The present study was initiated to determine the degree of salt tolerance among chickpea genotypes, and the relationship between salt tolerance and ion accumulation in leaves. The experiment was conducted in pots, in which 15 genotypes of chickpea were subjected to 0, 40 or 60mM NaCl added to the soil to determine the variation in salt tolerance. Leaves were taken as sample in the vegetative phase to measure the concentrations of sodium, potassium and K⁺/Na⁺ ratio. The results showed substantial effects of salinity on chickpea growth and ion content. The plant K⁺ content and K⁺/Na⁺ ratio were lowered in the shoot and root of cultivars tested, but Na⁺ content increased under saline conditions. CSG 8962 showed high levels of tolerance compared for the other cultivars. The results suggest that chickpea cultivars tolerant of salinity have better growth potential than do sensitive ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aagriculture 3achickpeas 3acrops 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asoil 0aSalt sensitivity 0aNaCl 0aand Ion content1 aMukesh Kumar,1 aSengar, R.S.1 aKumar, Pushpendra1 aSingh, S.K.1 aKumar, Yogesh0 tProgressive agriculture.g2017 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.97-101dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00015.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245010200201300001600303520203600319592002802355650001902383650001602402650001402418650002102432650001102453650002602464650001502490653002602505653002002531653002002551653001902571653002102590653001002611700001902621700001502640700001702655773009502672856008502767852000902852655001202861IND60576060620221122031547.0180831e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057606062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9548-717813aAn equivalent-time-lines model for municipal solid waste based on its compression characteristics  ap. 292-306.  aMunicipal solid waste (MSW) demonstrates a noticeable time-dependent stress–strain behavior, which contributes greatly to the settlement of landfills and therefore influences both the storage capacity of landfills and the integrity of internal structures. The long-term compression tests for MSW under different biodegradation conditions were analyzed. It showed that the primary compression can affect the secondary compression due to the biodegradation and mechanical creep. Based on the time-lines model for clays and the compression characteristics of MSW, relationships between MSW’s viscous strain rate and equivalent time were established, and then the viscous strain functions of MSW under different biodegradation conditions were deduced, and an equivalent-time-lines model for MSW settlement for two biodegradation conditions was developed, including the Type I model for the enhanced biodegradation condition and the Type II model for the normal biodegradation condition. The simulated compression results of laboratory and field compression tests under different biodegradation conditions were consistent with the measured data, which showed the reliability of both types of the equivalent-time-lines model for MSW. In addition, investigations of the long-term settlement of landfills from the literature indicated that the Type I model is suitable for predicting settlement in MSW landfills with a distinct biodegradation progress of MSW, a high content of organics in MSW, a short fill age or under an enhanced biodegradation environment; while the Type II model is good at predicting settlement in MSW landfills with a distinct progress of mechanical creep compression, a low content of organics in MSW, a long fill age or under a normal biodegradation condition. Furthermore, relationships between model parameters and the fill age of landfills were summarized. Finally, the similarities and differences between the equivalent-time-lines model for MSW and the stress-biodegradation model for MSW were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3adeformation 3alandfills 3amechanical creep 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aprediction 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aCompressibility 0aEquivalent time 0aBiodegradation 0aTime-lines model 0aCreep1 aBian, Xuecheng1 aXu, Wenjie1 aChen, Yunmin0 tWaste management.g2017 Oct., v. 68 p.292-306dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011600169300001400285520112200299592002801421650002601449650001001475650001501485650001001500650001201510650001301522650002701535650001401562650002601576650002901602700002401631700002001655700002101675700002001696700002901716700002201745700002301767773010801790856008101898852000901979655001201988IND60123837520221120155901.0150407e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0589-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarrocco, Sabrina10aBioactive metabolites from new or rare fimicolous fungi with antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungi  ap. 61-71.  aHerbivorous mammal dung supports a large variety of fimicolous fungi and the number of new genera and species is constantly increasing. Dung is a complex ecosystem and to win the struggle for life, these fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites to compete with other organisms. Fimicolous fungi and their bioactive metabolites are mostly evaluated for a possible use in medicine. Very little information is available about their possible exploitation in agriculture against plant pathogens. Three fimicolous isolates of Cleistothelebolus nipigonensis, Neogymnomyces virgineus and Rodentomyces reticulatus, collected from dung of different herbivorous were investigated. Only the organic extracts of Solid State Fermentation (SSF) cultures of C. nipigonensis and N. virgineus grown on rye flour showed strong antifungal activity against fungal pathogens of some important crops. The purification of the organic extracts allowed us to obtain different fractions and the isolation of some pure metabolites and their preliminary chemical and biological characterization are reported in this manuscript.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifungal properties 3acrops 3aecosystems 3afeces 3amammals 3amedicine 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arye flour 3asecondary metabolites 3asolid state fermentation1 aDiquattro, Stefania1 aAvolio, Fabiana1 aCimmino, Alessio1 aPuntoni, Grazia1 aDoveri, F.q(Francesco),1 aEvidente, Antonio1 aVannacci, Giovanni0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 May, v. 142, no. 1 p.61-71dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0589-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016000176300001600336520195900352592002802311596005802339596005002397596002702447650001702474650002002491650001202511650001402523650001702537650002502554650001902579650001302598651001002611651001302621651002202634651001002656651001102666653001602677653002802693653001502721653001502736700002302751700002902774700002002803700002402823773010102847856008602948852000903034655001203043IND60672915820221119190056.0191213e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291582DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2019.16422512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDongmo, Jean-Bernard10aVariable phylogeographic histories of five forest birds with populations in Upper and Lower Guinea: implications for taxonomy and evolutionary conservation  ap. 257-270.  aThis study evaluates phylogeographic structure in selected forest bird species distributed on either side of the Dahomey Gap in West Africa to extend analyses of avian diversification across the Guineo-Congolean forest. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data were collected for five species, including four with a break in distribution across the Dahomey Gap and one with a more continuous distribution. Data for the five focal species were included in a single analysis along with appropriate outgroup taxa, allowing estimates of divergence time on a common timescale. Both phylogeographic patterns and estimated divergence times were highly variable. In two cases (Green Hylia Hylia prasina and Yellow-whiskered Greenbul Eurillas latirostris), samples from east and west of the Dahomey Gap belong to divergent mitochondrial lineages, but with substantially older divergence in Eurillas (∼4.1 MY). In Western Bluebill Spermophaga haematina, relatively divergent eastern and western lineages (∼1.1 MY) were sampled in the same locality in eastern Ghana, suggesting east to west gene flow across the gap following earlier vicariance. In Forest Robin Stiphrornis erythrothorax, birds sampled within Ghana were from two highly divergent lineages (∼1.9 MY), one of which is more closely related to birds from Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, such that divergence across the Dahomey Gap was comparatively recent (∼0.36 MY). For both Hylia and Stiphrornis, we corroborate recent studies documenting multiple divergent lineages within each genus, some of which may represent distinct species. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis shows that the Dahomey Gap can be a significant barrier to gene flow for species restricted to forest habitats. At the same time, individual species exhibit a broad range of divergence times and phylogeographic histories of variable complexity. We discuss the taxonomic implications of our results for each focal species.  aPublisher supplied data  cBoston Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007161  cIdea Wilddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007142  cThe Rufford Foundation 3aforest birds 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3agene flow 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeography 3ataxonomy 3aBenin 3aCameroon 3aEquatorial Guinea 3aGhana 3aGuinea 0aDahomey Gap 0aGuineo-Congolean forest 0aspeciation 0avicariance1 aDaCosta, Jeffrey M1 aDjieto-Lordon, Champlain1 aNgassam, Pierre1 aSorenson, Michael D0 tOstrich.g2019 Sept. 2, v. 90, no. 3 p.257-270dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12300x1727-947X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2019.16422513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245012500202300001600327520119500343592002801538650001101566650001401577650001101591650001901602650002001621650001001641650000901651650001301660650001401673650001101687650001901698650001601717653001401733653002301747653001801770653001801788653002401806700002301830773010201853856008301955852000902038655001202047IND60686398620221121234439.0210312e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2573-246210aGas-phase selective oxidation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone over Au/Mg1-xCuxCr2O4 catalysts: On the role of Cu doping  ap. 218-230.  aThe industrial production of cyclohexanone from cyclohexanol would benefit from a selective oxidation catalyst. Herein, Cu doping of MgCr₂O₄ supports for gold nanoparticles active in gas-phase oxidation of cyclohexanol was investigated. Mg₁₋ₓCuₓCr₂O₄ exhibited spinel structures (x ≤ 0.25: MgCr₂O₄; x = 1: CuCr₂O₄) onto which 3–4 nm gold nanoparticles could be dispersed. Cu doping led to higher activity. During reaction, surface Cu²⁺ was reduced to Cu⁰, resulting in AuCu alloy formation. At low temperature, low-Cu-content catalysts (x ≤ 0.1) showed higher activity than high-Cu-content catalysts, likely because the AuCu alloy with highly diluted Cu was more active for the dehydrogenation step of cyclohexanol. However, Au/Mg₀.₉₉Cu₀.₀₁Cr₂O₄ and Au/Mg₀.₉Cu₀.₁Cr₂O₄ showed lower cyclohexanol conversion at high temperature than samples with high Cu content, because O₂ activation involving Cu becomes rate-limiting. Stable cyclohexanol conversion and cyclohexanone selectivity were 99.1% and 90.2% (space-time yield of 266 gKₑₜₒₙₑ gAᵤ⁻¹ h⁻¹) for Au/Mg₀.₂₅Cu₀.₇₅Cr₂O₄ at 300 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acopper 3acyclohexanones 3adehydrogenation 3agases 3agold 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aspace and time 3atemperature 0aCu doping 0aGold nanoparticles 0aCyclohexnanol 0aCyclohexanone 0aSelective oxidation1 aHensen, Emiel J.M.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Apr., v. 384 p.218-230dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001600253520133700269592002801606650002901634650002401663650002101687650001301708650002201721650002101743650001301764650001101777650001501788650001501803650002201818650001801840650002101858653002501879653002801904653002201932653003101954653001501985653002602000700002702026700002402053700002602077700003402103700001802137700002802155700002902183700002502212700002302237700006302260700005802323773011802381856008502499852000902584655001202593IND60554269420221122003925.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055426942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAschauer, Philipp10aCrystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae monoglyceride lipase Yju3p  ap. 462-470.  aMonoglyceride lipases (MGLs) are a group of α/β-hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of monoglycerides (MGs) into free fatty acids and glycerol. This reaction serves different physiological functions, namely in the last step of phospholipid and triglyceride degradation, in mammalian endocannabinoid and arachidonic acid metabolism, and in detoxification processes in microbes. Previous crystal structures of MGLs from humans and bacteria revealed conformational plasticity in the cap region of this protein and gave insight into substrate binding. In this study, we present the structure of a MGL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae called Yju3p in its free form and in complex with a covalently bound substrate analog mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate of MG hydrolysis. These structures reveal a high conservation of the overall shape of the MGL cap region and also provide evidence for conformational changes in the cap of Yju3p. The complex structure reveals that, despite the high structural similarity, Yju3p seems to have an additional opening to the substrate binding pocket at a different position compared to human and bacterial MGL. Substrate specificities towards MGs with saturated and unsaturated alkyl chains of different lengths were tested and revealed highest activity towards MG containing a C18:1 fatty acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacylglycerol lipase 3aarachidonic acid 3abacteria 3acrystal structure 3afree fatty acids 3aglycerol 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolism 3amonoacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 3atriacylglycerols 0aMonoglyceride lipase 0aMonoacylglycerol lipase 0aCrystal structure 0aLipase–substrate-complex 0aLipase cap 0aSubstrate specificity1 aRengachari, Srinivasan1 aLichtenegger, Joerg1 aSchittmayer, Matthias1 aDas, Krishna Mohan Padmanabha1 aMayer, Nicole1 aBreinbauer, R.q(Rolf),1 aBirner-Gruenberger, Ruth1 aGruber, Christian C.1 aZimmermann, Robert1 aGruber, K.q(Karl),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3485-97401 aOberer, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2525-95130 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 May, v. 1861, no. 5 p.462-470dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245012400198300002000322520101200342592002801354650001401382650001501396650001101411650001401422650002801436650002001464650002301484650001401507650001301521650003101534650001501565650004401580650001401624650002001638650001801658700002401676700001901700700001901719700001701738700002301755773014901778856007601927852000902003655001202012IND60679481420221118165556.0191228e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067948142DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b100942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEills, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8468-686010aReal-Time Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Detection of Fumarase Activity Using Parahydrogen-Hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]Fumarate  ap. 20209-20214.  aHyperpolarized fumarate can be used as a probe of real-time metabolism in vivo, using carbon-13 magnetic resonance imaging. Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization is commonly used to produce hyperpolarized fumarate, but a cheaper and faster alternative is to produce hyperpolarized fumarate via PHIP (parahydrogen-induced polarization). In this work, we trans-hydrogenate [1-¹³C]acetylene dicarboxylate with para-enriched hydrogen using a commercially available Ru catalyst in water to produce hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]fumarate. We show that fumarate is produced in 89% yield, with succinate as a side product in 11% yield. The proton polarization is converted into ¹³C magnetization using a constant adiabaticity field cycle, and a polarization level of 24% is achieved using 86% para-enriched hydrogen gas. We inject the hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]fumarate into cell suspensions and track the metabolism. This work opens the path to greatly accelerated preclinical studies using fumarate as a biomarker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acell suspension culture 3aenzyme activity 3afumarate hydratase 3afumarates 3ahydrogen 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aruthenium 3astable isotopes 3asuccinic acid1 aCavallari, Eleonora1 aCarrera, Carla1 aBudker, Dmitry1 aAime, Silvio1 aReineri, Francesca0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 141, no. 51 p.20209-20214dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b100943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015800169300001600327520166100343592002802004650002602032650001602058650002602074650002302100650001702123650001502140650000902155650001702164650002202181653000802203653000802211653001402219700001902233700002002252700002002272700001702292700002102309773014202330856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60721444020221120164702.0201224e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144402DNAL7 a10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00016.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDev, Pavitra10aImpact of foliar application of bioregulators and Nutri-Ents on the vegetative parameters of okra (AbelmoschusEsculentus (L.)

A field experiment was carried out during 2011 and 2012 at Horticulture Research Center of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology, Meerut to find out the response of foliar application of plant growth regulators and nutrients on vegetative attributes of okra cv. Parbhani Kranti. Two plant growth regulators and four nutrients ware used in different concentration i.e. NAA (25, 50 and 75ppm), GA₃ (25, 50 and 75ppm), MnSO₄ (2000 and 4000 ppm), FeSO₄ (2000 and 4000 ppm), MgSO₄ (2500 and 5000 ppm), CuSO₄ (1000 and 2000 ppm) and Control (distilled water spray). All variables parameters regarding vegetative growth were significantly influenced by different concentrations of the growth regulators and nutrients. Results revealed that between both the growth regulators, the foliar application of GA₃ (75 ppm) registered significantly higher vegetative growth viz., plant height (140.64cm), leaf width (21.56 cm) & length (27.35 cm), fresh weight (365.34g) and dry weight (62.15g) of plant, number of nodes per plant (27.44) and green pod yield (15.23 t/ha) over NAA. Similarly, minimum days taken to first flowering (39.77) and first harvesting (47.55) were carried out with foliar application of GA3 (75 ppm). In case of nutrients, FeSO₄ @ 4000 ppm foliar application had promoting effect on all vegetative parameters, except earlier flowering and harvesting in which MgSO₄ show positive effect as compare to other nutrient treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural colleges 3aagriculture 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3ahorticulture 3aleaf width 3aokra 3aplant height 3avegetative growth 0aGA3 0aNAA 0anutrients1 aPrakash, Satya1 aKumar, Jitendra1 aSingh, Manendra1 aKumar, Vinuj1 aBhadana, Gayatri0 tProgressive agriculture.g2017 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.107-112dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00016.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04018naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245010600208300001600314520189600330592002802226650001902254650001502273650001802288650002302306650001902329650001802348650002602366650002502392650001502417650001602432650001202448650002302460650001002483650001502493650004202508650003302550650001302583650001302596650001802609650001802627650001502645650002002660651001002680653001802690653003902708653001402747653001502761653001802776653001802794700005902812700006102871700006302932700001602995700001703011700001703028700005403045700001503099700001403114773011903128856008803247852000903335655001203344IND60637917020221121234339.0190906e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063791702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kaibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6837-917110aEffects of grassland afforestation on structure and function of soil bacterial and fungal communities  ap. 396-406.  aGrassland afforestation strongly influences the structure and function of soil microorganisms. Yet the mechanisms of how afforestation could simultaneously alter both the soil fungal and bacterial communities and its implications for ecosystem management are poorly understood, especially in nitrogen-limited ecosystems. Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes, the present study investigated the changes in soil properties and soil microorganisms after afforestation of natural grasslands with Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) on the Loess Plateau in China. Results showed that soil bacterial diversity had no significant differences among the grassland (GL), forest–grassland transition zone (TZ), and forestland (FL), while soil fungal diversity in the GL was significantly higher than that in the FL and TZ (P < 0.05). The proportion of shared OTUs in the soil bacterial community was higher than that in the soil fungal community among the three land use types. The dominant bacterial phylum shifted from Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria, while the dominant fungal phylum shifted from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota after the GL conversion to the FL. The functional groups of ECM fungi increased significantly while biotrophic fungi decreased significantly after grassland afforestation. Both the soil bacterial and fungal communities in the TZ showed great similarity with those in the FL. In addition, among all examined soil properties, soil nitrogen (N) showed a more significant effect on the soil microbial communities. The reduction of soil N after grassland afforestation resulted in both the structure and function changes in soil microbial communities. Our results demonstrated simultaneously differential changes in the composition and diversity of both soil bacterial and fungal communities after afforestation from grasslands to planted forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aProteobacteria 3aafforestation 3abacterial communities 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aforest land 3aforests 3afungal communities 3agenes 3agrasslands 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aland use 3anitrogen 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3asoil properties 3aChina 0aAfforestation 0aForest–grassland transition zone 0aGrassland 0aSoil fungi 0aSoil bacteria 0aSoil nitrogen1 aZhang, Yongwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4539-89351 aTang, Zhuangsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6397-63081 aShangguan, Zhouping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5815-63101 aZhang, Fan,1 aJia, Feng'an1 aChen, Yiping1 aHe, Xinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5570-34541 aShi, Weiyu1 aDeng, Lei0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 676 p.396-406dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013400165300001800299520109300317592002801410650002001438650002601458650001601484650002301500650001701523650002001540650001701560650001801577650002101595650000701616650001001623653002901633653003401662653002401696653002401720653003501744700001401779700001701793700001801810700001801828773011001846856008601956852000902042655001202051IND60564483320221116185837.0190318e20170210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056448332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.10.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ding,10aDual pH/redox responsive and CD44 receptor targeting hybrid nano-chrysalis based on new oligosaccharides of hyaluronan conjugates  ap. 1272-1280.  aA smart hybrid microenvironment-mediated dual pH/redox-responsive polymeric nanoparticles combined with inorganic calcium phosphate (CaP) was fabricated, which we term as armored nano-chrysalis inspired by butterfly pupa. The nano-chrysalis has an inner core composed of specially designed oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (oHA) targeting CD44 receptor. The inner core has two functions, i.e., the dual pH/redox responsive polymeric conjugate and the fluorescent curcumin-prodrug function. The prepared nano-chrysalis possessed a smaller size (102.5±4.6nm) than the unarmored nano-chrysalis (122.5±6.6nm). Interestingly, while the nano-chrysalis were stable under pH 7.4, when incubated under the tumor acidic conditions (pH 6.5) the outer CaP armor would dissolve in a pH-dependent, sustained manner. Moreover, nano-chrysalis was demonstrated to present the most effective antitumor efficacy than other formulations. This study provides a promising smart nano-carrier platform to enhance the stability, decrease the side effects, and improve the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3abutterflies 3acalcium phosphates 3afluorescence 3ahyaluronic acid 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3apupae 0aDual pH/redox responsive 0aMultifunctional nanoparticles 0aBioinspired prodrug 0aSmart drug delivery 0aOligosaccharides of hyaluronan1 aDong, Xue1 aQi, Mengjiao1 aSong, Xiaoyan1 aSun, Jingfang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Feb. 10, v. 157 p.1272-1280dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.10.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245006300192300001600255520076200271592002801033650001101061650001001072650002201082650001801104650001701122650001501139650002601154700002601180773010001206856008101306852000901387655001201396IND60119842120221119040639.0150427e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984212DNAL7 a252342802pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1996-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInestrosa, Nibaldo C.10aWnt signalling in neuronal differentiation and development  ap. 215-223.  aWnts are secreted glycoproteins that play multiple roles in early development, including the differentiation of precursor cells. During this period, gradients of Wnts and other morphogens are formed and regulate the differentiation and migration of neural progenitor cells. Afterwards, Wnt signalling cascades participate in the formation of neuronal circuits, playing roles in dendrite and axon development, dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis. Finally, in the adult brain, Wnts control hippocampal plasticity, regulating synaptic transmission and neurogenesis. In this review, we summarize the reported roles of Wnt signalling cascades in these processes with a particular emphasis on the role of Wnts in neuronal differentiation and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abrain 3aearly development 3aglycoproteins 3aneurogenesis 3astem cells 3asynaptic transmission1 aVarela-Nallar, Lorena0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Jan., v. 359, no. 1 p.215-223dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1996-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006000192245006400252300001600316506007600332520139700408592002801805506003701833650001001870650001701880650001601897650001701913650001801930650001801948650001301966650001701979650002001996650001302016653001902029653001802048653002302066653001802089653001802107653002402125653001602149653001702165653002102182653002202203653002402225653001702249653002302266653001502289653002502304700002102329700001102350700002202361773009902383856008502482852000902567655001202576IND60557029920221207104622.0170713e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.01.0402doi7 aPMC64500962pmcid7 a268090052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8230-494510aEngineering nanolayered particles for modular drug delivery  ap. 364-386.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLayer-by-layer (LbL) based self-assembly of nanoparticles is an emerging and powerful method to develop multifunctional and tissue responsive nanomedicines for a broad range of diseases. This unique assembly technique is able to confer a high degree of modularity, versatility, and compositional heterogeneity to nanoparticles via the sequential deposition of alternately charged polyelectrolytes onto a colloidal template. LbL assembly can provide added functionality by directly incorporating a range of functional materials within the multilayers including nucleic acids, synthetic polymers, polypeptides, polysaccharides, and functional proteins. These materials can be used to generate hierarchically complex, heterogeneous thin films on an extensive range of both traditional and novel nanoscale colloidal templates, providing the opportunity to engineer highly precise systems capable of performing the numerous tasks required for systemic drug delivery. In this review, we will discuss the recent advancements towards the development of LbL nanoparticles for drug delivery and diagnostic applications, with a special emphasis on the incorporation of biostability, active targeting, desirable drug release kinetics, and combination therapies into LbL nanomaterials. In addition to these topics, we will touch upon the next steps for the translation of these systems towards the clinic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aengineering 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3anucleic acids 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 0aLayer-by-layer 0aNanoparticles 0aControlled release 0aDrug delivery 0aGene delivery 0aCombination therapy 0aDiagnostics 0aTheranostics 0aActive targeting 0aColloid chemistry 0aPolymer engineering 0aBiomaterials 0aScalable synthesis 0aShelf life 0aClinical translation1 aDreaden, Erik C.1 aGu, Li1 aHammond, Paula T.0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016 Oct. 28, v. 240 p.364-386dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014600172300001400318520161100332592002801943650001601971650001101987650001401998650002302012650001302035650001302048650001702061650001902078650001102097650003302108650002302141653002302164653001902187653001602206653002602222653001702248700002702265773009902292856008302391852000902474655001202483IND60686399020221120052954.0200621e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllmann, Marcius A.10aZirconocene immobilization into organic-inorganic dual-shell silicas prepared by the nonhydrolytic sol-gel method for polyethylene production  ap. 30-43.  aCp₂ZrCl₂ was entrapped in dual-layered silica by two iterated nonhydrolytic sol-gel steps with organosilanes (methyltriethoxysilane, isopropyltriethoxysilane, octyltriethoxysilane, octadecyltrimethoxysilane) and WCl₆ as modifiers. For comparative reasons, organic-inorganic hybrid one-layer systems were also synthesized. The hybrid systems were evaluated for ethylene polymerization, with methylaluminoxane (MAO) as the cocatalyst. Increasing catalytic activity was observed in the case of the dual-layered silica systems. Modification of the silica surface with octadecylsilane (C8-Si) in combination with the presence of added Lewis acid centers (W) afforded the highest catalytic activity among the systems tested. The presence of organosilanes on the silica surface may affect polyethylene polydispersity. In the case of dual systems, the presence of two distinct hybrid silica layer effects, an internal silica layer modified with C18-Si and an external layer with C8-Si moieties, impinged on the broadening of polydispersity. Inverse moieties have distinct polydispersity indexes that indicate the surface modification at internal/external silica layers affects polymer characteristics. Microstructural features of hybrid silicas determined by small-angle X-ray scattering indicate that a low number of neighbors and larger correlation distances could explain higher catalytic activities. Similarly, long carbon chains in organoalkoxysilanes tend to reduce the radii of second level particles in a hierarchical structure of dual-shell systems, which in turn leads to higher catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene 3amoieties 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3asilica 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asol-gel processing 0aDual-shell systems 0aHybrid silicas 0aZirconocene 0aNonhydrolytic sol-gel 0aPolyethylene1 ados Santos, João H.Z.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 May, v. 385 p.30-43dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245010200196300001500298520123700313592002801550650002601578650001501604650001301619650001001632650001501642650001301657650001501670650001401685650001101699650002001710650001201730650002101742650001501763650001501778650001701793650002601810650001401836700002301850700002101873773015101894856006902045856010102114990002302215852000902238655001202247IND60643537320221120114926.0190510e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353732DNAL7 a10.3791/515902doi7 aPMC42176472pmcid7 a250783582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Danika L.10aHigh yield purification of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites for use in opsonizing antibody assays  ap. e51590.  aPlasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens are under development as potential malaria vaccines. One aspect of immunity against malaria is the removal of free merozoites from the blood by phagocytic cells. However assessing the functional efficacy of merozoite specific opsonizing antibodies is challenging due to the short half-life of merozoites and the variability of primary phagocytic cells. Described in detail herein is a method for generating viable merozoites using the E64 protease inhibitor, and an assay of merozoite opsonin-dependent phagocytosis using the pro-monocytic cell line THP-1. E64 prevents schizont rupture while allowing the development of merozoites which are released by filtration of treated schizonts. Ethidium bromide labelled merozoites are opsonized with human plasma samples and added to THP-1 cells. Phagocytosis is assessed by a standardized high throughput protocol. Viable merozoites are a valuable resource for assessing numerous aspects of P. falciparum biology, including assessment of immune function. Antibody levels measured by this assay are associated with clinical immunity to malaria in naturally exposed individuals. The assay may also be of use for assessing vaccine induced antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood 3acell lines 3aethidium 3afiltration 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amalaria 3amalaria vaccines 3amerozoites 3aphagocytes 3aphagocytosis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aschizonts1 aEriksson, Emily M.1 aSchofield, Louis0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 July 17, , no. 89 p.e51590-e51590dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/515903Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51590/high-yield-purification-plasmodium-falciparum-merozoites-for-use  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003500159040001800194100002000212245007300232300001400305506007600319520098900395592002801384506003701412650001401449650001001463650001201473650001901485650002101504650001701525700002201542773009801564856008101662852000901743655001201752IND60119842420221207062157.0150427e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984242DNAL7 a253674302pmid7 aPMC4286515 [Available on 01/01/16]2pmcid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-2011-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorley, Matthew14aThe roles and regulation of Polycomb complexes in neural development  ap. 65-85.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the developing mammalian nervous system, common progenitors integrate both cell extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory programs to produce distinct neuronal and glial cell types as development proceeds. This spatiotemporal restriction of neural progenitor differentiation is enforced, in part, by the dynamic reorganization of chromatin into repressive domains by Polycomb repressive complexes, effectively limiting the expression of fate-determining genes. Here, we review the distinct roles that Polycomb repressive complexes play during neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also highlighting recent work describing the molecular mechanisms that govern their dynamic activity in neural development. Further investigation of the way in which Polycomb complexes are regulated in neural development will enable more precise manipulation of neural progenitor differentiation facilitating the efficient generation of specific neuronal and glial cell types for many biological applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3agenes 3amammals 3anervous system 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurogenesis1 aKroll, Kristen L.0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Jan., v. 359, no. 1 p.65-85dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-2011-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012400167300001600291520210800307592002802415650002002443650002502463650001902488650000902507650001902516650001302535650000902548650001402557650001102571650004302582650001402625650002402639650002002663650001102683650002302694650002102717651001002738653002102748653002502769653001902794653002102813653002102834653002002855700001802875700001802893700001802911700001402929700001402943700002002957700001802977700001402995773012303009856008703132852000903219655001203228IND60557026920221120144531.0190318e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Nan10aLittle change in heat requirement for vegetation green-up on the Tibetan Plateau over the warming period of 1998–2012  ap. 650-658.  aWe investigated spatial and temporal variations in the accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) requirement for spring vegetation green-up onset on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the rapid warming period of 1998–2012, which is essential for understanding and modeling the spring vegetation phenological responses to climate change. Annual green-up date was determined by using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index. The annual AGDD requirement was then determined as the sum of daily mean air temperatures above 0°C over the dormancy period. Linear regression between the AGDD requirement and year was used to determine its temporal trend. Partial correlation analysis was used to assess factors controlling inter-annual variations in the AGDD requirement. We found the AGDD requirement was significantly different for different vegetation types and showed large spatial variations ranging from a few °C-days in cold and wet areas to more than 1000 °C-days in warm and dry areas of the TP. Despite the rapid warming and subsequent earlier green-up date, the AGDD requirement did not increase significantly over the period 1998–2012. Interestingly, we found that the inter-annual variations in AGDD requirement were extensively driven by the number of chilling days, while precipitation sum and insolation affected the AGDD requirement in limited areas. Although the winter warming reduced chilling accumulation on the TP, the AGDD requirement for vegetation green-up onset did not necessarily increase over 1998–2012, being insensitive to decline in the chilling accumulation. This suggested that the chilling requirement to break vegetation dormancy might be still fulfilled. In other words, the winter warming might not substantially affect the vegetation green-up process, since the reduction in chilling accumulation may not affect the dormancy break. However, the negative temporal correlation between the AGDD requirement and number of chilling days indicates that continued future warming may lead to a deficiency in chilling and thus an increase in AGDD requirement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3achilling requirement 3aclimate change 3acold 3acold treatment 3adormancy 3aheat 3aheat sums 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aregression analysis 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3avegetation types 3aChina 0aAlpine grassland 0aChilling requirement 0aClimate change 0aHeat requirement 0aSpring phenology 0aTibetan Plateau1 aShen, Miaogen1 aPiao, Shilong1 aChen, Xiaoqiu1 aAn, Shuai1 aYang, Wei1 aFu, Yongshuo H.1 aMeng, Fandong1 aWang, Tao0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 232 p.650-658dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245014500130300001600275520070000291592002800991650001601019650001201035650001701047650001801064650001601082650001401098650002201112650001501134650001201149650001201161650002001173650001101193650001201204653002501216653001401241653003501255653005901290700002501349700001901374700002401393773014201417852000901559655001201568IND60721440720221120164829.0201224e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Mamta10aSynthesis of 2-(substituted phenyl)-3-[4-1-thioanisole] -1,3-thiazol-2-yl}amino]-5-methyl1, 3-thiazolidin-4-ones as antihyperglycemic agents  ap. 102-108.  aCompounds were prepared by the bromination of 4-Acetyl Thio anisole in chloroform followed by condensation with substituted benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones in ethanol to get 4-(1-Thio Anisoyl)-2-(Substituted benzylidine amino)-1,3-thiazoles.

In forested and agricultural landscapes with transition zones, microclimate and matter cycling are markedly altered. This probably accelerates and is intensified by global warming. However, there is no consensus on defining transition zones and quantifying relevant variables for microclimate and matter cycling across disciplines. This article is an attempt to a) revise definitions and offer a framework for quantitative ecologists, b) review the literature on microclimate and matter cycling in transition zones and c) summarise this information using meta-analysis to better understand bio-geochemical and bio-geophysical processes and their spatial extent in transition zones. We expect altered conditions in soils of transition zones to be 10–20m with a maximum of 50m, and 25–50m for above-ground space with a maximum of 125m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acarbon 3aglobal warming 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3ameta-analysis 3amicroclimate 3anitrogen 3asoil 0aEdge effects 0aEcological boundaries 0aMatter cycling 0aMatter dynamics 0aFramework quantitative ecology 0aEcotone hierarchy1 aJochheim, Hubert1 aKersebaum, Kurt Christian,1 aLischeid, Gunnar1 aNendel, Claas0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 232 p.659-671dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013800172300001600310520195800326592002802284596008302312650001902395650003002414650001202444650001102456650002302467650001202490650002302502650001302525650002202538650002002560651001302580700007002593773014002663856008202803852000902885655001202894IND60672913320200213000000.0191017e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291332DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-019-00539-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo, José Julio10aDiversity, composition and biomass of native vascular plants regenerating under Acacia mangium Will. plantations in northern Amazonia  ap. 457-465.  aIt is imperative that studies can be developed to assess the role of homogeneous tree plantations in biodiversity conservation and the ability to store atmospheric carbon. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Acacia mangium Will. plantations established in areas originally occupied by savanna (locally termed “lavrado”) on the establishment success of vascular plants, by analyzing three attributes of the community—diversity, composition and biomass. All plants with base diameter ≥ 1 cm were measured in 28 0.05-ha plots (11 plots allocated in natural areas of “lavrado” and 17 under A. mangium plantations). Species diversity was much higher in A. mangium plantation than in the natural areas of “lavrado”. There was a clear floristic differentiation between A. mangium and “lavrado”, with high density of forest species and low density of “lavrado” species growing under A. mangium plantations. “Lavrado” plots presented high floristic similarity, but plots under A. mangium plantations were far less similar, indicating a more heterogeneous vegetation. Biomass of vascular plants in A. mangium plantations was about one-fifth of that found in natural “lavrado” sites, but in “lavrado” 92.6% of the total biomass was allocated in only two species, whereas in A. mangium plantation two species comprised only 43% of the total biomass. In A. mangium plantation, species classified as forest species and typical “lavrado” species accounted for 72.8% and 27.2% of total biomass, respectively. Our results showed that A. mangium plantations resulted in high alpha and beta plant diversity due to the invasion of alien forest species. Also, biomass of “lavrado” species in plantations was smaller and species relative abundances completely different from natural “lavrados”. Therefore, we conclude that forest plantations established in savannas cannot be used to meet conservationist purposes.  aPublisher supplied data  a459735/2014-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAcacia mangium 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3asavannas 3aspecies abundance 3avascular plants 3aAmazonia1 aNascimento, Henrique E.

Accurate modeling of local scale unit geometries and stratigraphic relationships is important for understanding aquifer-aquitard connectivity, estimation of aquifer volume, and prediction of contaminant migration pathways; this is particularly important in previously glaciated areas because of the high degree of lithological heterogeneity and stratigraphic variation in glaciogenic deposits. This study presents a case study (Ontario, Canada) that explores the impacts of an optimized model (in which high-resolution data are preserved in local scale models as ‘golden blocks’) and non-optimized regional scale 3D models on the predicted geometries and stratigraphic relationships of coarse- and fine-grained units (lithofacies associations) within a Quaternary stratigraphy. Each of the regional scale models include high quality data (outcrop and cored borehole logs) and low quality data (water well lithology logs); however, the optimized model was constructed by seamlessly integrating the golden blocks into the regional scale model using an algorithm (producing a ‘nested’ model), whereas the non-optimized model was built using a global modeling approach. By way of comparison to unit geometries previously delineated in outcrops and surficial geology maps and hydraulic responses from pumping tests, the results of this study indicate that coarse-grained units, which host significant municipal aquifers, and fine-grained units were more realistically and accurately represented in the optimized model as a result of the nested 3D modeling approach. This case study demonstrates a relatively simple and effective method for preserving high quality data in a regional scale 3D model without sacrificing model accuracy in key areas of interest (e.g. aquifer well fields).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ageometry 3amodels 3aprediction 3astratigraphy 3aOntario 0aNested 3D model 0a‘Golden blocks’ 0aGlacial stratigraphy 0aAquifers 0aQuaternary1 aMacCormack, K.E.1 aEyles, C.H.0 tEngineering geology.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 248 p.309-329dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2018.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245009900129300001600228520102100244592002801265650001601293650001201309650002101321651001001342653001001352653001501362653001801377700001801395700001901413700001501432700002401447700001601471773014201487852000901629655001201638IND60721440920221120153956.0201224e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pawan10aImpact of K.V.K. entrepreneurship training on knowledge extent of dairy entrepreneurs trainees  ap. 113-116.  aThis study was conducted during the year 2010–11 in Haidergarh block of Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh.

For that purpose, the following procedure was followed: i) measurements of laminar methane flame velocities carried out in a stainless steel combustion chamber at atmospheric pressure and 300 K; ii) calculations and comparison with experiments of laminar flame velocities to validate the reaction mechanism; and iii) simulations in larger ranges of flames conditions near to gas turbine conditions: premixed methane–air flames, preheated inlet temperature (To = 600 K) and pressures ranging from 1 to 8 bar. Lean, stoichiometric and slightly rich conditions were studied as the equivalence ratio was varied from 0.7 to 1.1. Both influences of the oxygen enrichment and CO₂ dilution are discussed. Finally, a feasibility study of the coupling of oxygen-enriched combustion in gas turbines and CO₂ capture by membrane processes, which requires high CO₂ concentration in the flue gas, was carried out. A large numerical database of combustion conditions was obtained, among which the optimal initial combustion conditions allowing a correct operation of the entire process could be chosen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3adatabases 3amethane 3aoxygen 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3aturbines1 aFoucher, F.q(Fabrice),1 aPillier, Laure1 aOsorio, Vladimiro1 aGökalp, Iskender0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.1055-1066dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016000160300001600320520121400336592002801550650001101578650001201589650001101601650002701612650001701639650001701656650001101673650000901684650000901693650001301702651001001715700001601725700001401741700001501755773011201770856008101882852000901963655001201972IND60123834820221122125834.0150407e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-014-9652-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Kai14aThe arsenic contamination of rice in Guangdong Province, the most economically dynamic provinces of China: arsenic speciation and its potential health risk  ap. 353-361.  aRice is a staple food in China, but it may contain toxic heavy metals. Hence, the concentrations of arsenic (As) species (Asᴵᴵᴵ, Asⱽ, MMA and DMA) were evaluated in 260 rice samples from 13 cities of Guangdong Province, the most economically dynamic provinces of China. The levels of sum concentrations of As species in rice samples varied from non-detect to 225.58 ng g⁻¹, with an average value of 57.27 ng g⁻¹. The mean concentrations of the major As species detected in rice samples were in the order Asᴵᴵᴵ(34.77 ng g⁻¹) > Asⱽ(9.34 ng g⁻¹) > DMA (8.33 ng g⁻¹) > MMA (4.82 ng g⁻¹). The rice samples of Guangdong Province were categorized as inorganic As type. Significant geographical variation of As speciation existed in rice samples of 13 cities of Guangdong Province by chi-square test (p < 0.05). The average human weekly intakes of inorganic As via rice consumption in Guangdong Province, southern China, were 1.91 µg kg⁻¹body weight. Hazard quotients of total As via rice consumption of adults in 13 cities ranged from 0.06 to 0.30, indicating the As contents in rice from Guangdong Province had no potential adverse impact on human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarsenic 3acities 3ageographical variation 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3arice 3arisk 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aLu, Shaoyou1 aWang, Jun1 aYang, Yuyi0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2015 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.353-361dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-014-9652-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007500170300001400245500001500259520172200274592002801996650002402024650001402048650001502062650002002077650001102097650001002108650001702118653002002135653001002155653001802165653001802183653001302201653002002214700002502234700002002259700006202279700002002341700001802361700002602379700002302405773009202428856008402520852000902604655001202613IND60535582720221118062902.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053558272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStites, Shana D.10aPre-ordering lunch at work. Results of the what to eat for lunch study  ap. 88-97.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate an intervention that combined mindful eating and online pre-ordering to promote healthier lunch purchases at work. The study took place at an urban hospital with 26 employees who were overweight or obese. The design included a contemporaneous comparison with delayed-treatment control and a three-phase prospective study. A minimum 4-week baseline period preceded a 4-week full-intervention, in which participants received mindful eating training, pre-ordered their lunches, and received price discounts toward lunch purchases. In a 4-week reduced intervention phase, participants pre-ordered lunches without price discounts. Participant lunch purchases were tracked electronically at the point of purchase. The primary outcome measures were the amounts of kilocalories and fat grams in purchased lunches. In contemporaneous comparisons, the treatment group purchased lunches with an average of 144.6 fewer kilocalories (p = 0.01) and 8.9 fewer grams of fat (p = 0.005) compared to controls. In multivariable longitudinal analyses, participants decreased the average number of calories in their meals by 114.6 kcal per lunch and the average grams of fat by 5.4 per lunch during the partial-intervention compared to the baseline (p < 0.001). At the end of the study, a moderate increase was observed in participants' overall mindful eating behaviors as compared to the beginning of the study (p < 0.001). The majority of participants (92%) said they would use the pre-ordering system if offered in the future. Combined mindful eating training and online pre-ordering appears a feasible and useful worksite intervention to improve food choices by employees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprospective studies 3ahospitals 3aoverweight 3ahuman resources 3aprices 3alunch 3afood choices 0aHealth behavior 0aAdult 0aeating habits 0aFood services 0aWorksite 0aChoice behavior1 aSingletary, S.

However, its effect on various ecological processes is generally lacking. Here, we carried out an experiment in a 16-year-old Eucalyptus plantation in South China to assess the effects of enriched planting of native tree species on surface water, soil erosion and nutrient losses. Two treatments were conducted in 2008: (1) enriched planting of native broadleaved tree species with uniform thinning of 60% of Eucalyptus trees (TEP); and (2) enriched planting of native broadleaved tree species without thinning (NEP). The original Eucalyptus plantation stands was used as the control (CK). Runoff plots (total n=9, 3 for each treatment or CK) were established in 2009, and surface water flow, sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses were monitored from major rainfall events in 2010–2012. Results showed that enriched planting in Eucalyptus plantation significantly reduced surface water flow and soil erosion. Compared with CK, TEP and NEP reduced annual surface water flow by 29–43% and 11–16%, and reduced annual soil erosion by 38–54% and 20–33% throughout the study period, respectively. TEP and NEP had significantly lower annual mean concentrations of N and P in surface water. Compared with CK, TEP reduced annual N and P losses through surface water by 42–60% and 44–64%, respectively, while NEP reduced them by 25–28% and 24–34%, respectively. N and P losses were significantly related to surface water flow. Between the two treatments, TEP was better for retaining water and soil, and for preventing nutrient loss. These results clearly demonstrated that the enriched planting of native tree species effectively retained surface water and nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abroadleaved trees 3aforest plantations 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3arain 3arunoff 3asediments 3asilvicultural practices 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asurface water 3awater flow 3aChina 0aEnriched planting 0aNative tree species 0aNutrient loss 0aSoil erosion 0aSurface water flow 0aEucalyptus forests1 aOuyang, Jianhui1 aLiao, Dandan1 aZhou, Yongdong1 aLiu, Songsong1 aShen, Decai1 aWei, Xiaohua1 aZeng, Shucai0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 20, v. 675 p.224-234dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245012900200300002000329520105600349592002801405650001701433650003101450650001901481650002201500650001601522650001601538650002101554653002801575653001601603653002201619653001901641653002101660700001701681700005201698773014201750856007801892852000901970655001201979IND60596050720221123020747.0180611e20180413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059605072DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b014252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yongkang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3541-934912aA Thermal-, Water-, and Near-Infrared Light-Induced Shape Memory Composite Based on Polyvinyl Alcohol and Polyaniline Fibers  ap. 14017-14025.  aA multiresponsive shape memory composite was prepared by incorporating polyaniline (PAn) fibers into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), where in situ polymerization assisted by surfactant was used to homogeneously disperse PAn fibers in a PVA matrix. The PAn fibers not only increased physical cross-linking points in the system but also served as photothermal conversion reagents, resulting in excellent water-, thermal-, and near-infrared (NIR) light-induced shape memory properties of the composites, where their light-induced shape recovery ratio and speed could be enhanced via the increase of PAn loading percentage and light power density. Moreover, the composites possessed high mechanical properties with tensile strength over 83 MPa. On the basis of these dramatic mechanical properties and shape memory properties, the composites could show high recovery stress over 6.0 MPa, which increased with the increase of temperature and PAn loading percentage. This presented composite could be a great candidate as actuator element for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atensile strength 0ashape memory composites 0apolyaniline 0apolyvinyl alcohol 0ainfrared light 0afreezing-thawing1 aZhang, Jiwen1 aChen, Xin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1224-02850 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 13, v. 10, no. 16 p.14017-14025dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b014253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006200167300001600229520150100245592002801746650001201774650001401786650003001800650002101830650001801851650002801869650001101897653002001908653002201928653002101950653002001971653003101991653002902022700001502051700001402066773009402080856008402174852000902258655001202267IND60535582820221118062836.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053558282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatherley, R.10aDisordered eating practices in gastrointestinal disorders  ap. 240-250.  aPurpose: To systematically review evidence concerning disordered eating practices in dietary-controlled gastrointestinal conditions. Three key questions were examined: a) are disordered eating practices a feature of GI disorders?; b) what abnormal eating practices are present in those with GI disorders?; and c) what factors are associated with the presence of disordered eating in those with GI disorders? By exploring these questions, we aim to develop a conceptual model of disordered eating development in GI disease. Methods: Five key databases, Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (1900–2014) and MEDLINE (1950–2014), PubMed, PsycINFO (1967–2014) and Google Scholar, were searched for papers relating to disordered eating practices in those with GI disorders. All papers were quality assessed before being included in the review. Results: Nine papers were included in the review. The majority of papers reported that the prevalence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls. Disordered eating patterns in dietary-controlled GI disorders may be associated with both anxiety and GI symptoms. Evidence concerning the correlates of disordered eating was limited. Conclusions: The presence of disordered eating behaviours is greater in populations with GI disorders than in populations of healthy controls, but the direction of the relationship is not clear. Implications for further research are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3adatabases 3adigestive system diseases 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3agastrointestinal system 3amodels 0aEating disorder 0aDisordered eating 0aGastrointestinal 0aCoeliac disease 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aIrritable bowel syndrome1 aHoward, R.1 aHiggs, S.0 tAppetite.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 84 p.240-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245009300214300001400307520106800321592002801389650002101417650002101438650001901459650001001478650001401488650001801502650001901520650001301539650001701552650001301569650001701582653002501599653002401624653001301648653002001661653001901681653002501700700001601725700001901741700002201760700005701782700002201839700002701861773009701888856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60557027420221120144722.0170713e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodust, Vladimir N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6134-748410aExtension of in vivo half-life of biologically active molecules by XTEN protein polymers  ap. 52-66.  aXTEN™ is a class of unstructured hydrophilic, biodegradable protein polymers designed to increase the half-lives of therapeutic peptides and proteins. XTEN polymers and XTEN fusion proteins are typically expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by conventional protein chromatography as monodisperse polypeptides of exact length and sequence. Unstructured XTEN polypeptides have hydrodynamic volumes significantly larger than typical globular proteins of similar mass, thus imparting a bulking effect to the therapeutic payloads attached to them. Since their invention, XTEN polypeptides have been utilized to extend the half-lives of a variety of peptide- and protein-based therapeutics. Multiple clinical and preclinical studies and related drug discovery and development efforts are in progress. This review details the most current understanding of physicochemical properties and biological behavior of XTEN and XTENylated molecules. Additionally, the development path and status of several advanced drug discovery and development efforts are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiodegradability 3achromatography 3adrugs 3ahalf life 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3atherapeutics 0aXTEN protein polymer 0aHalf-life extension 0aPeptides 0aBiotherapeutics 0aGenetic fusion 0aChemical conjugation1 aBalan, Sibu1 aSim, Bee-Cheng1 aCoyle, Michael P.1 aErnst, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7710-60601 aPeters, Robert T.1 aSchellenberger, Volker0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016 Oct. 28, v. 240 p.52-66dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245009600205300002000301506007600321520091100397592002801308506003701336650001501373650001401388650002101402650001101423650001801434650001101452650001101463650001901474650002001493650002101513700006201534700006501596700006101661773014901722856007601871852000901947655001201956IND60679479420221207084004.0191228e20191213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947942DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b082822doi7 aPMC70863432pmcid7 a318333572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Mark W.10aThree-Component Olefin Dicarbofunctionalization Enabled by Nickel/Photoredox Dual Catalysis  ap. 20069-20078.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn intermolecular, photocatalytic dicarbofunctionalization (DCF) of olefins enabled by the merger of Giese-type addition with Ni/photoredox dual catalysis has been realized. Capitalizing on the rapid addition of 3° radicals to alkenes and their reluctance toward single electron metalation to Ni complexes, regioselective alkylation and arylation of olefins is possible. This dual catalytic method not only permits elaborate species to be assembled from commodity materials, but also allows quaternary and tertiary centers to be installed in a singular, chemoselective olefin difunctionalization. This multicomponent process occurs under exceptionally mild conditions, compatible with a diverse range of functional groups and synthetic handles such as pinacolboronate esters. This technology was directly applied to the synthesis of an intermediate to a preclinical candidate (TK-666) and its derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkylation 3aarylation 3achemoselectivity 3aesters 3afree radicals 3anickel 3aolefin 3aphotocatalysis 3aredox reactions 3aregioselectivity1 aCompton, Jordan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7099-34561 aKelly, Christopher B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5530-86061 aMolander, Gary A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9114-55840 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Dec. 13, v. 141, no. 51 p.20069-20078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b082823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245009400177300001400271520125100285592002801536650001501564650001601579650001701595650002201612650001301634650002401647650001701671700002201688700002001710700002401730700002501754700002301779773007201802856008401874852000901958655001201967IND60096534320221117234245.0141104e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009653432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiogou, Chrysovalantou10aOptimal production of renewable hydrogen based on an efficient energy management strategy  ap. 58-67.  aThis work presents the development of a flexible energy management strategy (EMS) for a renewable hydrogen production unit through water electrolysis with solar power. The electricity flow of the unit is controlled by a smart microgrid and the overall unattended operation is achieved by a supervisory control system. The proposed approach formalizes the knowledge regarding the system operation using a finite-state machine (FSM) which is subsequently combined with a propositional-based logic to describe the transitions among various process states. The operating rules for the integrated system are derived by taking into account both the operating constraints and the interaction effects among the individual subsystems in a systematic way. Optimal control system parameter values are obtained so that a system performance criterion incorporating efficient and economic operation is satisfied. The resulted EMS has been deployed to the industrial automation system that monitors and controls a small-scale experimental solar hydrogen production unit. The overall performance of the proposed EMS in the experimental unit has been evaluated over short-term and long-term operating periods resulting in smooth and efficient hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy efficiency 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3asolar energy1 aIpsakis, Dimitris1 aSeferlis, Panos1 aBezergianni, Stella1 aPapadopoulou, Simira1 aVoutetakis, Spyros0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.58-67dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008700175300001600262520155300278592002801831650001601859650001501875650001001890650002001900650002101920650001201941650002001953650002001973650001501993650001802008650004302026650001502069650003002084653001302114653002302127653001402150653001402164700002302178700002002201700002302221700002702244700002002271700002202291700002402313773011102337856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60576058620221122212652.0201202e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057605862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.07.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalek-Maghsoudi, Armin10aRecent advances in biosensor technology in assessment of early diabetes biomarkers  ap. 122-135.  aDiscovery of biosensors has acquired utmost importance in the field of healthcare. Recent advances in biological techniques and instrumentation involving nanomaterials, surface plasmon resonance, and aptasensors have developed innovative biosensors over classical methods. Integrated approaches provided a better perspective for developing specific and sensitive devices with wide potential applications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease affecting almost every tissue and organ system, with metabolic complications extending far beyond impaired glucose metabolism. Although there is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes, early diagnosis and interventions are critical to prevent this disease and can postpone or even prevent the serious complications that are associated with diabetes. Biomarkers for type 2 diabetes are useful for prediction and intervention of the disease at earlier stages. Proper selection of biomarkers that represent health and disease states is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment by detecting it before it manifests. In this respect, we provide an overview of different types of biosensors being used, ranging from electrochemical, fluorescence-based, nanomonitors, SPR-based, and field-effect transistor biosensors for early detection and management of diabetes with focus on prediabetes. In the future, novel non-invasive technologies combined with blood and tissue-based biomarkers will enable the detection, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and its complications long before overt disease develops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3ahealth services 3ainstrumentation 3ametabolism 3ananomaterials 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprediction 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aDiabetes 0aInsulin resistance 0aBiomarker 0aBiosensor1 aVakhshiteh, Faezeh1 aTorabi, Raheleh1 aHassani, Shokoufeh1 aGanjali, Mohammad Reza1 aNorouzi, Parviz1 aHosseini, Morteza1 aAbdollahi, Mohammad0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 99 p.122-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.07.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010500186300001800291520171500309592002802024650002002052650001502072650001002087650002102097650002602118650002602144650002502170650001202195650003002207650004602237650001502283650002002298650001402318650002502332650002602357650004002383650003602423650002102459651001502480700002302495700002002518773010502538856004802643852000902691655001202700IND50060875320221122054014.0130318e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006087532DNAL7 a229328652pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-012-0168-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKruidhof, H. M.10aAbiotic Induction Affects the Costs and Benefits of Inducible Herbivore Defenses in Datura wrightii   ap. 1215-1224.  aWe evaluated the costs and benefits of continuous high-level expression of defenses relative to naturally-induced defenses in field-grown Datura wrightii in the presence and absence of herbivores. We induced D. wrightii plants with monthly applications of the plant hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and assessed levels of inducible proteinase inhibitors (Pins). MeJA application increased Pin production by 124 %, whereas the increase in Pins due to herbivory was more modest (36 %). Pin induction was costly and significantly reduced plant fitness compared to unmanipulated plants both in the presence and absence of herbivores. Although MeJA-treated plants exposed to herbivory suffered significantly less herbivore damage than unmanipulated plants exposed to herbivory, this was not accompanied by a corresponding fitness benefit. In contrast to glasshouse studies in which protected plants never expressed Pins, Pin induction occurred in field-grown plants not treated with MeJA and completely protected from herbivory. Subsequent experiments confirmed that putative herbivore defenses can be induced abiotically in D. wrightii as: 1) Pin levels did not differ significantly between field-grown plants protected from herbivory and plants exposed to chronic herbivory over the full season; and 2) plants exposed to ambient UV-B light in the absence of herbivory expressed low levels of Pins after two wk of exposure, whereas plants protected from UV-B remained uninduced. The costs of induced responses may be relatively easily determined under field conditions, but there may be many inducing agents in the field, and the benefits of induction may be difficult to associate with any single inducing agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDatura wrightii 3aherbivores 3alight 3amethyl jasmonate 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDaturaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFood Chain 2aGenetic Fitness 2aHerbivory 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aProtease Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aCalifornia1 aAllison, Jeremy D.1 aHare, J.

Our results showing decreased glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and Ca²⁺ overload in the cerebral cortex of hypothyroid pups suggest misregulated glutamate metabolism associated with developmentally induced TH deficiency. The ¹⁴C-MeAIB accumulation indicates upregulated System A activity and glutamine uptake by neurons. Energy metabolism in hypothyroid cortical slices was preserved, as demonstrated by unaltered glucose metabolism. We also found upregulated acetylcholinesterase activity, depleting acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft, pointing to disrupted cholinergic system. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, which were associated with glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and gamma-glutamyltransferase downregulation suggest redox imbalance. Disrupted astrocyte cytoskeleton was evidenced by downregulated and hyperphosphorylated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Morphological and structural characterization of the sensorimotor cerebral cortex (SCC) showed unaltered thickness of the SCC. However, decreased size of neurons on the layers II & III and IV in the right SCC and increased NeuN positive neurons in specific SCC layers, suggest that they are differently affected by the low TH levels during neurodevelopment. Hypothyroid pups presented increased number of foot-faults in the gridwalk test indicating affected motor functions. Taken together, our results show that congenital hypothyroidism disrupts glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission, Ca²⁺ equilibrium, redox balance, cytoskeleton integrity, morphological and functional aspects in the cerebral cortex of young rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aastrocytes 3acalcium 3acerebral cortex 3acortex 3acytoskeleton 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglucose 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahypothyroidism 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurons 3aprogeny 3apups 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athyroid hormones 0aHypothyroidism 0aCytoskeleton 0aRedox imbalance 0aCholinesterase 0aCalcium 0aGFAP1 aWajima, Carolinne Sayury1 aCesconetto, Patricia Acordi1 aParisotto, Eduardo Benedetti1 aWinkelmann-Duarte, Elisa1 aSantos, Karin dos1 aSaleh, Najla1 aFilippin-Monteiro, Fabíola Branco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4313-17831 aRazzera, Guilherme1 aMena Barreto Silva, Fátima Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1391-23541 aPessoa-Pureur, Regina1 aZamoner, Ariane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2844-85630 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 478 p.62-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008500171300001800256520154100274592002801815650001501843650001801858650002001876650001201896650001101908650002101919650001501940650001301955650001501968650002301983650002202006650001402028650002402042650001502066650001102081653002402092653002402116653003102140653001102171653002302182700002202205700001902227700002102246700002202267700002202289700002202311700002902333773012102362856008502483852000902568655001202577IND60635882220221118045707.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063588222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Rúben J.10aDiscovery of pyridoxal reductase activity as part of human vitamin B6 metabolism  ap. 1088-1097.  aPyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6. Mammals cannot synthesize vitamin B6, so they rely on dietary uptake of the different B6 forms, and via the B6 salvage pathway they interconvert them into PLP. Humans possess three enzymes in this pathway: pyridoxal kinase, pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase and pyridoxal phosphatase. Besides these, a fourth enzyme has been described in plants and yeast but not in humans: pyridoxal reductase.We analysed B6 vitamers in remnant CSF samples of PLP-treated patients and four mammalian cell lines (HepG2, Caco2, HEK293 and Neuro-2a) supplemented with PL as the sole source of vitamin B6.Strong accumulation of pyridoxine (PN) in CSF of PLP-treated patients was observed, suggesting the existence of a PN-forming enzyme. Our in vitro studies show that all cell lines reduce PL to PN in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We compared the amino acid sequences of known PL reductases to human sequences and found high homology for members of the voltage-gated potassium channel beta subunits and the human aldose reductases. Pharmacological inhibition and knockout of these proteins show that none of the candidates is solely responsible for PL reduction to PN.We show evidence for the presence of PL reductase activity in humans. Further studies are needed to identify the responsible protein.This study expands the number of enzymes with a role in B6 salvage pathway. We hypothesize a protective role of PL reductase(s) by limiting the intracellular amount of free PL and PLP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolism 3apatients 3aphosphates 3apotassium channels 3aprotective effect 3apyridoxal 3apyridoxal phosphate 3apyridoxine 3ayeasts 0aVitamin B6 vitamers 0aPyridoxal reductase 0aVitamin B6 salvage pathway 0aKCNAB2 0aAKR1B1 and AKR1B101 aAlbersen, Monique1 aVringer, Esmee1 aBosma, Marjolein1 aZwakenberg, Susan1 aZwartkruis, Fried1 aJans, Judith J.M.1 aVerhoeven-Duif, Nanda M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 June, v. 1863, no. 6 p.1088-1097dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011900131300001600250520197700266592002802243650001702271650001602288650001802304650001102322650000902333650001702342650001602359650001102375651001002386700002602396700001502422700001702437700001802454700001902472773014202491852000902633655001202642IND60721441520221120154027.0201224e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShashikala, T.10aFodder performance of different oat (Avena sativa L.,) genotypes under agro climatic conditions of Telangana state  ap. 141-144.  aTelangana region of Andhra Pradesh experiences mean minimum temperature of 10–13° C during winter season, hence very much suitable to grow Oat as fodder crop in the region. In view of the importance of the crop, an experiment was conducted to study the fodder yield potential of thirteen genetically diverse and improved cultures of oats along with two national checks and one zonal check during Rabi 2012–13 at AICRP on Forage Crops, Acharya N.G. Ranga Agril. University, Hyderabad, Andhrapradesh, India to identify suitable varieties for the region. The experiment was laid out in Randomised Block Design with three replications. The results revealed that the entries registered highly significant differences among themselves for all the characters except for crude protein yield. The entry JHO-2012-2 recorded highest green fodder yield of 469.9 q/ha as against best check Kent (432.9 q/ha) followed by OS 405 (440.3 q/ha), while for dry fodder yield OS 405 (93.2q/ha) showed significant superiority over zonal check JHO 2000-4 (74.5 q/ha) followed by JO-04-14 (89.5 q/ha), JHO -2012-2 (88.1 q/ha). Non significant variation was observed among the entries for crude protein yields. Plant height of the entries ranged between 82.6cm in RSO59 to 105.1cm in OS405 &JHO-2012-2. Significant variation was observed among the entries for plant height. The average number of days to 50% flowering among entries ranged from 72 to 91, RSO59,60 & OS-6 being very early and UPO-12-1 being very late. The L/S ratio varied from 0.27 in JHO2012-2 to 0.58 in UPO-12-1. Among the check varieties, Kent had shown superior performance with regard to green fodder and dry fodder yields, while OS-6 for crude protein yields. These two check varieties are very much suitable for cultivation in the region. the test entries JHO-2012-2, OS 405 and JO-04-14 were very promising with high green fodder and dry fodder yield potential, hence can be recommended in the region for cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aagriculture 3acrude protein 3aforage 3aoats 3aplant height 3atemperature 3awinter 3aIndia1 aNaaiik, RVT.

The combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the diesel engine fueled with three different emulsions made from wood pyrolysis oil (WPO) and Jatropha methyl ester (JME) are compared with those of JME and diesel operations. The WPO of 5%, 10% and 15% by volume is emulsified with 95%, 90% and 85% by volume of JME, denoted as X₁JOE5, X₁JOE10 and X₁JOE15 respectively. The combustion of JME, X₁JOE5, X₁JOE10 and X₁JOE15 starts earlier by 2.6 °CA, 2.3 °CA, 2.8 °CA and 2 °CA respectively compared to that of diesel at load. Shorter ignition delay and higher peak cylinder pressure are observed with JME and its emulsions with WPO. There is a significant reduction in the nitric oxide (NO) emissions by 2.5% when fueled with X₁JOE15. The smoke opacity decreases by 25%, 26.7%, 22.1% and 18.2% for JME and its emulsions with WPO respectively, in comparison with diesel at full load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3aair 3abiofuels 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aemulsions 3anitric oxide 3aoils 3aopacity 3apyrolysis 3asmoke 3awaste wood 3awood1 aSingh, R.K.1 aMurugan, S.0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.610-618dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011500182300001600297520136700313592002801680650001101708650002701719650001701746650001901763650001601782650001401798650001101812650001701823650002001840650001301860650001601873700002801889700002401917700001901941700002201960773007401982856008402056852000902140655001202149IND60096534720221117234230.0141104e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009653472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsaprakakis, Dimitris Al.10aTechnical details regarding the design, the construction and the operation of seawater pumped storage systems  ap. 619-630.  aThis paper presents important technical details for the design, construction and operation of seawater pumped storage systems (S-PSS). S-PSS co-operating with wind parks, features as the most promising technology towards maximizing Renewable Energy penetration in insular systems with low annual rainfalls. This article summarises the fundamental points of integrated studies of S-PSS, from the feasibility study to the precise positioning of the systems' components and the selection of the main equipment. Special issues regarding the use of seawater from the PSS (pumped storage system), such as the use of materials for the construction of the penstock, the construction of the upper reservoir, placing the pump station and the hydro power plant on the coast and the selection of pump and hydro-turbine models are presented thoroughly. Indicative results are presented from two S-PSS of small and medium size. The study proves that current technology enables the secure use of seawater in PSS. The electricity surplus from Wind Powered Pumped Storage Systems (WP-PSS) can also be exploited in reverse osmosis desalination plants for producing potable water. Seawater can be pumped directly from the sea, thus construction of a lower reservoir is avoided, compensating higher costs arising from the use of corrosion-resistant materials for certain components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aconstruction materials 3adesalination 3adrinking water 3aelectricity 3aequipment 3amodels 3apower plants 3areverse osmosis 3aseawater 3awater power1 aChristakis, Dimitris G.1 aStefanakis, Ioannis1 aSpanos, Petros1 aStefanakis, Nikos0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.619-630dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013900157300002000296520110600316592002801422650000801450650001701458650002301475650002001498650001701518650002101535650001701556650002601573650001701599650002101616650001401637650001401651650001201665650002101677653002501698653001201723653001901735653002101754653002901775653002701804700001201831700001801843700001501861700001401876700001301890700001601903700001401919700001301933700001801946700001901964700005401983773014202037856007802179852000902257655001202266IND60596051020221123031946.0180611e20180406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059605102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b014312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rui10aTiO2 Nanolayer-Enhanced Fluorescence for Simultaneous Multiplex Mycotoxin Detection by Aptamer Microarrays on a Porous Silicon Surface  ap. 14447-14453.  aA new aptamer microarray method on the TiO₂–porous silicon (PSi) surface was developed to simultaneously screen multiplex mycotoxins.

The aptamer microarray can simultaneously screen for multiplex mycotoxins with a dynamic linear detection range of 0.1–10 ng/mL for ochratoxin A (OTA), 0.01–10 ng/mL for aflatoxins B₁ (AFB₁), and 0.001–10 ng/mL for fumonisin B₁ (FB₁) and limits of detection of 15.4, 1.48, and 0.21 pg/mL for OTA, AFB₁, and FB₁, respectively. The newly developed method shows good specificity and recovery rates. This method can provide a simple, sensitive, and cost-efficient platform for simultaneous screening of multiplex mycotoxins and can be easily expanded to the other aptamer-based protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaflatoxin B1 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afumonisin B1 3amicroarray technology 3aochratoxin A 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3ascreening 3asilicon 3atitanium dioxide 0amultiplex mycotoxins 0aaptamer 0aporous silicon 0atitanium dioxide 0afluorescence microarrays 0asimultaneous detection1 aLi, Wei1 aCai, Tingting1 aDeng, Yang1 aDing, Zhi1 aLiu, Yan1 aZhu, Xuerui1 aWang, Xin1 aLiu, Jie1 aLiang, Baowen1 aZheng, Tiesong1 aLi, Jianlin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5267-39310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 06, v. 10, no. 17 p.14447-14453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b014313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010100165300001600266520171400282592002801996650002002024650001102044650001302055650001102068650001802079650001502097650001402112650001202126650001902138650000902157650002002166650001402186650001602200651000902216700002102225700003502246700002102281773011202302856008102414852000902495655001202504IND60123835520221122182812.0150407e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-014-9644-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagan, Nicole10aSpeciation and bioaccessibility of mercury in adobe bricks and dirt floors in Huancavelica, Peru  ap. 263-272.  aHuancavelica, Peru, a historic cinnabar refining site, is one of the most mercury (Hg)-contaminated urban areas in the world. Exposure is amplified because residents build their adobe brick homes from contaminated soil. The objectives of this study were to compare two Hg-leaching procedures, and their application as risk-assessment screening tools in Hg-contaminated adobe brick homes in Huancavelica. The purpose was to evaluate potential health implications, particularly for children, after ingestion of Hg-contaminated particles. Hg was measured in adobe brick and dirt floor samples from 60 households by total Hg extraction, simulated gastric fluid (GF) extraction, and sequential selective extraction (SSE), which provides more detailed data but is resource-intensive. Most of the Hg present in samples was relatively insoluble, although in some households soluble Hg species were present at concentrations that may be of concern after ingestion. A strong correlation was identified between results from simulated GF extraction of adobe bricks and dirt floors and the more soluble fractions of Hg from SSE. Simulated GF extraction data were combined with ingestion and body mass characteristics for small children to compare potential risk of ingestion of Hg-contaminated soil with current health standards. Simulated GF extraction can be used as a risk assessment screening tool for effective allocation of time and resources to households that have measurable concentrations of bioaccessible Hg. Combining simulated GF extraction data with health standards enables intervention strategies targeted at households with the greatest potential health threat from ingestion of Hg-contaminated particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abricks 3achildren 3afloors 3agastric juice 3ahouseholds 3aingestion 3amercury 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ascreening 3aurban areas 3aPeru1 aRobins, Nicholas1 aGonzales, Ruben Dario Espinoza1 aHsu-Kim, Heileen0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2015 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.263-272dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-014-9644-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011400173300001800287520191100305536008102216592002802297596005202325650001902377650003102396650002202427650001202449650001402461650001402475650001502489650002102504650001602525650002402541650001102565650002002576651002502596653001102621653001402632653003202646653002302678653001802701700002002719700001602739700001702755700001902772700001802791700002102809773014802830856008602978852000903064655001203073IND60672914020221119184010.0201217e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291402DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16673752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyiraneza, Judith10aLong-Term Changes in Mehlich-3-Extractable Sulfur and Magnesium under Intensive Agriculture in Eastern Canada  ap. 2505-2520.  aLeachable nutrients such as sulfur (S) and magnesium (Mg) may become limiting under temperate regions with sandy soils. This long-term georeferenced study assessed changes in Mehlich-3-extractable S and Mg in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. The Island was sampled over 3 years (one cycle, over 500 sampling points) from 1998 to 2015 for a total of six cycles. Regression kriging was used as a method of interpolation. Sulfur in the high category (>25 mg kg⁻¹) dominated during the first two cycles (69%–98% of the total area) and then decreased below 1% of the total area during the last two cycles. The area in the low to medium category (7–18.50 mg kg⁻¹) represented less than 1% of the total area in the first three cycles and increased to 84% in the last cycle. Magnesium distribution was dominated by soils within the low to medium range (36–116 mg kg⁻¹), representing 74% to 97% of the total area from cycle 1 to cycle 6, respectively. Areas within the Mg range of 116 to 196 mg kg⁻¹ changed from 24% of the total area in cycle 1 to 3% of the total area by the end of cycle 6. The S and Mg contents were positively correlated to soil organic carbon and negatively correlated to phosphorus. In a temperate climate and sandy loam soils, S and Mg decline over time under intensive cultivation, and the soil supply alone may not meet the crop S and Mg requirements.

A randomized plot design with 17 cultivars (‘Aurora-1’; ‘Biuti’; ‘Centenário’; ‘Delicioso Precoce’; ‘Diamante’; ‘Doçura-2’; ‘Douradão’; ‘Dourado-2’; ‘Flordaprince’; ‘Jóia-3’; ‘Kampai’, ‘Libra’; ‘Maravilha’; ‘Okinawa’; ‘Ouromel-4’; ‘Régis’ and ‘Tropical’) was evaluated from 2013 to 2016. The following variables were evaluated during the production cycle each year: the average date for the beginning of harvest (BH), the phenotypic values for the period between pruning and the beginning of harvest (development cycle, DC), the number of fruits per tree (NF), the accumulated production (P. kg. tree−1) and the estimated accumulated productivity (P. t. ha−1). The fruit length (L) and fruit diameter (D) were measured (mm) in addition to the fruit mass (FM) and stone mass (SM) in grams (g). The ratio between the soluble solids and titratable acidity (SS/TA) was also calculated. To evaluate the multivariate analysis by the cluster analysis method, the cultivars were grouped into three different groups for the Tocher and canonical variables and two groups for the UPGMA method (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages). Among the studied variables, DC and P. t. ha−1 were for adaptability and stability performance, and ‘Kampai’ had general adaptability and the highest stability for DC and P. t. ha−1. By the analysis of the selection index, the best cultivars were ‘Aurora-1’, ‘Centenário’, ‘Douradão’, ‘Kampai’ and ‘Régis’. The cultivars ‘Aurora-1’, ‘Douradão’, ‘Kampai’ and ‘Régis’ were the most adaptable and stable regarding precocity and productivity for peach production in the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3aearly development 3aexperimental design 3afruits 3amultivariate analysis 3apeaches 3aphenotype 3apruning 3aselection index 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 3atropics 0aPrunus persica 0aPrecocity 0aProduction 0aMultivariate analysis 0aAdaptability1 aPio, Rafael1 aSilva, Gabi Nunes1 aOlmstead, Mercy1 aCruz, Cosme Damião1 ade Souza, Filipe Bittencourt Machado1 aBisi, Rayane Barcelos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-907X0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 June 27, v. 252 p.252-259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011600180300001800296520126400314592002801578650003001606650001501636650001201651650002201663650001901685650001401704650001601718650002001734650002501754650001401779650001701793650001001810653001701820653001501837653001201852653001801864653001801882700003101900700002901931700002301960700001801983700001802001773014802019856008602167852000902253655001202262IND60672914120221119183849.0201217e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291412DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16673762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaheer, Muhammad Saqlain10aEffect of rhizobacteria and cytokinins application on wheat growth and yield under normal vs drought conditions  ap. 2521-2533.  aDrought is a major constraint for agricultural productivity worldwide, and it is likely to further increase. Different strategies are required to mitigate drought stress in plants. In a two-year study that conducted at agronomic research area of the Islamia University of Bahawalpur, we investigated the role of rhizobacteria (RB) and cytokinins (Ck) on drought tolerance, nutrient uptake, yield, and physiological parameters in wheat under drought stress at different developmental stages (tillering, anthesis, and grain filling). Thirteen treatments used were well-watered control plants without RB or Ck, drought at tillering, anthesis, or grain filling without or with RB alone, Ck alone, or combination of both (RB+Ck). In both years, and at the different stages, measured parameters were highest in the well-watered plants but lowest in drought-stressed plants. Application of RB and Ck to drought-stressed plants increased these parameters in the order RB+Ck > RB > Ck. In some cases, under drought stress, there was no difference between inoculation with RB and application of Ck. It was concluded that the combined application of RB and Ck could play a significant role in improving wheat yield and also alleviation of stress under drought condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3acytokinins 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3anutrient uptake 3arhizosphere bacteria 3atillering 3awater stress 3awheat 0aAntioxidants 0acrop yield 0adrought 0agrowth stages 0aphytohormones1 aRaza, Muhammad Aown Sammar1 aSaleem, Muhammad Farrukh1 aErinle, Kehinde O.1 aIqbal, Rashid1 aAhmad, Salman0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 50, no. 20 p.2521-2533dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16673763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009700175300001800272520142100290592002801711650001901739650001201758650001601770650001401786650002101800650002201821650001301843650001301856650001801869650002101887650001301908650001301921650001701934650001901951651000901970653002101979653001802000653001702018653002102035653003302056653001902089700002902108700002102137700002802158700002502186773014802211856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60672914220221119183803.0201217e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291422DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16673772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan Ahmadi, Somayeh10aEvaluation of Various Rosa Damascena Mill. Genotypes Grown under Rainfed Semi-arid Condition  ap. 2534-2543.  aRosa damascena Mill L. also known as “Damask Rose” and “Gole Mohammadi” is a well-recognized high value ornamental and medicinal plant, which can be used in food, perfume and medicine industries. This study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity of 10 Rosa damascena genotypes by evaluating their morphological traits, flower yield and oil content to find the best genotype with high productivity under rainfed condition in Lorestan province, Iran. This study was conducted in a completely randomized design trial with three replications. The data analyses, using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients, showed that flower dry yield per hectare was significantly and positively correlated with, flower dry weight per plant, flowering period, plant height, number of flowers per plant, fresh and dry weight of petals, average weight of each flower, and number of flowers per day. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that the first three PCs, respectively, called as flower yield, receptacle, and flower size components accounted for 88.33% of the total variation. The genotypes were grouped into four clusters in which the highest genetic distance was observed between Kermanshah and Fars1 genotypes. Fars1 and Yazd1 genotypes had the highest productivity in terms of, respectively, flower yield and oil content and showed the high potential for cultivation under rainfed condition in Lorestan province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa damascena 3acorolla 3aflower size 3aflowering 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aindustry 3alipid content 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3aperfumes 3aplant height 3asemiarid zones 3aIran 0aCluster analysis 0aessential oil 0aflower yield 0agenetic distance 0aprincipal component analysis 0aRosa damascene1 aMortazaeinezhad, Forough1 aZeinali, Hossein1 aAskari-Khorasgani, Omid1 aPessarakli, Mohammad0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 50, no. 20 p.2534-2543dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16673773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04321naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245015100204300001400355520216900369592002802538650000802566650001902574650001802593650001102611650001102622650001502633650001902648650001702667650001402684650001302698650001902711650001902730650001402749650002502763650002402788650001702812650002002829650002102849650001802870650002102888650001702909650002202926650003702948650002002985650002203005653002203027653002703049653003103076653004303107653002703150653002503177653001803202653002403220653002603244653001103270653005203281653001703333653002103350700001603371700001503387700001403402773010103416856008503517852000903602655001203611IND60625747920221122045403.0200103e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062574792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerera, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2263-700810aTowards a fuller assessment of benefits to children's health of reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change due to fossil fuel combustion  ap. 55-72.  aFossil fuel combustion by-products, including particulate matter (PM₂.₅), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), are a significant threat to children's health and equality. Various policies to reduce emissions have been implemented to reduce air pollution and mitigate climate change, with sizeable estimated health and economic benefits. However, only a few adverse outcomes in children have been considered, resulting in an undercounting of the benefits to this vulnerable population.Our goal was to expand the suite of child health outcomes addressed by programs to assess health and economic benefits, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP), by identifying concentration-response (C-R) functions for six outcomes related to PM₂.₅, NO₂, PAH, and/or PM₁₀: preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, IQ reduction, and the development of childhood asthma.We conducted a systematic review of the literature published between January 1, 2000 and April 30, 2018 to identify relevant peer-reviewed case-control and cohort studies and meta–analyses. In some cases meta-analyses were available that provided reliable C-R functions and we assessed their consistency with subsequent studies. Otherwise, we reviewed all eligible studies published between our search dates.For each pollutant and health outcome, we present the characteristics of each selected study. We distinguish between C-R functions for endpoints having a causal or likely relationship (PTB, LBW, autism, asthma development) with the pollutants for incorporation into primary analyses and endpoints having a suggestive causal relationship with the pollutants (IQ reduction, ADHD) for secondary analyses.We have identified C-R functions for a number of adverse health outcomes in children associated with air pollutants largely from fossil fuel combustion. Their incorporation into expanded assessments of health benefits of clean air and climate mitigation policies will provide an important incentive for preventive action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aasthma 3aautism 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3achild health 3achildhood 3achildren 3aclimate change 3acohort studies 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3afinancial economics 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3alow birth weight 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apremature birth 3asystematic review 0aChildren's health 0aFossil fuel combustion 0aParticulate matter (PM2.5) 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 0aNitrogen dioxide (NO2) 0aCarbon dioxide (CO2) 0aAir pollution 0aPreterm birth (PTB) 0aLow birthweight (LBW) 0aAutism 0aAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 0aIQ reduction 0aChildhood asthma1 aAshrafi, A.1 aKinney, P.1 aMills, D.0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 May, v. 172 p.55-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001600267520134700283592002801630650002001658650002301678650000801701650001501709650001001724650001401734650001201748650001001760650001901770650001101789650001401800650002201814650001101836650000901847650002001856650003701876651002101913700002001934700002001954700001901974700002001993773011202013856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60123835920221122220706.0150407e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-014-9650-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiyeon10aHuman exposure and risk assessment of cadmium for residents of abandoned metal mine areas in Korea  ap. 321-332.  aThe objective of this study is to find the Cd levels in agricultural crops compared to soil, to evaluate the relationship between daily intake dose through the multimedia/multi-pathway of human exposure and biomarker levels of the residents in mine vicinity area. We collected and cited the data of four out of ten health impact assessments for the residents of abandoned mine areas undertaken by the Korea Ministry of Environment in 2008. The Cd levels in soil were significantly decreased by the separation distance from the mines. The Cd levels in blood were significantly different between residents in mine areas and in comparative areas, but urinary Cd levels did not differ. The Cd levels in blood were related to the age; the separation distance from mine to residence; the daily intake dose via ingestion of drinking water, crops, and surface soil; and inhalation of ambient air of Cd, but urinary Cd levels were not relevant with various sociodemographic characteristics and exposure factors. The average hazard quotient (HQ) value of Cd in the mining site was below 1.0, but the maximum HQ was closed to 1.0. The results indicated that the ingestion of Cd-contaminated soil and agricultural crops by local inhabitants could pose potential adverse health effects to long-term residents consuming rice grown near to the mining areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural soils 3aair 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abreathing 3acadmium 3acrops 3adrinking water 3ahumans 3aingestion 3along term effects 3amining 3arice 3arisk assessment 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Eung-Cheol1 aShin, Dong-Chun1 aJo, Seong-Joon1 aLim, Young-Wook0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2015 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.321-332dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-014-9650-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013400173300001200307520118600319592002801505650002201533650001401555650001101569650001801580650001601598650001201614650001701626650001701643650001601660650000901676650000901685653003301694653003001727653001801757653001901775700001701794773013801811856008601949852000902035655001202044IND60721442220221120154034.0201224e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144222DNAL7 a10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00006.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishna, Deeksha10aEffect on different concentration of zinc and cadmium on mycorrhizal colonization in soil in finger millet (Eluesine Cocacana L.)  ap. 1-4.  aA pot culture experiment was carried out to studythe effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on finger millet mycorrhizal colonization, Zinc and Cadmium up take under increasing Zn and Cd levels using a factorial design with 4×4 treatments with four levels of strains of mycorrhizal fungi viz. uninoculted control (M₀), in oculation with Gigaspora ACP-1(M₁), Glomus ACP-2(M₂)and Scutellospora ACP-2(M₃) and four levels of heavy metal each ofzinc sul phate at the rates of 0, 150, 300 and 450 mg Zn kg⁻¹ soil and Cdat the rates of 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg Cd Kg⁻¹ soil to find out the effects of in oculation with mycorrhizal strains under doses of Zn and Cdon finger millet (Eluesine coracana L.) at 30, 60 and 105 days af ter sow ing (DAS).

Early and accurate diagnosis is a must for proper treatment that prevents life threatening sequels. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel technique that can amplify DNA with high sensitivity and specificity under isothermal conditions.To validate a LAMP-specific protocol for detection of Toxoplasma DNA using dried blood spots (DBS) from mice experimentally infected with the cystogenic Toxoplasma ME-49 strain.In this study, the target DNA fragment was the Toxoplasma 529-bp repeat element that exists in 200–300 copies per T. gondii genome. The sensitivity of both LAMP and conventional PCR techniques was estimated in DBS samples from experimental mice at 1-week and 8-weeks post-infection.Out of 20 blood samples gathered on Whatman filter paper from mice at 1-week post-infection, 18 and 16 were positive by LAMP and conventional PCR, respectively. Neither techniques detected parasite DNA in blood at 8th week of infection.Dried blood spots are easy source of material for molecular studies. LAMP assay proved higher sensitivity than the conventional PCR in detecting parasitemia in early infection with the cystogenic Toxoplasma strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3agenome 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amice 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aDried blood spots (DBS) 0aLoop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 0aPCR1 aAwad, Soha I.1 aSaleh, Nora E.1 aHegazy, Mamdouh M.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2020 Apr., v. 211 p.107869-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1078693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04312naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012300171300001600294520194400310592002802254650002002282650002502302650001702327650001502344650001602359650001302375650001302388650001102401650002002412650001602432650002702448650002802475650004302503650002002546650002402566650001402590650000902604650001702613650001702630650002102647650002202668650002002690650001802710650001002728650002002738650002502758650004402783650001002827653000802837653000702845653000802852653000802860653000802868653001502876653000702891653001202898653000802910653000802918653000902926653000802935653000902943653000802952653001002960653000902970653000702979653001602986653001403002653002003016653003003036653003103066653002103097700002703118700002403145700002303169700001603192700001603208773010403224856008503328852000903413655001203422IND60625748020221120025153.0200117e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062574802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNapierala, Marta14aThe effect of maternal tobacco smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure on human milk oxidant-antioxidant status  ap. 110-121.  aMany women who smoke tobacco continue to do so during lactation, and many non-smoking women are exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) during the period that she wishes to breastfeed. There are reports documenting the adverse effects of maternal smoking during lactation on their infant's health; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood.Our study purpose was to examine the influence of tobacco smoke on biochemical markers reflecting the intensity of oxidative stress using concentration of total protein (TP), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), S-nitrosothiols (RSNO), nitric oxide (NO), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) in the plasma, colostrum, and mature milk of women who smoke, those only exposed to SHS, and non-smokers.Questionnaire data on the tobacco smoking status were verified based on the determination of cotinine by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Relevant markers of oxidative stress and biochemical parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods.We found that tobacco smoking during lactation increases oxidative stress in the mother's plasma, colostrum, and mature milk, and lesser so in those exposed to SHS. Tobacco smoke significantly increase TBARS and decrease TEAC in colostrum and mature milk. In response to ROS generated by tobacco smoke increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GST, GPx and CAT), p < 0.05.Such exposure to tobacco smoke influences the antioxidant barrier of human colostrum and mature milk that can adversely affect their infant's health. Greater public health awareness of the adverse effects of tobacco smoking during lactation on breast milk quality and its protective effects is urgently needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abreast milk 3acatalase 3acotinine 3adiodes 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman colostrum 3ainhalation exposure 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk quality 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3apublic health 3asmoke 3asmoking (habit) 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3awomen 0aCAT 0aER 0aGPx 0aGSH 0aGST 0aHPLC–DAD 0aNO 0aONOO– 0aRNS 0aROS 0aRSNO 0aSHS 0aSIDS 0aSOD 0aTBARS 0aTEAC 0aTP 0aBreast milk 0aLactation 0aTobacco smoking 0aSecond-hand tobacco smoke 0aOxidant-antioxidant status 0aOxidative stress1 aMerritt, Thurman Allen1 aMiechowicz, Izabela1 aMielnik, Katarzyna1 aMazela, Jan1 aFlorek, Ewa0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Mar., v. 170 p.110-121dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012400172300001800296520158400314592002801898650001201926650001101938650001901949650003001968650002601998650002502024650001702049650001802066650001402084650001902098650001102117650001302128650002102141650002502162650001402187650001602201650002002217653001202237653002102249653002002270653001802290653001902308653001602327700002202343700002702365700002502392700002302417773014802440856008602588852000902674655001202683IND60672914620221119183807.0201217e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291462DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16714432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodor, Daniel E.10aKinetics of Carbon Mineralization and Sequestration of Sole and/or Co-amended Biochar and Cattle Manure in a Sandy Soil  ap. 2593-2609.  aThe interactive effect of biochar, cattle manure and nitrogen (N) fertilizer on the dynamics of carbon (C) mineralization and stabilization was investigated in a sandy soil amended with three sole biochar (0, 20 or 40 t ha⁻¹) or manure (0, 13 or 26 t ha⁻¹) and four combined biochar-manure levels (20 or 40 t ha⁻¹ biochar plus 13 or 26 t ha⁻¹ manure) with or without N fertilizer (0 or 90 kg ha⁻¹) and CO₂-C evolution measured over 54-d incubation period. Biochar application, solely or combined with manure resulted in lower applied C mineralized (ACM), indicating C sequestration in the soils. Negative attributable effect (AE) of co-application of biochar and manure on C mineralization was observed relative to the sole treatments. Both ACM and AE were negatively correlated with C/N ratio and mineral N content of the soil-mixtures (r ≥ – 0.573; p ≤ 0.01), indicating microbial N limitation. The double first-order exponential model described CO₂-C efflux very well and indicated that ≥94% of C applied was apportioned to stable C pools with slower mineralization rate constant and longer half-life. Cumulative C mineralized and modeled C pools were positively correlated with each other (r ≥ 0.853; p ≤ 0.001) and with readily oxidizable C of soil-amendment mixtures (r ≥ 0.861; p ≤ 0.001). The results suggested that co-application of biochar and manure can promote initial rapid mineralization to release plant nutrients but sequester larger amounts of applied C in refractive C pool, resulting in larger C sequestration in sandy soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acattle manure 3ahalf life 3amineralization 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 0aBiochar 0aC mineralization 0aC sequestration 0acattle manure 0akinetic models 0asandy soils1 aAmanor, Yahaya J.1 aAsamoah-Bediako, Abena1 aMaccarthy, Dilys S.,1 aDovie, Delali B.K.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 50, no. 20 p.2593-2609dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16714433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016900169300001400338520166600352592002802018650001402046650001802060650001302078650002002091650001102111650001502122650002102137650001202158650002502170650001202195650002402207650001202231650001902243651001802262653002102280653001302301653002602314653001702340653002402357700001602381700001902397700002702416773009202443856008402535852000902619655001202628IND60535583720221118062923.0190401e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053558372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSliwa, Sarah A.10aMaternal employment, acculturation, and time spent in food-related behaviors among Hispanic mothers in the United States. Evidence from the American Time Use Survey  ap. 10-19.  aEmployment is a major factor underlying im/migration patterns. Unfortunately, lower diet quality and higher rates of obesity appear to be unintended consequences of moving to the US. Changes in food preparation practices may be a factor underlying dietary acculturation. The relationships between employment, acculturation, and food-related time use in Hispanic families have received relatively little attention. We used cross-sectional data collected from Hispanic mothers (ages 18–65) with at least one child <13 years old participating in the 2003–2011 American Time Use Survey (n = 3622) to estimate the relationship between employment, acculturation (US-born vs. im/migrant), and time spent in food preparation and family dinner. Regression models were estimated separately for the employed and the non-working and were adjusted for Hispanic origin group, socio-demographic and household characteristics. Working an eight-hour day was associated with spending 38 fewer minutes in food preparation (−38.0 ± SE 4.8, p < 001). Although being US-born was associated with spending fewer minutes in food preparation, this relationship varied by origin group. Acculturation did not appear to modify the relationship between hours worked and time spent in food preparation or family dinner. Mothers who worked late hours spent less time eating the evening meal with their families (−9.8 ± SE 1.3). Although an eight-hour workday was associated with a significant reduction in food preparation time, an unexpected result is that, for working mothers, additional time spent in paid work is not associated with the duration of family dinner later that day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHispanics 3aacculturation 3achildren 3adata collection 3adinner 3aemployment 3afood preparation 3amothers 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awork schedules 3aUnited States 0aFood preparation 0aTime use 0aDietary acculturation 0aFamily meals 0aMaternal employment1 aMust, Aviva1 aPeréa, Flavia1 aEconomos, Christina D.0 tAppetite.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 87 p.10-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167300001600275520120500291592002801496650002101524650001601545650001501561650002101576650001501597650001201612650001201624650001501636650001801651650001101669653000901680653000701689653000901696653000701705653000801712653000801720653000901728653000801737653000801745653000701753653000701760653000701767653000701774653001101781653000701792653000801799653003001807653001101837653002101848653001001869653002701879653002901906653002301935653001401958700002701972700001801999700001802017773011902035856008502154852000902239655001202248IND60554267920221120175154.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055426792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Junsen10aStructural insights into nonvesicular lipid transport by the oxysterol binding protein homologue family  ap. 928-939.  aSterols such as cholesterol in mammals and ergosterol in fungi are essential membrane components and play a key role in membrane function and in cell signaling. The intracellular distribution and processing of sterols and other phospholipids are in part carried out by oxysterol binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) in eukaryotes. Seven ORPs (Osh1–Osh7 proteins) in yeast have distinct functions in maintaining distribution, metabolism and signaling of intracellular lipids but they share at least one essential function. Significant progress has been made in understanding the ligand specificity and mechanism of non-vesicular lipid transport by ORPs. The unique structural features of Osh proteins explain the diversity and specificity of functions in PI(4)P-coupled lipid transport optimized in membrane contact sites. This review discusses the current advances in structural biology regarding this protein family and its potential functions, introducing them as the key players in the novel pathways of phosphoinositide-coupled directional transport of various lipids.

The Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB), known as the major hindrance, greatly limits therapeutics penetration into the brain. Moreover, even though some therapeutics can cross BBB based on their intrinsic properties or via the use of proper nanoscale delivery vehicles, their therapeutic efficacy is still often limited without the specific uptake of drugs by the cancer or disease-associated cells. As more studies have started to elucidate the pathological roles of major cells in the CNS (for example, microglia, neurons, and astrocytes) for different disorders, nanomedicines that can enable targeting of specific cells in these diseases may provide great potential to boost efficacy. In this review, we aim to briefly cover the pathological roles of endothelial cells, microglia, tumor-associated microglia/macrophage, neurons, astrocytes, and glioma in CNS disorders and to highlight the recent advances in nanomedicines that can target specific disease-associated cells. Furthermore, we summarized some strategies employed in nanomedicine to achieve specific cell targeting or to enhance the drug neuroprotective effects in the CNS. The specific targeting at the cellular level by nanotherapy can be a more precise and effective means not only to enhance the drug availability but also to reduce side effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aastrocytes 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3amacrophages 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3atherapeutics 0aABC 0aAD 0aALS 0aBBB 0aBBTB 0aCCL 0aCNS 0adPGS 0aGFAP 0aIL 0aLFR 0aLPS 0aMMP 0aMS 0aMTFR 0aNO 0aPAMAM 0aPD 0aROS 0aTAM 0aTfR 0aTNF 0aVCAM 0aNanomedicine 0aCNS disorders 0aTargeted therapy 0aBBB 0aMicroglia 0aNeuron1 aLin, Yi'an,1 aKannan, Sujatha1 aKannan, Rangaramanujam M.0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016 Oct. 28, v. 240 p.212-226dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010400168300001600272520122700288592002801515650001501543650002801558650000901586650001601595650002001611650001501631700001501646700001401661700001901675773007401694856008401768852000901852655001201861IND60096535620221117234331.0141104e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009653562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhongbao10aComparative study of computational intelligence approaches for NOₓ reduction of coal-fired boiler  ap. 683-692.  aThis paper focuses on NOₓ emission prediction and operating parameters optimization for coal-fired boilers. Support Vector Regression (SVR) model based on CGA (Conventional Genetic Algorithm) was proposed to model the relationship between the operating parameters and the concentration of NOₓ emission. Then CGA and two modified algorithms, the Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) and SAGA (Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm), were employed to optimize the operating parameters of the coal-fired boiler to reduce NOₓ emission. The results showed that the proposed SVR model was more accurate than the widely used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model when employed to predict the concentration of NOₓ emission. The mean relative error and correlation coefficient calculated by the proposed SVR model were 2.08% and 0.95, respectively. Among the three optimization algorithms implemented in this paper, the SAGA showed superiority to the other two algorithms considering the quality of solution within a given computing time. The SVR plus SAGA method was preferable to predict the concentration of NOₓ emission and further to optimize the operating parameters to achieve low NOₓ emission for coal-fired boilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acoal 3acorrelation 3aneural networks 3aprediction1 aLi, Xiaolu1 aXu, Lijun1 aCheng, Yanting0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.683-692dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009300172300001600265520146000281592002801741650001601769650001801785650002001803650001701823650002601840650001801866650001901884650001101903650001501914650001801929650001201947650001801959650001701977653001801994653004502012700002302057700001502080700003902095700002702134773007902161856008602240852000902326655001202335IND60539380520221117085255.0160815e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053938052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Aakriti10aCharacterizing soils via portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer: 3.

The use of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry for pH determination was investigated using elemental data as a proxy for soil pH. Two datasets representing a wide variety of soil pH (4.17–8.70) were first evaluated via PXRF followed by standard laboratory techniques. Datasets were divided into modeling and validation datasets. Simple and multiple linear regressions were used to develop models associating both pure elemental data from PXRF as well as PXRF elemental data with auxiliary input data (clay content, sand content, organic matter content). Multiple linear regression with auxiliary input data provided the best predictive model (R2: 0.825; RMSE: 0.541); multiple linear regression with pure PXRF elemental data provided a quality model (R2: 0.772; RMSE: 0.685); simple linear regression was ineffective as producing significant model predictions. Validation via correlation analysis confirmed the significance of the developed models. Summarily, PXRF shows considerable promise in providing rapid pH predictions in soils with reasonable accuracy, especially for unusual circumstances where non-destructive sampling is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aclay fraction 3adata collection 3afluorescence 3alaboratory techniques 3alinear models 3aorganic matter 3apastes 3aprediction 3asand fraction 3asoil pH 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 0aSoil reaction 0aPortable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry1 aWeindorf, David C.1 aMan, Titus1 aAldabaa, Abdalsamad Abdalsatar Ali1 aChakraborty, Somsubhra0 tGeoderma.g2014 Nov., v. 232-234 p.141-147dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010900164300001600273500001500289520174400304592002802048650001602076650001602092650002002108650001502128650001202143650001402155650002002169650001202189650002102201650001002222650001702232650000902249650001502258650002102273650001902294650001402313650001202327651001102339653001502350700001902365700002102384700001702405700001502422700001602437773012202453856008102575852000902656655001202665IND60519652520221123005812.0160508e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051965252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-016-0954-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalev, Ailon10aHigh-intensity thinning treatments in mature Pinus halepensis plantations experiencing prolonged drought  ap. 551-563.  a2019-12-06  aPinus halepensis plantations are widespread throughout semiarid–subhumid landscapes of the Mediterranean. Recently, drought-induced decline has often been reported raising concerns with regard to the future of these man-made ecosystems. The study was set out to investigate thinning as a means to alleviate water stress and improve performance of mature P. halepensis plantations experiencing prolonged drought. The study was conducted in a 40-year-old P. halepensis forest in the Jerusalem Mountains of Israel (rainfall: 550 mm year⁻¹). Declining stands (stand basal area increment, BAIₛₜₐₙd ≈ −3 % year⁻¹) were treated by thinning: (1) intense thinning—tree density, BAₛₜₐₙd, and leaf area index (LAI) reduced by 81, 68, and 59 %, respectively; (2) moderate—56, 48, and 26 %, respectively; (3) control (~560 tree ha⁻¹). Plots of 70 × 70 m were used in four replicates. Individual tree- to stand-level variables were monitored during 4 years through stem and leaf area metrics alongside with predawn shoot water potential (ψ PD) and tree mortality. Thinning ameliorated drought stress, reduced mortality, and improved individual tree growth (ψ PD = −1.7, −1.8, and −2.0 MPa; mortality = 0.2, 2, and 5 % year⁻¹; BAIₜᵣₑₑ = 3.4, 2.0, and 1.4 % year⁻¹ in intense, moderate, and control treatments, respectively). Thinning effects became more pronounced with time. LAI and individual tree leaf area (LAₜᵣₑₑ) fluctuated with association to annual rainfall. Higher LAₜᵣₑₑ caused by thinning reflected a “selection effect” while increased leaf area efficiency (BAI per unit LAₜᵣₑₑ) was attributed to a “release effect” of thinning.  aPublisher supplied data 3atree growth 3aplantations 3awater potential 3alandscapes 3adecline 3amountains 3aleaf area index 3adrought 3aPinus halepensis 3atrees 3awater stress 3arain 3aecosystems 3astand basal area 3atree mortality 3amortality 3aforests 3aIsrael 0abasal area1 aZoref, Chanoch1 aTzukerman, Moshe1 aMoshe, Yosef1 aZangy, Ela1 aOsem, Yagil0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2016 June, v. 135, no. 3 p.551-563dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-016-0954-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018400168520150000352592002801852650001801880650001501898650002101913650001701934650002401951650002501975650001302000650001902013650002202032650002702054650001202081650001002093650002502103650001202128650002302140650001602163650002602179650002002205650001302225650001802238650001102256650001902267650001602286650002302302653004202325653002802367653002502395653002102420653001902441700001402460700001502474700001702489700001902506700002002525700001502545700005802560700001702618700001502635773011202650856008502762852000902847655001202856IND60701006720221123011103.0200831e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070100672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Chengxin10aMesophilic anaerobic digestion of thermally hydrolyzed sludge in anaerobic membrane bioreactor: Long-term performance, microbial community dynamics and membrane fouling mitigation  aThermal hydrolysis (TH) was integrated into an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) to stimulate sludge bioconversion and methane production. Sludge solubilization degree and methane productivity increased with TH temperature. The optimal performance was observed at 125 °C, with a 2.56-time increase in soluble chemical oxygen demand (1116.2 ± 62 mg/L). Methane production rate approached 73.2 ± 7.5 mL/Lᵣₑₐcₜₒᵣ/d, rising by 2.96 times. Integration of TH effectively mediated membrane fouling, inducing a stable membrane flux of 10.8 ± 0.5 L/m²/h and low transmembrane pressure (TMP, ≤4.7 kPa). Cake layer deposited on the membrane surface accounted for 66.1 ± 1.0% of total resistance, with proteins and polysaccharides as the main contributors to membrane fouling (or increased TMP) (protein: Rₚ = 0.89, p₀.₀₅ = 0.04; polysaccharide: Rₚ = 0.99, p₀.₀₅ = 0.01). 16s rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that utilization of TH could regulate microbial diversity and enhance the proliferation of organics-degrading bacteria (i.e. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, etc.) and methane-producing methanogens (i.e. Methanosaeta, Methanobacterium, etc.), which accelerated the biodegradation of organics while alleviating membrane fouling and upgrading methane production. This study demonstrated the great potential of the combined TH-AnMBR system as a new strategy in promoting sludge solubilization, methane bioconversion and membrane fouling mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aMethanobacterium 3aMethanosaeta 3aanaerobic digestion 3aartificial membranes 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3achemical oxygen demand 3afouling 3agenes 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3asludge 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3athermal hydrolysis 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) 0aThermal hydrolysis (TH) 0aMethane productivity 0aMembrane fouling 0aEnergy balance1 aPan, Yang1 aLu, Xueqin1 aWang, Shasha1 aZhang, Zhongyi1 aZheng, Chaoting1 aTan, Yujie1 aZhen, Guangyin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7697-18021 aZhao, Youcai1 aLi, Yu-You0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 612 p.118264-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013300169300001800302520152200320592002801842650001101870650001001881650001101891650001501902650000901917650001101926650003001937651001301967651001501980651001801995651001802013651001602031700002302047700002002070700002302090700002002113773013502133856008202268852000902350655001202359IND60654233120221121101335.0190724e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065423312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02796-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhamshry, Asmaa10aPrediction of summer rainfall over the source region of the Blue Nile by using teleconnections based on sea surface temperatures  ap. 3077-3087.  aSummer rainfall (June–September) accounts for about 80% of the annual rainfall in the Lake Tana basin of Ethiopia, the source region of the Blue Nile River. Prediction of summer rainfall would be valuable for managing the region’s water resources and agricultural operations. This study investigated the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) as a predictor of summer rainfall in the basin by applying cross-correlation analysis between summer rainfall and climatic indices and SST in various oceanic regions from 1985 to 2015. Summer rainfall showed a strong negative correlation (− 0.619) with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index at short time lags. Further analysis identified strong teleconnections (|r| ≥ 0.5) between SSTs in specific parts of the Pacific Ocean and summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin, raising the possibility of predicting summer rainfall from Pacific SSTs with a lead time of 4 to 5 months. Average SSTs of an area near the Philippines and an area west of North America were positively correlated (0.629) and negatively correlated (− 0.538), respectively, with summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin. Predictions of summer rainfall from these teleconnected SSTs by an Elman recurrent neural network model were encouraging, indicating a strong correlation (r > 0.77) between the observed and predicted summer rainfall. Our results suggest that neural network techniques may have sufficient skill to support seasonal rainfall predictions over the Lake Tana basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3alakes 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aEthiopia 3aNile River 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean 3aPhilippines1 aFenta, Ayele Almaw1 aYasuda, Hiroshi1 aShimizu, Katsuyuki1 aKawai, Takayuki0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Aug., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.3077-3087dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02796-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015500166300001400321520187100335592002802206650001502234650002802249650002602277650001702303650001902320650001202339650001602351650001402367650001302381650001502394650001402409650001402423650001902437650001502456651001002471700001502481700001502496700001402511773008802525856008502613990002302698852000902721655001202730IND60093620220221117163657.0141103e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009362022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJian, Xing10aGeochemistry of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in the northern Qaidam basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau: Implications for provenance and weathering  ap. 74-88.  aWhole-rock geochemical data of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in the northern Qaidam basin were used to reconstruct the provenance and chemical weathering history. Based on the fairly uniform REE patterns and trace element ratios, both the Mesozoic (LaCN/YbCN=10.37±1.75; Eu/Eu*=0.68±0.07; Th/Sc=1.11±0.38) and Cenozoic (LaCN/YbCN=9.77±0.62; Eu/Eu*=0.69±0.03; Th/Sc=0.97±0.14) mudstones were derived from a similar source area with acidic-intermediate rocks as dominant contributors, and two modeled mixtures composed of 60% granite, 35% quartzdiorite and 5% mafic rocks, and 55% granite, 40% quartzdiorite and 5% mafic rocks can be deduced as the potential source compositions for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments, respectively. This conclusion is reinforced by the mudstone major element composition and sandstone petrography. The Early–Middle Jurassic mudstones have relatively high K-corrected CIA (84–93) and PIA (88–99) values, indicating intense chemical weathering conditions; while the Late Jurassic to Cenozoic sediments have variable corrected CIA (51–85) and PIA (50–92) values, implying predominantly mild to moderate weathering conditions. The chemical weathering history suggests that a warm and humid climate prevailed during the Early–Middle Jurassic, whereas a cool and semiarid to arid climate prevailed from the Late Jurassic up to now. This dramatic transition of climate may be attributed to multiple likely factors, including the restructuring of global atmospheric circulation patterns in response to the breakup of Pangea since Late Jurassic, and the orogenic rejuvenation and high elevation of the Qilian Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, the decreasing chemical weathering intensity over time indicates the increase of aridification and cooling of the climate culminating in the Late Cenozoic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric circulation 3aelemental composition 3ageochemistry 3aglobal cooling 3agranite 3ahumid zones 3amountains 3amudstone 3aprovenance 3asandstone 3asediments 3atrace elements 3aweathering 3aChina1 aGuan, Ping1 aZhang, Wei1 aFeng, Fan0 tChemical geology.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 360-361 p.74-88dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009700162300001600259500001900275520170500294592002801999596007502027596005902102650002402161650001202185650002602197650002002223650002402243650001402267650001002281650002302291650001402314650002002328650001602348650001502364650001902379650002202398650003702420650000902457651001002466700001602476700001602492700001902508773012802527856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60688012120221121042610.0200407e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068801212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-020-04452-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aEffect of long-term destocking on soil fungal functional groups and interactions with plants  ap. 495-508.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: While the effects of destocking on soil nutrient and plant productivity are known, the effect on functional groups of fungi has received less attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term destocking on fungal functional guilds and their association with plants and soil. METHODS: We characterized the changes in five fungal functional guilds, including plant pathogens, animal pathogens, wood saprotrophs, dung saprotrophs, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), along a 35-year chronosequence following destocking at 0–60 cm soil depths on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Fungal community composition was assigned by comparing with the FUNGuild database. RESULTS: After 35 years of destocking, diversities of plant pathogens, wood saprotrophs, and AMF increased, while that of animal pathogens and dung saprotrophs decreased. Destocking had a greater effect in the near-surface layers (0–10 and 10–20 cm) owing to the greater influence of plant biomass and soil nutrients. Among the above- and belowground drivers, plant pathogen diversity was largely associated with plant diversity, while animal pathogens, dung saprotrophs, and wood saprotrophs were associated with aboveground biomass, AMF were responsive to soil conditions (e.g., organic C, NO₃⁻-N, C:N ratio, and moisture). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term destocking can be considered to be an important predictor of fungal functional guilds, and changes in these microorganisms were associated with cessation-induced shifts in plants and soil by grazing.

Here, we report a sandwich-like structured strain sensor with excellent optical transparency based on highly purified, solution-processed, 99% metallic CNT–polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite thin films. Our CNT–PDMS composite strain sensors are mechanically compliant, physically robust, and easily fabricated. The fabricated strain sensors exhibit a high optical transparency of over 92% in the visible range with acceptable sensing performances in terms of sensitivity, hysteresis, linearity, and drift. We also found that the sensitivity and linearity of the strain sensors can be controlled by the number of CNT sprays; hence, our sensor can be applied and controlled based on the need of individual applications. Finally, we investigated the detections of human activities and emotions by mounting our transparent strain sensor on various spots of human skins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectronic equipment 3aemotions 3ahumans 3ahysteresis 0acarbon nanotube 0astrain sensor 0atransparent 0apolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 0asolution-processed 0anetwork 0asandwich-like structure1 aLim, Meehyun1 aYoon, Jinsu1 aKim, Min Seong1 aChoi, Bongsik1 aKim, Dong Myong1 aKim, Dae Hwan1 aPark, Inkyu1 aChoi, Sung-Jin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 9, no. 31 p.26279-26285dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b031843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245003900166300001600205520092800221592002801149650001301177650001401190650002401204650002501228650001601253650001101269650001301280650002201293700001801315773012501333856007901458852000901537655001201546IND60312914620221117034820.0150714e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031291462DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12611402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedford, June I.10aPlant synthetic biology takes root  ap. 162-163.  aThe evolution of computers and electronics from bulky room-size devices to the sleek devices of today has relied on a well-honed strategy: Use parts whose behaviors are quantitatively defined and assemble complex systems from simpler modules. Synthetic biology aims to bring this approach to living organisms (1 , 2), and it is already starting to happen in plants. A sensor and response system can be designed, sensor proteins programmed in a computer, encoded in a plant, and empowered with such properties as memory and amplification (3). Using genetic information and mathematical analysis allows one to design predictable and quantitative functions in plants, comparable to those of integrated electronic circuits. Just as integrated circuits can be reused in diverse electronic devices, from cell phones to aircraft, synthetic biology components should function predictably in different synthetic circuits and plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3acomputers 3aelectronic circuits 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3amemory 3aproteins 3asynthetic biology1 aPrasad, Ashok0 tScience.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 346, no. 6206 p.162-163dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12611403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245007100167300001600238520131100254592002801565650001101593650001501604650001301619650001501632650001101647650001801658650001001676650000901686650001301695650001001708650001401718650001201732650001201744650001101756650001201767651001101779651001401790651001401804653001101818653001301829653000901842653001301851653001901864653001601883700001801899773012801917856007802045852000902123655001202132IND60130100220221120204048.0151127e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010022DNAL7 a10.2994/057.007.02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Robert W.10aOn the Diets of Neotropical Treeboas (Squamata: Boidae: Corallus)1  ap. 172-180.  aNine species of the Neotropical boid genus Corallus are distributed from southeastern Guatemala to southeastern Brazil. Based largely on previously published papers, we accumulated 271 prey records for all species combined, and they comprised 2 frogs, 69 lizards (mostly Anolis), 1 snake, 65 birds, and 134 mammals (marsupials, rodents, bats). There is a conspicuous difference in diet between the two West Indian species (C. cookii and C. grenadensis) and species occurring on the mainland: juvenile and subadult boas from the West Indies prey almost entirely on anoles, whereas on the mainland (with the notable exceptions of C. batesii and C. caninus), those age classes prey largely on birds and bats. Four species (C. cookii, C. grenadensis, C. hortulanus, and C. ruschenbergerii) are vertebrate generalists and exhibit both active and ambush foraging modes. Adult C. batesii and C. caninus (and, perhaps, C. cropanii) are specialists on mammalian prey, may only utilize an ambush foraging mode, and were the only species for which we had at least three prey records that did not include avian prey. Although more common than the critically endangered C. cropanii, both C. annulatus and C. blombergii seem genuinely rare and it is premature to make any generalizations regarding their trophic biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis 3aChiroptera 3aCorallus 3aMetatheria 3aadults 3aage structure 3abirds 3adiet 3aforaging 3afrogs 3ajuveniles 3alizards 3arodents 3asnakes 3atropics 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aGuatemala 0aBoidae 0aCorallus 0aDiet 0aForaging 0aPrey Densities 0aWest Indies1 aPauers, Mike,0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2012 Aug., v. 7, no. 2 p.172-180dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2F057.007.02073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007500170300001200245520196100257592002802218650002902246650001702275650001102292650002502303650001202328650001902340650002702359650002102386650001702407650000902424650001402433653001002447653002202457653002602479653001902505653002002524653002502544653002902569653001302598700002002611773010102631856008102732852000902813655001202822IND60622233420221118045326.0181124e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062223342DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683604hl684ed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, Frank M.10aHolocene environmental change: contributions from the peatland archive  ap. 1-6.  aPeatlands provide a widespread terrestrial archive of Holocene environmental change. The taphon omy of peat is relatively simple, the range of evidence and proxies is wide, and dating methods have become more accurate and precise, such that the potential temporal resolution of records is high. Although long estab lished, the use of peatlands as archives of Holocene change has undergone phases of decline and resurgence. Here, the variable exploitation of the peat archive is explored, and recent developments in peatland science as applied to Holocene records are reviewed with reference to the collection of papers in this Special Issue of The Holocene, which are arranged in four key themes: (1) records of Holocene climatic change; (2) peatland dynamics; (3) carbon accumulation; and (4) implications for conservation and management. The changing acceptance of peatlands as archives of Holocene climatic change is attributed to developments in understanding of the peatland system and geographical differences in the history of Holocene research. Recent developments in biological and geochemical proxies combined with improvements in chronological techniques have resulted in renewed interest in peatland palaeoclimate records. Peatlands are an important global carbon pool and it is clear that climate has influenced the efficiency of long-term carbon sequestration by these systems. Climate has also had an impact on the biodiversity and condition of peatlands, which creates problems in discerning cause and effect in sites affected by human activities, and in targeting remedial management. It is concluded that particular strengths of the archive are the current diversity of peat-based palaeoenvironmental research and the potential for multiproxy analyses to be applied to a range of research issues. Mire-based investigations can complement research in other realms, and are deserving of greater attention from researchers of other archives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageographical variation 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apeat 3apeatlands 0aMires 0apeatland archives 0aproxy climate records 0acarbon cycling 0aclimatic change 0aenvironmental change 0aenvironmental management 0aHolocene1 aCharman, D.

Peat from the cold Younger Dryas (11050–9550 cal. bc) was well preserved despite low levels of precipitation. A particularly dry period, peaking at c. 7100 cal. bc, is indicated by well-decomposed peat. Peat from c. 6750–4250 cal. bc shows a low degree of decomposition, indicating a wet bog surface despite relatively warm temperatures and therefore indicating high levels of precipitation. A sharp transition to higher levels of decomposition c. 4450–3750 cal. bc indicates a major transition to a drier bog surface. Subsequently, peat humification generally decreases towards the end of the deeper profile (c. cal. ad 1050), indicating a gradual return to wetter conditions. This gradual decrease is punctuated by periods of particularly low humification which appear to be due to shifts to higher levels of effective precipitation from c. 2500 to 1350 cal. bc, c. 1050 to 550 cal. bc, centered around 150 cal. bc, and from c. cal. ad 550 onwards. Anthropogenic influences appear to have affected peat humification at the site at least since the Middle Ages. This study indicates that humification in colder regions/time periods could be more affected by temperature than precipitation and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abogs 3aclimate change 3acold 3acolorimetry 3ahumification 3apeat 3atemperature 0aPeatlands 0apeat humification 0adecomposition 0acolorimetry 0apalaeoclimate proxy 0aeffective precipitation 0aLateglacial 0aHolocene 0aSwitzerland1 avan der Knaap, W.

The current study offered a first report on preparation and performance of the magnetic and photocatalytic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-Ni-ZnO composite membranes for the antifouling purpose. Magnetic Ni–ZnO particles (NZPs) was firstly prepared via an in-situ reduction reaction. Thereafter, the NZPs were attracted onto a PVDF membrane surface through a magnetic force effect. The PVDF-NZPs composite membrane displayed magnetic property, photocatalytic property and obviously higher antifouling performance than that of bare PVDF membrane. Particularly, the flux recovery rates (FRR) of the optimal PVDF-NZPs membrane reached to 100%, 100%, 83% and 83% for filtration of humic acid (HA), sodium alginate (SA), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and yeast solutions, respectively, which are comparable or much better than most of the literature data. In addition, it was found that acid-based (AB) interaction of the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) results played the predominant role during the fouling process. The ultrahigh FRR of the modified PVDF-NZPs membrane mainly stemmed from its in-situ and persistent photocatalytic activities. The current work not only offered a novel membrane modification method, but also presented the modified membranes with enhanced performance for water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling activities 3aasymmetric membranes 3abovine serum albumin 3afiltration 3afouling 3ahumic acids 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3aphotocatalysis 3asodium alginate 3athermoplastics 3awater treatment 3ayeasts 0aComposite membrane 0aMagnetic property 0aPhotocatalytic property 0aMembrane fouling 0aXDLVO theory1 aShen, Liguo1 aLin, Hongjun1 aYu, Weiming1 aXu, Yanchao1 aLi, Renjie1 aSun, Tianyu1 aHe, Yiming0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 612 p.118378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1183783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173520187800303592002802181650002002209650002502229650002202254650002602276650001302302650001602315650001602331650001402347650001702361650002002378650001302398650001102411650001402422650002802436650001302464653002302477653002402500653001202524653001502536653002202551653001502573700005902588700001902647700002002666700006502686700002802751773010902779856008602888852000902974655001202983IND60749352020221122064013.0211227e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074935202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouphael, Youssef10aVegetal-protein hydrolysates based microgranule enhances growth, mineral content, and quality traits of vegetable transplants  aThe urgent need to increase sustainable crop production has pushed the agricultural sector towards methods based on natural products such as biostimulants. The nursery industry holds strategic importance for modern horticulture because only “high quality” seedlings can guarantee productive success. The aim of our research was to assess the effects of a microgranule plant-derived biostimulant added to the transplants’ substrate. Biometric parameters, mineral composition, total chlorophylls, carotenoids, and total phenols content of eggplant (Solanum melongena L., cv. Mirabelle F1), pepper (Capsicum annuum L., cv. Tarquinio F1), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv. Taylor F1) at four different biostimulant doses (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g L⁻¹) were evaluated. Compared to the untreated control, the use of the highest dose of microgranule biostimulant (4.0 g L⁻¹) increased shoot dry weight by 73%, 61%, and 33% and root dry weight by 37%, 34%, 36%, for eggplant, pepper, and tomato, respectively. Similarly, the nitrogen and potassium contents of eggplant, pepper, and tomato plants were positively affected by biostimulant application. Total chlorophylls content and carotenoids were significantly affected only in tomato leaves with the 2.0 and 4.0 g L⁻¹ doses while no significant differences for total phenols were recorded in transplant leaves of tested vegetable crops. Chlorophyll a/b decreased in eggplant and pepper with increasing microgranular-based PHs rates, indicating a greater accumulation of chlorophyll b than chlorophyll a. Our results show that microgranule biostimulant application directly mixed in the substrate can improve the quali-quantitative traits of nursery seedlings while reducing the excessive use of fertilizers and concomitantly producing vigorous seedlings potentially capable of overcoming easily transplant stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum melongena 3aagricultural industry 3abiometry 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aeggplants 3ahorticulture 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3apepper 3apotassium 3asustainable agriculture 3atomatoes 0aPlant biostimulant 0amineral composition 0anursery 0aSolanaceae 0aseedlings quality 0aSPAD index1 aColla, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3399-36221 aHoagland, Lori1 aGiordano, Maria1 aEl-Nakhel, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1200-28341 aCardarelli, Mariateresa0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 290 p.110554-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245014700167300001500314520131000329592002801639650001001667650001901677650001001696650001901706650001601725650001401741650001201755650003501767651000901802653001301811653001001824653001801834653003501852653001001887653000901897653001401906700001701920700002501937773012701962856007802089852000902167655001202176IND60130100720221120183207.0151127e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010072DNAL7 a10.2994/057.007.02122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiva, Ignacio de la,12aA New Species of Telmatobius (Anura: Telmatobiidae) from Montane Forests of Southern Peru, with a Review of Osteological Features of the Genus  ap. 91-109.  aWe describe a new species of Telmatobius from cloud forests in the valley of the Río Kosñipata in the Cordillera de Paucartambo, Región de Cusco, Peru, where it inhabits roadside ditches and forest streams. The new species is among the larger Telmatobius known. It has a short rostrum and exceedingly long jaw. Males have nuptial excrescences composed of minute, closely spaced spicules. Osteologically, the new species is distinguished by unusual ossification of the endocranium. The sphenethmoid is synostotically united with the prootic and the ossification/mineralization of the dorsal neurocranial roof eliminates the parietal fontanelles, leaving only a small frontal fontanelle. Osteological comparisons are made between the new species and the 24 other species of Telmatobius for which there is information available in the literature. Preliminary evidence suggests that the suspensory apparatus of Telmatobius may have a unique combination of features distinguishing it from that of other anurans. Superficially, the new species resembles members of the Telmatobius bolivianus Group, but its phylogenetic relationships are unknown. Many anurans in the area of the type locality have experienced severe declines, and the new species, not seen since 2007, is considered as Critically Endangered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3abone formation 3amales 3amineralization 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3astreams 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aPeru 0aAmphibia 0aAnura 0aTelmatobiidae 0aTelmatobius mendelsoni sp. nov 0aAndes 0aPeru 0aOsteology1 aTrueb, Linda1 aDuellman, William E.0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2012 Aug., v. 7, no. 2 p.91-109dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2F057.007.02123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009800162300001800260520038400278592002800662650001500690650001000705650001200715650001500727650001800742650001500760650002100775700001800796700002200814700003100836773012900867856007300996852000901069655001201078IND60657689620221119100119.0190816e20050718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065768962DNAL7 a10.1039/b504922a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedoryak, Olesya D.10aSynthesis of a caged glutamate for efficient one- and two-photon photorelease on living cells  ap. 3664-3666.  aWe have synthesized a biologically inert, photosensitive derivative of the major excitatory amino acid, l-glutamate (which we call MDNI-glu) that makes more efficient use of incident light than all other caged glutamates.

A case study in unfragmented montane forests  ap. 1167-1185.  aUnderstanding the processes that shape biodiversity patterns is essential for ecosystem management and conservation. Local environmental conditions are often good predictors of species distribution and variations in habitat quality usually positively correlate to species richness. However, beside habitat limitation, species presence-absence may be constrained by dispersal limitation. We tested the relative importance of both limitations on saproxylic beetle diversity, using forest continuity as a surrogate for dispersal limitation and stand maturity as a surrogate for habitat limitation. Forest continuity relies on the maintenance of a forest cover over time, while stand maturity results in the presence of old-growth habitat features. Forty montane beech-fir forests in the French pre-Alps were sampled, under a balanced sampling design in which forest continuity and stand maturity were crossed. A total of 307 saproxylic beetle species were captured using flight-interception traps and Winkler–Berlese extractors. We explored the response of low- versus high-dispersal species groups to forest continuity and stand maturity. Saproxylic beetle diversity increased significantly with stand maturity and was mostly influenced by variables related to deadwood diversity at the stand scale and suitable habitat availability at the landscape scale. Surprisingly, no evidence of dispersal limitation was found, as diversity patterns were not influenced by forest continuity and associated variables, even for low-dispersal species. Our study demonstrates that in an unfragmented forest landscape, saproxylic beetles are able to colonize recent forests, as long as local deadwood resources are sufficiently diversified (e.g. tree species, position, diameter and/or decay stage).  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3adead wood 3aecosystem management 3aenvironmental factors 3aextractors 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amontane forests 3aspecies diversity 3atraps 3atrees1 aCateau, Eugénie1 aFuhr, Marc1 aNusillard, Benoit1 aBrustel, Hervé1 aBouget, Christophe0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2016 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1167-1185dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1116-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010500170300001600275520161900291592002801910650001501938650001201953650001301965650002001978650001501998650002102013650001302034651000902047653001202056653001502068653003402083653001402117653001402131700002502145773010002170856008602270852000902356655001202365IND60538008820221122165628.0190412e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053800882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGara, Brian D.12aA candidate vegetation index of biological integrity based on species dominance and habitat fidelity  ap. 225-232.  aIndices of biological integrity of wetlands based on vascular plants (VIBIs) have been developed in many areas of the USA and are used in some states to make critical management decisions. An underlying concept of all VIBIs is that they respond negatively to disturbance. The Ohio VIBI (OVIBI) is calculated from 10 metrics, which are different for each wetland vegetation class. We present a candidate vegetation index of biotic integrity based on floristic quality (VIBI-FQ) that requires only two metrics to calculate an overall score regardless of vegetation class. These metrics focus equally on the critical ecosystem elements of diversity and dominance as related to a species’ degree of fidelity to habitat requirements. The indices were highly correlated but varied among vegetation classes. Both indices responded negatively with a published index of wetland disturbance in 261 Ohio wetlands. Unlike VIBI-FQ, however, errors in classifying wetland vegetation may lead to errors in calculating OVIBI scores. This is especially critical when assessing the ecological condition of rapidly developing ecosystems typically associated with wetland restoration and creation projects. Compared to OVIBI, the VIBI-FQ requires less field work, is much simpler to calculate and interpret, and can potentially be applied to all habitat types. This candidate index, which has been “standardized” across habitats, would make it easier to prioritize funding because it would score the “best” and “worst” of all habitats appropriately and allow for objective comparison across different vegetation classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3afunding 3ahabitats 3avascular plants 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3awetlands 3aOhio 0aWetland 0aVegetation 0aIndex of biological integrity 0aDiversity 0aDominance1 aStapanian, Martin A.0 tEcological indicators.g2015 Mar., v. 50 p.225-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245018500162300002000347520170300367592002802070650001102098650001102109650002102120650001102141650002502152650001502177650001702192650001902209650001102228653001902239653002002258653004302278653002602321653001902347700001902366700001502385700001602400700002002416700001802436700005702454700005502511700001602566773014202582856007902724852000902803655001202812IND60759903220221117161009.0211216e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075990322DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c182692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhiqiang10aCovalent Pinning of Highly Dispersed Ultrathin Metallic-Phase Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets on the Inner Surface of Mesoporous Carbon Spheres for Durable and Rapid Sodium Storage  ap. 58652-58664.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS₂@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS₂@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS₂ nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na⁺ storage, the M-MoS₂@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g–¹ at a high current density of 5 A g–¹. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–¹, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g–¹ with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g–¹, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g–¹ with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS₂@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3aporous media 3asemiconductors 3asodium 0ametallic phase 0aMoS2 nanosheets 0ainner surface of hollow carbon spheres 0acovalent interactions 0asodium storage1 aMao, Pengcheng1 aLiu, Chang1 aLan, Gongxu1 aAhmad, Mashkoor1 aZheng, Runguo1 aWang, Zhiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-05641 aSun, Hongyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5072-70191 aLiu, Yanguo0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Dec. 02, v. 13, no. 49 p.58652-58664dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c182693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014500164300001600309500001900325520169900344592002802043596005902071650001202130650001902142650001302161650001102174650002202185650001702207650001402224650001202238650000702250650001602257650000902273650001302282650002002295650001102315700001502326700001802341700001802359700001802377700002002395700001802415700001902433700001602452700005402468773012802522856008202650852000902732655001202741IND60688012720221120092111.0200407e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068801272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-020-04459-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen10aMagnesium alleviates aluminum toxicity by promoting polar auxin transport and distribution and root alkalization in the root apex in populus  ap. 565-585.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: Populus can tolerant high concentration Al stress. However, the mechanisms of Mg alleviation to Al toxicity in populus remain unknown. METHODS: In the present study, adequate Mg was supplied to poplar under high concentration Al toxicity stress, and the pH gradients of root surface, Mg and Al uptake from root apex were detected using electrophysiological analysis, fluorescence staining, etc. Furthermore, auxin distribution and transport dynamic kinetics in root tips were also detected. RESULTS: In the present study, we found that adequate supply of Mg alleviated high concentration Al toxicity to populus root growth. Mg promoted the pH gradients of root surface in populus, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone, which prevented Al toxicity to root elongation. The auxin distribution in root tips of populus was detected using DR5:GFP reporter. The transport and distribution of polar auxin in root transition zone were inhibited by Al toxicity, but partially alleviated by Mg supply. Further electrophysiological experiments using auxin transporter mutant pin-formed 2 (pin2) showed that Mg alleviated Al toxicity by PIN2-based polar auxin transport, which regulated root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Transcriptomic analysis and yeast complementation experiments using mrs2 mutants also reveals same relationships among Mg, auxin and Al. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that Mg promotes polar auxin transport and distribution, which leads to the elevated root surface pH regulation, and further alleviates the Al toxicity. Our results partially clarify the mechanism of Mg in alleviating the toxicity of high concentration Al in woody plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870587cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus 3aalkalinization 3aaluminum 3aauxins 3aelectrophysiology 3afluorescence 3amagnesium 3amutants 3apH 3aroot growth 3asoil 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 3ayeasts1 aLiu, Dunyi1 aMeng, Hongjun1 aLi, Shengting1 aWang, Shufeng1 aXiao, Zhongchun1 aSun, Juanjuan1 aChang, Longran1 aLuo, Keming1 aLi, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6592-76220 tPlant and soil.g2020 Mar., v. 448, no. 1-2 p.565-585dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04459-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04116naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245019300171300001600364520233500380592002802715650001502743650001202758650002102770650001802791650001102809650000902820650001802829650001802847650001402865650001402879650001402893650001502907650001402922650001502936650002602951650002902977650001503006650001503021650002403036650001203060650001203072650001603084650000903100653003703109653002203146653003103168653003703199700002203236700002103258700001903279700002203298700002003320773007903340856008603419852000903505655001203514IND60539381320221117090550.0160815e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053938132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVašát, Radim10aConsideration of peak parameters derived from continuum-removed spectra to predict extractable nutrients in soils with visible and near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR-DRS)  ap. 208-218.  aVisible and near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR-DRS) provides a rapid and inexpensive tool for simultaneous prediction of a variety of different soil properties. Usually, some sophisticated multivariate mathematical or statistical methods are employed in order to extract the required information from the raw spectrum scan. For this purpose especially the partial least squares regression (PLSR) is the most frequently used algorithm. This method generally benefits from complexity, with which the soil spectra are treated. But interestingly, also techniques which focus on only one specific spectral feature, such as simple linear regression dealing with single continuum-removed spectra (CRS) value at selected wavelength, can often provide competitive results too. Such methods rely on known spectral signature of spectrally active soil components. In this study focusing on laboratory soil spectroscopy, we attempted to enhance the potential of CRS by taking into account all possible peaks as derived from CRS and relating their basic parameters, i.e. area, width and depth to soil properties employing the multiple linear regression (MLR) technique. On top of that comparison to PLSR was performed to evaluate the ability of the presented method. Nine measured soil properties on total 97 topsoil samples, were Mehlich 3 extractable elements Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn and soil pH in CaCl2 extract. In seven cases (Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn, P, Zn and pH), of which three (Ca, Cu and Zn) were predicted reliably accurately (0.50<R2cv<0.80) and the rest four (Fe, Mn, P and pH) only poorly (R2cv<0.50), better results (the differences in R2cv up to 0.1) were obtained with the presented methodology compared against PLSR. For K and Mg, it was clear that K was predicted accurately while the prediction of Mg was not satisfactory, slightly better results (the differences in R2cv were 0.02 and 0.05, respectively) were achieved with PLSR against the presented method. We further concluded that content of clay, soil organic matter (SOM), and soil color were the main driving forces behind the prediction using soil spectroscopy in this particular case. The study indicated that MLR based on CRS peak parameters could be an alternative method in quantitative prediction of different soil properties using VNIR-DRS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aclay fraction 3acopper 3airon 3aleast squares 3alinear models 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil color 3asoil depth 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3awavelengths 3azinc 0aDiffuse reflectance spectroscopy 0aContinuum-removal 0aMultiple linear regression 0aPartial least squares regression1 aKodešová, Radka1 aBorůvka, Luboš1 aKlement, Aleš1 aJakšík, Ondřej1 aGholizadeh, Asa0 tGeoderma.g2014 Nov., v. 232-234 p.208-218dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04507naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171300001600265520325400281592002803535650002203563650001203585650002203597650000903619650000903628650000903637650001403646650001303660650001703673650000903690650001603699650002103715650001603736700002503752700002003777700001903797700001903816700001903835773009003854856008503944990002304029852000904052655001204061IND60093621020221120131036.0141103e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009362102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuadros, Javier10aCrystal-chemistry of interstratified Mg/Fe-clay minerals from seafloor hydrothermal sites  ap. 142-158.  aSeafloor hydrothermal sites generate abundant Mg- and Fe-rich clays. These clays are structurally and compositionally interesting because these environments are characterized by large, dynamic temperature and chemical gradients in their deposition environment, which promote the formation of chemically and structurally complex clays, including interstratified phases. The system is also interesting as a proxy for the study of the large Mg- and Fe-rich phyllosilicate deposits on Mars, which are broadly characterized as smectitic clay of hydrothermal, volcanic or sedimentary origin. Thirty submarine samples and four terrestrial ones, for comparison, were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), mid-IR and Mössbauer spectroscopies and chemical analysis. The samples include nontronite and the mixed-layer phases glauconite–nontronite, talc–nontronite and talc–saponite. Some of the talc–saponite samples have Fe contents well above those typical for these Mg-rich, trioctahedral phases (up to 1.69 Fe per O₁₀[OH]₂, in the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets). Tetrahedral Fe ranges from 0 to 0.66atoms per O₁₀[OH]₂ across the samples. As found in previous studies of similar specimens, Fe promotes the retention of molecular water that is released upon heating above 200C, and is mainly emplaced in non-expandable layers (talc and glauconite layers). In talc–nontronite and talc–saponite octahedral Fe (both di- and trivalent) appears to be bound to this trapped molecular water, whereas in glauconite–nontronite the bond appears to be with tetrahedral Fe. Samples typically show more than one dehydroxylation event in the TG analysis. The weight loss at each dehydroxylation event is broadly consistent with the proportion of individual layers as determined by means of XRD, but there is no good correlation between both. By contrast, the weight loss at each dehydroxylation event correlates with the chemistry of the layers, where certain cations promote chemical domains in the octahedral sheet (e.g., trioctahedral, nontronite-like, and montmorillonite-like) that dehydroxylate at the several temperatures. The correlations found for talc–nontronite and glauconite–nontronite samples suggest that the distribution of cations in the octahedral sheets of most, but not all, samples is intermediate between total dispersion and total segregation, perhaps random. The talc–nontronite samples have talc layers with cation-deficient octahedral sheets. The above results are best explained by layers of polar character, where the octahedral sheets are composed of domains with different chemical characteristics corresponding to the two types of layers in the interstratified clay. The existence of molecular water (bands at 1635 and 3300–3500cm⁻¹, or ~6.1 and 2.9–3.1μm, respectively) bound in non-expanding layers is relevant to the mineral characterization of Martian Fe-rich clays with spectroscopic methods, where molecular water is so far assumed to be linked to smectite. The variety of mixed-layer clays in which Fe is found in the submarine samples suggests that mixed-layering may be important in Martian clays, which are spectroscopically variable but generally Fe-rich.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acations 3achemical analysis 3aclay 3aheat 3airon 3amagnesium 3asmectite 3aspectroscopy 3atalc 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss1 aMichalski, Joseph R.1 aDekov, Vesselin1 aBishop, Janice1 aFiore, Saverio1 aDyar, M.

Introducing preloads on the reinforcing elements allows us to maximize the high performance of CFRPs, besides recovering deformations. A new technique to perform the pre-stressing of CFRP bars in NSM configuration is described in this paper. The technique introduces the preload on the rods after they have been placed in the grooves, and with a system that acts and reacts against the beam itself. We also present the results of a testing campaign conducted to determine the effectiveness of said technique. Breakage of the control beams (without reinforcement) was ductile, while breakage of reinforced beams was explosive. Pre-stressing the reinforcing elements allowed us to increase the bearing capacity of the beams 170% compared to the control beams, also resulting in an increase in the rigidity of the reinforced elements and a decreased cracking of the beam. The results however are only slightly better than those of a conventional CFRP NSM reinforcement, due to the appearance of cavities in the groove where the adhesive didn&rsquo;t manage to penetrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acivil engineering 3acracking 3adeformation 3apolymers1 aGarcía del Toro, Eva  M.1 aMás-López, M.

However, the combination of geophysical sensing and pedometrical techniques to produce soil property maps is complex and requires a well-structured design, from the initial steps of data collection right through to final model validation. In this study, we compare different sampling design strategies – an extension of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, fuzzy k-means sampling and response surface sampling – as a basis for predicting soil texture, soil organic carbon and soil pH-value at two soil depth intervals using electromagnetic induction (EM38DD and EM31) and gamma spectroscopy (U, K, Th) data. Two different sample set sizes, two different regression approaches (multiple linear least squares and random forests), as well as several resampling and independent validation approaches are compared. In addition to these real-world datasets, we also compared the investigated methods for two comparable simulated datasets.Our accuracy estimation results reveal that an optimal combination of Latin hypercube sampling and random forest regression should be adopted. This is the case for both the real world examples as well as the two synthetic datasets. The analysis conducted indicates that this stems from optimized spread within the state space of the sensors.Iterative LHS subsampling with increasing sample set sizes may potentially be a successful approach for incrementally analyzing and validating the model and thus can help reduce laboratory costs when a certain desired accuracy level is achieved.Comparison between the different validation approaches reveals their complexity and highlights the necessity for adequate independent validation approaches. However, based on the findings of our study, we recommend ‘leave-group-out’ cross-validation and ‘.632 bootstrapping’ as the best estimates to use.Finally, this study shows that there are complex interactions between sampling design, regression approaches and validation approaches, which can greatly influence the final soil property maps and their accuracy estimates.Future work should focus on detailed analysis of Latin hypercube sampling and why it outperformed the other approaches. Therefore, comparisons with other sampling approaches should be conducted, as well as specific ‘sampling-for-validation’ approaches. Therefore we provide the simulated datasets as Supplementary reference material for future comparative analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3aleast squares 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3asampling 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil texture 3aspectroscopy 0aWeighted Latin hypercube sampling 0aFuzzy k-means sampling 0aResponse surface sampling 0aSoil sensing 0aRandom forest regression1 aBehrens, T.1 aDaumann, J.1 aRamirez-Lopez, L.1 aWerban, U.1 aDietrich, P.1 aScholten, T.0 tGeoderma.g2014 Nov., v. 232-234 p.243-256dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170300001600260520209500276592002802371650002502399650001702424650002602441650002702467650001202494650001002506650001102516650001302527650002202540650001402562650001202576650002802588651001002616653002802626653002702654653002402681653001702705653002302722653001002745700001502755700001602770773010002786856008602886852000902972655001202981IND60538009020221122062723.0190412e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053800902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaohong10aAssessment of sustainable development: A case study of Wuhan as a pilot city in China  ap. 206-214.  aBuilding resource-conserving and environmental-friendly society (referred to as “two-oriented society”, TOS) is an important way proposed by the Chinese government to achieve sustainable development.

Treating the indicators of TOS as multi-dimensional vectors, this paper proposes a methodological framework by integrating the methods of vector angle and Euclidean distance to measure the angle and distance between the vector of annual status of TOS and the vector of planning target of TOS. Based on this, the paper employs coordination (the angle between the two vectors) and effectiveness (the distance between the two vectors) to describe the performance of TOS and its subsystems, including economic development (ED), social and people's well-being (SW), resource consumption (RC), resource recycling (RR), environmental quality (EQ) and pollution control (PC). Moreover, grey relational analysis approach is used to analyse the core factors influencing TOS construction. Results reveal that the performance of TOS in Wuhan is continually improved in the study period while the performance of its subsystems shows several differences: (1) both coordination and effectiveness of TOS, ED and SW keep on improving, while those of EQ fluctuate; (2) the effectiveness of both RR and PC shows a downward trend while the coordination of them fluctuates; (3) the actual value of RC indicators reaches the planning targets. Based on the analysis of determinants, we suggest that strengthening technological ability and adding investment are extremely important to improve the performance of RC and PC. For the sake of improving RR, it is critical to provide more government public expenditure and encourage financial institutions to provide more loans to stimulate and support the businesses. Moreover, increasing the amount of R&D funding and maintaining steady external economic environment are proved to be effective to improve all subsystems of TOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aenvironmental quality 3afinancial institutions 3afunding 3aloans 3apeople 3aplanning 3apollution control 3arecycling 3asociety 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aSustainable development 0aEnvironmental friendly 0aResource conserving 0aVector angle 0aEuclidean distance 0aChina1 aLiu, Xiang1 aHu, Dongbin0 tEcological indicators.g2015 Mar., v. 50 p.206-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245006800167300001600235520130000251592002801551650001901579650001501598650000901613650001001622650001301632653001501645653001301660653001601673653002201689653001601711773012401727856008601851852000901937655001201946IND60694392620221120192755.0200513e19980101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069439262DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.1998.111009782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoyke, J.,10aSize change of Apis mellifera eggs during the incubation period  ap. 239-246.  aNine queen honey bees (Apis mellifera) were restricted for 4 h 30 min under a queen-excluder cap on an empty comb in the centre of the broodnest. 25 eggs were removed from each comb and their length and width were measured, as well as the length of the embryo. The egg removal and measurements were repeated every 7 h 30 min. In total, 2475 eggs were measured, on which 7425 measurements were made. In addition, groups of 25 eggs were weighed in four determined periods. Results showed that the length, width and volume of eggs 7 h 30 min-12 h old reduced to 98%, 98% and 94% of their initial dimensions, respectively Eggs 15–19 h 30 min old increased the three dimensions to 99%, 98% and 96%, respectively Next the eggs decreased to 91 %, 90% and 73% at the age of 52 h 30 min-57 h. Subsequently a peculiar phenomenon occurred, namely the eggs increased to 93%, 92% and 78% at the time of hatching. The embryo changed its length similarly to the egg. The correlation coefficient between the length of embryo and egg was r = 0.92. The weight of eggs decreased continuously to 65% of their initial value at the hatching time. Thus, the eggs change their size and weight during the whole incubation period. It is suggested that the size and weight changes of eggs are due to metabolic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aapiculture 3aeggs 3ahoney 3aresearch 0ahoney bees 0aegg size 0aembryo size 0aincubation period 0adevelopment0 tJournal of apicultural research.g1998 Jan. 1, v. 37, no. 4 p.239-246dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.1998.111009783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167520151500271592002801786650002401814650002501838650002301863650001101886650002401897650003301921650000901954650001801963650001401981650001701995650001302012650001702025650001402042650001302056653002102069653002302090653001302113653001502126700001802141700001702159700005402176773011202230856008502342852000902427655001202436IND60694054120221122120056.0210401e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069405412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanjie10aRoom-temperature swelling of block copolymers for nanoporous membranes with well-defined porosities  aSelective swelling of block copolymers (BCPs) has been an efficient way to produce nanoporous materials with well-defined porosities. Currently, the cavitation of bulk BCP films by selective swelling needs to be performed at elevated temperatures (typically 50–70 °C), which is not only tedious in operation but also energy extensive. Herein, we develop the room-temperature (RT) swelling strategy to enable pore formation in BCP films with no need of heating. Simply introducing a solvent selective to the majority blocks of BCPs into the swelling bath allows the initiation of selective swelling-induced pore generation at room temperature because of plasticizing effect on BCP matrix. The swelling degrees and porosities of BCP films can be flexibly tuned by changing the compositions of the swelling bath and the swelling durations. The universality of this RT swelling strategy is also demonstrated by its applicability to both polystyrene (PS)-based BCPs and polysulfone-based BCPs with high glass transition temperatures. We prepare composite membranes with nanoporous polystyrene-block-poly (2-vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) selective layers on top of macroporous substrates by using this RT swelling approach. Interestingly, thus-produced membranes exhibit more uniform pores with narrow pore size distributions, resulting in better selectivity. RT swelling is featured as convenient and energy-saving, and is desired in large-scale manufacturing of nanoporous BCP materials for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aasymmetric membranes 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3amanufacturing 3ananopores 3apolystyrenes 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apyridines 3asolvents 0aBlock copolymers 0aSelective swelling 0aMembrane 0aCavitation1 aZhang, Chenxu1 aZhou, Jiemei1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8653-514X0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 608 p.118186-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1181863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245014700200300002000347520166100367592002802028650001602056650001302072650002402085650001302109650001702122650001702139650001302156650000902169650001202178650001402190650001902204650001602223650001202239650001302251650002202264653001802286653001802304653001602322653002202338653002002360700001402380700001302394700005802407700005602465773014202521856007902663852000902742655001202751IND60759903620221117161047.0211216e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075990362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c184012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Huiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3000-810210aPolyphenol-Metal Ion Redox-Induced Gelation System for Constructing Plant Protein Adhesives with Excellent Fluidity and Cold-Pressing Adhesion  ap. 59527-59537.  aSoy protein (SP) adhesives can resolve several problems with aldehyde-based adhesives, including formaldehyde release and excessive dependence on petroleum-based materials. Nevertheless, their development is hindered by the lack of balance between fluidity and high cold-pressing adhesive strength. A dynamically cross-linked SP adhesive with excellent fluidity and cold-pressing adhesion was developed in this study based on the polyphenol-metal ion redox-induced gelation system. SP was blended with acrylamide (AM), ammonium persulfate (APS), and the tannic acid (TA)–Fe³⁺ complex to prepare an adhesive gel precursor with good fluidity. In situ gelation of SP adhesive was then achieved via AM polymerization, as initiated by redox between TA and Fe³⁺. As expected, the prepared adhesive gel exhibited outstanding cold-pressing bonding strength (650 kPa) to the veneers compared to the neat SP adhesive, which has almost no cold-pressing bonding strength to the veneers. The TA–Fe³⁺ complex induced an in situ gelation system, which endowed the SP adhesive with strong cohesion; the topological entanglement of the adhesive gel in the veneers contributed to tight interfacial combinations. The TA–Fe³⁺ complex served not only as an accelerator of SP adhesive gelation but also as a “cross-linking core” for the cross-link SP adhesive system. The prepared SP-based adhesive also exhibited outstanding hot-pressing bonding strength and mildew resistance. The proposed polyphenol-metal ion-induced in situ gelation strategy may provide a new approach for developing advanced vegetable protein adhesives to replace aldehyde adhesives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aadhesion 3aammonium persulfate 3acohesion 3acrosslinking 3aformaldehyde 3agelation 3agels 3amildews 3apetroleum 3apolymerization 3asoy protein 3atannins 3atopology 3avegetable protein 0aplant protein 0awood adhesive 0atannic acid 0aadhesive hydrogel 0aMussel-inspired1 aYan, Qian1 aMa, Chao1 aZhang, Shifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1767-20411 aGao, Zhenhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9301-84260 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 49 p.59527-59537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c184013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04356naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018500168300001600353520294700369592002803316650001203344650001103356650001903367650001303386650001903399650000903418650001903427650001303446650001203459650001103471650001003482650001303492650002003505650001103525650001603536651001403552651003003566651001703596700001903613700001903632700002003651773008603671856008503757990002303842852000903865655001203874IND60093621420221120165146.0141103e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009362142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConliffe, J.10aPaleoproterozoic Mississippi Valley Type Pb–Zn mineralization in the Ramah Group, Northern Labrador: Stable isotope, fluid inclusion and quantitative fluid inclusion gas analyses  ap. 211-223.  aMississippi Valley Type (MVT) Pb–Zn sulfide mineralization is common in Phanerozoic rocks but relatively few MVT deposits have been reported from Paleoproterozoic rocks. This study investigates the genesis of numerous Pb–Zn showings in the ca.2.0Ga Ramah Group, northern Labrador. Pb–Zn mineralization is hosted within the Reddick Bight Dolomite Member (RBDM), Ramah Group. The RBDM is characterized by a well developed secondary porosity associated with solution dissolution of tepee structures in the dolomite. Mineralization occurs as open fill in this secondary porosity, with dark-brown sphalerite, galena and pyrite with gangue quartz, dolomite, calcite and feldspar. The presence of blocks of mineralized RBDM in thrust faults indicates that mineralization predates propagation of these faults during the Torngat Orogeny from 1.85 to 1.87Ma. Fluid inclusion analysis of sphalerite has identified H₂O–NaCl–CaCl₂+CO₂±N₂±CH₄ mineralizing fluids with high salinities (up to 19.4eq.wt.% NaCl+CaCl₂) and homogenization temperatures of 104 to 177°C. The presence of significant volatiles in the mineralizing fluids has been confirmed through quantitative fluid inclusion gas analysis of sphalerite, which has recorded 5.9mol% CO₂. Fluid inclusion data from quartz suggests high temperature (135 to 231°C), high salinity (up to 20.5eq.wt.% NaCl+CaCl₂) fluids with significant volatile contents (quantitative fluid inclusion gas analysis up to 21.5mol% CO₂). Carbon isotope data show a decrease in δ¹³C from host dolomite (−1.3±0.9‰) through pre-ore dolomite (−4.7±1.5‰) to post-ore calcite (−5±1.7‰), indicating an influx of isotopically light hydrocarbon-bearing fluids. The δ³⁴S isotopic ratios range from 8.3 to 11.1‰ for early pyrite mineralization, 23.3 to 31.8‰ for late stage pyrite, 16.7 to 32.9‰ for galena and 23.2 to 33.8‰ for sphalerite. The relatively high δ³⁴S values associated with Pb–Zn mineralization, high fluid temperatures (>175°C) and presence of CO₂ fluids indicate ore deposition was associated with thermochemical sulfate reduction. Pb isotope data from galena separates suggests that the Pb was derived from a relatively non-radiogenic source consistent with the Archean basement rocks of the Nain Province. The Pb–Zn mineralization in the RBDM shares many features with classic MVT deposits including geological setting, mineralogy, fluid characteristics and crustal sources for both metals and sulfur. However, MVT mineralization in the RBDM is unusual when compared with Phanerozoic MVT deposits, with elevated fluid temperatures, high CO₂ contents of mineralizing fluids and minimum trapping pressures for fluid inclusions corresponding to mineralization depths of >4.5km. Similar characteristics have been described from other Paleoproterozoic MVT deposits (e.g. Pering Zn–Pb deposit, South Africa, Kamarga Pb–Zn deposit, Australia).  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adolomite 3ahomogenization 3alead 3amineralization 3aporosity 3apyrites 3aquartz 3arocks 3asalinity 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aAustralia 3aNewfoundland and Labrador 3aSouth Africa1 aWilton, D.H.C.1 aBlamey, N.J.F.1 aArchibald, S.M.0 tChemical geology.g2013 Dec. 20, v. 362 p.211-223dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013500169300001800304520171800322592002802040596007502068596007502143596005902218650003102277650001802308650001102326650001202337650002202349650001502371650002302386650003002409650002502439650001302464650001102477651001802488651001902506651001002525651001202535651001802547651001602565700005902581700001602640773013502656856008102791852000902872655001202881IND60654234420221121032249.0190724e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065423442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-018-2703-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Yuanhuang10aPredicting wintertime windy days in Beijing with the preceding autumn sea surface temperature and large-scale circulation patterns  ap. 1801-1809.  aIn this study, we investigate the role of sea surface temperature and large-scale circulation patterns in the preceding autumn for the prediction of wintertime windy days in Beijing during the period of 1979–2016, based on a time-scale decomposition approach. A windy day is defined according to the threshold of 2 m·s⁻¹, which can effectively remove or reduce air pollution of Beijing. Wintertime windy days in Beijing, preceding autumn sea surface temperature and large-scale climate indices are separated into the interannual and interdecadal components. For the interannual component, the preceding autumn sea surface temperature in central western Pacific Ocean, Polar/Eurasia pattern, and Scandinavia pattern are identified as predictors of wintertime windy days in Beijing. For the interdecadal component, the identified predictors include the preceding autumn sea surface temperature in northeastern part of North Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation. We develop statistical models for the interannual and interdecadal components based on these preceding autumn predictors, and take them together to predict wintertime windy days in Beijing. The leave-one-out cross-validation for 1979–2016 time series shows that 76% of the total variance of observed wintertime windy days in Beijing can be predicted. Hindcast experiments for the period of 1999–2016 also yield the high prediction skills. The physical mechanisms responsible for links between these predictors and wintertime windy days in Beijing are also discussed. The statistical models proposed herein are expected to be applied to and aid to improve seasonal forecasting of wintertime windy days in Beijing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFA0606501cNational Key Research and Development Program of china  a2017YFA0603601cNational Key Research and Development Program of china  a41675085cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aair pollution 3aautumn 3aclimate 3apollution control 3aprediction 3astatistical models 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aChina 3aEurasia 3aPacific Ocean 3aScandinavia1 aZhang, Jingyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1056-84361 aWu, Lingyun0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Aug., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.1801-1809dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2703-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245014300207300001600350520156900366592002801935650001901963650001901982650001102001650001902012650002202031650001302053650001402066650001302080650002102093650001502114650002402129650002102153650001202174650002302186650001102209651001002220653002502230653003002255653001102285653001802296653001502314700001602329700001602345700001502361773007902376856008602455852000902541655001202550IND60539381720221117085730.0160815e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053938172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Genxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3403-098310aImpacts of surface soil organic content on the soil thermal dynamics of alpine meadows in permafrost regions: data from field observations  ap. 414-425.  aThe relationship between soil organic matter and soil temperature plays an important role in our understanding of the effect of climate change on the hydrological and carbon cycles in permafrost regions.

Based on the data obtained from more than 23 observation sites, the relationship between soil organic content and soil temperature dynamics in different seasons was determined. The findings indicate a strong positive exponential (in thawing period) and linear (in freezing period) relationship between surface soil organic content (SOC) and soil temperature dynamics in deep soil layers. The higher SOC at the surface soil layer is associated with a lower rate of soil temperature variation and a later onset time for the thaw–freeze transformation. In permafrost regions of the QTP, the greater lapse rate of soil temperature per 100m of increased elevation resulted in more significant modification of the SOC and soil thermal relationship in alpine meadows than that in tundra and boreal ecosystems. The coupled soil organic matter, soil thermal and water relationships play an important role in the resilience of permafrost during climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aforest ecosystems 3afreezing 3ahydrology 3alatitude 3aorganic horizons 3apermafrost 3asoil organic matter 3asoil temperature 3athawing 3athermal properties 3atundra 3aChina 0aSoil organic content 0aSoil temperature dynamics 0aImpact 0aAlpine meadow 0aPermafrost1 aMao, Tianxu1 aChang, Juan1 aDu, Jizeng0 tGeoderma.g2014 Nov., v. 232-234 p.414-425dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012600164520175200290592002802042650001102070650001202081650002202093650002102115650001802136650001102154650001102165650001502176650001502191650002602206650000902232650002602241650001202267650002802279650002202307650001602329651001202345651001002357651001402367700001802381700003002399700001902429773012702448856007402575852000902649655001202658IND60652836420221119164641.0190713e20190306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065283642DNAL7 a10.3390/su110513782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiehl, Jessica Ann,10aHousehold Food Consumption Patterns and Food Security among Low-Income Migrant Urban Farmers in Delhi, Jakarta, and Quito  aAs growing populations in urban areas demand greater food supplies, the poor&mdash;particularly poor migrants&mdash;may be at higher risk for food insecurity. Evidence suggests that the urban poor who pursue agriculture in the city as a livelihood are more food secure. Thus, it could be assumed that migrants involved in urban agriculture are also in a better position to meet nutritional needs. The aim of this research was to explore household food security among migrant urban farmers using data from studies conducted in three rapidly urbanizing cities: Delhi, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and, Quito, Ecuador. Surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted with market-oriented small-to-medium scale farmers in each city to understand livelihood and migrant status, household food consumption patterns, and food security. In general, we found that participation in urban agriculture had a positive impact on household food security among participants through direct (self-consumption) and indirect (improved income, improved access) means. Although each case city expressed a different form of low-income migrant practice of urban agriculture, findings suggest that growing food in the city offers some protection against food insecurity through improved quantity, quality, and diversity of food options. This study is particularly relevant in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. These factors guide development goals and priorities. Given that rural-urban migrant trends are predicted to continue, this exploratory study offers empirical evidence related to rural-urban migrants, food security, and urban agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3afarmers 3afood availability 3afood consumption 3afood security 3ahunger 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3anutrient requirements 3arisk 3arural urban migration 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aEcuador 3aIndia 3aIndonesia1 aOviatt, Kate 1 aChandra, Amanda  Jennifer1 aHarpreet Kaur,0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 06, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110513783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012500161300002000286520198300306592002802289650001502317650002202332650003302354650001402387650002002401650002202421650002202443653001502465653002002480653001202500653002402512653004002536653000902576700001702585700001702602700001702619700001602636700001702652700001502669700001602684700001802700773012602718856008002844852000902924655001202933IND60577457920221119014206.0170809e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057745792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b048592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shaojie10aStructure–Property Study on Two New D–A Type Materials Comprising Pyridazine Moiety and the OLED Application as Host  ap. 26242-26251.  aIn this paper, two new pyridazine based donor–acceptor type materials, i.e., 3CzPyaPy: 9,9′-(3-(6-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyridazin-3-yl)pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(9H-carbazole) and 4CzPyPyaPy: 3,6-bis(2,6-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyridin-3-yl)pyridazine, were synthesized with high yields. These two materials exhibited strong absorption/emission with high molar extinction coefficients and moderate photoluminescence quantum yield. The glass transition temperature of 3CzPyaPy was detected to be as high as 131 °C, showing its high thermal stability. Although the absorption energies and oxidation/reduction behaviors of the two materials were similar, the emission from 4CzPyPyaPy with longer effective-conjugation length presented hypsochromic shift both in films and in dilute solutions, contradicting to the common sense. The single crystal structure study disclosed their different space stretching and packing: 3CzPyaPy was twisted in larger angles and adopted dimerlike packing, while 4CzPyPyaPy showed smaller torsion angles and exhibited slipped herringbone packing. The dimerlike packing in 3CzPyaPy is responsible for its bathochromic shift of emission in solid state, while its unsymmetrical molecular structure accounts for that in solution. We believe that the unsymmetrical molecular structure of 3CzPyaPy is partially responsible for its high thermal-stability and also responsible for its HOMO dispersion which renders it slightly more difficult to oxidize. 3CzPyaPy was proved to be a bipolar-transport material and when served as a phosphor host, a green phosphorescent device achieved maximum efficiencies of 54.0 cd A–¹, 42.4 lm W–¹, and 17.7%, which are among the best with nonoptimized device structure, demonstrating its great potential for optoelectronic application. Furthermore, the new synthesized pyridazine derivatives and the corresponding structural and molecular-packing influences on material properties give a new insight into molecule tailoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystal structure 3aglass transition temperature 3aoxidation 3aphosphorescence 3aphotoluminescence 3athermal stability 0apyridazine 0aD−A materials 0abipolar 0aorganic electronics 0aorganic light-emitting diode (OLED) 0ahost1 aZhang, Xunlu1 aOu, Changjin1 aWang, Shulei1 aYang, Xinli1 aZhou, Xinhui1 aMi, Baoxiu1 aCao, Dapeng1 aGao, Zhiqiang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 9, no. 31 p.26242-26251dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b048593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008700169300001800256520128000274592002801554650001101582650001401593650001901607650005001626650000901676650001301685650002301698650001501721651000901736700002301745700002601768773013501794856008101929852000902010655001202019IND60654234720221121055346.0190724e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065423472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-018-2690-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemifar, Elham10aSpatiotemporal analysis of snow cover in Iran based on topographic characteristics  ap. 1855-1867.  aThis study investigates the distribution of snow cover in Iran using the 8-day moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product (MOD10A2) during 2001–2015. The year 2008 was found to have the most extensive snow cover and was used to determine the snow-covered areas into five regions based on topographic characteristics (elevation, slope, and aspect). Our results show that the mean snow cover extent (SCE) on the slopes higher than 20° is greater (62.94% on average) than on the slopes lower than 20° (55.28% on average). The highest and lowest SCEs are related to the north-facing aspect and flat-surface regions, respectively. In addition, a direct relationship between SCE and elevation was revealed, with snow cover reaching 100% in the highlands (above 3000 m). The highest values of the mean (171,905.1 km² in slope1 from region 3), standard deviation (SD) (70,856.53 km² in slope 1 from region 3), and coefficient of variation (CV) (214.65% in region 1) of SCE were obtained from 17 to 24 January, 9 to 16 January, and 10 to 17 February, respectively. The SD peaked in the early 8 days and then decreased in the middle and ending 8 days. The highest CV was obtained in the Caspian coastal region and decreased with increasing elevation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3ahighlands 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asnow 3asnowpack 3astandard deviation 3atopography 3aIran1 aMohammadi, Chenour1 aFarajzadeh, Manuchehr0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Aug., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.1855-1867dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2690-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012900175300001600304520124600320592002801566650002801594650003001622650001501652650001201667650001301679650001401692653002801706653001501734653002401749653001201773653001201785653001101797653001601808653001801824653002301842653002201865700001901887773012601906856008602032852000902118655001202127IND60694394720221120213833.0200513e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069439472DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.1999.111010042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWossler, Theresa C10aMass spectral identification of the tergal gland secretions of female castes of two African honey bee races (Apis mellifera)  ap. 137-148.  aThe tergal gland secretions in queens, workers and pseudoqueens of Apis mellifera capensis and Apis mellifera scutellata are composed of long-chain fatty acids, long-chain esters and a linear series of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The cuticular extracts, on the other hand, consisted of a linear series (C₂₃-C₃₁) of saturated hydrocarbons and were shown to be identical for both A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata queens and workers. The major compound in the tergal gland secretion for all test groups, was (Z)-9- octadecenoic acid. Virgin queens are distinguishable from mated queens (P = 0.0001) and workers (P = 0.0001) in that they secrete a series of long-chain esters, the predominant ester being decyl decanoate. A. m. capensis workers differed significantly (P = 0.0001) from A. m. capensis mated queens, as did pseudoqueens (P = 0.001), in their tergal gland secretion profiles. Significant inter-racial differences were found between the tergal gland secretions of mated queens (P = 0.0001) and workers (P = 0.001) from the two contiguous African races, but not between the virgin queens (P = 0.39). Consequently, mated queens and workers of these two African races can be separated on their tergal gland secretion profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera capensis 3aApis mellifera scutellata 3aapiculture 3afemales 3aresearch 3asecretion 0atergal gland secretions 0apheromones 0a9-octadecenoic acid 0aalkanes 0aalkenes 0aesters 0afatty acids 0afemale castes 0agas chromatography 0amass spectrometry1 aCrewe, Robin M0 tJournal of apicultural research.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 38, no. 3-4 p.137-148dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.1999.111010043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012800208300001600336500001900352520141400371592002801785596004001813650001301853650001201866650001101878650002701889650001101916650000901927650001101936650001101947650001101958650001901969650001501988650001102003650001202014650001202026700002302038700001902061700002502080700001902105700001802124700001902142700001902161700001902180700002402199700002102223700001902244700002802263700002102291700002602312700001902338700002002357700001902377773012802396856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60688013420221122102657.0200407e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068801342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04418-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPošćić, Filip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6642-153210aAccumulation and partitioning of rare earth elements in olive trees and extra virgin olive oil from Adriatic coastal region  ap. 133-151.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: A potential of rare earth elements (including yttrium) (REY) accumulation in olives is increasing due to enhanced use of REY in human activities. REY transfer to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is little studied, and characterising the relationships between soil properties and REY concentrations in olive leaves, pomace and EVOO can enhance our understanding of soil-plant interactions. METHODS: Three different soil types (reclaimed karst, rendzina and cambisols), with the sum of REY concentrations (54–364 μg g⁻¹) among the highest in European soils, were characterized for their pH, organic carbon, total carbonates and the applied agronomic practice. Aluminium, calcium, iron, phosphorus and REY were determined in soil (total and plant-available), olive leaves, pomace and EVOO. RESULTS: REY were mainly excluded from plant uptake and only small amounts of REY were transferred to leaves (0.2–652 ng g⁻¹), pomace (0.001–10 ng g⁻¹) and EVOO (<0.5–33 pg g⁻¹). Soil REY availability (0.001–1685 ng g⁻¹) and plant uptake increased with increasing soil acidity. Leaf REY concentrations were mainly explained by plant-available REY and pH. There was an indication of enhanced REY plant availability being associated with low available phosphorus and soil ploughing. CONCLUSIONS: Soil properties influence REY uptake and further partitioning to leaves, fruits and EVOO.  aPublisher supplied data  a23/15cUnity through Knowledge Fund 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acoasts 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3ahumans 3airon 3akarsts 3aleaves 3aolives 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus 3apomace 3asoil pH 3ayttrium1 aŽanetić, Mirella1 aFiket, Željka1 aFurdek Turk, Martina1 aMikac, Nevenka1 aBačić, Niko1 aLučić, Mavro1 aRomić, Marija1 aBakić, Helena1 aJukić Špika, Maja1 aUrlić, Branimir1 aRunjić, Marko1 aVuletin Selak, Gabriela1 aVitanović, Elda1 aKlepo, T.q(Tatjana),1 aRošin, Jakša1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aPerica, Slavko0 tPlant and soil.g2020 Mar., v. 448, no. 1-2 p.133-151dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04418-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245017300205300002000378506007600398520197600474592002802450506003702478650004402515650002602559650003702585650002902622650001302651650002802664650001202692650001302704650001302717650002002730650001202750650001402762650001802776650000902794650001602803650001302819650001302832650000902845650001102854650001702865650001202882650001402894650001302908650001302921650003702934650001502971653003602986653002003022653002703042653003303069653001403102653003103116700002203147700001703169700001703186700001903203700001803222700001803240700001903258700001603277700001903293700002003312773012603332856008003458852000903538655001203547IND60577458020221207073433.0170809e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057745802DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b049502doi7 aPMC55530952pmcid7 a286966712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhshandeh, S.10aSimultaneous Delivery of Multiple Antibacterial Agents from Additively Manufactured Porous Biomaterials to Fully Eradicate Planktonic and Adherent Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 25691-25699.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImplant-associated infections are notoriously difficult to treat and may even result in amputation and death. The first few days after surgery are the most critical time to prevent those infections, preferably through full eradication of the micro-organisms entering the body perioperatively. That is particularly important for patients with a compromised immune system such as orthopedic oncology patients, as they are at higher risk for infection and complications. Full eradication of bacteria is, especially in a biofilm, extremely challenging due to the toxicity barrier that prevents delivery of high doses of antibacterial agents. This study aimed to use the potential synergistic effects of multiple antibacterial agents to prevent the use of toxic levels of these agents and achieve full eradication of planktonic and adherent bacteria. Silver ions and vancomycin were therefore simultaneously delivered from additively manufactured highly porous titanium implants with an extremely high surface area incorporating a bactericidal coating made from chitosan and gelatin applied by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The presence of the chitosan/gelatin (Ch+Gel) coating, Ag, and vancomycin (Vanco) was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The release of vancomycin and silver ions continued for at least 21 days as measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and UV-spectroscopy. Antibacterial behavior against Staphylococcus aureus, both planktonic and in biofilm, was evaluated for up to 21 days. The Ch+Gel coating showed some bactericidal behavior on its own, while the loaded hydrogels (Ch+Gel+Ag and Ch+Gel+Vanco) achieved full eradication of both planktonic and adherent bacteria without causing significant levels of toxicity. Combining silver and vancomycin improved the release profiles of both agents and revealed a synergistic behavior that further increased the bactericidal effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocompatible materials 3abiofilm 3achitosan 3acoatings 3aelectrophoresis 3agelatin 3ahydrogels 3aimmune system 3aions 3aorthopedics 3apatients 3aplankton 3arisk 3asilver 3asurface area 3asurgery 3asynergism 3atitanium 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avancomycin 0aantibacterial surfaces/coatings 0aporous implants 0aadditive manufacturing 0amultifunctional biomaterials 0ahydrogels 0aelectrophoretic deposition1 aGorgin Karaji, Z.1 aLietaert, K.1 aFluit, A.

To develop a sustainable production platform, microbial ester biosynthesis using alcohol acetyltransferases (AATs) has been studied for decades. Volatility of esters endows high-temperature fermentation with advantageous downstream product separation. However, due to the limited thermostability of AATs known, the ester biosynthesis has largely relied on use of mesophilic microbes. Therefore, developing thermostable AATs is important for ester production directly from lignocellulosic biomass by the thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) microbes, e.g., Clostridium thermocellum. RESULTS: In this study, we engineered a thermostable chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus (CATSₐ) for enhanced isobutyl acetate production at elevated temperatures. We first analyzed the broad alcohol substrate range of CATSₐ. Then, we targeted a highly conserved region in the binding pocket of CATSₐ for mutagenesis. The mutagenesis revealed that F97W significantly increased conversion of isobutanol to isobutyl acetate. Using CATSₐ F97W, we demonstrated direct conversion of cellulose into isobutyl acetate by an engineered C. thermocellum at elevated temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that CAT is a potential thermostable AAT that can be harnessed to develop the thermophilic CBP microbial platform for biosynthesis of designer bioesters directly from lignocellulosic biomass.  aPublisher supplied data  a1553250cU.S. National Science Foundation  aDE-AC02-05CH11231cU.S. Department of Energy0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3afermentation 3alignocellulose 3amicroorganisms 3amutagenesis 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aLee, Jong-Won1 aGarcía, Sergio,1 aTrinh, Cong T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8362-725X0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.245-245dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1583-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245013000128300001600258520107600274592002801350650002101378650001601399650001301415650001301428650002601441650002101467650001801488650001301506651001001519653001901529653002701548653000801575700001901583773014201602852000901744655001201753IND60721438920221120174750.0201224e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072143892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aEffect of growth regulating substances on stratification of wild apricots (Prunus armeniaca) kernels under Kashmir conditions  ap. 183-187.  aA field experiment was carried out during 2008–09 to investigate the effect of growth regulators on the stratified and un-stratified kernels of wild apricot. The data on the observations on seed germination and growth parameters of the seedlings were recorded. Three growth regulators at 3-different levels each viz., GA₃ @ 250, 500, 750 ppm, thiourea @ 0.2, 0.4, 0.6% and KNO₃ @ 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4% were applied to the extracted kernels. The results showed that maximum (76.85%) seed germination was recorded in kernels treated with growth regulators are sown directly in the nursery beds, however, survival rate of 80.13% of the germinated seedlings was recorded maximum when subjected to stratification for a period of two months. Maximum germination of the kernels and survival rate of the seedlings was obtained at GA₃ 500 ppm both under stratified and un-stratified conditions. All of the growth characters of the seedlings were recorded maximum in the stratified kernels, however, proved the essentiality of stratification during the dormancy stage of seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aagriculture 3aapricots 3adormancy 3afield experimentation 3aseed germination 3asurvival rate 3athiourea 3aIndia 0aStratification 0aGrowth Characteristics 0aGA31 aShahnaz, Efath0 tProgressive agriculture.g2013 Aug., v. 13, no. 2 p.183-187dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011600158300002000274520124300294592002801537650001301565650001301578650002601591650002201617650001901639650001201658650003101670650001901701650001401720650001101734650002201745650002801767650001401795653001801809653002101827653001701848653003001865700001301895700001501908700001501923700001801938700005501956773014202011856007802153852000902231655001202240IND60679477620221119064911.0191228e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b181122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aOxygen-Self-Supplying and HIF-1α-Inhibiting Core–Shell Nanosystem for Hypoxia-Resistant Photodynamic Therapy  ap. 48261-48270.  aExtreme hypoxia together with the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) represents a significant barrier against the effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor. To mitigate these issues, we created a core–shell nanosystem that can simultaneously alleviate tumor hypoxia and suppress the expression of HIF-1α to combat tumor resistance against PDT. Specifically, a carrier-free, dual-drug nanocore was formed by the self-assembly of hydrophobic photosensitizer (chlorin e6, Ce6) and rapamycin (RAP), and then the surface was coated by a layer of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to load catalase, reaching an overall drug loading of ∼60%. In such system, catalase acted as oxygen-self-supplier to catalyze the decomposition of tumor-abundant H₂O₂ into O₂, and the sustained release of RAP downregulated HIF-1α, which collectively potentiated the PDT efficacy against tumor. The nanosystem could passively accumulate into tumor, realize in situ oxygen generation and HIF-1α inhibition in tumor tissue, and thus exhibit strong PDT effect toward highly hypoxia tumor. This work provides a highly promising nanoplatform to reverse hypoxia-mediated tumor resistance and overcome the restriction of PDT treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalase 3achlorins 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3ananotechnology 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3arapamycin 0atumor therapy 0aself-oxygenation 0ananomedicine 0ametal−organic framework1 aXie, Xin1 aShi, Xinyi1 aPeng, Ying1 aDing, Jinsong1 aZhou, Wenhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3794-661X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 11, no. 51 p.48261-48270dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b181123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009800160300002000258520103500278592002801313650002201341650001101363650002101374650001201395650002201407650002201429650002301451653001601474653001401490653001101504653002601515653001601541700001701557700001601574700001501590700001601605700001801621700001301639700001501652700005101667773014201718856007801860852000901938655001201947IND60596049220221122220607.0180611e20180329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059604922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b013292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Minghe10aSol–Gel Synthesis and in Situ X-ray Diffraction Study of Li3Nd3W2O12 as a Lithium Container  ap. 12716-12721.  aIn this work, garnet-framework Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂ as a novel insertion-type anode material has been prepared via a facile sol–gel method and examined as a lithium container for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂ shows a charge capacity of 225 mA h g–¹ at 50 mA g–¹, and with the current density increasing up to 500 mA g–¹, the charge capacity can still be maintained at 186 mA h g–¹. After cycling at 500 mA g–¹ for 500 cycles, Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂ retains about 85% of its first charge capacity changed from 190.2 to 161 mA h g–¹. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction technique is adopted for the understanding of the insertion/extraction mechanism of Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂. The full-cell configuration LiFePO₄/Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂ is also assembled to evaluate the potential of Li₃Nd₃W₂O₁₂ for practical application.

Secondary forest in Hong Kong is recovering through natural succession since 1945, after complete destruction during the Second World War (WW2). Over 70 of years of natural vegetation succession, forests have suffered three major extreme cold events, in 1974, 1991 and 2016. An intense cold event across Hong Kong and southern China from 23 to 25th January 2016 with temperatures of −6°C and wind chill of −13°C recorded at 950m on Hong Kong’s highest mountain, was preceded by unseasonably warm weather in early January. The intensity of cold had not been experienced in over 100 years of climate records. This study was conducted to map and assess the impacts of the frost event on Hong Kong’s vegetation at landscape level using remotely sensed vegetation indices and GIS, and at species level from field observations. Results indicate that the vegetation below 400m was largely unaffected, but then vegetation damage gradually increased along the elevation gradient from 400m to the maximum elevation of 957m. Furthermore, the cooler north and east-facing aspects appeared less affected by the event, showing less than half of the reduction in the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) compared to normal years, than warmer south and west facing slopes. This presumably indicates that more cold-tolerant woody seedlings are more able to compete and germinate on northerly aspects, as well as the more closed forest canopy on northerly aspects being resistant to wind chill. Plants on the warmer south and west facing slopes covered with earlier successional stages (grasses, shrubs, and very young forest pioneers) were more damaged. Field observations also confirmed the high degree of frost damage observed above 600m, where a higher return frequency of frost explains the absence of tropical taxa and the presence of more temperate floristic elements. A higher frequency of frosts would favor deciduous species, which are more resilient to frost and, in the long-run, would cause the disappearance of evergreen forests above 600m in Hong Kong. The predicted greater frequency of frost damage due to climatic warming could bring about such changes in coming decades. Given the predicted greater incidence of climate extremes to forests in climatic transition zones under climate change predictions, monitoring using satellite-derived vegetation indices is a low cost and effective means of identifying longer-term changes as opposed to natural inter-annual variability in forest growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acold 3acold tolerance 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest canopy 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest growth 3afrost 3afrost injury 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal warming 3agrasses 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asecondary forests 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3atemperature 3awind 3aChina 0aHong Kong 0aExtreme climate events 0aFrost 0aRemote sensing 0aTropical forest1 aNichol, Janet E.1 aFischer, Gunter A.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 232 p.543-549dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245009500184300001600279520105100295592002801346650002201374650002001396650002101416650002101437650001601458653002101474653003501495653001201530653001901542653001201561653001001573700003101583700002101614773010801635856008601743852000901829655001201838IND60564479520221118214328.0190318e20161120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056447952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapagiannopoulos, Aristeidis10aScattering investigation of multiscale organization in aqueous solutions of native xanthan  ap. 196-202.  aThe hierarchical morphology of xanthan solutions is analyzed by light and neutron scattering in a broad range of concentrations in order to connect their morphology to their well-documented dynamic properties. Static light scattering inside the semidilute regime is dominated by the form factor of individual xanthan chains while at higher concentrations chain interconnections appear to modify the low wave vector scattering. Dynamic light scattering reveals the self-similar nature of the solutions caused by interchain associations as intensity autocorrelation functions present power-law behaviour. Small angle neutron scattering is dominated by the fractal scattering from the formed network at intermediate length scales. At small length scales the rigid structure of xanthan is revealed and the molecular weight per unit length is extracted. No detectable morphological alterations for shear rates up to 1000rad/s are observed revealing that the shear thinning behaviour of xanthan is related to the disruption of chain-chain associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aautocorrelation 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3axanthan gum 0aLight scattering 0aSmall angle neutron scattering 0aXanthan 0aPolysaccharide 0aFractal 0aHelix1 aSotiropoulos, Konstantinos1 aRadulescu, Aurel0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 153 p.196-202dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009100175300001600266520102600282592002801308650001301336650001201349650001101361650002101372650001201393650001401405650001001419650001801429650001101447651001401458700002901472700002701501700002701528773011801555856008201673852000901755655001201764IND60119837620221119184830.0181015e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011983762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-014-2573-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeglhus, Frederik Wolff10aGut evacuation rate and grazing impact of the krill Thysanoessa raschii and T. inermis  ap. 169-180.  aGut evacuation rates and ingestion rates were measured for the krill Thysanoessa raschii and T. inermis in Godthåbsfjord, SW Greenland. Combined with biomass of the krill community, the grazing potential on phytoplankton along the fjord was estimated. Gut evacuation rates were 3.9 and 2.3 h⁻¹ for T. raschii and T. inermis, respectively. Ingestion rates were 12.2 ± 7.5 µg C mg C⁻¹ day⁻¹ (n = 4) for T. inermis and 4.9 ± 3.2 µg C mg C⁻¹ day⁻¹ (n = 4) for T. raschii, corresponding to daily rations of 1.2 and 0.5 % body carbon day⁻¹. Clearance experiments conducted in parallel to the gut evacuation experiment gave similar results for ingestion rates and daily rations. Krill biomass was highest in the central part of the fjord’s length, with T. raschii dominating. Community grazing rates from krill and copepods were comparable; however, their combined impact was low, estimated as <1 % of phytoplankton standing stock being removed per day during this late spring study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adigestive system 3agrazing 3aingestion 3akrill 3aphytoplankton 3aspring 3aGreenland1 aAgersted, Mette Dalgaard1 aArendt, Kristine Engel1 aNielsen, Torkel Gissel0 tMarine biology.g2015 Jan., v. 162, no. 1 p.169-180dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-014-2573-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001400288520132400302592002801626650000901654650001801663650001801681650001801699650002001717650002301737650001501760650001101775650001601786650001701802650002401819650001701843650001001860653002401870653002401894653001601918653003301934653002301967700005701990700002102047700005602068700002202124773011202146856008602258852000902344655001202353IND60635880020221118045526.0190711e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063588002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Mandeep10aDecomposition of soil organic matter as affected by clay types, pedogenic oxides and plant residue addition rates  ap. 11-19.  aThe interactive effects of the types and contents of soil clay fractions (SCFs) and plant-residue addition rates on soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilisation are largely unknown. We conducted incubation experiments by amending a sandy soil sample with kaolinitic-illitic, smectitic and allophanic SCFs and adding wheat residues to the mineral mixtures to compare their C stabilisation capacity. The rate of carbon (C) decomposition was higher in the kaolinitic-illitic SCF followed by smectitic and allophanic clay minerals. The supply of easily degradable C substrate from decomposing residues markedly influenced the SCFs’ abilities to stabilise SOC. The removal of sesquioxides from the SCFs significantly decreased their C stabilisation capacity, which coincided with a decrease in the dehydrogenase activity of the mineral-residue mixture. The allophanic SCF showed the least microbial activity and the greatest C stabilisation due to having a higher proportion of micropores (75%). The high C stabilisation capacity of allophanic SCF could also be explained by its high specific surface area (119 m2 g−1). The results of this study are helpful to understand the role of various SCFs in stabilising added C originating from external wheat residue addition but warrant further validation under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclay minerals 3acrop residues 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3amicropores 3aoxides 3asandy soils 3asesquioxides 3asoil organic carbon 3asurface area 3awheat 0aSoil clay fractions 0aWheat plant residue 0aRespiration 0aOrganic carbon stabilisation 0aMicrobial activity1 aSarkar, Binoy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4196-12251 aBolan, Nanthi S.1 aOk, Yong Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3401-09121 aChurchman, G.

In this paper, we put forward a novel in situ method to introduce the OVs into BiSbO₄ (BiSbO₄-OV) via UV-light-induced breaking down of Bi–O and Sb–O bonds. The formation of OVs could broaden the photoresponse range and improve the charge carrier separation as confirmed by density functional theory calculation and UV and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The unique electronic structure of OVs endowed BiSbO₄ with high visible light photocatalytic NO activity. It was significant to reveal that oxygen in the air could fill the OV sites during the photocatalytic reaction and the consumption of the OVs led to the direct deactivation of BiSbO₄-OV. By re-irradiation of the deactivated photocatalysts, BiSbO₄-OV could get back to its initial state, realizing the refreshment of OVs for sustainable photocatalysis. Additionally, the visible light photocatalytic NO conversion pathway on BiSbO₄-OV was uncovered via in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy based on the identification of the reaction intermediates and products. The light-induced generation and regeneration of OVs could also be extended to other semiconductors for sustainable visible light photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3asemiconductors 0avisible light photocatalysis 0aphoto-induced oxygen vacancy 0aregeneration 0aDFT calculation 0ain situ DRIFTS1 aWang, Hong1 aCui, Wen1 aLi, Jieyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3666-97961 aChen, Peng1 aSun, Yanjuan1 aSheng, Jianping1 aZhou, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9995-06521 aZhang, Yuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4698-56451 aDong, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-99640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 11, no. 51 p.47984-47991dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b181543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010100170520248300271592002802754650002002782650001302802650001802815650001902833650002902852650001902881650002202900650001202922650002302934650001802957650002002975650002302995650001203018650002403030650001303054650001503067651001303082653001503095653001603110653000803126653000803134653001403142700002503156700002103181700002303202700002103225700002103246700002003267700002003287773011803307856008503425852000903510655001203519IND60686394620221119140620.0220411e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrta, Olivia R.10aCorrelates of organochlorine pesticide plasma concentrations among reproductive-aged black women  aOrganochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are lipophilic persistent organic pollutants associated with adverse health outcomes. Black women have higher body burdens compared with other U.S. populations and research on their correlates is limited. Using baseline data from a prospective cohort study of Black women aged 23–35 years from the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area (enrolled 2010–2012), we examined correlates of plasma concentrations of the following OCPs: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,pʹ-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor. At enrollment, we collected non-fasting blood samples from 742 participants. We also collected data on demographic, behavioral, dietary, occupational, and medical history factors via self-administered questionnaires, telephone interviews, and in-person clinic visits. We fit linear regression models to calculate percent (%) differences across categories of each correlate and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In models adjusted for all other correlates, a 5-year increase in age was associated with 24% higher oxychlordane (95% CI: 12%, 38%) and 26% higher trans-nonachlor (95% CI: 12%, 42%) plasma concentrations. Heavy alcohol use was associated with 7–9% higher plasma concentrations of p,pʹ-DDE, oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor. Current smoking was associated with 10–19% higher plasma concentrations of all four OCPs, and was highest for current smokers of ≥10 cigarettes/day (% differences ranged from 22 to 29%). Compared with having never been breastfed during infancy, having been breastfed for ≥3 months was associated with 15% higher concentrations of p,pʹ-DDE (95% CI: 6%, 25%), 14% higher oxychlordane (95% CI: 5%, 24%), and 15% higher trans-nonachlor (95% CI: 5%, 27%). Consumption of ≥5 vs. ≤2 glasses/day of tap or bottled water was associated with 8–15% higher plasma concentrations of all four OCPs, and was highest for trans-nonachlor (% difference: 15%; 95% CI: 6%, 26%). No other dietary predictors were appreciably associated with plasma OCP concentrations. Obesity, parity, higher birth order, and longer lactation duration were inversely associated with plasma OCP concentrations. In Black U.S. women of reproductive age, older age was an important correlate of plasma OCP concentrations. Exposure to OCPs earlier in life appears to contribute to current blood concentrations. In addition, tobacco, alcohol, and drinking water may be important sources of exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aalcohols 3abottled water 3abreast feeding 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3acohort studies 3ahexachlorobenzene 3ainfancy 3alactation duration 3alipophilicity 3amedical history 3ametropolitan areas 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atelephones 3aMichigan 0aPesticides 0aBlack women 0aDDT 0aDDE 0aChlordane1 aWesselink, Amelia K.1 aBethea, Traci N.1 aHenn, Birgit Claus1 aSjödin, Andreas1 aWegienka, Ganesa1 aBaird, Donna D.1 aWise, Lauren A.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 May, v. 184 p.109352-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247500001500263520083000278592002801108650001601136650002101152650001201173650001301185653002601198653001901224653002001243653001101263700001901274700001801293773007701311856008101388852000901469655001201478IND60519804620221118115346.0160511e20070401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051980462DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-007-0024-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAo, Chengqi12aA systematic investigation of leaf epidermis in Camellia using light microscopy  ap. 157-162.  a2019-12-06  aThe characters of mature leaf epidermis of 58 species and 3 varieties belonging to 19 sections, representing all the 4 subgenera: Protocamellia, Camellia, Thea and Metacamellia were investigated under light microscope.

The dietary BFR intake and related health risks of the mothers and their babies due to food consumption or human milk ingestion were subsequently assessed. At median concentrations of 284, 264 and 177 pg/g wet weight (ww) in the diet, decabrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-209), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and HBCDD were predominant among the total BFRs. In human milk, HBCDD was the most abundant BFR, followed by BDE-209 and DBDPE, which indicates that BDE-209 and HBCDD have remained ubiquitous in the environment because of their continuous production and use in China. Meanwhile, concentrations of DBDPE were comparative to those of PBDEs and HBCDD in both diet and human milk, and DBDPE also had much higher concentrations than any other NBFRs, which indicates that the BFR consumption pattern in China is shifting from legacy BFRs to NBFRs. The median estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) of BDE-209, HBCDD and DBDPE for the mothers were 6.83, 3.73 and 5.44 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, and EDIs for their nursing babies were 24.7, 41.9 and 7.83 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. The nursing infants showed higher BFR body burden than the mothers. However, the EDIs obtained for both mothers and their babies discloses a low health risk to this mother-infant cohort.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3adecabromodiphenyl ethane 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3adiet study techniques 3adietary exposure 3aenvironment 3aexposure assessment 3aflame retardants 3afood consumption 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3ainfants 3amilk consumption 3amothers 3arisk 3asampling 3aweight 3aChina 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aDuplicate diet study 0aHuman milk 0aDietary exposure assessments 0aMother-infant1 aLi, Jian1 aShi, Zhixiong0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126843-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245010400174300001600278520056200294592002800856650001100884650001600895650002900911650001500940650001300955650001800968650000900986650001400995651001501009773011601024856005701140852000901197655001201206IND4479071720221118042226.0120524e198004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447907172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.1979.tb00860.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSINCLAIR, E.

The effect of temperature on soil respiration rate is important in evaluating the potential feedback of soil organic carbon to global warming. We incubated soils from the alpine meadow zone and upper rocky zone along an altitudinal gradient (4400–5500m a.s.l.) on the Tibetan Plateau under various temperature and soil moisture conditions. We evaluated the potential effects of temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration and its variation across altitudes. Soil respiration rates increased as the temperature increased. At 60% of soil water content, they averaged 0.21–5.33μmolgsoil−1day−1 in the alpine meadow zone and 0.11–0.50μmolgsoil−1day−1 in the rocky zone over the experimental temperature range. Soil respiration rates in the rocky zone did not increase between 25 and 35°C, probably because of heat stress. Rates of decomposition of organic matter were high in the rocky zone, where the CN ratio was smaller than in the middle altitudes. Soil respiration rates also increased with increasing soil water content from 10% to 80% at 15°C, averaging 0.04–2.00μmolgsoil−1day−1 in the alpine meadow zone and 0.03–0.35μmolgsoil−1day−1 in the rocky zone. Maximum respiration rates were obtained in the middle part of the alpine slope in any case of experimental temperature and soil moisture. The change patterns in soil respiration rate along altitude showed similar change pattern in soil carbon content. Although the altitude is a variable including various environmental factors, it might be used as a surrogate parameter of soil carbon content in alpine zone. Results suggest that temperature, soil moisture and altitude are used as appropriate environmental indicators for estimating the spatial distribution of potential soil respiration in alpine zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3arespiratory rate 3aheat stress 3acarbon cycle 3aglobal warming 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3aalpine meadows 3aaltitude 3aenvironmental indicators 3aChina 0aorganic matter 0acarbon 0aAltitude 0aSoil carbon content 0aSoil respiration rate 0aSoil moisture 0aTemperature 0aMountain slope 0aAlpine region1 aYonemura, Seiichiro1 aKawashima, Shigeto1 aDu, Mingyuan1 aTang, Yanhong0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.245-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015800174500001400332520137700346592002801723650001001751650001801761650002501779650001901804650001601823650001501839650001001854650001001864650001801874650000901892650001701901650001001918650001001928650001601938650002101954650002301975650001501998650001902013650001302032650001302045650001002058650001202068650001302080650001402093650001002107653002602117653002702143653001902170653002102189653001402210700002202224700002402246700002302270700001902293773009202312856009002404852000902494655001202503IND60690524020221117093250.0201125e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069052402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRybak, Michał10aIron-induced behavioural and biochemical responses of charophytes in consequence of phosphates coagulant addition: Threats to lake ecosystems restoration  aNAL-light  aThe study aimed to evaluate the impact of iron (Fe) on the physiological and behavioural reaction of Chara tomentosa L. Fe was introduced into the environment in the form of iron chloride, the most common coagulants used in the restoration of water bodies. The investigations concerned the oxidative stress comprising phenolic compounds content, antioxidant activity and photosynthetic pigments concentration. Research was conducted as a laboratory microcosm experiment with one-off application of Fe at the level of 26.8 mg dm⁻³. Coagulant application caused short-term acidification, increased salinity and deterioration of light conditions. The shading resulted initially from the increase of water colour and turbidity and was followed by covering of the charophytes with a precipitated suspension. C. tomentosa did not activate defensive mechanisms to prevent the shading effect such as intensive elongation and elevated concentration of chlorophylls. Neither oxidative stress nor production of stress-specific phenolic metabolites was found. It was a result of iron coagulant toxicity, which led to cell membrane damage and leakage of cell contents to the water environment. Charophyte growth was significantly impaired, and thalli suffered numerous chlorotic and necrotic spots which extended gradually during experiment and finally caused death of specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChara 3aacidification 3aantioxidant activity 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3acoagulants 3acolor 3adeath 3adeterioration 3airon 3alaboratories 3alakes 3alight 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3aphenolic compounds 3aphosphates 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3asalinity 3ashade 3athallus 3atoxicity 3aturbidity 3awater 0aCharophytes behaviour 0aAntioxidative activity 0aIron coagulant 0aLake restoration 0aPhenolics1 aDrzewiecka, Kinga1 aWoźniak, Magdalena1 aRatajczak, Izabela1 aJoniak, Tomasz0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 254 p.126844-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1268443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007000163300001600233520109300249592002801342650001801370650001301388650001601401650001101417650002001428650001501448650001801463650001501481650000901496650002501505653001301530653001601543653002001559653001801579653001501597653002501612700002001637700002201657773007701679856008101756852000901837655001201846IND60519804920221118115315.0160511e20070401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051980492DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-007-0027-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBora, Kanti10aPaclobutrazol delayed dark-induced senescence of mung bean leaves  ap. 185-188.  aSixty days old mung beans Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek were treated with soil applied paclobutrazol, at the rate of 500 µg per 10 inch pot. After seven days of application, the plants along with untreated controls were transferred to the dark for induction of senescence. The treated plants exhibited higher chlorophyll content and activity of catalase (CAT) compared to controls. In contrast, control leaves had higher activity of peroxidase (POX) and a higher content of malondialdehyde (MDA), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity remained unchanged. Upon transfer to dark, chlorophyll content declined in both control and treated plants but the decline was much faster in control. The activity of CAT decreased significantly in controls while POX activity and MDA content remained higher in control than in treated plants. Paclobutrazol delayed the dark-induced senescence in attached mung bean leaves in association with the maintenance of higher activity of CAT, low activity of POX, and low MDA contents. The variation in SOD activity was not discernible with senescence levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna radiata 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amung beans 3apaclobutrazol 3aperoxidase 3asoil 3asuperoxide dismutase 0acatalase 0achlorophyll 0amalondialdehyde 0apaclobutrazol 0aperoxidase 0asuperoxide dismutase1 aGanesh, Rajmani1 aMāthura, Sudhā,0 tBiologia.g2007 Apr. 1, v. 62, no. 2 p.185-188dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-007-0027-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024003300159040001800192100002500210245012300235300001600358506007600374520141300450592002801863506003701891650001801928650002701946650001301973650002101986650002202007650002202029650002002051650001202071650001102083650001402094650001302108650001102121650002002132650002102152650001102173650005602184650003002240650004602270650002102316650007602337650003102413650004202444650002002486650005002506650001102556650002002567650001402587650003202601650002902633650002602662700001702688700002002705700001902725700001802744700001902762700002402781700003202805700002002837700002302857700002302880773010302903856007903006852000903085655001203094IND50072338620221207141122.0150206e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233862DNAL7 a239576152pmid7 aPMC4113418 [Available on 02/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1111/1462-2920.122232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoza‐Correa, Maria14aThe Legionella pneumophila kai operon is implicated in stress response and confers fitness in competitive environments  ap. 359-381.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLegionella pneumophila uses aquatic protozoa as replication niche and protection from harsh environments. Although L. pneumophila is not known to have a circadian clock, it encodes homologues of the KaiBC proteins of Cyanobacteria that regulate circadian gene expression. We show that L. pneumophila kaiB, kaiC and the downstream gene lpp1114, are transcribed as a unit under the control of the stress sigma factor RpoS. KaiC and KaiB of L. pneumophila do not interact as evidenced by yeast and bacterial two‐hybrid analyses. Fusion of the C‐terminal residues of cyanobacterial KaiB to Legionella KaiB restores their interaction. In contrast, KaiC of L. pneumophila conserved autophosphorylation activity, but KaiB does not trigger the dephosphorylation of KaiC like in Cyanobacteria. The crystal structure of L. pneumophila KaiB suggests that it is an oxidoreductase‐like protein with a typical thioredoxin fold. Indeed, mutant analyses revealed that the kai operon‐encoded proteins increase fitness of L. pneumophila in competitive environments, and confer higher resistance to oxidative and sodium stress. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that L. pneumophila KaiBC resemble Synechosystis KaiC2B2 and not circadian KaiB1C1. Thus, the L. pneumophila Kai proteins do not encode a circadian clock, but enhance stress resistance and adaption to changes in the environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aProtozoa 3acircadian rhythm 3acrystal structure 3adephosphorylation 3agene expression 3amutants 3aoperon 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asodium 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3ayeasts 2aAcanthamoeba castellaniixmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCircadian Clocks 2aCircadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Fitness 2aLegionella pneumophilaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aOperon 2aPhosphorylation 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aStress, Physiological1 aSahr, Tobias1 aRolando, Monica1 aDaniels, Craig1 aPetit, Pierre1 aSkarina, Tania1 aGomez Valero, Laura1 aDervins‐Ravault, Delphine1 aHonoré, Nadine1 aSavchenko, Aleksey1 aBuchrieser, Carmen0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.359-381dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.122233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013000157520183400287592002802121650001602149650001202165650001802177650001102195650001102206650001402217650001802231650001902249650001702268650001302285651002002298700001902318700002102337773012902358856007402487852000902561655001202570IND60656358820221120111044.0190812e20190804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065635882DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111518252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yupeng 10aChlorophyll Concentration Response to the Typhoon Wind-Pump Induced Upper Ocean Processes Considering Air–Sea Heat Exchange  aThe typhoon Wind-Pump induced upwelling and cold eddy often promote the significant growth of phytoplankton after the typhoon. However, the importance of eddy-pumping and wind-driven upwelling on the sea surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) during the typhoon are still not clearly distinguished. In addition, the air&ndash;sea heat flux exchange is closely related to the upper ocean processes, but few studies have discussed its role in the sea surface Chl-a variations under typhoon conditions. Based on the cruise data, remote sensing data, and model data, this paper analyzes the contribution of the vertical motion caused by the eddy-pumping upwelling and Ekman pumping upwelling on the surface Chl-a, and quantitatively analyzes the influence of air&ndash;sea heat exchange on the surface Chl-a after the typhoon Linfa over the northeastern South China Sea (NSCS) in 2009. The results reveal the Wind Pump impacts on upper ocean processes: (1) The euphotic layer-integrated Chl-a increased after the typhoon, and the increasing of the surface Chl-a was not only the uplift of the deeper waters with high Chl-a but also the growth of the phytoplankton; (2) The Net Heat Flux (air&ndash;sea heat exchange) played a major role in controlling the upper ocean physical processes through cooling the SST and indirectly increased the surface Chl-a until two weeks after the typhoon; (3) the typhoon-induced cyclonic eddy was the most important physical process in increasing the surface Chl-a rather than the Ekman pumping and wind-stirring mixing after typhoon; (4) the spatial shift between the surface Chl-a blooms and the typhoon-induced cyclonic eddy could be due to the Ekman transport; (5) nutrients uplifting and adequate light were two major biochemical elements supplying for the growth of surface phytoplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acooling 3aheat transfer 3amixing 3amodels 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atyphoons 3aSouth China Sea1 aTang, DanLing,1 aEvgeny, Morozov 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111518253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010000160300002000260520142200280592002801702650001101730650001301741650001701754650001101771650001901782650001401801700001501815700001501830700001601845700001701861773014401878856007502022852000902097655001202106IND60758087620221119201634.0211126e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075808762DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta05734k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Leicheng12aA high-performance lithiated silicon–sulfur battery enabled by fluorinated ether electrolytes  ap. 25426-25434.  aLithiated silicon–sulfur (Si–S) batteries are an attractive energy storage system that can offer higher theoretical energy density and lower cost than current lithium-ion batteries. However, this type of battery using conventional ether electrolytes suffers from a short lifespan, resulting from poor anode stability and severe polysulfide shuttle effects. To tackle these challenges, here we report a fluorinated ether electrolyte to boost the performance of lithiated Si–S batteries. The newly developed electrolyte not only enables the formation of a robust solid-electrolyte interphase on the Si surface, which effectively accommodates volume variation, thus stabilizing the Si anode, but also leads to quasi-solid-state conversion of S species, thereby considerably mitigating the polysulfide shuttle effect. As a result, a Si–S full battery using the fluorinated electrolyte is able to deliver a high initial capacity of 902 mA h g⁻¹ and maintain capacity retention of 64.0% after 100 cycles. By contrast, the capacity of a cell using conventional ether electrolyte rapidly decays to 162 mA h g⁻¹, which is only 17.5% of its original value. More impressively, for the first time, we demonstrate that a full cell can operate stably with a high cathode loading (6.2 mg cm⁻²) and lean electrolyte (<10 μL mg⁻¹), showing great potential for achieving high-performance and high-energy batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3alongevity1 aZhao, Chen1 aLin, Yanke1 aWu, Maochun1 aZhao, T.

A total of 81 gene-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were genotyped and 33 markers were segregating. The MDH1 SNP on SSC3 was associated with 45-min and ultimate pH (pHu), and pH decline. PRKAG3 on SSC15 was associated with pHu. The HSPG2 SNP on SSC6 was associated with marbling score and days to 113kg. Markers for NUP88 and FKBP10 on SSC12 were associated with 45-min pH and L*, respectively. The SSC15 marker SF3B1 was associated with L* and LMA, and the SSC18 marker ARF5 was associated with pHu and color score.

The genes whose expression is modified during growth in P. anserina are either not conserved or differently regulated in Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus niger, two fungi for which transcriptome data during growth are available. The P. anserina mutants display a similar alteration of their transcriptome profile, with nearly 1000 genes affected similarly in the three mutants, accounting for their similar growth phenotypes. Yet, each mutant has its specific set of modified transcripts, in line with particular phenotypes exhibited by each mutant. Again, there is limited conservation during evolution of the genes regulated at the transcription level by MAP kinases, as indicated by the comparison the P. anserina data, with those of Aspergillus fumigatus and N. crassa, two fungi for which gene expression data are available for mutants of the MAPK pathways. Among the genes regulated in wild type and affected in the mutants, those involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolisms appear prominent. The vast majority of the genes differentially expressed are of unknown function. Availability of their transcription profile at various stages of development should help to decipher their role in fungal physiology and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aAspergillus niger 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aNeurospora crassa 3aPodospora anserina 3adevelopmental stages 3aevolution 3afungi 3afungus physiology 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 2aBiological Evolution 2aCluster Analysis 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aPodosporaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscriptional Activation 2aTranscriptome1 aCoppin, Evelyne1 aSilar, Philippe0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2012 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.643-652dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005700183245013100240506007600371520143500447592002801882596003801910506003701948650002401985650001502009650001102024650003902035650002102074650001102095650001302106650001302119650002202132650002202154650001602176773010402192856007602296852000902372655001202381IND60624327120221207094824.0181203e20180926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062432712DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/43730892doi7 aPMC61781652pmcid7 a303564082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaskina, Olga1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4994-085610aTransposable Elements in the Organization and Diversification of the Genome of Aegilops speltoides Tausch (Poaceae, Triticeae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRepetitive DNA—specifically, transposable elements (TEs)—is a prevailing genomic fraction in cereals that underlies extensive genome reshuffling and intraspecific diversification in the wild. Although large amounts of data have been accumulated, the effect of TEs on the genome architecture and functioning is not fully understood. Here, plant genome organization was addressed by means of cloning and sequencing TE fragments of different types, which compose the largest portion of the Aegilops speltoides genome. Individual genotypes were analyzed cytogenetically using the cloned TE fragments as the DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The obtained TE sequences of the Ty1-copia, Ty3-gypsy, LINE, and CACTA superfamilies showed the relatedness of the Ae. speltoides genome to the Triticeae tribe and similarities to evolutionarily distant species. A significant number of clones consisted of intercalated fragments of TEs of various types, in which Fatima (Ty3-gypsy) sequences predominated. At the chromosomal level, different TE clones demonstrated sequence-specific patterning, emphasizing the effect of the TE fraction on the Ae. speltoides genome architecture and intraspecific diversification. Altogether, the obtained data highlight the current species-specific organization and patterning of the mobile element fraction and point to ancient evolutionary events in the genome of Ae. speltoides.  aPublisher supplied data  a723/07cIsrael Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAegilops speltoides 3aDNA probes 3aclones 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenetic distance 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotype 3amolecular cloning 3asequence analysis 3atransposons0 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2018 Sept. 26, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/43730893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245007500164300001600239520113500255592002801390650001101418650001701429650002101446650001601467650000901483650001701492650001301509650002801522700001801550700002001568700002201588700002601610700001501636773012901651856007801780852000901858655001201867IND60561400520221119042827.0170118e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056140052DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b095672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrancaccio, Diego10a[4Fe-4S] Cluster Assembly in Mitochondria and Its Impairment by Copper  ap. 719-730.  aThe cellular toxicity of copper is usually associated with its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. However, recent studies in bacterial organisms showed that copper toxicity is also strictly connected to iron–sulfur cluster proteins and to their assembly processes. Mitochondria of eukaryotic cells contain a labile copper(I) pool localized in the matrix where also the mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly machinery resides to mature mitochondrial Fe/S cluster-containing proteins. Misregulation of copper homeostasis might therefore damage mitochondrial Fe/S protein maturation. To describe, from a molecular perspective, the effects of copper(I) toxicity on such a maturation process, we have here investigated the still unknown mechanism of [4Fe-4S] cluster formation conducted by the mitochondrial ISCA1/ISCA2 and GLRX5 proteins, and defined how copper(I) can impair this process. The molecular model here proposed indicates that the copper(I) and Fe/S protein maturation cellular pathways need to be strictly regulated to avoid copper(I) ion from blocking mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amitochondria 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species1 aGallo, Angelo1 aPiccioli, Mario1 aNovellino, Ettore1 aCiofi-Baffoni, Simone1 aBanci, L.,0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Jan. 18, v. 139, no. 2 p.719-730dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b095673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002900153245027900182300001600461520102600477592002801503650002001531650000801551650001501559650001401574650002801588650001201616650001101628650001801639650001201657650001001669650003001679651001101709700002301720700003101743700002101774700002301795700002501818773008601843856008901929852000902018655001202027IND4492579420221116201220.0150808e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449257942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPita-Pereira, Daniela de10aLutzomyia (Pintomyia) fischeri (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), a probable vector of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: Detection of natural infection by Leishmania (Viannia) DNA in specimens from the municipality of Porto Alegre (RS), Brazil, using multiplex PCR assay  ap. 273-275.  aIn order to determine natural Leishmania (Viannia) infection in Lutzomyia (Pintomyia) fischeri, a multiplex PCR methodology coupled to non-isotopic hybridization was adopted for the analysis of sand fly samples collected by CDC light traps in an endemic area of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in the periurban region of the municipality of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. We analyzed by PCR methodology 560 specimens of Lutzomyia (Pintomyia) fischeri (520 females and 40 males). The wild sand flies were grouped into 56 pools (52 females and 4 males) of 10 each, and positive results were detected in 2 of the 52 female pools, representing a minimum infection rate of 0.38% based on the presence of at least 1 infected insect in the pool.

(P.)fischeri may be considered as a secondary vector of ACL in the studied locality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCDC light traps 3aDNA 3aLeishmania 3aLutzomyia 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3afemales 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ainsects 3amales 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aBrazil1 aSouza, Getúlio D.1 aPereira, Thaís de Araújo1 aZwetsch, Adriana1 aBritto, Constança1 aRangel, Elizabeth F.0 tActa tropica.g2011 Dec., v. 120, no. 3 p.273-275dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010300166300001600269500001500285520137200300592002801672650002001700650001601720650001101736650001201747650002401759650002601783650002201809650002401831650002601855650002101881650001701902650002701919650002801946650000901974650001001983650002101993650002902014650001502043653001802058653002302076653001102099653000802110653002102118653001502139653002702154700002602181773010102207856008602308852000902394655001202403IND60084568220221119042402.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinesh, R.10aSoil biochemical/microbial indices as ecological indicators of land use change in mangrove forests  ap. 253-258.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the study was to examine the long-term changes in biochemical/microbial indicators of soil quality due to clear felling of mangroves for establishment of plantations. The biochemical/microbial parameters included dissolved organic-C (DOC) and -N (DON), soil microbial biomass-C (SMBC), -N (SMBN) and -P (SMBP), soil respiration (SR), metabolic quotient (qCO2), adenylates (ATP, AMP and ADP), adenylate energy charge (AEC), ergosterol and their ratios. Results revealed that the undisturbed mangroves possessed considerably greater amounts of soil organic C, DOC and DON. Consequently, SMBC, SMBN and SMBP showed marked reductions in the plantations suggesting an average loss of 66%, 49% and 75%, respectively due to changed land use. Likewise, SR decreased by 46.4% in the plantations. Enhanced qCO2 levels in the plantations indicated a microbial community under stress with a high maintenance carbon demand, while lower qCO2 levels in the mangroves indicated an efficient microbial community and a better use of available organic substrates. The levels of ATP, AMP and ADP followed a trend identical to that of SMB and SR. Greater ergosterol concentration led to greater ergosterol/SMBC ratio suggesting a shift in the microbial community structure from a primarily fungi dominated SMB in the mangroves to a fungi recessive SMB in the plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3aplantations 3aenergy 3afelling 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3aindicator species 3asoil organic carbon 3aadenosine diphosphate 3amangrove forests 3asoil quality 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosine monophosphate 3asoil 3afungi 3asoil respiration 3aenvironmental indicators 3aergosterol 0aDeforestation 0aMetabolic quotient 0acarbon 0aATP 0aSoil respiration 0aErgosterol 0aSoil microbial biomass1 aGhoshal Chaudhuri, S.0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.253-258dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014100176300001600317520156300333592002801896650002001924650001401944650002301958650002301981650001502004650002602019650001902045650001502064650001902079650001102098650001702109650001202126650001302138651001002151653002302161653001602184653002202200653002202222653001002244653000802254700001902262700002202281700002002303773010102323856008602424852000902510655001202519IND60084568320221119042524.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Sabatino, Antonio10aScale and ecological dependence of ecosystem services evaluation: Spatial extension and economic value of freshwater ecosystems in Italy  ap. 259-263.  aUsing land cover datasets derived from satellite imagery as a proxy for ecosystem services (ES) mapping and evaluation generates a series of technical problems mainly related to the resolution at which spatial data are acquired. Small sized and highly fragmented ecosystems such as wetlands, streams and rivers are particularly underestimated when coarse resolution land cover datasets are used. However, even at finer resolution, a large fraction of the economic value provided by freshwater ecosystems may not be adequately captured by remote sensed data because, other than technical and methodological problems, the provision of many freshwater services is strictly dependent on the interactions and contacts of these ecosystems with contiguous environments. The paper analyzes and discusses the effectiveness of the CORINE land cover (CLC) dataset to represent the spatial extension and, indirectly, the economic value of freshwater biomes in Italy, with emphasis on rivers and streams. Using a georeferenced national hydrographic network database and applying a stream buffer of variable width to more than 20,000 water courses, we demonstrated that less than 10% of the estimated surface is captured by the CLC dataset with heavy negative consequences on the overall evaluation of ES at local, regional and national scale. Our approach, easily applicable also to other geographical and spatial contexts, may contribute to improve proxy-based methodologies in ES mapping/evaluation and may help to limit errors in the estimation of freshwater services.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ageoreferencing 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aspatial data 3astreams 3awetlands 3aItaly 0aEcosystem services 0aFreshwaters 0aSpatial extension 0aCORINE land cover 0aItaly 0aGIS1 aCoscieme, Luca1 aVignini, Patrizia1 aCicolani, Bruno0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.259-263dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245006300154300001600217520148300233592002801716650001701744650001301761650001001774650001201784650001301796650002101809650001801830650002301848650001501871650001001886773010901896856003802005852000902043655001202052IND50065200420221122062551.0130416e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006520042DNAL7 a10.2307/14789882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosvik, M.H.10aStimulation of seed germination in an abandoned hay meadow  ap. 251-256.  aIn order to stimulate germination from the soil seed bank in a formerly species‐rich hay meadow for conservation purposes, eight gaps were made in each of four habitat types: (1) Dry/open, (2) Dry/shaded, (3) Moist/open and (4) Moist/ shaded; the meadow was abandoned 12 yr before the experiment started. The mean tree cover of the gaps was reduced from 50 % to 22 %. Light was estimated as distance to nearest tree towards south and shade as tree cover. Soil moisture content was estimated from topography and measured from soil samples. There were no significant differences in total herb number between strata before the experiment started. The number of the target group herb indicators of old, traditional management, was however higher in dry, open areas than in shaded areas whether moist or dry. After the treatment, 15 herbs appeared anew in the gaps, nine of these were indicators of traditional management. 80 % of the indicators present after treatment were either new or had increased in frequency in the gaps. More indicators of traditional management appeared in gaps in the open, on dry soils in slopes than in shaded gaps, on moist soils and flat surface. In order to stimulate germination from the seed bank of as many herb indicators of traditional management as possible in abandoned hay meadows of the region, dry, sloping areas, situated as far as possible from large trees towards south and in the open, should be chosen for making gaps for germination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburied seeds 3ahabitats 3aherbs 3ameadows 3asampling 3aseed germination 3asoil sampling 3asoil water content 3atopography 3atrees0 tApplied vegetation science.g1999 Dec., v. 2, no. 2 p.251-256dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1478988  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175300001600257520146900273592002801742650001501770650001501785650003501800650001101835651001201846651001601858651001801874653002601892653001801918653002101936653001801957653002101975653003701996700001902033700002002052700002002072773010102092856008602193852000902279655001202288IND60084568420221119042349.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanghans, Simone D.10aHow to make river assessments comparable: A demonstration for hydromorphology  ap. 264-275.  aRiver monitoring and assessment programs are important tools to quantify the condition of river ecosystems, identify deficits, and provide preliminary indication of how to improve them. But, they are limited in delivering comparable assessment results across national or transnational borders, aggregating site-specific assessments into broader scale assessments, and supporting river management decisions. We present a multi-criteria decision analysis approach for improving the comparability of ecological assessment methods of different origin and for combining these assessments into a joint procedure. The approach consists of seven consecutive steps. The most central ones concern the hierarchical allocation of ecological assessment endpoints, and the harmonization of the scoring procedure of attributes (ecological indicators or assets) to a common scale from 0 to 1. We demonstrate the approach integrating three programs developed to assess the hydromorphological river condition in Switzerland, Germany, and the USA. In our example, the integrated assessment produces comparable results for the whole range from natural to impacted rivers, while data continuity with original assessments was maintained. Our approach provides a common assessment standard due to the definition of the minimum amount of information required, is flexible regarding measurement and assessment endpoints, and bridges the gap between river quality assessment and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3amonitoring 3amulti-criteria decision making 3arivers 3aGermany 3aSwitzerland 3aUnited States 0aEcological assessment 0aComparability 0aIntercalibration 0aBioassessment 0aRiver management 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis1 aLienert, Judit1 aSchuwirth, Nele1 aReichert, Peter0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.264-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009800176300001600274520097300290592002801263650001601291650001601307650001301323650001301336650001701349650001901366650002301385650003101408650001601439650001001455650001401465650001401479653001401493653002001507653002101527653002901548653001901577653004201596700002201638700002701660700001901687773011401706856008601820852000901906655001201915IND60088096420221122084933.0190318e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008809642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetthaisong, Danupol10aChanges in physicochemical properties of waxy corn starches at different stages of harvesting  ap. 241-248.  aStarches were isolated from immature waxy corn kernels harvested at 0, 2, 4 and 6 days after optimum stage (DAO) and from mature kernels at 16 DAO.

The sample was the lean part of a pork loin. The UVâVis reflectance spectra and the factors of microbial contamination (i.e. plate count and ATP content) on the pork meat surface were measured for 3 or 4days. The 2nd derivative of reflectance at 318 and 578nm gave a high correlation with logââ(plate count) or logââ(ATP content), because the reflectance spectrum at 318nm is probably related to ATP absorption and that at 578nm is related to myoglobin pigments. Moreover, Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was developed and logââ(plate count) and logââ(ATP content) were predicted from the 2nd derivative of reflectance. The determination coefficients (RÂ²) for calibration were 0.95â0.99. These results indicate the potential of utilizing UVâVis reflectance spectrum analysis for cleanness assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aloins 3ameat processing plants 3amicrobial contamination 3amyoglobin 3apigments 3aplate count 3apork 3aprocess monitoring 3areflectance 3asanitation1 aOshita, S.1 aKawagishi, S.1 aMakino, Y.1 aKawagoe, Y.1 aAl-Haq, M.I.1 aShinozaki, S.1 aHiruma, N.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 1 p.9-17dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168300001600284520100300300592002801303650001301331650001301344650001301357650000901370650002201379650000901401650001601410650001701426650001501443650001201458650001601470650001201486650001201498653001501510653001601525653000901541653001301550653001201563653001501575700001701590700001401607773011401621856008601735852000901821655001201830IND60088096520221122084843.0190318e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008809652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, M.D.10aEffect of sucrose, stevia and xylitol on rheological properties of gels from blends of chestnut and rice flours  ap. 249-256.  aThe development of high quality gluten-free products requires the understanding of the phenomena that dictate the ingredient interactions commonly used in foodstuff. In this work, the main objective was to develop alternative gluten-free gelled desserts from blends of chestnut flour (Cf) and whole (Rw), Agulha (Ra) or Carolino (Rc) rice flours. The impact of sucrose, stevia and xylitol on textural, rheological and structural properties of selected gels was investigated. Texture results indicated that studied gels in the presence of sucrose and xylitol decreased significantly the firmness. Rheological outcomes showed that the temperature ramps on heating of Cf/Rw gels were similar to those obtained for Cf/Ra, whereas Cf/Rc gels presented a particular pattern. The presence of sucrose resulted in a significant decrease in the values of storage and loss moduli. Confocal microscopic images showed that the sugar addition leads to a less aggregated structure with fracture lines well marked.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3adesserts 3afirmness 3agels 3agluten-free foods 3aheat 3aingredients 3aloss modulus 3arice flour 3asucrose 3atemperature 3atexture 3axylitol 0aSweeteners 0aGluten-free 0aGels 0aRheology 0aTexture 0aMicroscopy1 aRaymundo, A.1 aSousa, I.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 98, no. 1 p.249-256dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010700157300002000264520096400284592002801248650001401276650001501290650001701305650001101322650001301333650001201346700001701358700001801375700002101393700001501414700001801429700001501447700001401462773014401476856007501620852000901695655001201704IND60758088320221119201033.0211126e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075808832DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta06683h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Mengfan10a3D printing of advanced lithium batteries: a designing strategy of electrode/electrolyte architectures  ap. 25237-25257.  a3D printing, i.e., additive manufacturing, is being progressively applied in lithium batteries to fabricate various electrodes and electrolytes due to the precise design of the structure from the nanoscale to the macroscale. By precisely controlling the geometry and structure, the utilization rate of electrode and electrolyte materials is able to be significantly improved, which is essential for enhancing the energy and power densities of lithium batteries. Herein, the manufacturing strategies and reasoning behind using 3D printing for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are reviewed. The development trend of electrodes and electrolytes designed by a variety of 3D printing technologies, including direct ink writing (DIW), inkjet printing (IJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM) and stereolithography apparatus (SLA), is summarized.

The unprecedented resolution of our piezo servo-system, which can impose millisecond force steps of 0.5–2 pN, reveals the exponential character of the elongation kinetics and allows us to test the two-state nature of the B-S transition mechanism. By analyzing the load-dependence of the rate constant of the elongation, we find that the elementary elongation step is 5.85 nm, indicating a cooperativity of ∼25 basepairs. This mechanism increases the free energy for the elementary reaction to ∼94 kBT, accounting for the stability of the basic conformation of DNA, and explains why ds-DNA can remain in equilibrium as it overstretches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA conformation 3aenergy1 aBongini, Lorenzo1 aMelli, Luca1 aDolfi, Mario1 aLombardi, Vincenzo0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Aug. 17, v. 101, no. 4 p.866-874dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.06.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019300169300001400362520164800376592002802024650001402052650002702066650001202093650001102105650002002116650001302136650001302149650001802162650001402180650001602194650001202210650002502222650001902247651001102266653001702277653001902294653002402313653002302337700001702360700001602377773009902393856008602492852000902578655001202587IND60084568920221119042505.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado, J.H.F.10aMark-recapture of the endangered franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) killed in gillnet fisheries to estimate past bycatch from time series of stranded carcasses in southern Brazil  ap. 35-41.  aIncidental fishery mortality estimates of franciscana based on stranding data are biased downwards, as only a fraction of the total bycatch ends up ashore. We estimated the probability of a franciscana incidentally killed by the coastal gillnet fisheries in southern Brazil to wash ashore and used this as a correction factor to back-calculate fishing related mortality from a dataset of carcasses collected between 1979 and 1998. From November 2005 to January 2009, 145 franciscanas incidentally killed in nets were tagged and returned to the sea. Only 11 of the tagged animals were found during beach surveys. Generalized Linear Models were used to model the probability of a tagged franciscana reaching the shore as a function of the covariates wave period, wind direction and intensity, distance from coast and the target species of the fishery. The target species had a significant effect on the stranding probability. The stranding probability of a tagged franciscana was higher in the fishery targeting white croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) (median=0.105; 95% CI=0.05–0.18) rather than weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa) (0.013; 0.0003–0.069). As the stranding probability estimate for weakfish was imprecise (wide credible interval) we decided to hind cast the number of franciscanas incidentally killed for white croaker season only. The corrected estimate of franciscana mortality was approximately 10 times higher than previous estimates based solely on stranding data. Finally, this novel mark-recapture approach provides a useful correction factor to reduce the bias in incidental mortality estimates derived from stranding data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynoscion 3aMicropogonias furnieri 3abycatch 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adolphins 3agillnets 3alinear models 3amortality 3aprobability 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3awind direction 3aBrazil 0aTag recovery 0aMarine mammals 0aLogistic regression 0aBayesian inference1 aSecchi, E.R.1 aKinas, P.G.0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.35-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009200161520187500253592002802128650001502156650001002171650002002181650002502201650001102226650001602237650001902253650002902272700001502301700001902316700001902335700001502354773012902369856007402498852000902572655001202581IND60656359520221120080116.0190812e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065635952DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111518312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinzheng 10aPolSAR Image Classification via Learned Superpixels and QCNN Integrating Color Features  aPolarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification plays an important role in various PolSAR image application. And many pixel-wise, region-based classification methods have been proposed for PolSAR images. However, most of the pixel-wise methods can not model local spatial relationship of pixels due to negative effects of speckle noise, and most of the region-based methods fail to figure out the regions with the similar polarimetric features. Considering that color features can provide good visual expression and perform well for image interpretation, in this work, based on the PolSAR pseudo-color image over Pauli decomposition, we propose a supervised PolSAR image classification approach combining learned superpixels and quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN). First, the PolSAR RGB pseudo-color image is formed under Pauli decomposition. Second, we train QCNN with quaternion PolSAR data converted by RGB channels to extract deep color features and obtain pixel-wise classification map. QCNN treats color channels as a quaternion matrix excavating the relationship among the color channels effectively and avoiding information loss. Third, pixel affinity network (PAN) is utilized to generate the learned superpixels of PolSAR pseudo-color image. The learned superpixels allow the local information exploitation available in the presence of speckle noise. Finally, we fuse the pixel-wise classification result and superpixels to acquire the ultimate pixel-wise PolSAR image classification map. Experiments on three real PolSAR data sets show that the proposed approach can obtain 96.56%, 95.59%, and 92.55% accuracy for Flevoland, San Francisco and Oberpfaffenhofen data set, respectively. And compared with state-of-the-art PolSAR image classification methods, the proposed algorithm can obtained competitive classification results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3adata collection 3aimage interpretation 3amodels 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aXia, Jili 1 aTan, Xiaoheng 1 aZhou, Xichuan 1 aWang, Tao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 06, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111518313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008100183300001600264520100700280592002801287650001801315650002101333650002501354650002001379650001701399650002001416650002101436650001701457650001201474650001101486650002301497650003901520650002101559650002401580650005301604650005001657650003101707650001901738650003301757700001401790773010901804856004801913852000901961655001201970IND4487051720221121091640.0121003e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448705172DNAL7 a211136872pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8903-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hua-xin10aSynthesis of Morin–Zinc(II) Complex and its Interaction with Serum Albumin  ap. 677-687.  aA morin–zinc(II) complex (MZ) was synthesized and its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by molecular spectroscopy including fluorescence emission spectra, UV-visible spectra, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, three-dimensional fluorescence spectra, and synchronous fluorescence spectra. The interaction mechanism of BSA and MZ was discussed by fluorescence quenching method and Förster non-radiation energy transfer theory. The thermodynamic parameters ΔH θ, ΔG θ, ΔS θ at different temperatures were calculated and the results indicate the interaction is an exothermic as well as entropy-driven process. Hydrogen bond forces played the most important role in the reaction. The fluorescence probe experiment showed that the binding site of MZ is in subdomain IIA of BSA and the distance between BSA and MZ is 3.17 nm at normal body temperature. The conformation changes of BSA in presence of MZ were investigated by CD spectra and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abody temperature 3abovine serum albumin 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aheat production 3ahydrogen bonding 3aspectroscopy 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCircular Dichroism 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aMolecular Structure 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aThermodynamics 2aZincxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aMei, Ping0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Nov., v. 143, no. 2 p.677-687dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8903-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010100161300001100262520098200273592002801255650001701283650001901300650001201319650001101331650002101342650002101363650002101384650003401405650002501439650002201464650001601486700002101502700002101523700001901544700001501563700001301578700001401591700001701605773011101622856008101733852000901814655001201823IND60120407520221119203522.0161029e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012040752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-014-1749-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yanbo10aGaseous NO2 effects on stomatal behavior, photosynthesis and respiration of hybrid poplar leaves  ap. 39.  aIn this study, we used poplar as a model plant and investigated the effects of gaseous nitrogen dioxide (NO₂, 4 µl 1⁻¹) on stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, dark- and photorespiration of Populus alba × Populus berolinensis hybrid leaves using the photosynthesis system and scanning electron microscope technique. The results showed that net photosynthetic rates were significantly reduced in leaves exposed to 4 µl 1⁻¹ NO₂ for 48 h as compared with leaves exposed to ambient carbon dioxide 380 µl 1⁻¹ and ambient NO₂ <0.1 µl 1⁻¹ (the control) and the leaves exposed for 14 h. The decline of net photosynthetic rate was caused mainly by NO₂ treatment. Dark respiration rates were dependent on co-action of the two factors (leaf temperature and NO₂ treatment time).

The uniform catalytic sites available in MOFs provide a unique opportunity to directly study reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysts, a problem typically intractable due to the multiplicity of coordination environments found in many solid catalysts. In this work, we use a combination of isotopic labeling studies, mechanistic probes, and DFT calculations to demonstrate that Ni-MFU-4l operates via the Cossee-Arlman mechanism, which has also been implicated in homogeneous late transition metal catalysts. These studies demonstrate that metal nodes in MOFs mimic homogeneous catalysts not just functionally, but also mechanistically. They provide a blueprint for the development of advanced heterogeneous catalysts with similar degrees of tunability to their homogeneous counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoordination compounds 3adimerization 3aethylene 3aisotope labeling 3areaction mechanisms1 aComito, Robert J.1 aHendon, Christopher H.1 aDincă, Mircea0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Jan. 18, v. 139, no. 2 p.757-762dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b103003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016700170300001400337520201600351592002802367650001302395650001002408650002302418650001102441650002502452650002902477650003502506650001702541650002202558650001702580651001102597653002502608653001102633653003002644653001002674653000802684653001102692700001802703700002102721773009902742856008602841852000902927655001202936IND60084569020221119042413.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ying-Chen10aAssessing the environmental impacts of high-altitude agriculture in Taiwan: A Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework and spatial emergy synthesis  ap. 42-50.  aLimited land resources in Taiwan have resulted in the conversion of many agricultural production areas to residential and commercial areas through urbanization. In addition, in order to produce more crops with a higher market value, many traditional cultivation areas have been transformed to high market-value cultivation areas. These transformations of the agricultural production system have led to an increase in agricultural practices in high-altitude areas in Taiwan, resulting in serious environmental impacts. This study integrates emergy evaluation with GIS (Geographic Information System) to investigate the environmental impacts resulting from the changing agricultural production system in high-altitude areas in Taiwan. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework is used for interpreting the problem of high-altitude agriculture in Taiwan. The spatial emergy synthesis in this study reveals the following: (1) total agricultural production areas in Taiwan decreased by 72,930ha from 1995 to 2006. However, the high-altitude agriculture (over 500 meters) increased significantly, by about 9665ha; (2) ecosystem services (calculated by combining food provision services and the regulation services) decreased by about 6.97E+20sej (solar emergy joule) from 1995 to 2006; (3) the results of the sustainability of ecosystem services index (SESI) indicate that the increases in the food producing function are outweighed by the losses in regulatory services (3.83 times) in the high-altitude agricultural areas; (4) there is a negative relationship between the altitude of the agriculture development and the social adaptive capacity provided by the government for environmental impacts (defined by the Social Response Ratio, SRR); and (5) the spatial emergy approach effectively identifies the distribution of vulnerable areas via GIS, and provides the government with the information required for the appropriate allocation of resources for environmental protection in different areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3aemergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3ageographic information systems 3amarket value 3aresidential areas 3aurbanization 3aTaiwan 0aEnvironmental impact 0aEmergy 0aHigh-altitude agriculture 0aDPSIR 0aGIS 0aTaiwan1 aHuang, Shuli,1 aBudd, William W.0 tEcological indicators.g2013 Sept., v. 32 p.42-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245005600201520135500257592002801612650002501640650001301665650001501678650001501693650001001708650001701718650001801735650001101753650000901764650001401773650001701787650002001804650002201824700001501846700001801861700001701879700002201896700001601918700001701934773009701951856007602048852000902124655001202133IND60752020220221117211010.0210929e20210913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075202022DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/55133582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleh Mohammed,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7263-706510aFruit By-Product Processing and Bioactive Compounds  aTotal phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP), and diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity of avocado peel, avocado seeds, kiwi fruit, orange peel, pineapple peel, and pomegranate skin by-products during processing (i.e., dried, blanched, freezed, and fresh) were determined. It was hypothesized that fruit by-products would add a significant value to the food products. Heat treatments resulted in increasing TPC and TFC and reducing power of fruit by-products with avocado peels TFC of 136.9 and 63.1 mg/100 g of dried and blanched treatments, respectively, compared to 14.4 mg/100 g of fresh and 20.6 mg/100 g of freezed treatments. Orange peels TFC increased from 54.4 mg/100 g of fresh to 194.4 and 380.0 mg/100 g for blanched and dried treatments, respectively. Fresh treatments had the lowest DPPH (%) (IC₅₀), indicating a significant effect of blanching and drying on fruit by-product antioxidant activity with some exceptions. IC₅₀ increased from 20.0 of fresh to 39.8% of dried pineapple peel and from 6.5 to 15.0% for pomegranate skin of fresh and dried treatments, respectively. The use of fruit by-products regardless to its processing as supplements to flours would significantly increase flour’s bioactive availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aavocados 3abyproducts 3aflavonoids 3aflour 3afood quality 3afree radicals 3afruits 3aheat 3akiwifruit 3aorange peels 3apineapple peels 3apomegranate peels1 aAmro, Lana1 aBarakat, Haya1 aBaker, Rahma1 aReyash, Amani Abu1 aAmro, Reham1 aQasem, Jihad0 tJournal of food quality.g2021 Sept. 13, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/55133583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002700192245011400219300001800333506007600351520182200427592002802249506003702277650001502314650002502329650003402354650002802388650001902416650001502435650002002450650001602470650002002486650001002506650001102516650001902527650001802546650000902564650001302573650001402586650001502600650001902615650002202634650002302656700002502679700002402704700002202728700003002750700002602780700001602806700002302822700003202845700002202877773012202899856008503021852000903106655001203115IND60624751620221207073746.0181206e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062475162DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw4302doi7 aPMC62769442pmcid7 a275876582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabuzzetta, Charles J.10aComplementary feature selection from alternative splicing events and gene expression for phenotype prediction  ap. i421-i429.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotivation: A central task of bioinformatics is to develop sensitive and specific means of providing medical prognoses from biomarker patterns. Common methods to predict phenotypes in RNA-Seq datasets utilize machine learning algorithms trained via gene expression. Isoforms, however, generated from alternative splicing, may provide a novel and complementary set of transcripts for phenotype prediction. In contrast to gene expression, the number of isoforms increases significantly due to numerous alternative splicing patterns, resulting in a prioritization problem for many machine learning algorithms. This study identifies the empirically optimal methods of transcript quantification, feature engineering and filtering steps using phenotype prediction accuracy as a metric. At the same time, the complementary nature of gene and isoform data is analyzed and the feasibility of identifying isoforms as biomarker candidates is examined. Results: Isoform features are complementary to gene features, providing non-redundant information and enhanced predictive power when prioritized and filtered. A univariate filtering algorithm, which selects up to the N highest ranking features for phenotype prediction is described and evaluated in this study. An empirical comparison of pipelines for isoform quantification is reported by performing cross-validation prediction tests with datasets from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, human patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mice, each including samples of diseased and non-diseased phenotypes.

Merr.) is an indigenous fruit tree species of North-east (NE) India that yields pods of high economic value. for the preparation of many traditional recipes. In this study, we attempted to refine criteria for selection of superior genotypes of tree bean by developing a pod ideotype and matching it to 26 trees-selected by farmers in Manipur, India. The pod ideotype was developed based on seven pod characteristics, viz. seed size, pod length, seed number per pod, pod width, colour, aroma and harvest stage. T A significant variation was observed for all pod and seed traits amongst the selected trees. Pod width ranged from 23.4 to 33.0 mm, the number of seeds per pod from 7.6 to 19.1 and the seed diameter from 4.7 to 18.7 mm. The perentage of trees that possessed traits preferred by consumers ranged from 15.4% for colour to 73.1% for aroma. Out of the 26 trees that were identified, only one produced pods that were similar and two that were close to the ideotype. The need to refine selection criteria to include consumer preferences and farmer traits in tree domestication for enhancing marketability of products towards greater economic and social benefits is discussed.  aThe author(s) reported that there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkia timoriana 3abeans 3acolor 3aconsumer preferences 3adomestication 3aeconomic valuation 3afarmers 3afruit trees 3aideotypes 3aodors 3aseed size 3aIndia 0aAgroforestry 0aEconomic benefits 0aPod character 0aParkia roxburghii 0aTree morphology 0aSuperior genotype1 aN, Lyngdoh1 aVasudeva, R1 aMehra, T.S1 aMongjam, Bishwapati Devi1 aMomin, Kalkame Ch0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 31, no. 1 p.13-26dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2169x2164-30757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2021.20183613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010700171300001600278520178100294592002802075650001102103650001302114650001502127650002602142650002202168650002502190650001702215650001402232650001102246650001102257650002102268650002002289650002502309650001002334653002002344653002202364653002502386653002302411653002502434653002202459700001602481700001502497700001402512700001502526773011302541856008602654852000902740655001202749IND60563292920221120135736.0180831e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056329292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shuaicheng10aEvaluation of properties and performance of rubber-modified concrete for recycling of waste scrap tire  ap. 681-689.  aUsing rubber particles as concrete aggregates can reduce the environmental impacts caused by the large accumulation of scrap tires. However, the added rubber particles can decrease concrete strength due to their low stiffness and surface bonding with cement paste. This study aims to improve the rubber concrete performance by employing different surface treatment and coating methods. Particularly, two surface treatment methods (NaOH, and Silane Coupling Agent) and three coating techniques (coated with normal cement, blended cement with silica fume, and blended cement plus sodium silicate) were used to improve rubber-cement bonding. Totally, ten groups of rubber concrete samples were prepared by using difference treatment or rubber replacement ratio. In addition, the control concrete samples without rubber particles or with as-received rubber particles were prepared for the comparison. The compressive strength tests demonstrated the NaOH-solution treatment can significantly improve the rubber concrete strength by comparing with normal and as-received rubber concrete. Further tests indicated that the samples with 25% replacement can still fulfil the strength requirements for rigid pavement construction. The measured electrical resistivity of rubber concrete were higher than the normal concrete, which indicates lower permeability and better durability. The decreased thermal conductivity and sound transmission attenuation can increase building energy efficiency and reduce noise, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrated NaOH-treated methods can improve the mechanical performance of rubber concrete and enhance its long-term durability. This modified rubber concrete can be potentially applied to the pavement and structure construction applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3aconcrete 3adurability 3aelectrical resistance 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3apermeability 3arecycling 3arubber 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium silicate 3athermal conductivity 3atires 0aRubber concrete 0aSurface treatment 0aCompressive strength 0aTransport property 0aThermal conductivity 0aSound attenuation1 aDai, Qingli1 aSi, Ruizhe1 aSun, Xiao1 aLü, Chao,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 148 p.681-689dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001900186245008700205300001600292506007600308520061500384592002800999506003701027650001501064650002301079650002301102650002801125650002401153650001701177650001301194700002001207700002301227773009101250856004801341852000901389655001201398IND4480905220221207110434.0120323e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448090522DNAL7 a224344412pmid7 aPMC33577562pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-012-0276-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInganäs, Olle10aAlternating Copolymers and Alternative Device Geometries for Organic Photovoltaics  ap. 138-142.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe efficiency of conversion of light to electrical energy with the help of conjugated polymers and molecules is rapidly improving.

Here, it was used to screen and evaluate a series of synthesized compounds and the results indicated that compound T7 (N-{4′-[(1E)-N-hydroxyethanimidoyl]-3′,5,6-trimethoxybiphenyl-3-yl}-N′-[4-(3-morpholin-4-ylpropoxy)phenyl]urea) could effectively inhibit the blood vessels formation. Then the anti-angiogenic potential of T7 and its related molecular mechanisms against lung carcinoma in vitro and in vivo were investigated. Treatment with T7 significantly inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cells and A549 cells proliferation and migration. T7 reduced human umbilical vein endothelial cells tube formation as well. Western blotting analysis of cell signaling molecules indicated that T7 reduced phosphorylation of KDR and its downstream signaling players AKT and ERK1/2 activation in endothelial cells and A549 cells. Moreover, T7 inhibited tumor growth in A549 xenografted model of athymic mice and reduced CD34 expression levels in tumor-bearing mice by immunohistochemistry. In sum, our findings showed that T7 was a candidate of tumor angiogenesis inhibitors, and it functioned by interrupting the autophosphorylation of KDR, AKT and ERK1/2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3ablood vessels 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alung neoplasms 3amice 3amodels 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aurea 0aEC 0aVEGF 0aKDR 0aHUVECs 0aScreening 0aT7 0aInhibition 0aAngiogenesis 0aKDR 0aSignaling pathway1 aQi, Junpeng1 aLiu, Rui1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhan, Yingzhuan1 aZhang, Yanmin0 tPhytomedicine.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 21 p.1675-1683dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100005700191245019400248506007600442506003100518520179600549592002802345596003002373596004402403596002902447596004702476506003702523650002902560650001502589650002002604650001602624650002302640650001802663650001702681650001002698650001702708650000902725650001402734650001402748650003502762653001002797653001502807653002202822700001702844700006302861700005902924700005502983700005903038700005803097700001803155700001703173700002703190700001903217700005803236773010703294856008503401852000903486655001203495IND60763068120221207085448.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076306812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093342chorus7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Thea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2410-624010aExperimental infection of specific-pathogen-free domestic lambs with Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae causes asymptomatic colonization of the upper airways that is resistant to antibiotic treatment  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMycoplasma ovipneumoniae (M. ovipneumoniae) is a respiratory pathogen associated with mild to moderate respiratory disease in domestic lambs and severe pneumonia outbreaks in wild ruminants such as bighorn sheep. However, whether M. ovipneumoniae by itself causes clinical respiratory disease in domestic sheep in the absence of secondary bacterial pathogens is still unclear. The goal of our study was to better understand the role of M. ovipneumoniae as a respiratory pathogen in domestic sheep and to explore potential antibiotic treatment approaches. Therefore, we inoculated four 4-month-old, specific-pathogen-free lambs with fresh nasal wash fluids from M. ovipneumoniae-infected sheep. The lambs were monitored for M. ovipneumoniae colonization, M. ovipneumoniae-specific antibodies, clinical signs, and cellular and molecular correlates of lung inflammation for eight weeks. All lambs then were treated with gamithromycin and observed for an additional four weeks. M. ovipneumoniae inoculation resulted in stable colonization of the upper respiratory tract in all M. ovipneumoniae-inoculated, but in none of the four mock-infected control lambs. All M. ovipneumoniae-infected lambs developed a robust antibody response to M. ovipneumoniae within 2 weeks. However, we did not observe significant signs of respiratory disease, evidence of lung damage or inflammation in any of the infected lambs. Interestingly, treatment with gamithromycin, which blocked growth of the M. ovipneumoniae in vitro, failed to reduce M. ovipneumoniae colonization. These observations indicate that, in the absence of co-infections, M. ovipneumoniae caused asymptomatic colonization of the upper respiratory tract that was resistant to clearance by the host immune response and by gamithromycin treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  cJohnson Family Foundation  cMontana Agricultural Experiment Station  cMontana State University  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycoplasma ovipneumoniae 3aOvis aries 3aOvis canadensis 3aantibiotics 3aantibody formation 3agamithromycin 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amicrobiology 3anose 3apathogens 3apneumonia 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 0aSheep 0aMycoplasma 0aRespiratory tract1 aJones, Kerri1 aJacobson, B.

Key actors, flow of products and product information, and relationship among actors were assessed using content analysis. Results suggest that the nuts are picked or harvested from either wild or cultivated kola trees by farmers or pickers. The nuts are then processed or cured for storage by either the farmers, pickers or brokers who buy harvested kola pods for assemblers. The assemblers either sell to local consumers or on large markets in neighbouring countries like Nigeria. The business model for the kola nut industry in Ghana is such that transactions are usually on mutual trust and verbal agreements without any documented evidence. There is limited market information, which often hinders price negotiation, and this affects especially producers and processors. For improving the value chain for mutual benefit among the actors, especially for producers, we recommend the formation of a strong horizontal linkage through avenues, such as associations as well as strong vertical and consistent linkages between the actors.  aThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCola nitida 3aeconometric models 3afocus groups 3aindustry 3akola nuts 3amarkets 3aprices 3aqualitative analysis 3asupply chain 3aGhana 3aNigeria 0aBusiness-model 0ahorizontal-linkage 0asupply-chain 0afarmers 0aprocessors1 aOduro, Solomon Sefa1 aAsani, Moses1 aDoe, Eric Kofi0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 31, no. 1 p.54-70dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2169x2164-30757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2022.20398843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011800178300001800296520196800314592002802282650002002310650002802330650001902358650001502377650002002392650001002412650002602422650001302448650001102461650001902472650001402491650001302505650002302518650001502541700002202556700001802578700002202596700002202618700002202640700001802662773012202680856008502802852000902887655001202896IND60624751920221117004821.0181206e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062475192DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw4332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmmad-ud-din, Muhammad10aDrug response prediction by inferring pathway-response associations with kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization  ap. i455-i463.  aMotivation : A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients. This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can effectively model and predict drug responses. Results : In this study, we propose a novel formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF) method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly available cancer datasets as well as on a synthetic dataset. In addition, we validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by the proposed model for the well-known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.

We have previously shown that the 43 kDa outer membrane protein (43 K OMP) of F. necrophorum is a porin protein that plays an important role in bacterial infections; however, the molecular mechanisms by which this protein mediates adhesion remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of 43 K OMP in F. necrophorum adhesion to bovine epithelial cells using 43 K OMP-deficient mutants, and identified the protein that interacts with 43 K OMP by immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry. Our results indicated that the native 43 K OMP and recombinant 43 K OMP could bind to the cell membrane of MAC-T or bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs). When F. necrophorum was preincubated with antibodies against the recombinant 43 K OMP or bovine epithelial cells were preincubated with 43 K OMP, the adhesion of F. necrophorum to MAC-T or BEECs decreased significantly (P<0.01). We successfully constructed a 43 K OMP-deficient strain (A25Δ43 K OMP) and bacterial attachment to MAC-T or BEECs was significantly higher with the F. necrophorum A25 strain than with mutant strain A25Δ43 K OMP (P<0.01). The deficiency of 43 K OMP reduced the binding of F. necrophorum to bovine epithelial cells by 90.5 %–94.9 %. Among the 39 potential differential proteins, fibronectin, collagen and myosin were selected as the target proteins, and direct interaction between 43 K OMP of F. necrophorum and fibronectin was demonstrated. Taken together, these results suggest that 43 K OMP plays a key role in adhesion of F. necrophorum to bovine epithelial cells through its interaction with fibronectin. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the pathogenic mechanism of F. necrophorum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusobacterium necrophorum 3aadhesion 3abacterial adhesion 3acattle 3acell membranes 3acollagen 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3afibronectins 3amutants 3amyosin 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogens 3aporins 3aspectroscopy 0aFusobacterium necrophorum 0a43K OMP 0aBacterial adhesion 0aFibronectin1 aJiang, Kai1 aXiao, Jiawei1 aLian, Shuai1 aChen, Yaping1 aWu, Rui1 aWang, Lina1 aSun, Dongbo1 aGuo, Donghua0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Mar., v. 266 p.109335-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245005900198300001800257506007600275520136400351592002801715506003701743650001101780650001601791650001101807650001101818650002301829700001901852700001701871773012101888856007502009852000902084655001202093IND60558202920221207134628.0161111e20120726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055820292DNAL7 a10.1021/jp300312u2doi7 aPMC35476122pmcid7 a224488472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Daoguang,10afSUB: Normal Mode Analysis with Flexible Substructures  ap. 8636-8645.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this paper, we report a novel normal-mode analysis for supramolecular complexes, named fSUB. The method models a complex as a group of flexible substructures. The low-frequency substructure modes are first determined with substructures in isolation, and the motions of the whole complex are then calculated on the basis of substructure modes and substructure–substructure interactions. The calculation of modes in fSUB requires modal analysis without initial energy minimization, which is essential for maintaining energetic and structural consistency between substructures and whole complex. Compared with other coarse-grained methods, such as the RTB method, fSUB delivers much more accurate modes for the complex and allows for the choice of much larger substructures. The method can also accommodate any type of substructure arrangement including covalent bonds across the interface. In tests on molecular chaperonin GroEL (7350 residues) and HK97 capsid complex (118 092 residues), fSUB was shown to be much more efficient in terms of combined accuracy and demand of computing resources. Our results clearly demonstrated the vital importance of including substructure flexibility in complex modal analysis, as the deformational patterns of substructures were found to play an important role even in the lowest frequency modes of the whole complex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapsid 3achaperonins 3aenergy 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry1 aMing, Dengming1 aMa, Jianpeng0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 July 26, v. 116, no. 29 p.8636-8645dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp300312u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164300001600280520142500296592002801721650000801749650001101757650002201768650001701790650002301807653003101830653002001861653002701881653002301908653001601931653002001947700001601967700001601983700002001999773009702019856008502116852000902201655001202210IND60689104320221121015807.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068910432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yi10aPerformance evaluation for scientific balloon station-keeping strategies considering energy management strategy  ap. 290-302.  aThe combination of solar array and rechargeable battery is the main trend of energy system for scientific balloon station-keeping, when the performances of station-keeping strategies are evaluated, energy problem should be considered. In this paper, the performances of air ballast system and double balloon system are evaluated with the consideration of energy management strategy. The theoretical model consisting of thermal model, solar array power model, energy consumption model and energy evaluation model is proposed. The energy management strategy containing solar array and lithium battery is designed. Based on the theoretical model and energy management strategy, a MATLAB program is developed. The feasibility is verified by comparison analysis. The energy harvesting characteristics, effects of the station-keeping duration and effects of the station-keeping region radius are analyzed carefully. The results show that the double balloon is superior than air ballast system from the perspective of energy. The air ballast system requires more energy than double balloon system and the energy difference increases over time. Air ballast system lithium battery capacity requirement is higher than double balloon system, the total energy consumption and the energy differences decrease with expected radius increasing. It would be helpful in selecting station-keeping strategies for scientific balloon mission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3alithium batteries 3asolar energy 3atheoretical models 0aEnergy management strategy 0aLithium battery 0aPerformance evaluation 0aScientific balloon 0aSolar array 0aStation-keeping1 aLv, Mingyun1 aQu, Zhipeng1 aZhang, Lanchuan0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 156 p.290-302dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012600167520152100293592002801814650003101842650001001873650001001883650001101893650001401904650004801918650001701966650001301983650001801996650002202014650001002036651001602046653002502062653000802087653001502095653003402110653001302144700001802157700005802175773010702233856008502340852000902425655001202434IND60763068320221120072133.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076306832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gi Yong10aCo-occurrence of cfr-mediated linezolid-resistance in ST398 LA-MRSA and non-aureus staphylococci isolated from a pig farm  aLinezolid resistance, mediated by the cfr gene, which confers resistant phenotypes to phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A antimicrobials, has emerged in S. aureus and non-aureus staphylococci (NAS). Moreover, due to the transferable potential via plasmids, the spread of cfr among staphylococci is of great concern. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of cfr-mediated linezolid resistance in ST398 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and NAS strains isolated from a pig farm. Among the 26 staphylococci isolates collected from a pig farm, 14 cfr-harboring ST398 MRSA and NAS (S. epidermidis, S. pasteuri, S. cohnii, and S. rostri) strains were resistant to linezolid and also carried the fexA gene. Comparative genome analysis of cfr-carrying linezolid-resistant ST398 MRSA and NAS (S. pasteuri, S. cohnii, and S. epidermidis) strains revealed that the segments harboring cfr in different staphylococcal strains showed ≥ 99 % sequence identity and the corresponding region containing the cfr, fexA, and Tn558 elements were located in a 38-kb plasmid, designated pSA12 of ST398 MRSA. These observations indicate that the cfr-carrying plasmids and/or fragments may be disseminated among staphylococci in a pig farm and possibly transmitted to staphylococci of human origin, subsequently posing a threat to public health. This is the first report of the co-existence of cfr in linezolid-resistant ST398 MRSA and NAS isolated from a pig farm in South Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3afarms 3agenes 3ahumans 3alinezolid 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amicrobiology 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3aSouth Korea 0aLinezolid resistance 0aCfr 0aST398 MRSA 0aNon-aureusstaphylococci (NAS) 0aPig farm1 aKim, Geun-Bae1 aYang, Soo Jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3253-81900 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Mar., v. 266 p.109336-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012900178300001600307500001500323520079000338592002801128650002501156650001501181650002701196653003201223653001301255653002701268653002401295653003801319653001701357653001201374700002201386700001801408700002801426700001901454773011801473856008701591852000901678655001201687IND50067282720221119215930.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006728272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorrecilla, José S.,10aSelf-organizing maps based on chaotic parameters to detect adulterations of extra virgin olive oil with inferior edible oils  ap. 400-405.  a2019-12-06  aA nonlinear algorithm based on chaotic parameters (CPs) has been employed to determine the nature of different output signals obtained from UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV) measurements. These signals come from UV scans of adulterated samples of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with refined olive oil or refined olive pomace oil, or from pure samples of EVOO with white random or sinusoidal white random noises. The data collected from this equipment was used to calculate CP values. Then, a self-organizing map was used to detect different types of signals. Using this method, the signals can be identified and classified into five groups depending on their type, the percentage of noise added, and the concentration of adulterant agents, with a misclassification rate of less than 1.3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3aalgorithms 3aextra-virgin olive oil 0aUnsupervised neural network 0aUV–vis 0aExtra virgin olive oil 0aLow grade olive oil 0aLag-k autocorrelation coefficient 0aNoisy signal 0aoutputs1 aCancilla, John C.1 aMatute, Gemma1 aDíaz-Rodríguez, Pablo1 aFlores, Ana I.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Oct., v. 118, no. 4 p.400-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001600309520141400325592002801739650001501767650001701782650001201799650001401811650001801825650001601843650001201859650001101871650002901882650001801911653003901929653003401968653003302002653002002035653001702055700001302072700001702085700001802102773009702120856008502217852000902302655001202311IND60689104520221121015808.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068910452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shengtao10aImportance of platform mounting orientation of Y-shaped semi-submersible floating wind turbines: A case study by using surrogate models  ap. 260-278.  aThe Y-shaped semi-submersible platform, which is generally composed of three outer columns and one center column that are connected by a Y-shaped pontoon, is the one of the popular foundation concepts for floating wind turbines (FWTs). Because of its non-fully-symmetrical configuration, the directionality effects of ocean climate play a significant role in the dynamic response of the floating system, which indicates that the platform mounting orientation (PMO) should be comprehensively considered before installation at sea. This paper aims at evaluating the importance of PMO from the perspective of lifetime dynamic performance. However, simulating all the short-term conditions from a 25-year met-ocean database is computationally unaffordable. So, limited representative load cases are selected by maximum dissimilarity algorithm and reproduced in FAST, a coupled nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulator for FWTs. After calibrating and validating four surrogate models based on 1-year fully simulated results, the Kriging model are adopted to construct lifetime responses. Finally, statistics of five indexes reflect the system performance show that the floating system behaves variously between four PMOs due to the distinct hydrodynamic properties. These findings demonstrate the importance of PMO and provide a guidance for the installation of Y-shaped semisubmersible floating wind turbines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adatabases 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydroponics 3akriging 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3awind turbines 0aY-shaped semi-submersible platform 0aPlatform mounting orientation 0aLifetime dynamic performance 0aSurrogate model 0aInstallation1 aLi, Chao1 aXiao, Yiqing1 aCheng, Po Wen0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 156 p.260-278dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003800148245009500186300001200281520146500293592002801758596007301786650002901859650001001888650001501898650001701913650001801930650001701948650001601965650001801981650000901999650001902008650000902027650001802036650001702054650002102071650001302092650002102105650001402126650001602140650001602156700003602172700007402208700003202282700002602314700003402340700002002374700004102394700003702435773013302472856008302605852000902688655001202697IND60728179320221117062156.0220306e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072817932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02619-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida Rego, Fabiola Cristine10aViability of the use of mycotoxin adsorbent in the finishing of Texel lambs in confinement  ap. 170.  aThe objective of the present study was to evaluate the viability of a mycotoxin adsorbent based on beta-glucans from cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bentonites in the diets of confined lambs of the Texel breed. Twenty-four lambs (12 males and 12 females) with an average weight of 18.6 kg ± 1.6 were divided into two groups: treated (with adsorbent) and control. The animal diets contained the mycotoxins aflatoxin B1, fumonisin B1 and B2, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol in concentrations within guidance levels. The animals were slaughtered with body weight of approximately 26.4 kg. The performance and carcass variables of the lambs were evaluated. The daily weight gain was higher in the treated group (216.24 g) than in the control group (185.90 g). The averages for loin eye area, subcutaneous fat thickness, and marbling were 13.93 cm², 2.66 mm, and 3.20 in the treated group and 12.16 cm², 2.6 mm, and 3.25 in the control group, respectively. The true, hot, and cold carcass yield, and the carcass cooling losses did not differ between groups. The carcasses were similar in conformation and fat finishing degree, with averages of 3.95 and 3.83, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of a mycotoxin additive in the diet of finishing lambs. The use of mycotoxin adsorbent in confined lambs was feasible, and its use resulted in greater daily weight gain in lambs and average net profit.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTexel 3aadsorbents 3aaflatoxin B1 3aanimal health 3abeta-glucans 3abody weight 3acarcass yield 3acold 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiet 3afat thickness 3afumonisin B1 3aloins (meat cut) 3amarbling 3asubcutaneous fat 3aviability 3aweight gain 3azearalenone1 aSavio, Pedro Leonardo Olszewski1 aPertile, Simone Fernanda Nedel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-37561 ados Santos, Joice Sifuentes1 aEleodoro, Josiane Ito1 aTeixeira, Alfredo Jorge Costa1 aZundt, Marilice1 ada Cunha Filho, Luiz Fernando Coelho1 aBarreto, José Victor Pronievicz0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Mar., v. 53, no. 1 p.170-170dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02619-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001600292520138000308592002801688650000801716650002201724650002201746650001801768650001301786650002101799650001701820650002101837650001901858653002101877653001301898653002301911653001801934653001901952653002601971700002801997700001702025700002202042700002102064700002602085773010902111856008602220852000902306655001202315IND60524475920221122210614.0190318e20160905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052447592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHribernik, Silvo10aTuning of cellulose fibres’ structure and surface topography: Influence of swelling and various drying procedures  ap. 227-235.  aPresented study deals with the pre-treatment of cellulose fibres with the aim to activate their surface and to enlarge their pore system, leading to an enhancement of fibres’ affinity for subsequent functionalization processes. Swelling of fibres in aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide opens their fibrillar structure, while freezing and freeze-drying retain this enlargement of the pore system, in contrast with conventional air or elevated temperature drying. Effect of different pre-treatment procedures on fibres’ supramolecular structure, enlargement of their pore system, surface topography, zeta potential and mechanical properties was investigated. Degree of enhancement of the pore system depends on the concentration of sodium hydroxide and type of freezing; higher alkali concentrations are more effective, but at the cost of extensive deterioration of mechanical properties. Swelling of fibres in lower concentrations of NaOH, in combination with freeze drying, offers an acceptable compromise between enhancement of the fibres’ pore system, changes in surface potential and tensile properties of treated fibres.

The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) plays a major role in angiogenesis and blocking of its signaling inhibits neovascularization and tumor metastasis. Immunotoxins are promising therapeutics for targeted cancer therapy. They consist of an antibody linked to a protein toxin and are designed to specifically kill the tumor cells. In our previous study, VGRNb-PE immunotoxin protein containing anti-VEGFR2 nanobody fused to the truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A has been established. Here, we expressed this immunotoxin in lettuce chloroplasts. Chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, multigene engineering in a single transformation event and maternal inheritance of the transgenes. Site specific integration of transgene into chloroplast genomes, and homoplasmy were confirmed. Immunotoxin levels reached up to 1.1% of total soluble protein or 33.7 µg per 100 mg of leaf tissue (fresh weight). We demonstrated that transgenic immunotoxin efficiently causes the inhibition of VEGFR2 overexpression, cell growth and proliferation. These results indicate that plant chloroplasts are a suitable compartment for synthesizing recombinant immunotoxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aPseudomonas 3aangiogenesis 3aantibodies 3ablood vessels 3acell growth 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3aengineering 3aexotoxins 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3alettuce 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atransgenes 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-21 aJalali-Javaran, Mokhtar1 aMoieni, Ahmad1 aZeinali, Sirous1 aBehdani, Mahdi0 tPlant molecular biology.g2018 May, v. 97, no. 1-2 p.103-112dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-018-0726-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245015100181300001600332520179300348592002802141650001602169650002402185650001802209650001102227650002602238650002702264650004902291650002202340650000902362650004402371650001902415650001302434650002202447650001802469650001502487650001302502650002202515650002002537653002402557653003602581653002302617653002402640653000802664700002502672700002002697700001902717700002202736700001902758773009002777856009002867852000902957655001202966IND60592253520221121064716.0200607e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059225352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakeri Yekta, Sepehr10aPretreatment of anaerobic digester samples by hydrochloric acid for solution-state 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic characterization of organic matter  ap. 201-209.  aPretreatment of anaerobic digester samples by hydrochloric acid (HCl) resulted in removal of Fe-based mineral and coordination compounds, attenuating their interferences with solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic characterization of the solid phase organic matter. Substrate (influent) and digestate (effluent) samples from two full-scale anaerobic digesters, designated CD (co-digester) and SSD (sewage sludge digester), were investigated. Pretreatment of CD samples with 0.2–2.0 mol l⁻¹ HCl and pretreatment of SSD samples with 1.0–3.0 mol l⁻¹ HCl removed 96–100% and 76–80% of total Fe, respectively. Pretreatment declined overall paramagnetic characteristics of digestate samples, manifested by 50% (CD) and 70% (SSD) decrease in electron paramagnetic resonance signal intensities. As a result, meaningful solution-state ¹H,¹³C heteronuclear single quantum coherence and ¹H NMR spectra of DMSO-d₆ soluble organic matter could be acquired. Sample pretreatment with the lowest concentration of HCl resulted in alteration of C:N ratios in solid phase, likely due to removal of labile organic and inorganic C- and N-containing compounds, while elevating the HCl concentration did not further change the C:N ratios. Furthermore, sample pretreatment increased the solubility of carbohydrates and proteins in DMSO-d₆, enabling the detection of NMR resonances from certain structural units of carbohydrates (e.g. anomeric O₂CH) and proteins (e.g. CHα in amino acids). Both attenuation of the paramagnetic matrix as well as an enhanced solubility of carbohydrate and protein fractions of the samples in DMSO-d₆ solvent contributed to an improved molecular characterization of anaerobic digester samples by solution-state NMR analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aanaerobic digesters 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acoordination compounds 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrochloric acid 3airon 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3aproteins 3aquantum mechanics 3asewage sludge 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aOrganic matter characterization 0aSolution-state NMR 0aSample pretreatment 0aHCl1 aHedenström, Mattias1 aStehr, Jan Eric1 aDario, Mårten1 aHertkorn, Norbert1 aBjörn, Annika0 tChemosphere.g2018 May, v. 199 p.201-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001100297500001900308520150000327592002801827650000801855650002301863650001201886650001601898650002201914650001701936650001601953650002901969650001301998650001402011650001502025650001402040650001602054650001902070650001302089650001002102700002002112700002102132700002102153700002402174700002402198773013902222856008302361852000902444655001202453IND60728179520221117062149.0210325e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072817952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-021-05038-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChtouki, Mohamed10aEffect of Cadmium and Phosphorus Interaction on Tomato: Chlorophyll a Fluorescence, Plant Growth, and Cadmium Translocation  ap. 84.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCadmium (Cd) is considered one of the heavy metals disturbing plant biophysiological functions. The potential role of phosphorus (P) nutrition in the attenuation of Cd effects on photosynthetic efficiency, plant growth, and cadmium uptake has been investigated in hydroponically grown tomato. Two P nutrition regimes (P15: 15 mg l⁻¹; P30: 30 mg l⁻¹) were assessed in the presence or absence of Cd (Cd0: 0 μM; Cd25: 25 μM of CdCl₂). The results showed a positive effect of P30 concentration on leaf chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence compared to P15 treatment under Cd stress (Cd25). The disturbance of electron transfer caused by Cd at K and I-steps of OJIP transient was attenuated with sufficient P supply. P30 enhanced the performance index of photosystem II and the efficiency of electron transfer to electron acceptor at PSI acceptor side. Besides, increased P concentration improved root growth parameters and biomass accumulation in the presence of Cd. It was found that root tissues accumulated more Cd than shoots and Cd translocation was reduced with increasing P concentration. Our results reveal that Cd-P interaction induced a cascade of physiological and chemical changes in plants. An optimal P nutrition can attenuate Cd stress on plant by the promotion of nitrogen and potassium uptake, which in return improved photosynthesis efficiency, enhanced biomass accumulation and distribution, and minimized Cd accumulation and translocation in plant tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3ahydroponics 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aroot growth 3asoil pollution 3atomatoes 3awater1 aNaciri, Rachida1 aSoulaimani, Aziz1 aZeroual, Youssef1 aEl Gharous, Mohamed1 aOukarroum, Abdallah0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2021 Mar., v. 232, no. 3 p.84-84dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05038-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245015400168300002000322520181800342592002802160650001802188650001402206650001102220650001702231650002402248650002002272650002202292653003202314653002402346653002502370653003202395653002302427653001802450653001702468653002302485700004102508700003102549700001602580700002502596773012602621856008002747852000902827655001202836IND60528386620221123042127.0160716e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b038772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangaraj, Balusamy12aA Facile Method to Modify the Characteristics and Corrosion Behavior of 304 Stainless Steel by Surface Nanostructuring toward Biomedical Applications  ap. 17731-17747.  aThe study addresses how surface nanostructuring of AISI 304 stainless steel (SS) by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) influences its characteristic properties and corrosion behavior in Ringer’s solution. SMAT of 304 SS induced plastic deformation, enabled surface nanocrystallization, refined the grain size, transformed the austenite phase to strain induced α′-martensite phase, increased the surface roughness, induced defects/dislocations, imparted compressive residual stresses at the surface, decreased the contact angle, and increased surface energy. The change in properties of 304 SS following treatment using 5 and 8 mm ⌀ balls for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min has caused a deleterious influence on its corrosion resistance in Ringer’s solution, while an improvement in corrosion behavior is observed for those treated using 2 mm ⌀ balls. The increase in surface roughness, transformation of the austenite to α′-martensite phase, a higher extent of deformation, and the presence of larger number of defects/dislocations are main factors responsible for the lower corrosion resistance observed for 304 SS treated using 5 and 8 mm ⌀ balls in Ringer’s solution. In spite of having these attributes with a relatively lower extent, 304 SS treated using 2 mm ⌀ balls offered a better corrosion resistance and exhibits a better passivity. For those treated using 2 mm ⌀ balls, the ability of the nanocrystalline surface to promote passivation outweighs the deleterious influences caused by the limited amount of deformation and defects/dislocations. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommend that SMAT of 304 SS using 2 mm ⌀ balls for 15–30 min is the optimum condition to achieve the suitable surface profile, surface characteristics with better corrosion resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3ananocrystals 3aplastic deformation 3astainless steel 3asurface roughness 0asurface nanocrystallization 0aplastic deformation 0aphase transformation 0acompressive residual stress 0asurface topography 0acontact angle 0adislocations 0acorrosion behavior1 aT.

The co-infection with both bacteria was the commonest epidemiological finding associated with a greater disease severity. There was a statistically significant association (p = 0.002) between footrot-affected flocks and the presence of D. nodosus.

To date, information about the emergence of the oxazolidinone resistance gene optrA in isolates from goats is scare. In this study, the optrA-positive multiresistant E. faecalis strain SY-1 was isolated from a goat in China. E. faecalis strain SY-1 displayed a multidrug resistance profile for most of antimicrobial agents tested, including linezolid and tedizolid. MLST analysis showed that E. faecalis strain SY-1 belonged to the high-risk clone ST16. Whole genome sequencing analysis revealed that the optrA gene together with several other resistance genes was located on a novel RepA_N-family plasmid pSY-1-optrA. Detailed sequence analysis indicated that pSY-1-optrA exhibited a mosaic structure that may be the result of recombination events. In addition, a mobile bacitracin resistance operon bcrABDR was identified on plasmid pSY-1-optrA. In conclusion, this is, to our knowledge, the first report of the optrA gene in the high-risk clone E. faecalis ST16 of goat origin. Active surveillance of optrA-positive E. faecalis high-risk clones in food-producing animals is urgently warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3abacitracin 3agoats 3alinezolid 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3aresistance genes 3asequence analysis 3aChina 0aOxazolidinone 0aoptrA 0aE.

Despite the positive agro-environmental and cultural benefits, within the last decade, they are not considered economically profitable. The present study surveys the farmers’ attitudes towards agroforestry practices, and more specifically, the cultivation of chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.). With the assistance of different econometric models, we attempted to unveil the profile of chestnut growers, their opinion on the environmental impact of the crop adoption, the determinants of the criteria they considered for its selection, as well as the cultivation practices they apply in a purely agricultural region of northern Greece. Insight into these issues may well provide policy makers with tools to promote the adoption of chestnut and other forest species in agriculture, with the aim of ensuring protection of the ecosystem, as well as improvements in agricultural income and therefore incorporating the concept of sustainability in agricultural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural income 3aagroforestry 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3asustainable agriculture 3aGreece 0aLand use change 0arisk perception 0aCastanea1 aChatzissavvidis, Christos1 aAntonopoulou, Chrysovalantou1 aArabatzis, Garyfallos0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 20, no. 2 p.199-215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.19239123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001400263520111600277592002801393650002201421650004401443650001401487650002201501650001601523650001801539650001901557650001101576650001801587650001901605650001101624650003301635650002001668653003101688653002001719653003101739653001301770700006801783700002901851773010701880856008601987852000902073655001202082IND60524476120221122210652.0190318e20160905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052447612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Loo Yu10aCharacterisation of microcrystalline cellulose from oil palm fibres for food applications  ap. 11-20.  aMicrocrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from empty fruit bunches (EFB), stalk and spikelet were characterised through physicochemical and microstructure analyses. Raw stalk fibres yielded the highest cellulose content (42.43%), followed by EFB (32.33%) and spikelet (18.83%). Likewise, lowest lignin and residual oil content was reported in raw stalk fibres compared to EFB and spikelet. SEM revealed significant changes on fibres’ surface morphology throughout the extraction process. FTIR analysis showed that main characteristic peaks of hemicellulose and lignin was absent on the extracted MCC. The crystallinity index for MCC extracted from EFB (82.5%), stalk (82.2%) and spikelet (86.5%) was comparable to commercial MCC (81.9%). Results suggested stalk fibres is more preferable for the production of MCC compared to EFB and spikelet. Further rheological studies showed viscoelastic behaviour with no significant differences between commercial and stalk-based MCC, while modelling work showed ability to simulate complex deformation of the MCC-hydrogel/food mixture during processing/handling stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adeformation 3ahemicellulose 3ainflorescences 3alignin 3alipid content 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviscoelasticity 0aMicrocrystalline cellulose 0aOil palm fibres 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aRheology1 aP.

Numerous literatures can be found on the topic of PV fault detection through the implementation of artificial intelligence. The novel part of this research is the successful development, deployment and validation of a fault detection PV system using radial basis function (RBF), requiring only two parameters as the input to the ANN (solar irradiance and output power). The results obtained through the testing of the developed ANN on a PV installation of 2.2 kW capacity, provided an accuracy of 97.9%. To endorse the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm, the ANN was tested on another PV system, installed at a remote location. The total capacity of the new system was significantly higher, 4.16 kW. A vital part of the test was to see how the proposed ANN would perform with ‘scaled-up’ input data, during normal operation as well as partial shading scenarios. The validation process provided an overall fault detection accuracy of above 97%. The decrease in accuracy was due to the varying nature of the two systems in terms of total capacity, number of samples and type of faults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aneural networks 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0aPhotovoltaics 0aFault detection 0aArtificial intelligence 0aRBF Network1 aDhimish, Mahmoud1 aTitarenko, Sofya1 aMather, Peter0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.1272-1292dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245014900157300001400306520095100320592002801271653002601299653001901325653001901344653001201363653002701375653002801402653001901430653002001449653002301469700002401492700002301516700001501539773012401554856007301678852000901751655001201760IND60129325320221121131112.0151124e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012932532DNAL7 a10.1898/10-13.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowers, Breanna14aThe Influence of Cattle Grazing on Pocket Gophers in the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains, California: Potential Implications for Great Gray Owls  ap. 13-18.  aGreat Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa) in the Sierra Nevada Mountains feed primarily on rodents, especially voles and pocket gophers. Voles have been shown to be negatively affected by cattle grazing, but effects of grazing on gophers in the Sierra Nevada Mountains are unknown. We investigated the effects of grazing on pocket gophers (Thomomys monticola and T. bottae) in 21 grazed and 21 ungrazed montane meadow sites in the central Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Pocket gopher densities were significantly higher in grazed meadows than ungrazed meadows. Vegetation cover and height, thatch depth, and the frequency of sedge occurrence were higher in ungrazed meadows and there were negative correlations between pocket gopher densities and these vegetation variables. We suggest that potential negative effects of grazing on Great Gray Owls could be minimized by managing meadow vegetation commensurate with the habitat needs of their prey.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBotta's Pocket Gopher 0acattle grazing 0aGreat Gray Owl 0ameadows 0aMountain Pocket Gopher 0aSierra Nevada Mountains 0aStrix nebulosa 0aThomomys bottae 0aThomomys monticola1 aJohnson, Matthew D.1 aLaManna, Joseph A.1 aRich, Adam0 tNorthwestern naturalist.g2011 Mar., v. 92, no. 1 p.13-18dSociety for Northwestern Vertebrate Biologyx1051-17337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1898%2F10-13.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007400164300002000238520168200258592002801940650004401968650001302012650001702025650001302042650001802055650002202073650001902095650002302114650001602137653002602153653002402179653002702203653002702230653001402257653003702271700002402308700001802332700002102350700002202371700002402393773012902417856007802546852000902624655001202633IND60528386820221123042119.0160716e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b039702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSygletou, Maria10aEnhanced Stability of Aluminum Nanoparticle-Doped Organic Solar Cells  ap. 17756-17764.  aEnhancement of the stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported by the addition of surfactant-free aluminum (Al) nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer. The universality of the effect is demonstrated for two different BHJ systems, namely, the well-studied poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as well as the high efficient poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC₇₁BM). It is shown that the lifetime of the devices with Al NPs, operating under continuous one-sun illumination in ambient conditions, is more than three times longer compared to the reference devices. Using complementary analytical techniques for in situ studies, we have explored the underlying mechanisms behind the observed stability improvement in the case of the P3HT:PCBM system. In particular, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), photoluminescence decay and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments were performed and complemented with device degradation electrical measurements. It is found that the embedded Al NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability of the active blend. Furthermore, it is revealed that the observed improvement can also be ascribed to NP-mediated mitigation of the photo-oxidation effect. This study addresses a major issue in OPV devices, that is, photoinduced stability, indicating that the exploitation of Al NPs could be a successful approach toward fabricating OPVs exhibiting long-term operating lifetimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3afluorescence 3alighting 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotooxidation 3aphotovoltaic cells 3astabilizers 0aorganic photovoltaics 0abulk heterojunction 0aaluminum nanoparticles 0adegradation mechanisms 0astability 0ain situ characterization methods1 aKakavelakis, George1 aPaci, Barbara1 aGenerosi, Amanda1 aKymakis, Emmanuel1 aStratakis, Emmanuel0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Aug. 19, v. 7, no. 32 p.17756-17764dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b039703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245009300132300001400225520129600239592002801535650002601563650001601589650001101605650001701616650002501633650001001658650001001668650002001678650001101698650001801709650000901727650002301736650001201759650001401771651001001785653002201795653001901817653002201836653001501858653001601873700001501889700001701904773014701921852000902068655001202077IND60710035720221121222343.0200908e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071003572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Nilotpal10aIncome Generation through Broiler Rabbits (Oryctolagus Cuniculus) Rearing in West Bengal  ap. 60-62.  aEconomics of rearing two meat type rabbits in hot humid conditions of West Bengal was undertaken. The animals were maintained in galvanized iron wire cages under routine farm feeding and health care management. Net annual return per doe was estimated with an aim to compare efficiency of the two breeds. Four crops were produced per year in both the breeds. The total numbers of kits born and survived up to the age of slaughter in a year were more in Grey Giant than Soviet Chinchilla. The individual live weight at slaughter was slightly more in Soviet Chinchilla than Grey Giant, but total weight of surviving youngs at this stage was more in Grey Giant than Soviet Chinchilla. This might be due to more number of kits born and survived at this stage in Grey Giant rabbits. Considering the selling price of rabbits on live weight basis and cost of feeds involved, an amount of Rs.221.25 may be expected from a Soviet Chinchilla doe and Rs.295.00 from a Grey Giant doe during a period of one year indicating better economic performance of the latter breed. The rabbit husbandry can be successfully advocated especially for the poorer section of the society for generating their subsidiary income and improving family nutrition status as it calls for low input and easy husbandry practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3abody weight 3abreeds 3acage rearing 3aeconomic performance 3afarms 3afeeds 3ahealth services 3aincome 3amarket prices 3ameat 3anutritional status 3arabbits 3aslaughter 3aIndia 0aIncome generation 0aBroiler rabbit 0aSoviet Chinchilla 0aGrey Giant 0aWest Bengal1 aMandal, L.1 aBiswas, C.K.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.60-62dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245007900197300001800276500002000294520158700314592002801901596011301929596006002042596006002102596005402162650001702216650001702233650001502250650002002265650001302285650002502298651001002323700005802333700005602391700002702447700001802474700001802492700005602510773013202566856007702698852000902775655001202784IND60789901120221116143750.0220822e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078990112DNAL7 a10.1029/2017JB0153642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9184-078210aExtracting Induced and Remanent Magnetizations From Magnetic Data Modeling  ap. 9290-9309.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo investigate the crustal magnetic structure, it is important to assess the susceptibility and remanence properties of rocks and ores. In this paper, we propose a method to extract the contributions of induced and remanent magnetization from modeling of magnetic anomalies. We first estimate the direction of the total magnetization vector by studying the reduced‐to‐pole anomaly and its correlation with different magnitude magnetic transforms. Then we invert the magnetic data to obtain the volumetric distribution of the magnetization intensity. As the third step, based on a priori information about the Koenigsberger ratio derived from petrophysical measurements, we extract the distributions in the source volume of the induced and remanent magnetization intensities, based on a generalized relationship involving the total and remanent magnetizations, and the true susceptibility. In this way, we are able to produce separate maps of the anomaly fields attributed to the physical magnetic source parameters: remanent and induced magnetization. After validating the method with synthetic data, we analyze the data relative to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic igneous rocks in Yeshan region, eastern China. The analysis of the separated magnetization components reveals that the intrusion of dioritic and basaltic rocks occurred at different geological periods, and the basaltic rocks were magnetized by a reversed geomagnetic field. The uncertainty analysis shows that a larger Koenigsberger ratio is beneficial to extract more reliable remanence and susceptibility information.  aPublisher supplied data  aCUGL170407cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)  a41874122cNational Natural Sciences Foundation of China  a41604087cNational Natural Sciences Foundation of China  a2016YFC0600109cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aCenozoic era 3aMesozoic era 3ageophysics 3amagnetic fields 3aresearch 3auncertainty analysis 3aChina1 aFedi, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-22711 aHu, Xiangyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3623-83041 aBaniamerian, Jamaledin1 aWei, Bangshun1 aZhang, Dalian1 aZhu, Rixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4985-925X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Nov., v. 123, no. 11 p.9290-9309dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JB0153643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001700185245018100202300002000383506007600403520136000479592002801839506003701867650001601904650002401920650001401944650001501958650000901973650001901982650003102001650001902032650001302051650001802064650001402082650002102096653003802117653001102155653002302166653005502189700001602244700001402260700002202274773012602296856008002422852000902502655001202511IND60528386920221207094508.0160716e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b039982doi7 aPMC46716342pmcid7 a261479062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Chixia10aPoly(acrylic acid) Bridged Gadolinium Metal–Organic Framework–Gold Nanoparticle Composites as Contrast Agents for Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Bimodal Imaging  ap. 17765-17775.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImaging contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have received significant attention in the development of techniques for early stage cancer diagnosis. Gadolinium (Gd)(III), which has seven unpaired electrons and a large magnetic moment, can dramatically influence the water proton relaxation and hence exhibits excellent MRI contrast. On the other hand, gold (Au), which has a high atomic number and high X-ray attenuation coefficient, is an ideal contrast agent candidate for X-ray-based CT imaging. Gd metal–organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles with tunable size, high Gd(III) loading and multivalency can potentially overcome the limitations of clinically utilized Gd chelate contrast agents. In this work, we report for the first time the integration of GdMOF nanoparticles with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the preparation of a MRI/CT bimodal imaging agent. Highly stable hybrid GdMOF/AuNPs composites have been prepared by using poly(acrylic acid) as a bridge between the GdMOF nanoparticles and AuNPs. The hybrid nanocomposites were then evaluated in MRI and CT imaging. The results revealed high longitudinal relaxivity in MRI and excellent CT imaging performance. Therefore, these GdMOF/AuNPs hybrid nanocomposites potentially provide a new platform for the development of multimodal imaging probes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3acomputed tomography 3aelectrons 3agadolinium 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apolyacrylic acid 0amultimodal imaging contrast agent 0aMRI/CT 0agold nanoparticles 0agadolinium metal−organic framework nanoparticles1 aZhu, Liping1 aLin, Feng1 aBoyes, Stephen G.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 7, no. 32 p.17765-17775dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b039983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245009500205520157900300592002801879650003101907650002701938650001501965650001001980650002701990650001302017650001002030650001002040650001802050650001002068650000902078650001702087650001202104650001502116650001802131650001102149650001602160650001402176653002702190653001002217653001902227653001202246653002402258700001702282700001602299700005702315700001902372773010702391856008502498852000902583655001202592IND60763068920221118083247.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076306892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Bogyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-627510aSalmonella Typhimurium lacking phoBR as a live vaccine candidate against poultry infection  aSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with a broad-host range, is a predominant cause of non-typhoidal Salmonella infection in humans, and the infectious source is highly associated with food animals, especially poultry. Considering the horizontal transmission of S. Typhimurium from farm animals to humans, vaccination has been strongly recommended in industrial animals. In an effort to eradicate S. Typhimurium in poultry farms, a live candidate vaccine strain lacking the phoBR genes, which encode the PhoB/PhoR two-component regulatory system responsible for cellular phosphate signaling, was evaluated in mice and chickens. Lack of the phoBR genes promoted overgrowth of intracellular Salmonella. However, notably, in BALB/c mouse models, the ΔphoBR mutant showed attenuated virulence and instead, provided protection against infection with virulent Salmonella, thereby clearing out Salmonella in the spleen and liver. Accordingly, immunization with the ΔphoBR mutant increased immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM antibody responses and also tended to increase the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, which is indicative of T helper (Th)1-mediated cellular immunity. In chicken challenge models, immunization with the ΔphoBR mutant significantly boosted the production of IgG and IgM antibodies after the second vaccination. The vaccinated chickens ceased fecal shedding of challenged Salmonella earlier than the non-vaccinated ones and showed no Salmonella in their caecum and ileum. These results demonstrate the potential of the S. Typhimurium ΔphoBR mutant as a vaccine in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibodies 3acecum 3acell-mediated immunity 3achickens 3afarms 3aileum 3alive vaccines 3aliver 3amice 3amicrobiology 3amutants 3aphosphates 3asalmonellosis 3aspleen 3avaccination 3avirulence 0aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aphoBR 0aImmunogenicity 0aVaccine 0aProtective efficacy1 aPark, Soyeon1 aKim, Eunsuk1 aYoon, Hyunjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2252-94021 aHahn, Tae-Wook0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Mar., v. 266 p.109342-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014300173300001600316520137000332592002801702650002201730650003701752650002201789650001301811650001301824650001701837650000901854650001401863650001801877650001401895650000701909650001701916650002401933650003301957650001101990650003702001653001602038653000902054653001102063653001302074653001202087700001702099700001902116700001802135700001802153773009002171856009002261852000902351655001202360IND60592253820221121064725.0200607e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059225382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Zhenzhen10aEnhanced reactivity of nZVI embedded into supermacroporous cryogels for highly efficient Cr(VI) and total Cr removal from aqueous solution  ap. 232-242.  aNovel supermacroporous PSA-nZVI composites with nanoscale zero-valent iron particles (nZVI) embedded into poly (sodium acrylate) (PSA) cryogels were synthesized through ion exchange followed by in-situ reduction. The magnetic composites were evaluated for material characterizations and their efficiency for Cr(VI) and total Cr removal from aqueous medium in batch experiments. PSA-nZVI composites with high nZVI loading capacity up to 128.70 mg Fe/g PSA were obtained, and the interconnected macroporous structure of PSA cryogel remained unaltered with nZVI uniformly distributed on PSA cryogel as determined by TGA, SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS analyses. PSA-nZVI composites showed faster reaction rate than free nZVI both for Cr(VI) and total Cr removal, suggesting no mass transfer resistance and the enhanced reactivity of nZVI in PSA carrier. PSA-nZVI composites exhibited much more remarkable performance for Cr(VI) and total Cr removal than free nZVI particles in high removal capacity and broad pH application range (pH 4–10). The reaction mechanisms were also elucidated with XPS analyses before and after Cr(VI) reduction reactions. These results demonstrate that PSA cryogel acts as an excellent carrier and shows multiple functions in nZVI particle dispersion, pH buffering and oxidation resistance in addition to immobilizing nZVI particles from release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acryogels 3aion exchange 3airon 3amagnetism 3amass transfer 3aoxidation 3apH 3aporous media 3areaction mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPSA cryogel 0anZVI 0aCr(VI) 0aTotal Cr 0aRemoval1 aShu, Yuehong1 aHuang, Renlong1 aLiu, Junguang1 aLiu, Lingling0 tChemosphere.g2018 May, v. 199 p.232-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245009200205300001600297506007600313520157800389592002801967506003701995650001802032650000902050650001002059650001202069650001302081650001402094650001702108650001702125650001402142700001902156700001402175700001502189700002102204700002302225700002002248700001202268700001802280773012202298856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60596613520221207144154.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059661352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-018-0732-y2doi7 aPMC59457942pmcid7 a296872842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Ajith13aAn improved ternary vector system for Agrobacterium-mediated rapid maize transformation  ap. 187-200.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE: A simple and versatile ternary vector system that utilizes improved accessory plasmids for rapid maize transformation is described. This system facilitates high-throughput vector construction and plant transformation. The super binary plasmid pSB1 is a mainstay of maize transformation. However, the large size of the base vector makes it challenging to clone, the process of co-integration is cumbersome and inefficient, and some Agrobacterium strains are known to give rise to spontaneous mutants resistant to tetracycline. These limitations present substantial barriers to high throughput vector construction. Here we describe a smaller, simpler and versatile ternary vector system for maize transformation that utilizes improved accessory plasmids requiring no co-integration step. In addition, the newly described accessory plasmids have restored virulence genes found to be defective in pSB1, as well as added virulence genes. Testing of different configurations of the accessory plasmids in combination with T-DNA binary vector as ternary vectors nearly doubles both the raw transformation frequency and the number of transformation events of usable quality in difficult-to-transform maize inbreds. The newly described ternary vectors enabled the development of a rapid maize transformation method for elite inbreds. This vector system facilitated screening different origins of replication on the accessory plasmid and T-DNA vector, and four combinations were identified that have high (86–103%) raw transformation frequency in an elite maize inbred.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium 3acorn 3agenes 3amutants 3aplasmids 3ascreening 3atetracycline 3atransfer DNA 3avirulence1 aBass, StevenH.1 aWu, Emily1 aWang, Ning1 aMcBride, KevinE.1 aAnnaluru, Narayana1 aMiller, Michael1 aHua, Mo1 aJones, ToddJ.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2018 May, v. 97, no. 1-2 p.187-200dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-018-0732-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245008300124300001400207520059800221592002800819650004500847650003400892650001800926650000900944650001700953650001700970650000900987653002800996653002001024653001701044700001701061700001701078700001601095700001101111700001401122700002201136773014701158852000901305655001201314IND60710035820221121222358.0200908e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071003582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajmi, 10aSynchronization of Estrous Cycle With Vaginal Sponges in Barbary Breed of Ewes  ap. 63-64.  aA total of one hundred Barbary Libyan ewes were selected and were divided as Group T and C (n= 50).

This study presents options for heat and electricity generation based on local energy systems and utilizing seasonal thermal energy storages. Energy needs and production on Vartiosaari district in Helsinki in Finland were explored as a case area. The project studied the impacts of introducing solar thermal energy on local energy self-sufficiency and emissions from heating energy supply, if excess solar heat in the summer is stored using borehole thermal energy storage or tank storage for use in the winter. Around 60% self-sufficiency in heat production would have been achieved in the scenarios studied. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by around 50%, and sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions by up to 70% compared to the business-as-usual situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimatic zones 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aheat production 3aparticulate emissions 3asolar energy 3asulfur dioxide 3asummer 3awinter 3aFinland 0aDistrict energy 0aSolar energy 0aSeasonal heat storage 0aGround source heat pump 0aEnergy analysis 0aNearly zero energy building (nZEB)1 aHoàng, Hà,1 aHukkalainen, Mari0 tRenewable energy.g2017 July, v. 107 p.147-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014400169300001600313520272100329592002803050650001203078650002403090650001403114650001203128650001503140650002203155650001203177650002403189650001303213650001103226650001303237650001303250650001103263651001603274651001103290653000803301653002103309653001503330653002103345653001903366653001803385700002103403700002103424773019703445856008203642852000903724655001203733IND60524824520221118033115.0190411e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052482452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiseth, Jan Åge,10a175 years of adaptation: North Scandinavian Sámi reindeer herding between government policies and winter climate variability (1835–2010)  ap. 186-204.  aUnmanaged wild reindeer populations tend to follow cyclical behaviour, and domesticated reindeer populations often show cyclical behaviour, too. In this contribution, we intend to use the long-term development of two areas in northern Scandinavia to explore how externally imposed policies and winter climate variability have influenced the reindeer herd size and pasture state. We do this by comparing the development in two areas that are rather similar ecologically: Torneträsk in northernmost Sweden and Kautokeino (Vest-Finnmark) in northernmost Norway.Climatic and ecological studies as well as commons theory have been useful tools for understanding the inherent socio-ecological dynamics. Especially the time from 1850 to 1940 includes several short periods when historical sources document combinations of events such as (1) closure of national borders to cross-border herding migrations, (2) relocations of herder households, (3) overutilization of lichen pastures, (4) catastrophic winters, and (5) forced herd reductions. The high number of incidents and actions during this era makes it challenging to disentangle causes and effects.Our main findings are based on the documented effects of international events and consequent government policies and actions in Fennoscandia from 1852 to 1921 which had dramatic consequences, including excessive numbers of reindeer and people in northernmost Sweden, leading to more or less forced relocation southwards in Sweden with cascading effects in large parts of Sápmi. We have found clear indications that this contributed to overutilization of lichen pastures and beyond any reasonable doubt must also have reinforced the effects of several of the documented catastrophic climatic events, especially in areas like Torneträsk to where many families from Finnmark were relocated. From the first border closure in 1852 to the Second World War it thus seems as if the shocks from the political events were the main factor determining the development of reindeer herding in large parts of Sápmi. The political and administrative history is well documented. Our climate data are a unique compilation of climate events based on multiple sources during two centuries, which contribute to the validity of our findings. Our pasture state data from the late-1800s are also based on several sources which support each other.Two new factors influencing the general cyclical pattern have arisen more recently. Motorization has increased the possibilities for intense pasture utilization and the amplitudes between minimum and maximum herd sizes, while supplementary feeding has the potential to limit the effects of winter climate variability and lichen overutilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adietary supplements 3aherd size 3aherding 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alichens 3ameteorological data 3apastures 3apeople 3apolitics 3areindeer 3awinter 3aScandinavia 3aSweden 0aQ54 0aReindeer herding 0aAdaptation 0aPolitical shocks 0aClimate events 0aPasture state1 aTømmervik, Hans1 aBjerke, Jarle W.0 tJournal of forest economics.g2016 Aug., v. 24 p.186-204dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013600162300001600298520105200314592002801366650004401394650003701438650001201475650001401487650001401501650002301515650001901538650001101557650002101568650001301589650002001602650001301622650001501635650001701650650003301667650001701700650001601717650002101733650003701754653003901791653001301830653002201843653001901865653001401884700001801898700001601916700001601932700001601948700001501964773009701979856008502076852000902161655001202170IND60563294120221123014909.0180831e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056329412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Hu10aMulti-SO3H functionalized mesoporous polymeric acid catalyst for biodiesel production and fructose-to-biodiesel additive conversion  ap. 245-252.  aNovel and efficient multi-SO3H functionalized mesoporous polymeric solid acid (PD-En-SO3H) was synthesized from sulfonation of ethylenediamine (En)-functionalization of mesoporous polydivinylbenzene (PD). The catalyst was characterized by XPS, FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM, SEM, TG and elemental analysis. Characterizations suggest that PD-En-SO3H possess abundant mesoporosity, high BET surface area (369.00 m²/g) and high acidity (2.10 mmol/g). The catalytic activity was investigated for biodiesel (BD) production by esterification of various free fatty acids (FFAs) and synthesis of levulinate esters (BD additive) from fructose. The effects of reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil and catalyst amount on conversion of oleic acid were also explored. Interestingly, PD-En-SO3H showed excellent catalytic performance, which was more active than commercial Amberlyst 15 and Nafion NR50. Moreover, it could be reused for four times and still maintained high catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aesterification 3aesters 3afree fatty acids 3afructose 3afuel production 3amethanol 3aoleic acid 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMesoporous polymeric acid catalyst 0aFructose 0aLevulinate esters 0aEsterification 0aBiodiesel1 aLiu, Xiaofang1 aZhang, Heng1 aYang, Kaili1 aHuang, Shan1 aYang, Song0 tRenewable energy.g2017 July, v. 107 p.245-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013400172300001800306520151500324592002801839596006401867650001901931650001901950650002001969650002301989650001902012650001902031650001602050650001602066650001102082650001002093650001302103650002602116650002202142650000902164650002202173650002602195700002502221700003302246700006502279773012402344856008302468852000902551655001202560IND60677362320221118032250.0220511e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067736232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-05030-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsyraqiah, Faizatul10aLeptin enhances N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced tumour growth in gastric mucosa of male Sprague-Dawley rats  ap. 5967-5975.  aIndividuals who are obese are at a greater risk of developing gastric cancer. They are however also hyperleptinaemic. Chronic leptin treatment has been shown to upregulate numerous cancer-causing genes in the stomach of male Sprague-Dawley rats. It is however unclear if leptin enhances the effect of gastric carcinogens in vivo. This study was therefore done to investigate the effect of leptin on gastric carcinogenesis in rats treated with N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Twenty-four, 6-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into three groups: G1 served as age-matched controls; G2 was treated with MNNG in drinking water ad libitum (200 mg L⁻¹); G3 was given leptin and MNNG. Rats were euthanized after 40 weeks of treatment and their stomachs were removed for histopathology, microarray, and RT-qPCR analysis. Fisher’s exact test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyse the data. Fifty percent of the MNNG-treated rats developed gastric hyperplasia (p < 0.05), but there was no significant change in any carcinogenic genes. Concurrent MNNG and leptin treatment however induced hyperplasia, dysplasia, hypertrophy, and adenocarcinoma in 75% (6/8) of the rats; with upregulation of microRNAs, olfactory receptors, Hey2 (transcription factor), Tmed2 (vesicular trafficking), and Lcn11 (cell proliferation) genes. It appears that leptin enhances MNNG- induced tumour growth in stomachs of Sprague-Dawley rats and its role in gastric cancer requires further scrutiny.  aPublisher supplied data  a600-IRMI/MyRA 5/3/GIP (019/2017)cUniversiti Teknologi MARA 3aadenocarcinoma 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3acell proliferation 3agastric mucosa 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3aleptin 3amales 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3amolecular biology 3arisk 3astomach neoplasms 3atranscription factors1 aKutty, Methil Kannan1 aDurairajanayagam, Damayanthi1 aSingh, Harbindar Jeet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0805-06140 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.5967-5975dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-05030-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245009100157300001600248520184200264592002802106653002702134653002002161653002602181653001202207653002502219653003102244653001502275700002102290700002102311773012702332856007302459961001202532852000902544655001202553IND60129325920221121205840.0151124e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012932592DNAL7 a10.1898/10-01.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSovern, Stan G.10aNest Reuse by Northern Spotted Owls on the East Slope of the Cascade Range, Washington  ap. 101-106.  aDuring a long-term demography study of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in the eastern Cascade Range of Washington State in 1989 to 2008, we documented 276 nests of Northern Spotted Owls at 73 different territories. Of these nests, 90.2%% were on platforms, mostly in clumps of deformed limbs caused by dwarf mistletoe (primarily Arceuthobium douglasii), and 9.8%% were in cavities in trees. Of the nests associated with dwarf mistletoe, 8.4%% were nests built by other raptors and 91.6%% were either natural accumulations of debris or debris accumulated by other birds or mammals. Owls switched nests between nesting attempts 81.2%% of the time. The presence of a new male or female at a territory did not affect the odds of switching nests between nesting attempts. The odds an owl would reuse a nest were 6 times greater for owls that were successful in the previous nesting attempt compared to owls that were unsuccessful, given the same type of nest structure. The odds an owl would reuse a cavity nest were 4.7 times greater than the odds an owl would reuse a platform nest, given the same level of nest success the previous year. The estimated mean annual survival rate (φφ) of nest structures was 0.98 (== 0.006), suggesting that mean life expectancy of nests was 42 y. However, nests on dwarf mistletoe platforms may be more ephemeral than cavity nests or the nest trees themselves, and management for viable nest areas for Spotted Owls should include multiple trees with mistletoe brooms suitable for alternate nests. Our results, and results from other studies, indicate that Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees infected with dwarf mistletoe are an important habitat component for Spotted Owls and many other species of birds and arboreal mammals on the east slope of the Cascade Range in Washington.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArceuthobium douglasii 0adwarf mistletoe 0aeastern Cascade Range 0anesting 0aNorthern Spotted Owl 0aStrix occidentalis caurina 0aWashington1 aTaylor, Margaret1 aForsman, Eric D.0 tNorthwestern naturalist.g2011 Sept., v. 92, no. 2 p.101-106dSociety for Northwestern Vertebrate Biologyx1051-17337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1898%2F10-01.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008600160300001600246520140800262592002801670650001501698650001701713650001601730650001101746650002001757650001301777650001101790650002101801650001301822700002201835700001701857773011801874856007501992852000902067655001202076IND60558204120221123043407.0161111e20120126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055820412DNAL7 a10.1021/jp206323h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToshchevikov, V.10aLight-Induced Deformation of Azobenzene Elastomers: A Regular Cubic Network Model  ap. 913-924.  aWe propose a microscopic theory of light-induced deformation of azobenzene elastomers bearing photosensitive azo-moieties in their strands. The theory is based on the orientation approach (Toshchevikovet al.J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 5032), in which the light-induced mechanical stress originates from reorientation of chromophores with respect to the electric vector of the light. A regular cubic network model built from freely jointed polymer chains bearing azobenzene chromophores is used to calculate the light-induced deformation of azobenzene elastomers under homogeneous light illumination. We show that the photomechanical behavior of azobenzene elastomers is very sensitive to their chemical structure: it depends on the orientation distribution of chromophores around the main chains which is defined by the chemical structure of spacers. Depending on the chemical structure, azobenzene elastomers demonstrate either expansion or uniaxial contraction along the electric vector of the light. The magnitude of the light-induced deformation depends on the degree of cross-linking: the larger is the degree of cross-linking, the smaller is the magnitude of deformation. Additionally, we discuss possible bending motions of azobenzene elastomers under inhomogeneous light illumination, when the light intensity changes inside the polymer due to the absorption of the light energy by the material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aenergy 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotosensitivity 3apolymers1 aSaphiannikova, M.1 aHeinrich, G.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 26, v. 116, no. 3 p.913-924dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp206323h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245017500194300001800369500002000387520185500407592002802262596005702290650001902347650001602366650001402382650002802396650001502424650001102439650001302450650001902463700005902482773013202541856007702673852000902750655001202759IND60789901620221116143709.0220822e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078990162DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0156692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8210-355010aFully Dynamic Spontaneous Rupture Due to Quasi‐Static Pore Pressure and Poroelastic Effects: An Implicit Nonlinear Computational Model of Fluid‐Induced Seismic Events  ap. 9430-9468.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFluid perturbations play a pivotal role in triggering earthquakes. However, the role of fluid in the coseismic rupture process remains largely unknown. To this end, we develop a 2‐D fully dynamic spontaneous rupture model for fluid‐induced earthquakes. The effect of fluid in the preseismic quasi‐static regime is modeled as either pore pressure diffusion or fully coupled poroelasticity, using our Jin and Zoback (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JB014892) computational model. The two approaches lead to radically different predictions on the time of earthquake nucleation. Correspondingly, the evolved fluid pressure or poroelastic stress on the fault, together with the spatially altered density of the fluid‐saturated hosting rock, is passed to the dynamic regime. Under the assumption of an undrained coseismic fluid‐solid system, we discretize the fully dynamic Cauchy equation of motion subjected to an exact fault contact constraint using a split‐node finite element method in space and an implicit Newmark family finite difference method in time. Within each time step, a fully implicit Newton‐Raphson scheme is implemented iteratively for linearizing the fully discrete equations. Within each Newton iteration, a physics‐based and nonstationary preconditioner is designed to accelerate the convergence of the selected generalized minimal residual method iterative linear solver. The effect of fluid is highlighted throughout the discretization and computational procedures. Finally, by conducting a numerical experiment, we illustrate that a fully coupled poroelastic model can lead to significantly different predictions on coseismic rupture behaviors and wavefields compared to a decoupled model. Our computational model can also serve as one of the earliest full‐physics modeling tool for fluid‐induced earthquakes.  aPublisher supplied data  cStanford Center for Induced and Triggered Seismicity 3abioinformatics 3aearthquakes 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3athermodynamics1 aZoback, Mark D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8851-20990 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Nov., v. 123, no. 11 p.9430-9468dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB0156693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001600249520112800265592002801393650001801421650001201439650000901451650001001460650001301470650002201483650001201505650001201517650001601529651001001545700002401555773008501579856008101664852000901745655001201754IND60082011120221120173423.0141015e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008201112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-014-1142-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, K.

Millsp.] a hybrid breeding technology was successfully developed and the first two hybrids were recently released in India. In order to produce heterotic hybrid combinations, the first logical step is the identification and selection of genetically diverse parents with favorable alleles. In this context, the concept of classifying hybrid parents into different heterotic groups was developed and successfully used in maize and later adopted in other crops. Since hybrid technology in pigeonpea is new, the authors have made the first attempt to identify heterotic groups using SCA effects of 102 crosses generated from line × tester mating and evaluated them at four locations. Based on the performance of hybrids in terms of SCA effects, seven heterotic groups were constituted. Besides this, a scheme to use this information in breeding high yielding hybrids with specific or wide adaptation is also discussed herein. Genetic diversity between lines and tester showed positive association with the heterotic pools generated on the basis of SCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aalleles 3acorn 3acrops 3acrossing 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3aparents 3apigeon peas 3aIndia1 aSawargaonkar, S.

The disorder usually occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and gets worse over time. PE increases the risk of poor outcomes for both the mother and the baby. In the study we applied LC-MS/MS method for the analysis of the urine peptidome of women with PE. Samples were prepared using size-exclusion chromatography method which gives more than twice peptides identities if compared with solid phase extraction. Thirty urine samples from women with mild and severe preeclampsia and the control group were analyzed. In total 1786 peptides were identified using complementary search engines (Mascot, MaxQuant and PEAKS). A high level of agreement in peptide identification was observed with previously published data.Label-free data comparison resulted in 35 peptides which reliably distinguished a particular PE group (severe or mild) from controls. Our results revealed unique identifications (correlate to alpha-1-antitrypsin, collagen alpha-1(I) chain, collagen alpha-1 (III) chain, and uromodulin, for instance) that can potentially serve as early indicators of PE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3agel chromatography 3ahypertension 3apeptides 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy 3aproteinuria 3arisk 3asolid phase extraction 3aurinalysis 3aurine 3awomen 0aPreeclamsia 0aUrine peptidome 0aEndogenous peptides 0aLC-MSMS 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aSize-exclusion chromatography1 aStarodubtseva, N.L.1 aBugrova, A.E.1 aShirokova, V.A.1 aChagovets, V.V.1 aIndeykina, M.I.1 aPopov, I.A.1 aKostyukevich, Y.I.1 aVavina, O.V.1 aMuminova, K.T.1 aKhodzhaeva, Z.S.1 aKan, N.E.1 aFrankevich, V.E.1 aNikolaev, E.N.1 aSukhikh, G.T.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 Oct. 21, v. 149 p.38-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012300174300001400297520115300311592002801464650001401492650002301506650001101529650001401540650000901554650001401563650001101577650001501588650001801603650001201621650001701633650002601650650001601676651001801692653001401710653002901724653001501753653000801768653002001776700002001796773009801816856008601914852000902000655001202009IND60084565020221117165028.0190412e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrenkel, Verena M.12aA fisheries acoustic multi-frequency indicator to inform on large scale spatial patterns of aquatic pelagic ecosystems  ap. 72-79.  aFisheries acoustic instruments provide information on four major groups in aquatic ecosystems: fish with and without swim bladder (tertiary and quaternary consumers), fluidlike zooplankton (secondary consumers) and small gas bearing organisms such as larval fish and phytoplankton (predominantly primary producers). We entertain that this information is useable to describe the spatial structure of organism groups in pelagic ecosystems. The proposal we make is based on a multi-frequency indicator that synthesises in a single metric the shape of the acoustic frequency response of different organism groups, i.e. the dependence of received acoustic backscattered energy on emitting echosounder frequency. We demonstrate the development and interpretation of the multi-frequency indicator using simulated data. We then calculate the indicator for acoustic water-column survey data from the Bay of Biscay and use it to create reference maps for the spatial structure of the four scattering groups as well as their small scale spatial variability. These maps provide baselines for monitoring future changes in the structure of the pelagic ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aenergy 3aequipment 3afish 3afisheries 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3aphytoplankton 3asurveys 3aswim bladder 3atrophic relationships 3azooplankton 3aBay of Biscay 0aAcoustics 0aFrequency response curve 0aMonitoring 0aEOF 0aEcosystem state1 aBerger, Laurent0 tEcological indicators.g2013 July, v. 30 p.72-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011900162300001800281500001900299520070400318592002801022596007501050596006701125596010901192650002801301650003401329650001601363650001101379650001301390650003801403650001101441650001501452650000901467650001401476650001301490651001001503700001701513700001701530700001701547700001801564700001301582700001701595700001301612700001601625700001201641700005501653773011501708856008201823852000901905655001201914IND60730822320221118032811.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073082232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-021-04990-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Bin10aIdentification and genotyping of a new subtype of bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 isolated from cattle with diarrhea  ap. 1259-1262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn 2019, diarrhea cases occurred on cattle farms in Qionglai and Guang'an, Sichuan Province.

In this study, the validation of the 30-year Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) daily precipitation dataset was conducted over the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China. Based on daily precipitation data from 182 rain gauges, several continuous and categorical validation statistics combined with bias and error decomposition techniques were employed to quantitatively dissect the PERSIANN-CDR performance on daily, monthly, and annual scales. With and without consideration of non-rainfall data, this product reproduces adequate climatologic precipitation characteristics in the HRB, such as intra-annual cycles and spatial distributions. Bias analyses show that PERSIANN-CDR overestimates daily, monthly, and annual precipitation with a regional mean percent total bias of 11%. This is related closely to the larger positive false bias on the daily scale, while the negative non-false bias comes from a large underestimation of high percentile data despite overestimating lower percentile data. The systematic sub-component (error from high precipitation), which is independent of timescale, mainly leads to the PERSIANN-CDR total Mean-Square-Error (TMSE). Moreover, the daily TMSE is attributed to non-false error. The correlation coefficient (R) and Kling&ndash;Gupta Efficiency (KGE) respectively suggest that this product can well capture the temporal variability of precipitation and has a moderate-to-high overall performance skill in reproducing precipitation. The corresponding capabilities increase from the daily to annual scale, but decrease with the specified precipitation thresholds. Overall, the PERSIANN-CDR product has good (poor) performance in detecting daily low (high) rainfall events on the basis of Probability of Detection, and it has a False Alarm Ratio of above 50% for each precipitation threshold. The Equitable Threat Score and Heidke Skill Score both suggest that PERSIANN-CDR has a certain ability to detect precipitation between the second and eighth percentiles. According to the Hanssen&ndash;Kuipers Discriminant, this product can generally discriminate rainfall events between two thresholds. The Frequency Bias Index indicates an overestimation (underestimation) of precipitation totals in thresholds below (above) the seventh percentile. Also, continuous and categorical statistics for each month show evident intra-annual fluctuations. In brief, the comprehensive dissection of PERSIANN-CDR performance reported herein facilitates a valuable reference for decision-makers seeking to mitigate the adverse impacts of water deficit in the HRB and algorithm improvements in this product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aprobability 3arain 3arain gauges 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZhou, Shujia 1 aShen, Huayu 1 aChai, Rongfan 1 aChen, Haishan 1 aLiu, Yibo 1 aShi, Wanrong 1 aWang, Jia 1 aWang, Guojie 1 aZhou, Yang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111518053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013500162300001600297520108000313592002801393650001201421650001401433650002301447650001501470650002101485650001301506650001101519650001301530650001701543650001101560650001701571650001601588700001501604773013101619856008201750852000901832655001201841IND60561398220221120135843.0170118e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056139822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b020532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkay, Galip10aProcess Intensification in Ammonia Synthesis Using Novel Coassembled Supported Microporous Catalysts Promoted by Nonthermal Plasma  ap. 457-468.  aThe Integrated Process Intensification approach is used for the synthesis of ammonia using novel coassembled microporous silica supported nickel catalysts and nonthermal plasma reactors operating at ca. 140 ± 10 °C and ambient pressure. The conversion levels of nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia are similar to that achieved by the current industrial best practice which is, however, carried out at 100–250 bar and the temperatures 350–550 °C. In order to achieve continuous plasma generation, a novel catalyst, which has a surface area of ca. 200 m²/g in the form of lamellae with ca. 2 nm thick plates of nickel catalyst sandwiched between the silica support, has been used in the presence of plasma catalysis promoters in the form of spheres made from high permittivity material. In addition to process variables (flow rate, feed composition, and plasma power input), the effect of the electrode configuration on conversion was investigated. It is shown that the catalyst activity remained constant over a continuous period of 72 h when the reaction was terminated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3afeed composition 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aZhang, Kui0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2017 Jan. 18, v. 56, no. 2 p.457-468dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b020533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001500175245010400190300001800294520216200312592002802474650001402502650001802516650000902534650001402543650002002557650001702577650001102594650001102605650001202616650001002628650003002638650001302668650001502681650001002696650001602706650001402722650001002736650001402746650002602760650001202786650002402798650003102822650001702853650001102870650001102881653001102892653001502903700001602918700001902934773011502953856008103068852000903149655001203158IND60652471720221122034811.0190713e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065247172DNAL7 a29277165 292771652pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311170035482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMõtus, K.10aReasons and risk factors for beef calf and youngstock on-farm mortality in extensive cow-calf herds  ap. 1958-1966.  aRaising calves and youngstock is an essential part of beef production. High on-farm mortality (unassisted death and euthanasia) is a consequence of poor animal health and welfare, and is economically unfavourable. The present study aimed to identify the reasons and risk factors for beef calf and youngstock on-farm mortality, using registry data for the years 2013 to 2015. Cox regression models were applied for the data of four age groups: calves up to 30 days (n=21 075), calves 1 to 5 months (n=21 116), youngstock 6 to 19 months (n=22 637) and youngstock ⩾20 months of age (n=9582). We found that dystocia, small birth weight and older parity of the mother increased the mortality hazard in calves up to 30 days of age. A summer birth was a common protective factor against mortality for calves up to 30 days and calves 1 to 5 months of age, compared with birth in other seasons. Among calves 1 to 5 months old, being the offspring of a first-parity cow was associated with significantly higher risk of death compared with calves who were the offspring of third- or higher-parity cows. A high herd-level stillbirth rate was associated with higher mortality hazard. The most commonly reported reasons for calf mortality were digestive disorders and respiratory disease. According to the models of youngstock from 6 months of age, male sex was a risk factor for mortality. Cattle having more than 10% dairy breed experienced a higher mortality risk in the ⩾20 months age group. No significant differences were found across regions, herd size or different breeds in any of the calf or youngstock groups. Metabolic and digestive disorders, as well as traumas and accidents, were the most common causes of mortality in beef youngstock older than 6 months. We can conclude that in young calves, animal-level factors associated with calving had a high impact on mortality. Further, timing calving for the warmer spring months would benefit calf survivability. Further studies including complementary information about farm factors adapted across the whole youngstock period is highly needed to provide sound recommendations in reducing on-farm mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimal health 3abeef 3abeef cows 3abeef production 3abirth weight 3abreeds 3acalves 3acalving 3adeath 3adigestive system diseases 3adystocia 3aeuthanasia 3afarms 3afetal death 3aherd size 3amales 3amortality 3aparity (reproduction) 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk factors 3aspring 3asummer 0acattle 0ayoungstock1 aViltrop, A.1 aEmanuelson, U.0 tAnimal.g2018 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.1958-1966dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311170035483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005700171300001600228520217900244592002802423650002002451650002302471650001702494650002402511650001502535650002502550650002602575650001502601650001302616650001102629650001002640650001502650650002602665650001302691650001302704650001102717650002002728650001802748650001302766651001802779653001802797653002202815653001702837653002502854653002802879653002502907700001902932773010002951856008603051852000903137655001203146IND60084565320221117165003.0190412e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPander, Joachim10aEcological indicators for stream restoration success  ap. 106-118.  aExploitation of freshwater resources is essential for sustenance of human existence and alteration of rivers, lakes and wetlands has facilitated economic development for centuries. Consequently, freshwater biodiversity is critically threatened, with stream ecosystems being the most heavily affected. To improve the status of freshwater habitats, e.g. in the context of the European Water Framework Directive and the US Clean Water Act, it is essential to implement the most effective restoration measures and identify the most suitable indicators for restoration success. Herein, several active and passive bioindication approaches are reviewed in light of existing legal frameworks, current targets and applicable implementation of river restoration. Such approaches should move from the use of single biological indicators to more holistic ecological indicators simultaneously addressing communities, multiple life stages and habitat properties such as water quality, substrate composition and stream channel morphology. The proposed Proceeding Chain of Restoration (PCoR) can enable the integration of natural scientific, political and socioeconomic dimensions for restoration of aquatic ecosystems and associated services. Generally, an analysis that combines target species-based active bioindication with community-based passive bioindication and multivariate statistics seems to be most suitable for a holistic evaluation of restoration success, as well as for the monitoring of stream ecosystem health. Since the response of biological communities to changing environmental conditions can differ between taxonomic groups and rivers, assessments at the ecosystem scale should include several levels of biological organisation. A stepwise evaluation of the primary factors inducing disturbance or degradation is needed to integrate increasing levels of complexity from water quality assessments to the evaluation of ecological function. The proposed PCoR can provide a step-by-step guide for restoration ecologists, comprising all planning steps from the determination of the conservation objectives to the use of ecological indicators in post-restoration monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClean Water Act 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodiversity 3aecological function 3aecologists 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alakes 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3aplanning 3apolitics 3arivers 3astream channels 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aUnited States 0aBioindication 0aRiver restoration 0aBiodiversity 0aSpecies conservation 0aStream ecosystem health 0aEcological indicator1 aGeist, Juergen0 tEcological indicators.g2013 July, v. 30 p.106-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164300001600251500001500267520142700282592002801709650001801737650003801755650002501793650001201818650002401830650001601854650003001870650003201900650001001932650001801942650003701960650001201997653002302009700001702032700001702049700001502066700001302081700001402094700001702108700001602125700001702141773008502158856008102243852000902324655001202333IND60082011420221120183304.0141015e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008201142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-014-1147-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiyang10aAnalysis of genetic effects on a complete diallel cross test of Betula platyphylla  ap. 221-229.  a2019-12-06  aThe study utilized the offspring of a 5 × 5 diallel cross of Betula platyphylla as the experimental material. Tree height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem straight degree (SSD) were measured at the fourth and eighth growth year (SSD were measured only in the eighth growth year). ANOVA analyses showed that growth traits in different growth years were significant among families (P < 0.01). There existed extremely significant correlations between H and DBH in the same year. Although the sequencing of average H and DBH of different families were vicissitudinous at the 4th and 8th year, there also existed significant correlations between H and DBH in different year. The general combining ability, special combining ability (SCA) and reciprocal effect (REC) of different hybridized combinations were also different remarkably. The mean square of SCA was significantly higher than GCA, implied that the non-additive effect played major roles. When B5, B8 and MB15 were selected as parents, the offspring performed perfectly in traits of H, DBH and SSD at the eighth growth year respectively. B5 × XB11, B8 × XB11 and B8 × MB15 had highest SCA values in traits of H, DBH, and SSD at the eighth growth year respectively. Consequently, in order to achieve optimal outcomes, seed orchard building and clonal propagation should be considered simultaneously in birch’s genetic improvement process.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth traits 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3aanalysis of variance 3aparents 3agenetic improvement 3atestcrosses 3ageneral combining ability 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aseed orchards 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aprogeny 0aBetula platyphylla1 aBian, Xiuyan1 aLiu, Mengran1 aLi, Zhixin1 aLi, Ying1 aZheng, Mi1 aTeng, Wenhua1 aJiang, Jing1 aLiu, Guifeng0 tEuphytica.g2014 Nov., v. 200, no. 2 p.221-229dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-014-1147-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245010600161300001600267520170000283592002801983650002902011650002802040650001702068650002602085650001902111650001402130650001102144650002402155650001502179650003002194650001102224650001802235650001802253650002802271651001102299700002202310700002002332700002802352773013002380856007502510852000902585655001202594IND60693503720221121082051.0200507e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069350372DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj31021052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvano, Esther13aAn Environmental Benefit-Cost Analysis Case Study of Nutrient Management in an Agricultural Watershed  ap. 105-122.  aThis paper illustrates the importance of valuing environmental goods and services associated with water quality improvements when assessing implementation of on-farm nutrient management plans as required by the Quebec Regulation Respecting Agricultural Operations (RRAO). Based on a case study in the Chaudiere River watershed, two scenarios were considered using the integrated, economic-hydrological, modelling framework provided by GIBSI: (i) a base-case scenario assuming application of all available manure; and (ii) an on-farm nutrient management scenario based on meeting phosphorus crop requirements with manure and treating any manure surpluses. Two types of management units were selected to evaluate these scenarios: (i) contiguous municipalities (administrative units of agricultural development); and (ii) subwatersheds. Results showed that management at subwatershed levels had larger benefit/cost (B/C) ratios when compared to contiguous municipalities. This illustrates that the watershed is a more meaningful management unit than the municipality, which is not a hydrological unit. For one of those subwatersheds, the B/C ratio was close to one although only various recreational benefits were accounted for in the evaluation. In all likelihood, if a more holistic set of benefits were accounted for, a B/C ratio greater than or equal to one would have resulted. A sensitivity analysis revealed that variations of 37.5%, -22.5%, and -20% for monetary benefits, on-farm manure treatment costs, and average probabilities of exceeding the targeted water quality standard (prevention of eutrophication of rivers), respectively, were necessary to obtain a B/C ratio greater than one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural watersheds 3acase studies 3acost benefit analysis 3aeutrophication 3ahydrology 3amodels 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3apublic services and goods 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 3aQuebec1 aRousseau, Alain N1 aDebailleul, Guy1 aVilleneuve, Jean-Pierre0 tCanadian water resources journal.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 31, no. 2 p.105-122dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:2043x1918-18177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj31021053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005900183245010600242506007600348520182600424592002802250506003702278650002602315650001502341650002002356650001902376650001502395650002302410650001302433650002102446650002402467650001402491650001902505650001802524650001602542651001102558700002602569700002302595773010502618856007602723852000902799655001202808IND60624325220221207092334.0181203e20181025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062432522DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/39873962doi7 aPMC62222372pmcid7 a304986002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNankumbi, Joyce1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9147-455910aMaternal Nutrition Education Provided by Midwives: A Qualitative Study in an Antenatal Clinic, Uganda  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaternal nutrition during pregnancy affects the health of the mother and baby. The objective of this paper is to describe the maternal nutrition education offered by midwives to women attending an antenatal clinic. The study also examined the resources, support, and the needs of the midwives in offering the nutrition education. Six in-depth interviews with the midwives, six direct structured observations of the group education, and 12 one-on-one interactions of midwife and pregnant women observations were completed. The interviews and field observation notes were typed and analyzed using the latent content analysis. The emerging themes were the maternal nutrition education and the education needs of the midwives. The content and presentation of maternal nutrition were inadequate in scope and depth. The maternal nutrition education was offered to only pregnant women attending the first antenatal care visit. The routine antenatal education session lasted 45 minutes to 1 hour, covering a variety of topics, but the nutritional component was allotted minimal time (5–15 minutes). The organization, mode of delivery, guidelines, resources, and service environment were extremely deficient. The relevance of appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, guidelines for healthy habits, avoidance of substance abuse, and nutrition precautions in special circumstances was missing in the nutrition presentation. Information, maternal nutrition education resources, infrastructure, and health system gaps were identified. There was an inefficient nutrition education offered to the pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic. As means of promoting effective nutrition education, appropriate in-service training, mentorship, and support for the midwives are needed, as well as infrastructural and resource provision.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeducational resources 3aguidelines 3ahealth behavior 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3amaternal nutrition 3amidwives 3anutrient content 3anutrition education 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprenatal care 3aweight gain 3aUganda1 aNgabirano, Tom Dennis1 aNalwadda, Gorrette0 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2018 Oct. 25, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/39873963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245015500177300001600332520138600348592002801734650002601762650002501788650001201813650002101825650002501846650002201871650001401893650001001907650002401917650002101941650001401962650001801976650000901994650001202003650001402015650001002029650001502039700003502054700002202089700002502111773008502136856008102221852000902302655001202311IND60082011520221120193320.0141015e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008201152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-014-1149-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Moreno, María J.10aCharacterization of a γ-tocopherol methyltransferase mutant gene in wild (Carthamus oxyacanthus M.

A mutant with a high concentration of γ-tocopherol (>85 %) was identified in germplasm of wild safflower (Carthamus oxyacanthus M. Bieb.) that showed strong introgression of C. tinctorius, which allowed selection of individuals of both species with high concentrations of either α- or γ-tocopherol. The trait is controlled by a γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT) locus. The objective of this research was to identify γ-TMT sequence mutations associated with the high γ-tocopherol trait. Full length genomic and cDNA sequences of the γ-TMT gene were obtained from plants of C. tinctorius and C. oxyacanthus with both tocopherol profiles. Sequences from high γ-tocopherol plants showed an 11 bp deletion in exon 6 of the γ-TMT gene that disrupted the reading frame and created a premature stop codon, resulting in a predicted protein with a drastically altered amino acid sequence downstream the frameshift site. The data suggested that the frameshift mutation was underlying the γ-TMT loss of function mutant allele that determines the high γ-tocopherol phenotype. The characterized sequence change of 11 bp deletion could be used directly as a functional marker for introgression of the high γ-tocopherol trait into elite safflower cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus oxyacanthus 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aalleles 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3aexons 3aframeshift mutation 3agamma-tocopherol 3agermplasm 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3astop codon1 aFernández-Martínez, José M.1 aVelasco, Leonardo1 aPérez-Vich, Begoña0 tEuphytica.g2014 Nov., v. 200, no. 2 p.231-238dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-014-1149-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300002000264520034500284592002800629650001600657650001300673650002800686700001900714700001400733700001200747700001400759700001600773773013600789856007500925852000901000655001201009IND60758085720221118223801.0211126e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075808572DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc05412k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jinhuan10aCu/base co-catalyzed [3+3] cycloaddition for the synthesis of highly functionalized 4-fluoropyridines  ap. 12635-12638.  aAn efficient, straightforward and general method for the de novo synthesis of highly functionalized 4-fluoropyridines was developed via a cooperative copper- and base-catalyzed [3+3] cycloaddition of active methylene isocyanides with difluorocyclopropenes.

Previously, this species was known to extend from Fiordland up the western side of the Southern Alps as far as the Franz Joseph Glacier. New records from the Waitaha and Hokitika River catchments extend its range northeast by a further 60 and 75 km, respectively, from its previous known northern limit. This extension may represent recent northwards dispersal, but equally could be because this species has either not been seen in this rugged mountain country or has been confused with the morphologically similar Dracophyllum traversii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEricaceae 3aglaciers 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aNew Zealand 0aBiogeography 0adistribution 0aDracophyllum 0aEricaceae 0asubalpine0 tNew Zealand journal of botany.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 56, no. 4 p.430-437dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl16853x1175-86437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.2018.14918633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014400164300001600308520128400324592002801608650002501636650001401661650002201675650002401697700002501721773013101746856008201877852000901959655001201968IND60561398520221120135819.0170118e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056139852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b034532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhiyuan10aApplication and Analysis of Methods for Selecting an Optimal Solution from the Pareto-Optimal Front obtained by Multiobjective Optimization  ap. 560-574.  aProcess optimization often has two or more objectives which are conflicting. For such situations, multiobjective optimization (MOO) provides many optimal solutions, which are equally good from the perspective of the given objectives. These solutions, known as Pareto-optimal front and as nondominated solutions, provide deeper insights into the trade-off among the objectives and many choices for implementation. In the past 20 years, researchers have applied MOO to numerous applications in chemical engineering. However, selection of an optimal solution from the set of nondominated solutions has not received much attention in the chemical engineering literature. In the present study, 10 methods for selecting an optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal front are carefully chosen and implemented in an MS Excel-based program. Then, they are applied to the selection of an optimal solution in many benchmark or mathematical problems and chemical engineering applications, and their effectiveness and similarities are analyzed. Results of analysis indicate that, among the 10 methods studied, technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, gray relational analysis, and simple additive weighting are better for choosing one of the Pareto-optimal solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3achemistry 3acomputer software 3asystem optimization1 aRangaiah, Gade Pandu0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2017 Jan. 18, v. 56, no. 2 p.560-574dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b034533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245013600166300001600302500001500318520105100333592002801384650001601412650002101428650001501449650002101464650004301485650001501528650002401543650001301567650001901580650002201599650002301621653001601644700002001660700002401680700002101704773009901725856008501824852000901909655001201918IND4445478220221118042743.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444547822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddad, Imen10aElectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of triacylglycerols molecular species in camel milk (Camelus dromedarius)  ap. 119-127.  a2019-12-06  aCamel (Camelus dromedarius) milk fat triacylglycerols (TAGs) were characterized using high performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and high temperature gas chromatography. The complex nature of the fat meant that prefractionation was necessary to provide simpler fractions for more detailed molecular analyses. Data showed that camel fat contained a wide variety of molecular weight species. No predominant TAG was synthesized by the mammary gland. Of the quantified TAGs, 99% contained at least one of the four major fatty acids (FAs), i.e., C₁₄:₀, C₁₆:₀, C₁₈:₀, C₁₈:₁ (that by themselves represented 74% of the total FAs), and about 75% contained at least one unsaturated FA. Experimentally determined distributions of TAG molecular weights deviated from distributions predicted by a random hypothesis method. Mixed TAGs containing C-14, C-16 and C-18 FAs were preferentially synthesized by the mammary gland to the detriment of TAGs rich in medium chain FAs or long chain FAs alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3amolecular weight 3aionization 3atriacylglycerols 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3acamel milk 3aCamelus dromedarius 3amilk fat 3amammary glands 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 0adromedaries1 aMozzon, Massimo1 aStrabbioli, Rosanna1 aFrega, Natale G.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.119-127dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011700184300001600301520127900317592002801596650001401624650001301638650001101651650000901662650001701671650001101688650001201699650002101711650000801732650001901740650001001759650002501769650001301794650001001807650001001817650005901827650007901886650002101965650002201986650001102008650001102019650003802030650000902068650003402077650001702111650006002128650003302188650004002221651001102261651001102272700001802283700001902301700001902320700001902339700001902358700002202377700002202399700001802421700002202439773011202461856008102573852000902654655001202663IND4447638120221118023141.0141111e20110127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444763812DNAL7 a210751912pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacroix, Damien10aAntiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of medicinal plants traditionally used in the village of Kiohima, Uganda  ap. 850-855.  aAIM OF THE STUDY: In Uganda, malaria is the most common disease and Ugandan people largely rely on traditional medicine. In this context, we carried out an ethnobotanical study on the Kiohima village, located close to the Kibale National Park in South-Western Uganda and investigated in vitro the antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of selected medicinal plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five plants-using adults (men and women) were interviewed to find out their plant use. From these information, 48 plants used in traditional medicine were identified and according to their reported uses and to bibliographic data, several parts of 28 plants (leaves, barks, roots), were selected and collected for biological evaluations. These samples were dried, extracted with ethyl acetate and the crude extracts were assayed for in vitro antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities at 10μg/mL. RESULTS: One third of the screened plants showed a significant antiplasmodial activity with inhibition greater than 50% at 10μg/mL. CONCLUSION: These results may indicate a possible explanation of the use of some medicinal plant against malaria in the village of Kiohima and have also allowed to highlight a plant with potent antimalarial activity: Citropsis articulata root barks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitropsis 3aacetates 3aadults 3abark 3acytotoxicity 3aleaves 3amalaria 3amedicinal plants 3amen 3anational parks 3aroots 3atraditional medicine 3avillages 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAntimalarialsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEthnopharmacology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMalaria, Falciparumxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effects 3aUganda 0aUganda1 aPrado, Soizic1 aKamoga, Dennis1 aKasenene, John1 aNamukobe, Jane1 aKrief, Sabrina1 aDumontet, Vincent1 aMouray, Elisabeth1 aBodo, Bernard1 aBrunois, Florence0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Jan. 27, v. 133, no. 2 p.850-855dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165300001400269520122100283592002801504650002701532650002301559650002001582650001901602650001301621650001401634650002501648650003001673650000901703650001401712651001801726653000901744653002701753653001401780653001401794653000901808653002201817700002201839700001601861773007501877856008101952852000902033655001202042IND60519803320221118120208.0160511e20070201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051980332DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-007-0010-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulsen, Osman10aDiversity and relationships among Turkish okra germplasm by SRAP and phenotypic marker polymorphism  ap. 41-45.  aGermplasm characterization is essential and molecular markers provide valuable information for breeding programs. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and phenotypic markers were studied to determine diversity and relationships among 23 okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L) Moench) genotypes. The 39 combinations of forward and reverse SRAP primers were used to evaluate the 21 Turkish and two randomly selected USA genotypes as outgroups, and produced 97 scorable markers, of which 50% was polymorphic for all 23 genotypes. Seventeen out of the 23 genotypes (74%) were distinguished from each other with mean similarity of 0.93. As to phenotypic markers, 33 heritable traits were evaluated in field with ten replications, 28 of them (85%) were found to be polymorphic. The UPGMA (unweighted-pair group method arithmetic average) dendrogram based on the 33 phenotypic markers distinguished all genotypes, but failed to detect any geographic association of okra genotypes, being consistent with previous study. It can be concluded that SRAP markers are useful for studying diversity and relationships among okra germplasm, and have potential in marker-aided selection, linkage mapping, and evolutionary studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3agenetic traits 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agermplasm evaluation 3amarker-assisted selection 3aokra 3aphenotype 3aUnited States 0aokra 0aAbelmoschus esculentus 0adiversity 0agermplasm 0aSRAP 0aphenotypic marker1 aKaragul, Suleyman1 aAbak, Kazim0 tBiologia.g2007 Feb. 1, v. 62, no. 1 p.41-45dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-007-0010-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245007400175300001800249500001900267520143800286592002801724596006501752650001901817650001501836650002501851650001601876650002201892650001701914650001601931650001201947650001301959700003401972700006302006773011502069856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60730822920221118032906.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073082292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-021-04997-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalani, Sankara Naynar10aComparative study of potyvirid NIa proteases and their cleavage sites  ap. 1141-1149.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNuclear inclusion a protease (NIaPro), a major protease of potyvirids, processes its cognate viral polyprotein at distinct cleavage sites. Although Potyviridae is the largest family of the realm Riboviria, the individual NIaPro enzymes and their cleavage sites are believed to be species-specific. In the present study, the NIaPro amino acid sequences of 165 potyvirids of 10 genera and their 1154 cleavage sites were compared to understand their genus/species-specificity and functional regulation. Of these, the NIaPro of macluraviruses, maintains a constant length of 217 amino acids, while those of other genera allow variation. In particular, poaceviruses exhibited a broad range of NIaPro amino acid sequence lengths. Alignment of 162 NIaPro amino acid sequences showed that the N- and C-terminal regions allow variations, while the central region, with the catalytic triad and S1 subsite, are highly conserved. NIaPro cleavage sites are composed of seven amino acids (heptapeptide) denoted as P6-P5-P4-P3-P2-P1/P1’. A survey of 1154 cleavage sites showed that the P1 position is predominantly occupied by Gln/Glu, as is seen in picornaviruses. The P6 (Glu), P4 (Val/Cys/Gln), P2 (His/Tyr/Leu), and P1’ (Ser/Ala/Gly/Met) positions are predominantly occupied by genus-specific residues, while P5 and P3 are not genus-specific. The 6K2-VPg and VPg-NIaPro junctions possess Glu at the P1 position in order to maintain latency.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRG/2018/002106cScience and Engineering Research Board (IN) 3aPicornaviridae 3aPoacevirus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acomparative study 3apolyproteins 3aproteinases 3asurveys 3avirology1 aSankaranarayanan, Ramamoorthy1 aTennyson, Jebasingh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5771-21890 tArchives of virology.g2021 Apr., v. 166, no. 4 p.1141-1149dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-04997-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016300169300001400332520114400346592002801490650002601518650001101544650001001555650002301565650001901588650002601607650001701633650001501650650002001665650001901685650001101704650001501715650001401730650001301744651001101757653001801768653001901786653002301805653001901828653002001847653001401867700002101881700001901902773009801921856008602019852000902105655001202114IND60084565920221117165024.0190412e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPépino, Marc10aFall synchrony between leaf color change and brook trout spawning in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve (Québec, Canada) as potential environmental integrators  ap. 16-20.  aFall biological processes are driven by a combination of environmental factors, with cumulative effects over the length of the growing season, which are currently difficult to model. This study evaluated if leaf color change in fall (i.e., leaf yellowing) and brook trout spawning could be two biological processes that are synchronized at a regional scale and if leaf yellowing could be used to determine the peak of spawning activity of this species. To this end, we surveyed 551 brook trout redds and examined 193 digital images of forest trees in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve (Québec, Canada) over the fall season. Results showed that leaf yellowing and brook trout spawning were synchronized, providing one of the first examples of temporal matching between freshwater and terrestrial biological processes at the regional scale. Considering the difficulty of monitoring the phenology of freshwater fish spawning at high spatial and temporal resolution, terrestrial integrators of environmental conditions, such as leaf color change, may prove to be promising predictors of spawning activity in the management of fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aautumn 3acolor 3aconservation areas 3adigital images 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest trees 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3aspawning 3aCanada 0aColor indices 0aDigital images 0aMonitoring program 0aFall phenology 0aSeasonal timing 0aSynchrony1 aProulx, Raphaël1 aMagnan, Pierre0 tEcological indicators.g2013 July, v. 30 p.16-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300002000266520041500286592002800701650000800729650005200737650002700789650002500816650001200841650001300853700001500866700001900881700002100900773013600921856007501057852000901132655001201141IND60758086020221118224012.0211126e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075808602DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc05508a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByun, Wan Gi10aHarnessing stress granule formation by small molecules to inhibit the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2  ap. 12476-12479.  aWe identified small-molecule enhancers of cellular stress granules by observing molecular crowding of proteins and RNAs in a time-dependent manner.

Residual substrates and fermentation products were determined by proton NMR spectroscopy. Cells collected from the fumarate-supplemented medium (8–10 h after inoculation) supported the conversion of fumarate to succinate when suspended with fumarate and a co-substrate (glucose, sorbitol, or glycerol). Succinate production was limited by the availability of fumarate or reducing equivalents supplied by catabolism of a co-substrate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. The choice of reducing co-substrate influenced the yield of acetate and lactate as side products. High conversions of fumarate to succinate were achieved over pH 6.6–8.2 and initial fumarate concentrations up to 300 mM. However, at high substrate concentrations, intracellular retention of succinate reduced extracellular yields. Overall, the efficient utilization of fumarate (≤ 400 mM) combined with the significant extracellular accumulation of succinate (corresponding to ≥ 70% conversion) indicated the effective utilization of fumarate as a terminal electron acceptor by F. varium and the potential of the methodology for the bioproduction of succinate.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGPIN/04536-2014cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aFusobacterium varium 3aacetates 3aanaerobes 3abacteria 3aculture media 3afermented foods 3afumarates 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alactic acid 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apeptones 3asorbitol1 aWhite, Robert L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2769-43400 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.163-175dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2817-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015200165300001300317500001500330520134000345592002801685650001901713650001301732650001101745650001501756650001901771650001101790650001601801650001501817650000701832650002601839650000901865650002201874650001201896650002101908650002101929653001601950700002501966700001701991700001802008773010902026856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60082011920221120193232.0141211e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008201192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2175-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Deepti10aMolecular Docking of Laccase Protein from Bacillus Safensis DSKK5 Isolated from Earthworm gut: A Novel Method to Study dye Decolorization Potential  ap. 2175.  a2019-12-06  aThe bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were isolated by culture-dependent approaches. In total, 72 cultures were isolated and purified from the gut of an earthworm under aerobic culture condition, out of which 25 isolates were laccase positive. Isolate 33, a good laccase producer was identified as Bacillus safensis DSKK5, using both biochemical and molecular approaches. It was found to produce maximum laccase activity at 0.75 % of wheat bran, 37 °C, and pH 6.2. Further, copper sulfate and copper chloride showed a maximum laccase production. In order to understand the affinity of binding and interaction between toxic dyes and bacterial laccase, homology models were generated. The resulted models were further validated and used for docking studies with commonly used industrial dyes. Molecular docking using CCDC GOLD software gave a good score with all the textile dyes. Further, validation using molsoft ICM software showed a good binding energy of −104.25, −106.00, −113.98, and −100.36, with commercial dyes, i.e., procion blue, procion green, procion red, and reactive yellow 86, respectively. Experimental data showed a maximum decolorization with procion green (85.66 %) and procion red (85.58 %), which validate the molsoft ICM results, i.e., −106.00 and −113.98, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper sulfate 3atoxicity 3aenergy 3awheat bran 3adecolorization 3amodels 3amethodology 3aearthworms 3apH 3abacterial communities 3adyes 3acomputer software 3alaccase 3abinding capacity 3adigestive system 0anew methods1 aSharma, Krishna Kant1 aJacob, Shenu1 aGakhar, S.

To simplify the heterogeneous kinetics, by means of a smaller number of kinetic parameters to encompass all the kinetic terms toward the products and reagents, a reversible kinetic model was used. From the comparison between the experimental and calculated conversions, it was possible to analyze the accuracy of the estimations, providing a good way to apply statistical treatments to improve the calculated kinetic properties. Thereby, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium constants for a range of reactions performed across different temperatures (40–80 °C) as well as the forward reaction activation energy (44.77 kJ mol–¹) and the reverse reaction activation energy (41.40 kJ mol–¹). Moreover, 70–76% glycerol conversion was obtained using the same catalyst for five reactions, without wash or performing any other pretreatments in the catalyst between reactions. The solketal product has been studied as a green industrial solvent additive in gasoline and biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aactivation energy 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3aengineering 3aexperimental design 3agasoline 3aglycerol 3akinetics 3asolvents 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aPessanha, Yolanda da S.

This article uses Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of the social field to name this context and to analyze the construction of the bureaucratic or public administrative field in the United States. Field is meant in a triple sense—public administration as a general, institutionalized field in the structure of government; public administration as a professional field; and public administration as an academic field of study. Thus, rather than the bureaucratic field, the relationship of these bureaucratic fields or an “ensemble of fields” is analyzed to consider how each field both bounds its own legitimation struggles and draws from other fields for symbolic resources—what Bourdieu called symbolic capital —to establish its legitimacy and position. The multifield quality of public administration is used to show how the nature of the general bureaucratic field is distinct from other fields insofar as it purports to represent a universal, general interest. This difference is used to theorize a distinction between “general” and “specific” legitimation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernment and administration 3aUnited States 0alegitimacy 0alegitimation 0apublic administration 0aPierre Bourdieu1 aHu, Qian0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2009 Nov., v. 53, no. 3 p.458-481dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642093388033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013400165300001600299520105800315592002801373596006501401596014901466596027401615650002201889650002701911650001601938650001801954650002301972650001901995650001002014650002002024650001502044650001102059650001402070650001602084650001902100650001502119650001602134650001402150650001902164700001502183700001802198700001402216700001402230700001202244700001502256700001402271700001302285773012802298856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60627571220221120125305.0190816e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062757122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-018-2806-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ruifan10aOne-Step Bioprocess of Inulin to Product Inulo-Oligosaccharides Using Bacillus subtilis Secreting an Extracellular Endo-Inulinase  ap. 116-128.  aInulo-oligosaccharides (IOSs), a novel food additive and health product, represent a promising alternative to antibiotics. As prebiotics, IOSs can be obtained from inulin by endo-inulinase-mediated hydrolysis. Nonetheless, enzymatic catalysis is not feasible industrially because of the required catalytic conditions and cost. In this study, a 2331-bp optimized gene inuQ (from Pseudomonas mucidolens) encoding endo-inulinase was cloned into shuttle vector PHY300PLK and transfected into Bacillus subtilis WB800-R, with the simultaneous deletion of gene sacC encoding levanase. The maximal IOS yield after hydrolysis of the crude extract of inulin was 67.84 ± 0.72 g/L for a recombinant strain with the signal peptide nprB from alkaline protease and promoter P₄₃. The conversion rate reached 75.38%. For the major IOSs, the degree of polymerization was between 3 and 5. This study offers a simple and efficient one-step bioprocess for IOS production from inulin through secretion of an extracellular heterologous endo-inulinase by B. subtilis.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant 21376203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGrant JHB2011-54cthe Promotion Program of Achievements in Scientific Research for Industrial Production of Higher Education of Jiangsu Province  aGrant BE2012394cQinglan Project of Higher Education of Jiangsu Province, Overseas Research & Training Program for University Prominent Young & Middle-aged Teachers and Presidents of Jiangsu Province, Jiangsu Agricultural Key Technology Research and Development Program 3aBacillus subtilis 3aPseudomonas mucidolens 3aantibiotics 3abioprocessing 3acatalytic activity 3afood additives 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3ahydrolysis 3ainulin 3ainulinase 3anovel foods 3apolymerization 3aprebiotics 3aproteinases 3asecretion 3asignal peptide1 aQiu, Yibin1 aHuang, Weiwei1 aZhang, Li1 aXue, Feng1 aNi, Hao1 aMei, Difen1 aGao, Jian1 aXu, Hong0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.116-128dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2806-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245007000204520110400274592002801378596004801406650002901454650002501483650001301508650001301521650002201534650002301556650002301579650001501602650002101617651001101638700002401649700002001673700002401693700001901717773007901736856007701815852000901892655001201901IND60624325820221119163423.0190326e20180621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062432582DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/40795872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasangaki, Patrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8178-042910aApis mellifera adansonii Is the Most Defensive Honeybee in Uganda  aHoneybee defensive behaviour is an important trait for selection of honeybees for breeding programs. We evaluated the variation in honeybee defensive behaviour with environmental factors and hive conditions. Factors such as the difference in the agro-ecological zones, colony strength, mean elevation, type of bee hive used, and the vegetation cover were considered. The number of honeybees attacking the researchers’ protective gear within one minute of disturbance was recorded per colony and analyzed. Apis m. adansonii was found to be the most defensive. Variations in the agro-ecological zones, colony strength, and mean elevation were found to significantly influence the defensive behaviour of the honeybees. Honeybee colonies in the Mid North AEZ were the most defensive. The type of bee hive and vegetation cover did not have any influence on the defensive behaviour. From this study, we suggest that selection of honeybees that are less defensive for breeding programs should consider A. m. scutellata and honeybee colonies from West Nile and Southern Highland AEZs at higher elevations.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Agricultural Research Organization 3aApis mellifera adansonii 3aagroecological zones 3aaltitude 3abeehives 3abreeding programs 3adefensive behavior 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3avegetation cover 3aUganda1 aNyamasyo, Gideon N.1 aNdegwa, Paul N.1 aAngiro, Christopher1 aKajobe, Robert0 tPsyche.g2018 June 21, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:jnl19278x1687-74387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/40795873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245013200178300001400310520034500324592002800669650002100697650000900718651001100727653002000738653001600758653002300774653002000797653001500817653001100832700002500843700002200868700001800890773007500908856008100983852000901064655001201073IND60519803620221118120215.0160511e20070201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051980362DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-007-0013-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĆurčić, Božidar P.

Generation of ground rubber from scrap tires is the dominant management option in China. It is necessary to assess the environmental impacts of ground rubber production from scrap tires to provide technical advices on a cleaner production. METHODS: Production of ground rubber from recycled scrap tires consist of three steps: rubber powder preparation, devulcanization, and refining. A process life cycle assessment (LCA) of ground rubber production from scrap tires is carried out, and Eco-indicator 99 method coupled with ecoinvent database is applied to evaluate the environmental impacts of this process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: During the ground rubber production stage, the impact factor of respiratory inorganic is the most serious one. Devulcanization has the highest environmental load of about 66.2 %. Moreover, improvement on the flue gas treatment contributes to a cleaner production and a more environmental-friendly process. Applying clean energy can largely reduce environmental load by about 21.5 %. CONCLUSIONS: The results can be a guidance to reduce environmental load when producing ground rubber from scrap tires. Meanwhile, increasing energy efficiency, improving environmental protection equipment, and applying clean energy are the effective measures to achieve this goal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3aequipment 3alife cycle assessment 3arefining 3arenewable energy sources 3arubber 3atires 3aChina1 aWang, Qiaoli1 aJin, Jiajia1 aLi, Sujing0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2014 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.1833-1842dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-014-0793-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010500183300001600288500002400304520198900328650001602317650000902333650001802342650001702360650001702377650001402394650001902408650001802427650001002445650002302455650002802478650001202506700001502518700002102533773009102554852000902645856008502654655001202739IND4457847820221120202811.0110510s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445784782DNAL7 a224399492pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100022112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHildebrand, B.10aEffect of maize silage to grass silage ratio and feed particle size on ruminal fermentation in vitro  ap. 528-536.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of the forage source on ruminal fermentation in vitro was investigated for fine (F) and coarse (C) milled diets, using a modified Hohenheim gas production test and a semi-continuous rumen simulation technique (Rusitec). It was hypothesised that the replacement of maize silage by grass silage might lead to associative effects and that interactions related to particle size variation could occur. Five diets with a maize silage to grass silage ratio of 100 : 0, 79 : 21, 52 : 48, 24 : 76 and 0 : 100 differed in their content of CP and carbohydrate fractions, as well as digestible crude nutrients, derived from a digestibility trial with wether sheep. For in vitro investigations, the diets were ground to pass a sieve of either 1 mm (F) or 4 mm (C) perforation. Cumulative gas production was recorded during 93 h of incubation and its capacity decreased with increasing proportion of grass silage in the diet. Across all diets, gas production was delayed in C treatments compared with F treatments. Degradation of crude nutrients and detergent fibre fractions was determined in a Rusitec system. Daily amounts of NH3-N and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were measured in the effluent. Degradation of organic matter (OM) and fibre fractions, as well as amounts of NH3-N, increased with stepwise replacement of maize silage by grass silage. Degradability of CP was unaffected by diet composition, as well as total SCFA production. In contrast to the results of the gas production test, degradation of OM and CP was higher in C than in F treatments, accompanied by higher amounts of NH3-N and SCFA. Interactions of silage ratio and particle size were rare. It was concluded that the stepwise replacement of maize silage by grass silage might lead to a linear response of most fermentation characteristics in vitro. This linear effect was also supported by total tract digestibility data. However, further investigations with silages of variable quality seem to be necessary. 3acorn silage 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afermentation 3agrass silage 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3ashort chain fatty acids 3awethers1 aBoguhn, J.1 aRodehutscord, M.0 tAnimal.g2011 Apr., v. 5, no. 4 p.528-536dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100022113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03303naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245012000175300001800295500001500313520149600328650001301824650004501837650001201882650000901894650001501903650002301918650001501941650003701956650002501993650002102018650001302039650001202052650002302064650005802087650001302145650001502158650004702173650003002220650004902250650002302299653002602322653002802348700002002376700001102396700001902407700001602426700001702442700001702459773007602476852000902552856008102561930003302642945001302675946001302688655001202701IND2332416520221120203113.0030506e200212  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233241652DNAL7 a125125742pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.12.18322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoto, R.M.10aSingle-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays for major histocompatibility complex B genotyping in chickens  ap. 1832-1841.  a2019-12-04  aWe have developed a DNA-based method for defining MHC B system genotypes in chickens. Genotyping by this method requires neither prior determination of allele-specific differences in nucleotide sequence nor the preparation of haplotype-specific alloantisera. Allelic differences at chicken B-F (class I) and B-L (class II) loci are detected in PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays. PCR primer pairs were designed to hybridize specifically with conserved sequences surrounding hypervariable regions within the two class I and two class II loci of the B-complex and used to generate DNA fragments that are heat- and formamide-denatured and then analyzed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. PCR primer pairs were tested for the capacity to produce SSCP patterns allowing the seven B haplotypes in the MHC B congenic lines, and seven B haplotypes known to be segregating in two commercial broiler breeder lines to be distinguished. Primer pairs were further evaluated for their capacity to reveal the segregation of B haplotypes in a fully pedigreed family and in a closed population. Concordance was found between SSCP patterns and previously assigned MHC types. B-F and B-L SSCP patterns segregated in linkage as expected for these closely linked loci. We conclude that this method is valuable for defining MHC B haplotypes and for detecting potential recombinant haplotypes especially when used in combination with B-G (class IV) typing by restriction fragment pattern. 3achickens 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aalleles 3aloci 3ahaplotypes 3asequence alignment 3aDNA probes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA conformation 3apedigree 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgenetics 2aDeoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specificxmetabolism 2aGenotype 2aHaplotypes 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational 2aSequence Alignment 0alaboratory techniques 0amolecular sequence data1 aAfanassieff, M.1 aHa, J.1 aIglesias, G.M.1 aEwald, S.J.1 aBriles, W.E.1 aMiller, M.M.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Dec., v. 81, no. 12 p.1832-1841x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.12.18323Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04181naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245012200177300001800299500002400317520183900341650002102180650001302201650002102214650001502235650001602250650002502266650001602291650002502307650001102332650002402343650002002367650001902387650003602406650002402442650001502466650002002481650001802501650002802519650002602547650002702573650001802600650005202618650004002670650004202710650004802752650001502800650001102815650001102826650000902837650003202846650002402878650004402902650006802946651001003014651001003024700001803034700002303052700001303075700001303088700001403101700001903115700002003134700001703154700002103171700001803192773010703210852000903317856008503326655001203411IND4457564720221120202830.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756472DNAL7 a211253332pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0586-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zan10aProteomic identification of differentially-expressed proteins in esophageal cancer in three ethnic groups in Xinjiang  ap. 3261-3269.  aIncludes references  aThe Objective is to identify candidate biomarkers for Squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three ethnics in Xinjiang as well as reveal molecular mechanism. Proteins from 15 pairs of ESCC and matching adjacent normal esophageal tissues (five pairs in each ethnic of Kazakh, Uygur and Han) were separated by 2-DE and differentially proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. After identified by Mascot database, some of interesting proteins were confirmed in the other 175 pairs of ESCC by immuno histochemistry. Comparison of patterns revealed 20 proteins significantly changed, of which 12 protein with concordantly increased, such as ACTB protein, COMT protein, Syntaxin binding protein Pyruvate Kinase (PKM2), Cathepsin D, Chromosome 1 open reading frame 8, Heat shock protein 27, Cdc42, Proteosome, LLDBP, Immunoglobulin, TNF receptor associated factor 7; and eight protein spots with concordantly decreased intensity in ESCC, such as Adenylate kinase 1, General transcription factor II H, Smooth muscle protein, Trangelin, Early endosome antigen 1, Annexin A2, Fibrin beta, Tropomyosin. There were a significant difference in protein overexpression of PKM2 (74.9%) and Cathepsin D (85.1%) in ESCC compared to adjacent tissues (P < 0.05) by immunohistochemistry. Further, overexpression of Cathepsin D was obvious difference in Hazakh ESCC (94.7%) than that in Uygur (78.6%) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the overexpression of Cathepsin D was reversely associated with ESCC differentiation (P < 0.05). Twenty proteins differentially-expressed between ESCC and normal tissues were identified. Cathepsin D and PKM2 were for the first time observed to be dysregulated in Kazakh's ESCC. Moreover, Cathepsin D may play a complicated role both in carcinogenesis and cell-differentiation of ESCC. 3aadenylate kinase 3aantigens 3abinding proteins 3abiomarkers 3acathepsin D 3acell differentiation 3achromosomes 3aesophageal neoplasms 3afibrin 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmunoglobulins 3amuscle protein 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aopen reading frames 3aproteomics 3apyruvate kinase 3asmooth muscle 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAsian People. 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxchemistryxpathology. 2aCathepsin Dxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aEsophageal Neoplasmsxchemistryxpathology. 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxanalysis 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aPyruvate Kinasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 3aChina 0aChina1 aFeng, Jun-guo1 aTuersun, Aerziguli1 aLiu, Tao1 aLiu, Hui1 aLiu, Qing1 aZheng, Shu-tao1 aHuang, Cong-gai1 aLv, Guo-dong1 aSheyhidin, Ilyar1 aLu, Xiao Mei.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3261-3269dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0586-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03725naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011700183300001800300500002400318520143200342650002101774650001901795650001401814650001901828650001801847650001601865650001301881650001301894650002101907650002001928650003101948650001001979650001101989650002102000650001702021650002402038650001902062650002202081650001702103650002602120650002402146650004102170650004202211650003002253650005202283650002802335650004202363650005602405650003002461650002302491650002702514650002602541650003202567650006802599700003302667700002302700700002202723700002502745700002402770700002002794773010702814852000902921856008502930655001203015IND4457565520221120202944.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756552DNAL7 a211040202pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0438-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaquis, Sandra10aCharacterization of a F-box gene up-regulated by phytohormones and upon biotic and abiotic stresses in grapevine  ap. 3327-3337.  aIncludes references  aF-box proteins are key components of the ubiquitin (Ub)/26S proteasome pathway that mediates selective degradation of regulatory proteins involved in a wide variety of cellular processes affecting eukaryotic cells. In plants, F-box genes form one of the largest multigene superfamilies and control many important biological functions. Among the F-box genes characterized to date only few have been involved in the regulation of plant defense responses. Moreover, no F-box genes have been studied and characterized in grapevine. Using a differential display approach we isolated a F-box gene (BIG-24.1), which is up-regulated during Botrytis cinerea infection of grapevine leaves. BIG-24.1 encodes a polypeptide of 386 amino acids with a conserved F-box domain in the N-terminus region and a kelch domain. By investigating expression profiles of BIG-24.1, we show that the gene expression is strongly stimulated in B. cinerea infected berries and in grapevine cells challenged by MAMP rhamnolipids, a non-host bacterium and an endophytic rhizobacterium. The gene is also strongly induced by abiotic stresses including UV-C and wounding or by salicylic acid, methyl-jasmonate, ethylene and abscisic acid that are known to be involved in defense signalling pathways. In addition, sequence analysis of the BIG-24.1 promoter revealed the presence of several regulatory elements involved in the activation of plant defense responses. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aF-box proteins 3aRhizobium 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3aethylene 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3apolypeptides 3aregulatory proteins 3asalicylic acid 3asequence analysis 3asmall fruits 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBotrytisxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aF-Box Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStress, Physiological 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects 2aVitisxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aMazeyrat-Gourbeyre, Florence1 aFernandez, Olivier1 aCrouzet, Jérôme1 aClément, Christophe1 aBaillieul, Fabienne1 aDorey, Stéphan0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3327-3337dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0438-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03523naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245012100176300001600297500001500313520172800328650001102056650001802067650002302085650002202108650001602130650001802146650002402164650002102188650002702209650001502236650002002251650001802271650002202289650002102311650002302332650001302355650001002368650001202378650002602390650001302416650004602429650001102475650004202486650002602528650002302554650003202577653002002609653001302629700001702642700001802659773007302677852000902750856007902759930003302838945001302871946001302884655001202897IND2334153120221120202927.0030925e200302  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233415312DNAL7 a126197932pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.2.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddish, J.M.10aEffect of selection for growth on onset of sexual maturity in randombred and growth-selected lines of Japanese quail  ap. 187-191.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to determine the effect of selection for growth (BW) on the onset of reproduction (first egg) in Japanese quail hens from growth-selected (HW) and randombred (R1) lines. The HW line had undergone over 40 generations of selection for increased 4-wk BW and was originally developed from the R1 line. Data were collected over two consecutive hatches and summarized by hatch and within lines. Body weight at 35 d of age was positively correlated with BW at sexual maturity (first egg) in both the R1 and HW lines, but these correlations were not significant in both hatches for either line (Hatch 1-R1; Hatch 2-HW; P less than or equal to 0.05). There was a negative correlation between age at sexual maturity (days to first egg) and 35 d BW in both lines with the exception of the HW hens in Hatch 2. Age at sexual maturity and BW at sexual maturity was positively correlated (P less than or equal to 0.001) in the R1 line but did not show the same relationship in the HW line. Age at sexual maturity and weight of the abdominal fat pad were positively correlated in the R1 line (Hatch 1, P less than or equal to 0.01; Hatch 2, P less than or equal to 0.001), but this relationship was not significant in the HW line. Age at sexual maturity and follicle number was negatively correlated in both lines but was not significant in Hatch 2 of the HW line. Follicle size, however, was positively correlated with days to first egg in only Hatch 2 (P less than or equal to 0.001) of the HW line. The data suggest that the relationships between the onset of sexual maturity and both reproductive parameters and carcass traits in hens from consecutive hatches of HW quail are less clear than in the R1 line. 3aweight 3aanimal growth 3aselection response 3aovarian follicles 3abody weight 3abreast muscle 3aanimal reproduction 3aage at first egg 3aphenotypic correlation 3aegg weight 3aanimal genetics 3aabdominal fat 3aCoturnix japonica 3aline differences 3aselection criteria 3aoviducts 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aOvarian Folliclexanatomy & histology 2aOvipositionxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSexual Maturationxgenetics 0aJapanese quails 0abody fat1 aNestor, K.E.1 aLilburn, M.S.0 tPoultry science.g2003 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.187-191x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.2.1873Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02626naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245019800182300001800380500002400398520104700422650002201469650001001491650002601501650002001527650003001547650000901577650002501586650001401611650001801625650001101643650001301654650001101667650000901678650003601687650001301723650004001736650004301776650003001819650002601849650001401875650002301889700001901912773010701931852000902038856008502047655001202132IND4457566420221120190740.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756642DNAL7 a211077272pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0448-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazeli, Zahra13aAn artifact band frequently associated with variable number of tandem repeat marker at phenylalanine hydroxylase gene: application in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria  ap. 3395-3399.  aIncludes references  aThe variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) marker located at the 3′-end of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, PAHVNTR marker, is commonly used in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the PKU disease. During the molecular diagnosis of the disease, an artifact band associated with the PAHVTNR marker was frequently observed. Analysis of genotyping data from nine trios families indicated that in heterozygote individuals, the observed stutter (artifact) bands at PAHVNTR marker were minor bands with one repeat sequence shorter than the upper main bands. More investigations using sequencing revealed that the artifact band was associated with VNTRs including seven or higher core repeats. In statistical analysis, 75% of the studied heterozygote individuals represented PCR artifact band. The presence of the artifact band associated with PAHVNTR marker highlights a serious alarm risk of possible technical misdiagnosis in the application of the PAHVNTR marker in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the PKU disease. 3adisease diagnosis 3agenes 3aminisatellite repeats 3aphenylketonuria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 2aArtifacts 2aCarrier State 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMinisatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPedigree 2aPhenylalanine Hydroxylasexgenetics 2aPhenylketonuriasxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Diagnosis1 aVallian, Sadeq0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3395-3399dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0448-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03392naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003500164245013000199300001800329500002400347500001500371520160600386650004401992650002602036650002502062650001402087650000802101650001302109650001302122650001402135650001002149650002102159650001402180650005502194650003702249650005302286650001102339650001102350650003402361650001402395650003202409650007202441651001102513651001102524653001002535700003902545700002802584700002502612773010702637852000902744856008502753655001202838IND4457565720221120190607.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756572DNAL7 a211077292pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0440-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa Aguiar, Vitor Rezende10aComparison of DGGE and immunohistochemistry in the detection of TP53 variants in a Brazilian sample of sporadic breast tumors  ap. 3351-3354.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe presence of TP53 gene mutations in breast cancer has been associated with worse prognosis. These mutations interfere with the ability of the p53 protein, a transcription factor, to regulate the expression of target genes. Unlike the wild-type protein, which is rapidly degraded in cells, mutated forms have increased half-life and accumulate in tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is widely used in Brazil in the determination of breast cancer patients' prognosis. However, this technique is not able to detect many altered forms of the p53 protein (false-negative results) and readily detects the accumulation of wild-type p53 (false-positive results) that is associated with non-tumoral processes. For these reasons, we have set out to compare the efficiency of IHC with a molecular technique that detects gene variations at the DNA level in the evaluation of Brazilian patients with sporadic breast cancer. We have used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to study the TP53 status in 45 tumors, finding 26 allelic variants, most of them located in exon 4. Comparing the two techniques, IHC showed a false-negative rate of 64% and a false-positive rate of 50%. These results confirm the inability of IHC to correctly detect TP53 status, reason because it should not be routinely used to establish prognosis of breast cancer patients in Brazilian Pathology Laboratories. We recommend the utilization of a screening method, such as DGGE, followed by sequencing of altered exonic fragments to correctly detect TP53 gene variants and establish the prognosis of breast cancer patients. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3atranscription factors 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aprognosis 3aDNA 3amutation 3apatients 3ascreening 3aexons 3abreast neoplasms 3ahalf life 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Mutational Analysisxmethods 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresisxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aPrognosis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0agenes1 ade Freitas Cordeiro-Silva, Melissa1 ade Carvalho, Alex Assis1 aLouro, Iúri Drumond0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3351-3354dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0440-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02493naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245016400184300001800348500002400366520101700390650001601407650001001423650001801433650002801451650001701479650001201496650001001508650001901518650002601537650003001563650004901593650002801642650001401670650004001684650002701724700002301751700001601774700001801790700002601808773010701834852000901941856008501950655001202035IND4457566020221120190703.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756602DNAL7 a211044442pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0444-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaruyama, Naoto10aComplete mitochondrial genomes of two green lacewings, Chrysoperla nipponensis (Okamoto, 1914) and Apochrysa matsumurae Okamoto, 1912 (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)  ap. 3367-3373.  aIncludes references  aWe describe the complete mitochondrial genomes of the green lacewing species Chrysoperla nipponensis (Okamoto, 1914) and Apochrysa matsumurae Okamoto 1912 (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae).

A major noncoding (control) region was 1,244 bp in C. nipponensis and 1,407 in A. matsumurae, and the structure was simpler than that reported in other Neuroptera, lacking conserved blocks or long tandem repeats. The overall arrangement of genes was almost the same as that found in most arthropod mitochondrial genomes, with the one exception of a tRNA rearrangement to tRNA-Cys-tRNA-Trp-tRNA-Tyr, rather than the plesiomorphic tRNA-Trp-tRNA-Cys-tRNA-Tyr. A high A + T content (78.89 and 79.02%, respectively), A + T-rich codon bias, and a mismatch between the most-used codon and its corresponding tRNA anticodon were observed as a typical feature of the insect mitochondrial genome. 3aChrysoperla 3agenes 3aribosomal RNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3atransfer RNA 2aAnimals 2aCodon 2aGenome, Insect 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aInsectaxclassificationxcytologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Transfer, Amino Acylxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aMochizuki, Atsushi1 aSato, Yukie1 aNaka, Hideshi1 aNomura, M.q(Masashi)0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3367-3373dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0444-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03156naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015600182300001800338500002400356520149000380650002101870650002101891650002101912650003701933650002201970650001301992650001202005650001602017650003902033650002102072650002102093650003402114650003602148650002002184650002202204650001302226650001402239650002602253650003602279700001902315700001802334700001602352700001902368700002002387700001802407773010702425852000902532856008502541655001202626IND4457567520221120190556.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756752DNAL7 a211044412pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0459-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Faqian10aStart codon targeted polymorphism for evaluation of functional genetic variation and relationships in cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes  ap. 3487-3494.  aIncludes references  aCultivated peanut possesses an extremely narrow genetic basis. Polymorphism is considerably difficult to identify with the use of conventional biochemical and molecular tools. For the purpose of obtaining considerable DNA polymorphisms and fingerprinting cultivated peanut genotypes in a convenient manner, start codon targeted polymorphism technique was used to study genetic diversity and relatedness among 20 accessions of four major botanical varieties of peanut. Of 36 primers screened, 18 primers could produce unambiguous and reproducible bands. All 18 primers generated a total of 157 fragments, with a mean of 8.72 ranging from 4 to 17 per primer. Of 157 bands, 60 (38.22%) were polymorphic. One to seven polymorphic bands were amplified per primer, with 3.33 polymorphic bands on average. Polymorphism per primer ranged from 14.29 to 66.67%, with an average of 36.76%. The results revealed that not all accessions of the same variety were grouped together and high genetic similarity was detected among the tested genotypes based on cluster analysis and genetic distance analysis, respectively. Further, accession-specific markers were observed in several accessions. All these results demonstrated the following: (1) start codon targeted polymorphism technique can be utilized to identify DNA polymorphisms and fingerprint cultivars in domesticated peanut, and (2) it possesses considerable potential for studying genetic diversity and relationships among peanut accessions. 3aArachis hypogaea 3acluster analysis 3agenetic distance 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3apeanuts 3astart codon 2aArachisxclassificationxgenetics. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCodon, Initiator 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods1 aZhong, Ruichun1 aHan, Zhuqiang1 aJiang, Jing1 aHe, Liangqiong1 aZhuang, Weijian1 aTang, Ronghua0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3487-3494dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0459-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04028naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245012000175300001600295500001500311520152700326650001201853650002101865650001901886650002401905650001601929650002001945650001101965650002101976650001101997650002202008650002002030650002202050650002002072650001802092650002102110650001802131650001602149650001402165650001402179650001502193650002102208650001702229650001402246650002202260650002102282650002102303650004702324650001202371650002402383650002102407650002502428650003902453650000902492650001302501650004202514650002002556650001302576650003102589650000902620650004802629650004502677650001602722653001702738653002202755653002202777653001902799653000702818653001702825700002702842700001402869700001602883700001902899773007302918852000902991856007903000930003303079945001303112946001303125655001203138IND2334161020221120181303.0030926e200302  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233416102DNAL7 a126198092pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.2.3012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, S.A.10aDietary electrolyte balance for broiler chickens under moderately high ambient temperatures and relative humidities  ap. 301-308.  a2019-12-04  aCobb male broiler chicks (1,000) on new litter were used to evaluate effects of dietary electrolyte balance [DEB; Na+K-Cl, milliequivalents (mEq) per kilogram] under tropical summer conditions. Corn-soybean meal-based mash diets had salt (NaCl) alone or in combination with one or more supplements: sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), or potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3). A completely randomized design, with five starter and grower feed treatments (control: 145, then 130 mEq/kg; or 0, 120, 240, or 360 mEq/kg throughout) and four replicate pens (1.5 x 3.2 m) per treatment (50 chicks per pen), was used. Diets were analyzed for Na, K, and Cl for confirmation. There were no significant (P < 0.05) effects of treatments on mortality or processing parameters. Water intake increased linearly with increasing DEB, giving higher litter moistures and lower rectal temperatures. Blood HCO3 and pH increased with the highest DEB (360 mEq/kg) causing respiratory alkalosis. The DEB of 240 mEg/kg gave best weight gain and feed conversion ratio, and ideal DEB predicted by regression analyses were 186 and 197 mEq/kg from 0 to 21 d of age and 236 and 207 mEq/kg of feed from 0 to 42 d, respectively. These DEB corresponded to estimated (interpolated) values in predicted optimal 186 to 197 mEq/kg starter of Na 0.38 to 0.40% and Cl 0.405 to 0.39% (K = 0.52%), in 207 to 236 mEq/kg starter, Na 0.409 to 0.445% and Cl 0.326 to 0.372% Cl (K = 0.52%), and in grower Na 0.41 to 0.445%, Cl 0.315 to 0.267% (K = 0.47%). 3acations 3abroiler chickens 3acarbon dioxide 3aambient temperature 3aheat stress 3aliveweight gain 3aanions 3anutrient balance 3asodium 3aacid-base balance 3abroiler feeding 3arelative humidity 3afeed conversion 3astarter diets 3abody temperature 3awater content 3afeed intake 3apotassium 3amortality 3acarbonates 3alitter (bedding) 3agrower diets 3achlorides 3adiurnal variation 3awater metabolism 3adietary minerals 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxblood 2aBody Temperature 2aChickensxphysiology 2aChloridesxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aDrinking 2aElectrolytesxadministration & dosage 2aHot Temperature 2aHumidity 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aPotassium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aWeight Gain 0aelectrolytes 0aanimal physiology 0ablood composition 0aanimal feeding 0apH 0awater intake1 aFischer da Silva, A.V.1 aAriki, J.1 aHooge, D.M.1 aCummings, K.R.0 tPoultry science.g2003 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.301-308x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.2.3013Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03507naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245009300175300001800268500001500286520161400301650002101915650002101936650001601957650001901973650001401992650002302006650002702029650001602056650002102072650001602093650001902109650003202128650001102160650001502171650003102186650004702217650001202264650001302276650004202289650001802331650000902349650005402358650001102412650004102423650002502464650002502489650002402514650004002538653002302578653002102601700002202622773007602644852000902720856008102729930003302810945001302843946001302856655001202869IND2333201220221120181358.0030624e200210  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233320122DNAL7 a124129202pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.10.15332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespo, N.10aNutrient and fatty acid deposition in broilers fed different dietary fatty acid profiles  ap. 1533-1542.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of different dietary fatty acid profiles on efficiency of energy, fat, nitrogen, and fatty acid deposition in broiler chickens. Sixty female broiler chickens were fed a basal diet without additional fat or with 4 other diets with different fats (tallow, olive, sunflower, and linseed oils) at 10% from 28 to 48 d of age. Among broilers fed diets with added fat, those fed linseed oil had less abdominal fat (in grams and percentage) than those fed tallow (P < 0.05). Absorbed fat losses were slightly higher for birds fed linseed oil, and nitrogen efficiency was lower in those fed tallow (P < 0.05). However, there were not significant differences in energy deposition among broilers fed diets with added fat. Fatty acid balance showed the highest values of fatty acid oxidation during the experimental period in broilers fed linseed oil (48.2 g), followed by those fed sunflower oil (23.2 g). Contribution of endogenous fat synthesis to total body fat deposition was minimal in birds fed diets with added fat accounting for 3, 1.2, 8.5, and 7.5 g for broilers fed tallow, olive, sunflower, and linseed oils, respectively. This reflects lipogenesis inhibition by dietary fat addition. Interestingly, between broilers fed diets with added fat, higher values of fatty acids from endogenous synthesis were found in broilers fed diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Results suggest that reduction of abdominal fat in broilers fed linseed oil seems to be a consequence of higher lipid oxidation despite the higher synthesis of endogenous fatty acids. 3abroiler chickens 3anitrogen balance 3adietary fat 3afeed additives 3aolive oil 3alipid peroxidation 3along chain fatty acids 3alinseed oil 3abody composition 3alipogenesis 3aenergy balance 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atallow 2aAbsorption 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFats 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLinseed Oilxadministration & dosage 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosage 0afatty acid balance 0alipid metabolism1 aEsteve-Garcia, E.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1533-1542x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.10.15333Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03491naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245012400175300001800299520143700317650002101754650001601775650001901791650001101810650001401821650001801835650001601853650003201869650003201901650002601933650001601959650001001975650001101985650001301996650001602009650001602025650002002041650002002061650002702081650001202108650003102120650001202151650002102163650002502184650000902209650005502218650000902273650004102282650001102323650004102334650002302375650003602398650004302434650001502477650004002492653001402532700002202546773007602568852000902644856008102653930003302734945001302767946001302780655001202793IND2333201820221120172315.0030624e200210  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233320182DNAL7 a124129232pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.10.15552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespo, N.10aDietary linseed oil produces lower abdominal fat deposition but higher de novo fatty acid synthesis in broiler chickens  ap. 1555-1562.  aPrevious experiments have shown lower abdominal and body fat deposition in broilers fed polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) compared with those fed saturated fatty acids (SFA) or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). These changes in fat deposition may be related to different rates of lipid synthesis or lipid oxidation. In Experiment 1, in vivo lipogenesis of broilers fed different dietary fatty acid profiles (tallow, sunflower oil, or linseed oil) was investigated. In Experiment 2, liver fatty acid deposition of broilers fed a basal diet (without additional fat) or diets with added tallow, olive oil, sunflower oil, or linseed oil was studied. Results from Experiment 1 showed higher rates of de novo fatty acid synthesis in broilers fed the diet with added linseed oil (P < 0.05), compared with those fed tallow or sunflower oil. In Experiment 2, values of liver-to-dietary-fatty-acid ratios of fatty acids from endogenous synthesis (SFA, n-7 and n-9 fatty acids) were higher in broilers fed linseed oil and the basal diet. Results obtained in both experiments suggest that lower abdominal and body fat deposition of broilers fed PUFA compared with those fed SFA or monounsaturated fatty acids is mainly due to differences in lipid oxidation rates and that the higher in vivo lipogenesis found in broilers fed linseed oil would be another mechanism to dissipate energy, contributing to the lower fat deposition in these birds. 3abroiler chickens 3adietary fat 3afeed additives 3atallow 3aolive oil 3asunflower oil 3alinseed oil 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3aweight 3abody fat 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3afatty acid composition 2aAbdomen 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aFats 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aFemale 2aLinseed Oilxadministration & dosage 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aLipidsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aLiverxanatomy & histologyxchemistry. 2aOrgan Size 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosage 0aliver fat1 aEsteve-Garcia, E.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1555-1562x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.10.15553Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03439naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245015800173300001200331520163900343650001301982650001801995650002302013650002302036650001102059650001102070650002002081650002002101650001302121650002302134650002402157650001802181650001502199650001602214650002302230650002702253650002002280650002502300650001202325650002602337650001302363650002302376650001402399650001302413650001102426650000902437650000902446650002302455653002002478653002402498700001802522700001902540700001602559773006902575852000902644856007702653930003302730945001302763946001302776655001202789IND2334141120221120172302.0030923e200301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233414112DNAL7 a125802372pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, C.10aGenetic correlations between the maternal genetic effect on chick weight and the direct genetic effects on egg composition traits in a White Leghorn line  ap. 1-8.  aSelection can be a useful way to alter yolk proportion and thereby egg dry matter which, owing to its economic importance, is a trait of substantial importance for the egg-processing industry. However, the egg is primarily the chamber of embryonic development. The main purpose of this study was to estimate genetic correlations between the maternal effect on chick weight at hatching and the direct effect on different egg composition traits, in particular, yolk proportion. Additionally, genetic parameters were estimated for egg composition traits. To create a data set suitable for estimation of genetic parameters, a three-round selection experiment was set up. Birds were selected based on their predicted breeding values for the genetic maternal effect on chick weight and the direct genetic effect on yolk proportion according to the theory of elliptical selection. Genetic parameters were estimated using a multiple trait animal model and restricted maximum likelihood. The maternal heritability for chick weight was 0.5, whereas the direct heritability was close to 0. The genetic correlations between the maternal effect on chick weight and the direct effect on yolk proportion, yolk weight, albumen weight, albumen dry matter concentration, and egg weight were 0.14, 0.76, 0.93, 0.14, and 0.99, respectively. The heritabilities for yolk proportion, yolk weight, albumen weight, albumen dry matter concentration, and egg weight were 0.33, 0.43, 0.57, 0.38, and 0.60, respectively. We conclude that breeding ought to be a useful way to increase egg dry matter with no expected unfavorable correlated effects on chick weight. 3achickens 3aWhite Leghorn 3aselection criteria 3aselection response 3achicks 3aweight 3amaternal effect 3aegg composition 3aegg yolk 3agenetic covariance 3agenetic correlation 3alinear models 3aegg weight 3aegg albumen 3adry matter content 3aphenotypic correlation 3aanimal genetics 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aChickensxgenetics 2aEgg White 2aEgg Yolk 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOvum 2aSelection, Genetic 0ahatching weight 0aegg yolk proportion1 aJohansson, K.1 aStrandberg, E.1 aRydhmer, L.0 tPoultry science.g2003 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.1-8x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.1.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02046naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245007100176300001600247500001500263520065200278650002000930650002300950650001800973650001600991650002601007650001601033650002301049650001801072650001501090650001201105650002501117650003701142650001101179650002801190650003001218650005401248653002401302700001801326773007301344852000901417856007901426930003301505945001301538946001301551655001201564IND2334162720221120151048.0030926e200302  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233416272DNAL7 a126198142pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.2.3452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, T.10aArginine vasotocin induces bearing down for oviposition in the hen  ap. 345-346.  a2019-12-04  aAn intravenous injection of arginine vasotocin (AVT) at 16 h before the expected oviposition of the initial egg of an egg-laying sequence caused bearing down for oviposition.

In fertigated vegetable crops, N is often applied continuously throughout the crop, so such management requires accurate and quick on-farm diagnosis of crop N status to enable rapid correction of the N fertilizer rate. Proximal optical sensors are promising tools to monitor crop N status, but a prerequisite is the determination of reference values for optimal crop N status. The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) is a commonly-used indicator of crop N status, values › and ‹, respectively, indicate N excess and deficiency. In this work, the ability of optical sensor measurements of leaf chlorophyll (SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter) and of canopy reflectance (Crop Circle ACS 470) to assess crop N status throughout a fertigated, indeterminate tomato crop was evaluated. Reference values for optimal crop N nutrition of optical sensor measurements were derived from the relationships of these measurements to NNI, by solving for NNI=1. We pooled weekly data into four phenological phases (vegetative growth, flowering, early fruit growth and harvest) to simplify and ease use of sensors. The reference values varied slightly between phenological phases; for SPAD chlorophyll readings, the values were within the range 51 (early fruit growth) to 58 (vegetative) SPAD units, and for the reflectance index NDVI values were within the range 0.73 (flowering) to 0.77 (harvest). The approach developed for establishing reference values can facilitate on-farm use of optical sensors for monitoring crop N status, by enabling a quick assessment of whether crop N content deviates from optimal. 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3afertigation 3aflowering 3afruits 3aleaching 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anormal values 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3anutrition 3aphenology 3areflectance 3atomatoes 3avegetable crops 3avegetative growth1 aThompson, R.

Substrate specificity studies showed that Photorhabdus spp. exhibited a broad lipase activity, while most of the Xenorhabdus spp. secreted a specific lecithinase. Xenorhabdus spp. occur spontaneously in two variants, phase I and phase II. Only the phase I variants of Xenorhabdus nematophilus and Xenorhabdus bovienii strains produced lecithinase activity when the bacteria were grown on a solid lecithin medium (0.01% lecithin nutrient agar, 24 h of growth). Five enzymatic isomers responsible for this activity were separated from the supernatant of a X. nematophilus F1 culture in two chromatographic steps, cation-exchange chromatography and C18 reverse-phase chromatography. The substrate specificity of the X. nematophilus F1 lecithinase suggested that a phospholipase C preferentially active on phosphatidylcholine could be isolated. The entomotoxic properties of each isomer were tested by injection into the hemocoels of insect larvae. None of the isomers exhibited toxicity with the insects tested, Locusta migratoria, Galleria mellonella, Spodoptera littoralis, and Manduca sexta. The possible role of lecithinase as either a virulence factor or a symbiotic factor is discussed. 3aGalleria mellonella 3aHeterorhabditidae 3aLocusta migratoria 3aManduca sexta 3aPhotorhabdus 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aSteinernematidae 3aXenorhabdus bovienii 3aXenorhabdus nematophila 3aagar 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acation exchange chromatography 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aenzyme activity 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3aisomers 3alecithins 3aphospholipase C 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asubstrate specificity 3atoxicity 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnterobacteriaceaexenzymologyxpathogenicity. 2aErythrocytesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aHemocytesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aLipasexisolation & purification 2aNematodaxmicrobiology 2aPhospholipasesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSheep 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aDuvic, B.1 aGivaudan, A.1 aBoemare, N.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1998 July, v. 64, no. 7 p.2367-2373x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03508naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245006500169300001400234500016800248520184900416650002402265650001902289650001202308650002002320650001802340650002302358650001402381650001202395650002502407650001202432650002602444650001302470650001402483650001902497650001202516650001502528650001502543650001702558650001602575650001302591650001902604650001702623650001802640650002002658650002202678650001502700651001602715700001702731773014302748856005402891852000902945655001202954IND60594595820221120135114.0180521e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059459582DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1192.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaan, J. de10aAnimal manure use in vegetable production in the Netherlands  ap. 73-80.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Ecologically Sound Fertilization Strategies for Field Vegetable Production held May 18-22, 2015, Beijing, China  aApplication of animal manure in vegetables, when used right, can improve soil quality, crop production and financial returns on the long term. Use of animal manure closes nutrient and carbon cycles and contributes to several ecosystem services. The composition of animal manure varies considerably depending on animal species, housing system and feeding of animals. It is important to account for the composition of the manure when using it in vegetable production. Important aspects are the right selection of manure type, matching crop needs in nutrients and organic matter, and the right application of manure in time and place with minimum emissions. Animal manure is ample available in the Netherlands. It is widely used to cover nutrient needs and to sustain soil fertility in the intensive crop rotations in the Netherlands. Manure use in the Netherlands is severely restricted by legislation on nitrogen and phosphorus to prevent emissions to ground and surface water. Processing of animal manure is emerging to be able to use more manure in crop production efficiently next to other advantages for the animal farmer. Important processing techniques developed are 1) anaerobic digestion and 2) separation of manure in a liquid and a solid fraction combined with reversed osmosis making mineral concentrates. The value of animal manure for arable and vegetable crop production is difficult to calculate, especially for organic matter as it affects multiple processes in soil and plant growth. A first estimation of the value of animal manure for arable and vegetable farming on sandy soils is made based on a long-term experiment with different organic matter input treatments. Total value of slurry in the Netherlands is estimated between € 35 and 57 t-1 or € 430 and 2240 ha-1 based on input of 60 kg ha-1 of phosphate with slurry. 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal manures 3aanimals 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3afarmers 3alaws and regulations 3aliquids 3along term experiments 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aosmosis 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asandy soils 3aslurries 3asoil fertility 3asoil quality 3asurface water 3avegetable crops 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3aNetherlands1 aGeel, W. van0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Feb. 23, , no. 1192 p.73-80dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1192.8  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245014400176300001600320500001500336520132900351650002601680650002801706650001501734650002001749650002701769650001001796650002801806650001301834650001901847650002001866650000901886650001301895650002101908650001201929650001301941650002801954650002601982650002802008650001702036650004302053650004902096650002402145650004902169650004802218650002302266650002102289653002702310653001602337773007302353852000902426856007902435930003302514945001302547946001302560655001202573IND2334195720221120135059.0030930e200301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233419572DNAL7 a125802602pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.1.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, S.M.14aThe effect of electrolyzed oxidative water applied using electrostatic spraying on pathogenic and indicator bacteria on the surface of eggs  ap. 158-162.  a2019-12-04  aResearch was conducted to compare the effectiveness of electrolyzed oxidative (EO) water applied using an electrostatic spraying system (ESS) for killing populations of bacteria that are of concern to the poultry industry.

Even when very high concentrations of bacteria were inoculated onto eggs (many times higher than would be encountered in industrial situations), EO water was found to be effective when used in conjunction with electrostatic spraying for eliminating pathogenic and indicator populations of bacteria from hatching eggs. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacterial contamination 3asanitizers 3adecontamination 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3awater 3abioelectrical impedance 3asprayers 3aegg production 3afood sanitation 3aeggs 3aspraying 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEgg Shellxmicrobiology 2aElectrolysis 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & development 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxgrowth & development 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgrowth & development 2aStatic Electricity 2aWaterxchemistry 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0afood safety0 tPoultry science.g2003 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.158-162x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.1.1583Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02931naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245018600166300001800352520129700370650004001667650002901707650002101736650002201757650001801779650003301797650001601830650001501846650002101861650002201882650001701904650001601921650002901937650001001966650004401976650002402020650001802044650003902062650002802101650004102129650002802170650003102198700001802229773009802247852000902345930003302354945001302387946001302400655001202413IND2196467220221120135302.0990114e199807  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219646722DNAL7 a96478072pmid7 aPMC1064032pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerminan, E.10aHeterologous protein secretion directed by a repressible acid phosphatase system of Kluyveromyces lactis: characterization of upstream region-activating sequences in the KIPHO5 gene  ap. 2403-2408.  aTranscription of the repressible acid phosphatase gene (KIPHO5) in Kluyveromyces lactis is strongly regulated in response to the level of inorganic phosphate (Pi) present in the growth medium. We have begun a study of the promoter region of this gene in order to identify sequences involved in the phosphate control of KIPNO5 expression and to design new expression-secretion systems in K. lactis. Deletion analysis and directed mutagenesis revealed two major identical upstream activating sequences (UAS) CACGTG at positions -430 (UAS1) and -192 (UAS2) relative to the ATG initiation codon. These sequences are identical to those described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the binding of Pho4p. Deletion or directed mutagenesis of either one or both UAS reduce KIPHO5 expression by the same amount (approximately 80%). When fused to the coding region of trout growth hormone cDNA (tGH-II), the promoter and signal peptide-encoding region of the phosphate-repressible KIPHO5 gene drives the expression of this gene and the secretion of the tGHII protein. Synthesis of tGHIIp in K. lactis transformants carrying this construct was found to be regulated by the Pi present in the medium; derepression of heterologous protein expression can therefore be achieved by lowering the Pi concentration. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacid phosphatase 3acomplementary DNA 3aculture media 3aheterologous gene expression 3amutagenesis 3aphosphates 3apromoter regions 3aprotein secretion 3asomatotropin 3astart codon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrout 2aAcid Phosphatasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aKluyveromycesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed1 aDominguez, A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1998 July, v. 64, no. 7 p.2403-2408x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03009naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001100154245010300165300001600268500016800284520129500452650003601747650002001783650001501803650001201818650001101830650003001841650002201871650001501893650002001908650003301928650002701961650002601988650001102014650001302025650001302038650002502051650002402076650002202100650001902122700001502141700001502156700001502171700001202186700001502198700001502213700001302228700001702241773014502258856005502403852000902458655001202467IND60594596920221120130722.0180521e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059459692DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1192.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Y.10aEffects of nitrogen levels on yield, quality and soil environment of Chinese cabbage in open field  ap. 169-178.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Ecologically Sound Fertilization Strategies for Field Vegetable Production held May 18-22, 2015, Beijing, China  aField experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrogen fertilization on the yield, quality, nitrogen absorption, and nitrogen loss of autumn Chinese cabbage in an open field. Results indicated that Chinese cabbage yield, quality, economic efficiency, and nitrogen utilization firstly increased and then decreased with the increase in the amount of applied nitrogen. The optimal amount of applied nitrogen that can achieve high cabbage yield, high quality, and high income was 328.2-384.5 kg hm-2, in which organic fertilizer contributed 103.2 kg N hm-2. However, the amount of residual NO3- and ammonia volatilization increased with the increase of applied nitrogen, showing a highly significant linear relationship. With the existing extensive vegetable production and management methods, such as flooding irrigation, the use of quick-released N fertilizer with surface broadcasting method, to simultaneously, achieve high yield, quality, economic return, and environmental sustainability are difficult. Therefore, comprehensive studies on the effects of nitrogen fertilization on crop yield, quality, economic, and environment are necessary, in order to obtain the crop threshold of nitrogen application and to develop the best management practices. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3aautumn 3abest management practices 3acosts and returns 3acrop yield 3aedaphic factors 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aincome 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic fertilizers 3avegetable growing 3avolatilization1 aLiu, Z.

The implementation of European Union (EU) legislation is encouraging the adoption of fertiliser recommendation schemes. The most widely used schemes are those based on soil testing or on the use of indices that estimate the soil nitrogen supply. Soil testing approaches that are in use, particularly in NW Europe are the Nmin, KNS and N-Expert systems; the latter is operated as a computer-based decision support system (DSS). The comprehensive RB209 Fertiliser Manual of England and Wales uses soil N supply indices, but soil analysis can also be used. Nitrogen balance calculations are widely used throughout Europe and form part of the KNS and N-Expert systems, and a number of other DSSs. The N balance considers the various soil N sources and treats mineral N fertiliser as a supplemental N source. The EU-Rotate_N simulation model is a comprehensive and versatile tool, developed for diverse European conditions, that is useful for scenario analysis simulations to stakeholders. Various DSS have been developed in different European countries, with different levels of complexity. There are a number of different DSS that calculate N fertiliser recommendations for particular cropping systems; some DSS calculate the requirements for other nutrients, and some also do so for irrigation which is particularly useful where fertigation is used. Sap analysis has been shown to be sensitive to crop nutrient status, for N and some other  nutrients; currently, there is renewed interest in sap analysis. Proximal optical sensors are a promising approach for N management. 3aEuropean Union 3acropping systems 3adecision support systems 3afertigation 3airrigation 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3asap 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asoil analysis 3astakeholders 3avegetable crops 3aEngland1 aVoogt, W.1 aIncrocci, L.1 aFink, M.1 aNeve, S. de0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Feb. 23, , no. 1192 p.129-140dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1192.15  aDNAL 7aarticle04202naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245010600175300001600281500001500297520156900312650001201881650002101893650002201914650001601936650002401952650001601976650002001992650002302012650001102035650001102046650002202057650001602079650002202095650002002117650001902137650001802156650002102174650001402195650001602209650001402225650002102239650002202260650004702282650001202329650004202341650002502383650003902408650000902447650001102456650004202467650002202509650002002531650001302551650003102564650000902595650004902604650004802653650002402701650004802725650004502773650001302818650002602831650001602857650001302873653001702886653002202903653002002925653002602945653001402971653000702985700002702992700001403019700001603033700001903049773007303068852000903141856007903150930003303229945001303262946001303275655001203288IND2334207020221120130713.0031001e200303  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233420702DNAL7 a127054042pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.3.4282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, S.A.10aDietary electrolyte balance for broiler chickens exposed to thermoneutral or heat-stress environments  ap. 428-435.  a2019-12-04  aRoss male broiler chicks (n = 480) on new litter were used in a randomized block design with two blocks (environmental rooms) and four treatments having four replicate pens (1.0 x 2.5 m; 15 chicks) each to evaluate dietary electrolyte balance (DEB; P < 0.05). Two rooms were 1) thermoneutral (Weeks 1 through 6, with decreasing maximum from 32 to 25 degrees C and minimum from 28 to 19 degrees C; relative humidity 49 to 58%) and 2) cyclic daily heat stress (Weeks 1 and 2, thermoneutral; Weeks 2 through 6, maximum temperatures 35, 35, 33, and 33 degrees C, respectively; and minimum temperatures 23, 20, 19, and 19 degrees C, respectively; relative humidity 51 to 54%). The DEB treatments (0, 140, 240, or 340 mEq Na + K - Cl/kg) had NaHCO3 plus NH4Cl, or KHCO3, or both added to corn-soybean meal mash basal diets with 0.30% salt (NaCl). In the thermoneutral room, DEB 240 increased 42-d weight gain and 44-d lymphocyte percentage and decreased heterophil percentage and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio compared to the DEB 40 treatment. The DEB 240 diets had 0.35 and 0.35% Na and 0.37% and 0.29% Cl in starter (0.75% K) and grower (0.67% K) diets, respectively. No DEB treatment differences were found in the heat stress room. For combined rooms, 42-d feed intake was higher for DEB 240 than for DEB 40. The 21-d weight gain was higher for DEB 240 than for DEB 40 or 140; and 21-d feed/gain was lower for DEB 40 than for DEB 340.

A bifunctional single chain antibody has been developed for detection and binding of B. cereus T spores. The genes that encode B. cereus T spore single-chain antibody and streptavidin were connected for use in immunoassays and immobilization of the recombinant antibodies. A truncated streptavidin, which is smaller than but has biotin binding ability similar to that of streptavidin, was used as the affinity domain because of its high and specific affinity with biotin. The fusion protein gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with the T7 RNA polymerase-T7 promoter expression system. Immunoblotting revealed an antigen specificity similar to that of its parent native monoclonal antibody. The single-chain antibody-streptavidin fusion protein can be used in an immunoassay of B. cereus spores by applying a biotinylated enzyme detection system. The recombinant antibodies were immobilized on biotinylated magnetic beads by taking advantage of the strong biotin-streptavidin affinity. Various liquids were artificially contaminated with 5 x 10(4) B. cereus spores per ml. Greater than 90% of the B. cereus spores in phosphate buffer or 37% of the spores in whole milk were tightly bound and removed from the liquid phase by the immunomagnetic beads. 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aantigens 3abinding capacity 3abiotin 3afoods 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoblotting 3aliquids 3amagnetism 3amicroorganisms 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphosphates 3arecombinant antibodies 3ashelf life 3aspores 3astreptavidin 3awhole milk 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAntibodies, Bispecificxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBacillus cereusximmunology 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aSpores, Bacterialximmunology 2aStreptavidinxchemistryximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aTransformation, Bacterial1 aFoegeding, P.M.1 aSwaisgood, H.E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1998 July, v. 64, no. 7 p.2497-2502x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03572naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245007200168300001400240500013700254500001500391520144400406650001801850650001201868650002501880650003401905650001201939650001301951650000901964650001201973650004001985650001202025650002202037650002002059650001502079650002202094650001002116650003902126650002402165650003702189650001402226650002702240650002102267650001502288650002302303651001602326651001402342651001202356653002902368653003002397653003402427653003202461700001702493700002002510700002502530700002302555700001902578700001502597700002102612700002202633700001402655773014202669856005402811852000902865655001202874IND60594597520180925000000.0180521e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059459752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1193.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdkins, S.10aViruses of ornamentals emerging in Florida and the Caribbean region  ap. 17-20.  aPaper presented at the XIV International Symposium on Virus Diseases of Ornamental Plants held June 26-29, 2016 Singapore, Singapore  a2019-12-06  aHistorically, Tomato spotted wilt virus and Impatiens necrotic spot virus have been significant constraints to crop production worldwide. With the emergence of Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) and a natural Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV) reassortant in Florida and the Caribbean region, the significance of tospoviruses in production of major solanaceous vegetables including tomato and pepper has increased. In addition, TCSV has been reported in common solanaceous weeds including American black nightshade (Solanum americanum) and jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), in Florida and/or Puerto Rico. Experimental host range studies demonstrated that TCSV and/or GRSV can also infect solanaceous (Petunia and Brugmansia) and non-solanaceous (Garden Impatiens) ornamentals. During 2014, the first natural TCSV infections of non-solanaceous ornamentals porcelainflower (Hoya wayetii), false Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera truncata) and annual vinca (Catharanthus roseus) were detected in Florida. Since then, TCSV has been documented in other important crop and weed species, indicating host and geographic range expansion of this tospovirus. Several other viruses have also been detected in plants with symptoms similar to those induced by TCSV. In view of projected climate change-driven shifts in cropping systems, further knowledge of emerging plant viruses in Florida and the Caribbean region will help strengthen agricultural security. 3aplant viruses 3aPetunia 3acacti and succulents 3aGroundnut ringspot tospovirus 3agardens 3atomatoes 3aHoya 3aviruses 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3aclimate 3aornamental plants 3acrop production 3ahost range 3aDatura stramonium 3aweeds 3aImpatiens necrotic spot tospovirus 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aTomato chlorotic spot tospovirus 3aImpatiens 3aSchlumbergera truncata 3acropping systems 3aBrugmansia 3aSolanum americanum 3aPuerto Rico 3aCaribbean 3aFlorida 0aGroundnut ringspot virus 0aTomato spotted wilt virus 0aImpatiens necrotic spot virus 0aTomato chlorotic spot virus1 aBaker, C.

The vertical gradient can be efficiently investigated using a multi-channel manometer board connected to a bundled piezometer installed using hollow-stem-auger-drilling techniques. The design and construction of a manometer board is described. Manometer board data from a site in a 30-m-deep fresh-water aquifer adjacent to a pumping bore are described. The bore is screened in the lower part of the aquifer and the impacts of partial penetration are evident on the manometer board results. Data are then described from the centre of a coastal sand spit where fresh water overlies saline water. Fluid electrical conductivity measurements from the individual tubes of the bundled piezometer are used to derive fluid density at each of the bundled piezometer ports. The average fluid density of water above the mini-piezometer port at each depth is then calculated using Gaussian quadrature. The environmental-water head profiles are compared to point-water and fresh-water head profiles and the implications of the incorrect use of point-water or fresh-water head vertical profiles are clearly demonstrated. 3aaquifers 3aelectrical conductivity 3afreshwater 3asaline water 3asand 0aEquipment/field techniques 0aUnconsolidated sediments 0aCoastal aquifers0 tHydrogeology journal.g2007 Nov., v. 15, no. 7 p.1279-1289dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-007-0178-9 7aarticle02570naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002400194245011800218300001800336500001500354520110200369650001601471650001801487650002101505650002101526650001601547650001601563650002201579650001601601650002301617650001201640650002101652650002101673650002501694650001101719650000901730650000901739650001101748650001601759653002301775653002001798700001801818773007601836852000901912856008101921945002502002946001302027655001202040IND4362329220221120023255.0040503e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436232922DNAL7 a147175402pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.12.18392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

TI and 27 variables related to egg production and quality, feed consumption, and body condition were collected for 355 female Japanese quail. Experimental birds were the F2 generation from a reciprocal cross between a line selected for long TI and a line from a different origin and selected for early egg production. TI and several other variables had very asymetrical distributions so all variables were categorized, and the association between traits was studied by factorial correspondence analysis (FCA). Attributes of good versus poor layers were well separated by the FCA, but no association was obtained between TI and other traits on the primary axes of the FCA. Fearfulness, as measured by TI, was not related to levels of performance of egg laying quail. Secondary negative associations between TI and body temperature and between TI and residual feed consumption were obtained; however, they were marginal and need to be confirmed. 3abody weight 3aanimal stress 3aage at first egg 3abody temperature 3afeed intake 3afearfulness 3aCoturnix japonica 3aegg quality 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBody Temperature 2aCoturnixxphysiology 2aEating 2aEggs 2aFear 2aFemale 2aOviposition 0alaying performance 0aJapanese quails1 aMinvielle, F.0 tPoultry science.g2003 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.1839-1844x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.12.18393Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdJITe2004/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle03460naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001500158245009500173300001600268500001500284520134400299650002101643650001901664650001301683650001801696650002801714650003901742650001301781650001301794650001301807650001301820650002701833650002201860650001901882650001501901650001501916650001901931650001901950650001101969650001201980650002701992650001302019650006702032650007402099650007602173650004002249650002102289650002002310650002502330650001302355650002002368650002002388650001502408650002302423653000902446653001702455700001402472700001602486700001602502773007302518852000902591856007902600930003302679945001302712946001302725655001202738IND2334208920221120023008.0031001e200303  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233420892DNAL7 a127054132pmid7 a10.1093/ps/82.3.5032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCliche, S.10aExtraction and characterization of collagen with or without telopeptides from chicken skin  ap. 503-509.  a2019-12-04  aPoultry by-products are not often processed into high-value products. Rather than being transformed into meal for animal feed, a large quantity of chicken skin could be used to produce collagen, which is valued for its unique functional properties. The purpose of this research project was to extract and characterize collagen from chicken skin. Skins were first ground and then were heated to 40 or 60 degrees C to extract the fat. After mechanical separation, the collagen contained in the resulting solid phase was extracted with pepsin or ethylene diamine. Types I and III collagen were then isolated and characterized by SDS PAGE, antigen labeling, determination of tyrosine residues, and transmission electron microscopy. The total collagen content of the skin was recovered from the solid phase following heat treatment at 40 degrees C. Extraction yields varied with the solubilization process: 38.9% of the collagen content in the solid phase was extracted with pepsin and 25.1% with ethylene diamine. Ratios of type I to type III collagen fractionated using NaCl were 74.4:19.8% with pepsin and 62.4:31.7% with ethylene diamine. Characterization tests further revealed the presence of telopeptides solely on ethylene diamine-solubilized collagen. Chicken skin thus appears to be a good alternative source of high-quality collagen. 3abroiler chickens 3aimmunoblotting 3apolymers 3afractionation 3anonfood animal products 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3adiamines 3acollagen 3atyrosine 3apeptides 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aanimal byproducts 3ahydroxyproline 3asolubility 3aextraction 3aheat treatment 3asolubilization 3apepsin 2aAnimals 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChickens 2aCollagenxchemistryxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aCollagen Type Ixchemistryxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aCollagen Type IIIxchemistryxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEthylenediamines 2aHot Temperature 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPepsin A 2aSkinxchemistry 2aSodium Chloride 2aSolubility 2aTyrosinexanalysis 0askin 0atelopeptides1 aAmiot, J.1 aAvezard, C.1 aGariepy, C.0 tPoultry science.g2003 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.503-509x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/82.3.5033Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245013200160300001600292500002400308520137000332650002701702650002001729650001301749650002001762650000901782650001601791650001101807650001501818650001101833650002301844650001501867650001001882650001201892700001501904700001501919700001301934700001301947773009901960852000902059856008502068655001202153IND4457900520221123041249.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790052DNAL7 a10.1017/S00439339110001102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipahi, C.10aImpact of avian influenza outbreaks on Turkish village chicken producers, and their opinions on the disease and disease control  ap. 131-136.  aIncludes references  aThe following paper was constructed from research assessing the socio-economic impacts of the Avian Influenza (AI) outbreaks encountered between October 2005 and March 2006 on the Turkish village chicken producers, using data obtained from an interview survey on 64 families in six different provinces of Turkey where the outbreak was recorded. The research revealed that: 1) the villagers’ protein consumption was dramatically reduced as most of them could not afford or didn't prefer to purchase chicken products. 2) The income from chicken sales (on average, it accounted for 33% of total income of those selling birds and eggs) disappeared. Moreover, the gender implication of it was notable as the income from chicken sales was generally used by the housewives. 3) 55% of the families stopped consuming chicken products due to the AI fear. However, 97% of them re-started consumption after 9 months of the AI outbreaks. 4) 65% of the families stated that they believe the crisis was artificially manipulated by the commercial chicken firms with the collaboration of the media to wipe out the backyard chicken production. 5) The respondents generally found the government's disease control efforts, organization and timeliness of compensation payments successful. However, 54 of the respondents stated that the amount of compensation payment was insufficient. 3aattitudes and opinions 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3adisease control 3aeggs 3afearfulness 3agender 3ahomemakers 3aincome 3apoultry production 3apurchasing 3asales 3asurveys1 aYalcin, C.1 aCevger, Y.1 aAral, Y.1 aGenc, L.0 tWorld's poultry science journal.g2011 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.131-136dCABI Pubx0043-93397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00439339110001103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02272naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245011900139300001600258500001500274520100100289650002101290650002201311650002501333650001101358650001201369650001801381650003401399650002101433650001101454650002801465650003001493650003901523653002001562653002801582653002501610653001901635653002001654700001601674773005801690852000901748930003301757945001301790946001101803655001201814IND2043285020221123030558.0941117s1994    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204328502DNAL7 a79589692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, X.14aThe complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the horse, Equus caballus: extensive heteroplasmy of the control region  ap. 357-362.  a2019-12-05  aThe sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA of the horse (Equus caballus) was determined. The length of the sequence presented is 16 660 bp. This figure, however, is not absolute due to pronounced heteroplasmy caused by variable numbers of the motif GTGCACCT in the control region of different molecules. Boundaries of the 13 peptide-coding genes were determined by the presence of start and stop codons, and by analogy with other eutherian mtDNAs. Three genes (COIII, NADH3 and NADH4) were not terminated by a stop codon. Comparison among the peptide-coding genes of the horse and eight other mammals suggests that the boundaries of some mt genes should be redefined. The number of repeats in the control region was determined by sequencing 77 different clones (20 direct plus 57 PCR clones). The number of repeats ranged from 2 to 29. There was a pronounced overrepresentation of clones with many repeats (22-27). Very few clones had a repeat number that was close to the mean number of repeats. 3astructural genes 3amitochondrial DNA 3arepetitive sequences 3ahorses 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 0agene boundaries 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x79547 0arepeated motifs1 aArnason, U.0 tGene.g1994, v. 148, no. 2 p.357-362x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02651naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008500180300001600265500002400281520124000305650002701545650001901572650002101591650002101612650001101633650002801644650001001672650001101682650001101693650001401704650001801718650000901736650001201745650000901757650002001766650001901786650000901805651001101814700001601825700001601841700001501857700001601872700001601888700001301904700001901917773009101936852000902027856008502036655001202121IND4457843720221123001942.0110509s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445784372DNAL7 a224407732pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100019162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauvin, C.10aFactors associated with mortality of broilers during transport to slaughterhouse  ap. 287-293.  aIncludes references  aIn recent years, broiler mortality during transport to the slaughterhouse has become a cause for concern because of animal welfare considerations and associated economic losses. A descriptive and analytical epidemiological study was carried out to estimate the extent of DoA in poultry broiler production in the main producing regions of France and to determine factors influencing the DoA rate. Data regarding animal characteristics and rearing, catching, transport and lairage conditions were collected on farm and at the slaughterhouse for 404 chicken broiler flocks processed during 2005. The average DoA rate was 0.18% (from 0% to 1.4%). Variables found to be associated (P < 0.05) with the DoA rate in a multivariable negative binomial model were flock cumulative mortality on farm, the catching system (mechanical being more at risk than manual), the density in crates (more space allowance being associated with less mortality) and climatic conditions (rain and wind being associated with more DoA). Mortality during transport is thus related to all production steps from the farm to the slaughterhouse. Efforts have therefore to be made by all professionals to contain mortality on farm and during catching and transportation. 3aanimal characteristics 3aanimal welfare 3abroiler chickens 3aclimatic factors 3acrates 3aepidemiological studies 3afarms 3aflocks 3amodels 3amortality 3aprofessionals 3arain 3arearing 3arisk 3aslaughterhouses 3atransportation 3awind 3aFrance1 aHillion, S.1 aBalaine, L.1 aMichel, V.1 aPeraste, J.1 aPetetin, I.1 aLupo, C.1 aLe Bouquin, S.0 tAnimal.g2011 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.287-293dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100019163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02018naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012200124300001800246520099800264650002601262650001001288650001501298650001301313650001501326651001501341651001201356651001701368700001901385700002001404700002001424700001701444700001701461773009801478852000901576930003301585945001301618946001301631655001201644IND2200999920221122232009.0991008e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220099992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritz, H.10aFusarium subglutinans f. sp. pini represents a distinct mating population in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex  ap. 1198-1201.  aFusarium strains in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex cause diseases on a variety of economically important plants. One of these diseases, pitch canker of Pinus spp., is caused by strains identified as Fusarium subglutinans f.sp. pini. Fertile crosses were detected between F. subglutinans f.sp. pini strains from South Africa, California, and Florida. F. subglutinans f.sp. pini strains were not cross-fertile with the standard tester strains of six of the seven other mating populations of G. fujikuroi. Sporadic perithecia with ascospores were obtained in two crosses with the mating population B tester strains. These perithecia were homothallic, and the ascospores derived from these perithecia were vegetatively compatible with the mating population B tester strain parent. We concluded that fertile F. subglutinans f.sp. pini isolates represent a new mating population (mating population H) of G. fujikuroi and that they belong to a unique biological species in a distinct taxon. 3aFusarium subglutinans 3aPinus 3aascospores 3acrossing 3aperithecia 3aCalifornia 3aFlorida 3aSouth Africa1 aCoutinho, T.A.1 aWingfield, M.J.1 aMarasas, W.F.O.1 aGordon, T.R.1 aLeslie, J.F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.1198-1201x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245012400168300001800292520073300310650002301043650002001066650002201086650002201108650002701130650001001157650002001167650002401187650004701211650002401258650003801282650004001320650007601360650004701436650001801483650004001501650005801541650002001599650001101619650002801630650004701658650002401705653002801729653002101757700001401778700001401792700001401806700001301820700001301833700001601846773009801862852000901960930003301969945001302002946001302015655001202028IND2201001520221122231754.0991008e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220100152DNAL7 a100498962pmid7 aPMC911772pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaffonchio, D.12aA randomly amplified polymorphic DNA marker specific for the Bacillus cereus group is diagnostic for Bacillus anthracis  ap. 1298-1303.  aAiming to develop a DNA marker specific for Bacillus anthracis and able to discriminate this species from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus mycoides, we applied the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting technique to a collection of 101 strains of the genus Bacillus, including 61 strains of the B. cereus group.

In native soil 43.8% of [9-14C]anthracene was mineralized by the autochthonous microflora and 45.4% was transformed into bound residues within 176 days. Addition of compost increased the metabolism (67.2% of the anthracene was mineralized) and decreased the residue formation (20.7% of the anthracene was transformed). Thus, the higher organic carbon content after compost was added did not increase the level of residue formation. [14C]anthracene labeled at position 1,2,3,4,4a,5a was metabolized more rapidly and resulted in formation of higher levels of residues (28.5%) by the soil-compost mixture than [14C]anthracene radiolabeled at position C-9 (20.7%). Two phases of residue formation were observed in the experiments. In the first phase the original compound was sequestered in the soil, as indicated by its limited extractability. In the second phase metabolites were incorporated into humic substances after microbial degradation of the PAH (biogenic residue formation). PAH metabolites undergo oxidative coupling to phenolic compounds to form nonhydrolyzable humic substance-like macromolecules. We found indications that monomeric educts are coupled by C-C- or either bonds. Hydrolyzable ester bonds or sorption of the parent compounds plays a minor role in residue formation. Moreover, experiments performed with 14CO2 revealed that residues may arise from CO2 in the soil in amounts typical for anthracene biodegradation. The extent of residue formation depends on the metabolic capacity of the soil microflora and the characteristics of the soil. The position of the 14C label is another important factor which controls mineralization and residue formation from metabolized compounds. 3aanthracenes 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposts 3ahumic substances 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3aphenolic compounds 3aradiolabeling 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asorption 2aAnthracenesxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism1 aStreibich, S.1 aBeyrer, M.1 aRichnow, H.H.1 aFritsche, W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.1834-1842x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01903naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014300129300001800272520090300290650002901193650001601222650001601238650001001254650002001264650001701284650001301301650001601314700002101330700001901351700001801370773009701388852000901485930003301494945001301527946001301540655001201553IND2201699220221122221742.0991122e199905  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220169922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, J.K.10aPotential of conjugal transfer as a strategy for the introduction of recombinant genetic material into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus  ap. 1910-1914.  aCointegrates generated between a plasmid pIP501 deletion derivative (pVA797) and nonconjugative shuttle vector pSA3 were confirmed as capable of exconjugation from lactococci into a range of strains of Lactobacillus helveticus with the concomitant expression of a recombinant gene.

The technique offers not only a generalized method for the introduction of novel genetic material into this important industrial microbe but also the possibility of exploiting the thermal sensitivity of the plasmid to enable it to act as a delivery system for the integration of cloned genes into the bacterial chromosome, at restrictive temperatures, by recombination at regions of homology. 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aLactococcus 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3ahost strains 3aplasmids 3atemperature1 aMcConville, K.J.1 aMcReynolds, C.1 aCollins, M.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.1910-1914x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01732naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245008200169300001600251500002400267520075200291650002101043650001201064650001401076650001201090650002901102650001101131650001401142650001301156650001301169700001501182773013101197852000901328856005701337655001201394IND4456080220221122221633.0110408e197303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445608022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1973.tb00254.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVARJAS, L.10aUse of a juvenile hormone analogue against the fall webworm, hyphantria cunea  ap. 115-122.  aIncludes references  aAdministration of 0.1-100 μg of ethyl 11-chloro-3,7,11-trimethyl-2-dodecenoate to last-instar larvae of Hyphantria cunea that have not initiated cocoon spinning induces development of superlarvae and larval-pupal intermediates.

Outplanting of inoculated seedlings to forest plantations raises the questions about inoculant persistence and its effects on indigenous fungal populations. We previously showed (M.-A. Selosse et al. Mol. Ecol. 7:561-573, 1998) that the American strain Laccaria bicolor S238N persisted 10 years after outplanting in a French Douglas fir plantation, without introgression or selfing and without fruiting on uninoculated adjacent plots. In the present study, the relevance of those results to sympatric strains was assessed for another part of the plantation, planted in 1985 with seedlings inoculated with the French strain L. bicolor 81306 or left uninoculated. About 720 Laccaria sp. sporophores, collected from 1994 to 1997, were typed by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers and PCR amplification of the mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal DNAs. All plots were colonized by small spontaneous discrete genotypes (genets). The inoculant strain 81306 abundantly fruited beneath inoculated trees, with possible introgression in indigenous Laccaria populations but without selfing. In contrast to our previous survey of L. bicolor S238N, L. bicolor 81306 colonized a plot of uninoculated trees. Meiotic segregation analysis verified that the invading genet was strain 81306 (P < 0.00058), implying a vegetative growth of 1.1 m.year-1. This plot was also invaded in 1998 by strain S238N used to inoculate other trees of the plantation. Five other uninoculated plots were free of these inoculant strains. The fate of inoculant strains thus depends less on their geographic origin than on unknown local factors. 3aLaccaria bicolor 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aforest nurseries 3aforest plantations 3afruiting 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3aintrogression 3ameiosis 3amitochondria 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aprovenance 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aselfing 3asurveys 3asympatry 3atrees 3avegetative growth1 aMartin, F.1 aBouchard, D.1 aLe Tacon, F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.2006-2014x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03593naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001500149245009700164300001800261520161400279650002801893650001701921650001301938650002101951650001701972650001401989650001602003650001802019650002302037650002602060650002302086650002202109650002302131650002802154650001502182650003702197650004702234650001302281650001202294650004202306650007902348650002102427650005602448650002202504650003902526650003202565650002502597650002202622650001102644650002702655650004702682700001402729700001802743700001702761773009702778852000902875930003302884945001302917946001302930655001202943IND2201702320221122181336.0991122e199905  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220170232DNAL7 a102240012pmid7 aPMC912982pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyytia, E.10aBiodiversity of Clostridium botulinum type E strains isolated from fish and fishery products  ap. 2057-2064.  aThe genetic biodiversity of Clostridium botulinum type E strains was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with two macrorestriction enzymes (SmaI-XmaI and XhoI) and by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with two primers (OPJ 6 and OPJ 13) to characterize 67 Finnish isolates from flesh fish and fishery products, 15 German isolates from farmed fish, and 10 isolates of North American or North Atlantic origin derived mainly from different types of seafood. The effects of fish species, processing, and geographical origin on the epidemiology of the isolates were evaluated. Cluster analysis based on macrorestriction profiles was performed to study the genetic relationships of the isolates. PFGE and RAPD analyses were combined and resulted in the identification of 62 different subtypes among the 92 type E isolates analyzed. High genetic biodiversity among the isolates was observed regardless of their source. Finnish and North American or North Atlantic isolates did not form distinctly discernible clusters, in contrast with the genetically homogeneous group of German isolates. On the other hand, indistinguishable or closely related genetic profiles among epidemiologically unrelated samples were detected. It was concluded that the high genetic variation was probably a result of a lack of strong selection factors that would influence the evolution of type E. The wide genetic biodiversity observed among type E isolates indicates the value of DNA-based typing methods as a tool in contamination studies in the food industry and in investigations of botulism outbreaks. 3aClostridium botulinum E 3abiodiversity 3abotulism 3acluster analysis 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3afarmed fish 3afish products 3afood contamination 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3amethyltransferases 3amicrobial contamination 3aprovenance 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseafoods 2aAnimals 2aBotulismxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aClostridium botulinumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFish Productsxmicrobiology 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique1 aHielm, S.1 aBjorkroth, J.1 aKorkeala, H.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.2057-2064x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02451naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245009100180300001800271500002400289500001500313520086600328650001601194650001101210650001801221650001501239650001801254650000701272650001101279650001401290650002401304650002901328650003501357650002501392650002701417650002101444650002701465650002801492650001801520650001501538650002101553650002201574650001601596650002101612650001901633650002301652653001601675653001601691773010401707852000901811856007701820655001201897IND4459263720221122181351.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445926372DNAL7 a213095642pmid7 a10.1021/jf103711c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, Marjorie B.10aSimple and Rapid Method for the Analysis of Phenolic Compounds in Beverages and Grains  ap. 1565-1571.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA new method for the detection of phenolics in food systems was developed. This method is based on interactions of phenolics with Fast Blue BB diazonium salt in alkali pH, forming azo complexes, with the absorbance measured at 420 nm after 60 min. The linear regression correlations (R2) of gallic acid calibration standards were >0.99. The phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent) of samples analyzed yielded higher ratios (1.7−6.6) of the total phenolics by Fast Blue BB to Folin−Ciocalteu methods in most beverages and grain samples, but in flaxseed and some juice blends, the ratios were <1. The lower ratios suggest the presence of non-phenolic reducing constituents measured with the Folin−Ciocalteu method as “total phenolics”. This method is simple and inexpensive and can be used to rapidly assess the total phenolics of foods and beverages. 3agallic acid 3ajuices 3alinear models 3aabsorbance 3arapid methods 3apH 3agrains 3abeverages 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aDiazonium Compoundsxchemistry 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGallic Acidxchemistry 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aLinear Models 2aMolybdenum 2aPhenolxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPolyphenols 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aTeaxchemistry 2aTungsten Compounds 0amethodology 0anew methods0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1565-1571x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103711c3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02849naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245017600171300001800347500002400365520103300389650002301422650002501445650001201470650002001482650003801502650001201540650001701552650003201569650001301601650000901614650002601623650001401649650000701663650001201670650000901682650001401691650001201705650002701717650004701744650001101791650000901802650002401811650003301835650002001868650002401888650002601912650002101938700001501959700001601974700001901990700001702009700001902026773010402045852000902149856007702158655001202235IND4459264920221122181334.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445926492DNAL7 a212992532pmid7 a10.1021/jf104241n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Song10aDevelopment of a Sensitive Indirect Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ic-ELISA) Based on the Monoclonal Antibody for the Detection of the Imidaclothiz Residue  ap. 1594-1597.  aIncludes references  aAn indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) for imidaclothiz was developed. The hapten of imidaclothiz was synthesized and conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin (OVA) to form the artificial antigens. MoAbs were obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice. Under the optimized conditions (10% methanol, 0.14 M Na+, and pH 7.4), the half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) was 0.0875 ± 0.0034 mg/L and the limit of detection (IC20) was 0.0178 ± 0.0018 mg/L for imidaclothiz. There were no obvious cross-reactivities with most of the structural analogues of neonicotinoid insecticides, except imidacloprid. The recoveries of imidaclothiz in environmental and agricultural samples, including tap water, paddy water, soil, and cabbage, ranged from 80.43 to 113.83%, well within the requirements of residue detection. These results showed that this immunoassay could be used for the determination of imidaclothiz in environmental and agricultural samples. 3aantibody detection 3abovine serum albumin 3acabbage 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahaptens 3aimidacloprid 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethanol 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aovalbumin 3apH 3apaddies 3asoil 3atap water 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFemale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aThiazolesxanalysis 2aVegetablesxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry1 aZhang, Bin1 aRen, Ke-wei1 aCao, Meng-meng1 aShi, Hai-yan1 aWang, Minghua.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1594-1597x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104241n3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03880naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100002100149245013500170300001800305520183000323650001502153650002702168650001902195650001302214650002102227650002802248650002302276650002402299650001002323650001802333650001102351650003002362650001202392650001902404650001402423650001402437650001202451650004602463650001802509650002802527650001302555650002102568650002602589650002302615650002102638650001102659650004802670650002102718650001302739650003102752650003002783650005902813650006602872650001502938650001402953700001702967700001502984700001802999773009703017852000903114930003303123945001303156946001303169655001203182IND2201711520221122181332.0991123e199905  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220171152DNAL7 a102240192pmid7 aPMC913162pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuard-Petter, J.10aClinical and veterinary isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis defective in lipopolysaccharide O-chain polymerization  ap. 2195-2201.  aTwelve human and chicken isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis belonging to phage types 4, 8, 13a, and 23 were characterized for variability in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition. Isolates were differentiated into two groups, i.e., those that lacked immunoreactive O-chain, termed rough isolates, and those that had immunoreactive O-chain, termed smooth isolates. Isolates within these groups could be further differentiated by LPS compositional differences as detected by gel electrophoresis and gas liquid chromatography of samples extracted with water, which yielded significantly more LPS in comparison to phenol-chloroform extraction. The rough isolates were of two types, the O-antigen synthesis mutants and the O-antigen polymerization (wzy) mutants. Smooth isolates were also of two types, one producing low-molecular-weight (LMW) LPS and the other producing high-molecular-weight (HMW) LPS. To determine the genetic basis for the O-chain variability of the smooth isolates, we analyzed the effects of a null mutation in the O-chain length determinant gene, wzz (cld) of serovar Typhimurium. This mutation results in a loss of HMW LPS; however, the LMW LPS of this mutant was longer and more glucosylated than that from clinical isolates of serovar Enteritidis. Cluster analysis of these data and of those from two previously characterized isogenic strains of serovar Enteritidis that had different virulence attributes indicated that glucosylation of HMW LPS (via oafR function) is variable and results in two types of HMW structures, one that is highly glucosylated and one that is minimally glucosylated. These results strongly indicate that naturally occurring variability in wzy, wzz, and oafR function can be used to subtype isolates of serovar Enteritidis during epidemiological investigations. 3aO-antigens 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abacteriophages 3achickens 3acluster analysis 3aepidemiological studies 3agas chromatography 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aglucosylation 3ahumans 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3apolymerization 3aserotypes 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aChickens 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEggsxmicrobiology 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aLipopolysaccharidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aMutation 2aMyristic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aSalmonella Food Poisoningxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSalmonella enteritidisxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerotyping 2aVirulence1 aParker, C.T.1 aAsokan, K.1 aCarlson, R.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.2195-2201x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02666naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245017400178300001800352500002400370520097600394650002301370650001701393650001601410650002301426650002501449650001401474650001901488650001101507650001601518650004301534650004201577650003201619650003301651650001601684650004401700650001501744650001101759650003801770650003301808650002401841650002401865700002201889700002501911700002201936773010401958852000902062856007702071655001202148IND4459266320221122181438.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445926632DNAL7 a212843842pmid7 a10.1021/jf10233882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Jodee L.10aEffect of Black Raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.)

The objective of this study was to evaluate how black raspberry extract variability conditioned by horticultural factors affected the antiproliferative activity of 75 black raspberry extracts using an in vitro colon cancer cell model. HT-29 cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with freeze-dried extracts at 0.6 and 1.2 mg of extract/mL of medium. Percent cell growth inhibition for each concentration of the extracts was determined using the sulforhodamine B assay. All extracts significantly inhibited the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation was significantly influenced by cultivar, production site, and stage of maturity. The lack of correlation between growth inhibition and extract total phenolic and total monomeric anthocyanin assays suggested horticultural parameters influence bioactivity in a complex manner. 3aRubus occidentalis 3aanthocyanins 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acultivars 3afruit maturity 3amodels 3araspberries 2aAnthocyaninsxisolation & purification 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aColonic Neoplasmsxpathology 2aEnvironment 2aFruitxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aHT29 Cells 2aHumans 2aPhenolsxisolation & purification 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRosaceaexchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBomser, Joshua A.1 aScheerens, Joseph C.1 aGiusti, M.

It was previously reported that fucoxanthinol attenuated the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. However, the effects of amarouciaxanthin A on adipocyte differentiation have not been clarified. This study examined the effects of amarouciaxanthin A on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis by comparing the effects of fucoxanthinol, isofucoxanthinol, and amarouciaxanthin B. Amarouciaxanthin A significantly decreased glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, which was measured as an indicator of adipocyte differentiation. The suppressive effect of amarouciaxanthin A was stronger than that of fucoxanthinol, amarouciaxanthin B, and isofucoxanthinol. The mRNA expressions of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and glucose-transporter 4 (Glut4) in 3T3-L1 cells were markedly down-regulated by amarouciaxanthin A compared to fucoxanthinol. Furthermore, the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα),, which are the key adipogenic transcriptional factors, were also decreased by amarouciaxanthin A during adipocyte differentiation. These results show that amarouciaxanthin A, which is a dominant metabolite of fucoxanthin in white adipose tissue, suppressed 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3alipoprotein lipase 3amessenger RNA 3atranscription factors 3awhite adipose tissue1 aHosokawa, Masashi1 aMizushina, Yoshiyuki1 aYoshida, Hiromi1 aSaito, Yasunori1 aMiyashita, Kazuo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1646-1652x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1021/jf103290f3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03098naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001200149245005400161300001800215520131300233650002101546650002101567650001601588650001301604650001701617650001701634650003201651650002001683650001401703650001901717650001301736650003801749650002401787650005501811650003301866650002901899650003101928650004401959650003002003650006402033650002902097650002802126650003802154650002302192650006102215650004402276700001702320700001702337773009802354852000902452930003302461945001302494946001302507655001202520IND2202241620221122181328.0000118e199906  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220224162DNAL7 a103470022pmid7 aPMC913372pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, B.14aThe pediocin AcH precursor is biologically active  ap. 2281-2286.  aThe properties of the pediocin AcH precursor, prepediocin AcH, have been studied to gain insight into how producer cells may protect themselves from the activity of intracellular prebacteriocins. The native 62-amino-acid precursor and the 44-amino-acid mature species were expressed in Escherichia coli host strains that lack the leader peptide processing enzyme, PapD. Both forms inhibited the growth of the test bacterium Listeria innocua Lin11, indicating that the native precursor is biologically active. The two species also were synthesized in the context of maltose-binding protein chimeric proteins to facilitate the measurement of their relative specific activities. The chimeric form of the precursor was approximately 80% as active as the chimeric mature species. Of relevance to cell protection and pediocin AcH production, it was determined that the precursor is strongly susceptible to inactivation by reducing agents and to degradation by chymotrypsin and endogenous E. coli proteases. Taken together, the results indicate that the activity of prepediocin AcH may have to be controlled prior to secretion to prevent toxicity to the host. Perhaps producer cells avoid membrane damage by maintaining the precursor in a reduced inactive state or by degrading molecules whose secretion is delayed. 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria innocua 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3achymotrypsin 3ahost strains 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3areducing agents 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 3atoxicity 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transporters 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacteriocinsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aChymotrypsinxmetabolism 2aEndopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMaltose-Binding Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteins 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aProtein Precursorsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism1 aSchamber, R.1 aMiller, K.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.2281-2286x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03359naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003000156245015900186300001800345500002400363520166900387650002302056650001702079650001502096650001702111650001502128650001502143650002202158650000702180650001302187650001502200650001602215650001202231650001702243650002402260650001802284650003102302650001502333650004302348650002802391650004602419650006802465650001602533650002402549700001802573700001602591700002002607773010402627852000902731856007702740655001202817IND4459264020221122150556.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445926402DNAL7 a213198052pmid7 a10.1021/jf10398762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheison, Seronei Chelulei10aAnalysis of the Effect of Temperature Changes Combined with Different Alkaline pH on the β-Lactoglobulin Trypsin Hydrolysis Pattern Using MALDI-TOF-MS/MS  ap. 1572-1581.  aIncludes references  aTemperature and pH influence the conformation of the whey protein β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) monomer, dimer, and octamer formation, its denaturation, and solubility. Most hydrolyses have been reported at trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) optimum conditions (pH 7.8 and 37 °C), while the hydrolysate mass spectrometry was largely limited to peptides with <4 kDa. There are few reports on trypsin peptide release patterns away from optimum. This work investigated the influence of alkaline (8.65 and 9.5) and optimum (7.8) pH at different temperatures (25, 37.5, and 50 °C) on β-Lg (7.5%, w/v) hydrolysis. Sample aliquots were drawn out before the addition of trypsin (blank sample) and at various time intervals (15 s to 10 min) thereafter. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) was used to monitor peptide evolution over time with the use of two matrixes: α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) and 2.5-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP). Mass analysis showed that the N- and C-terminals (Lys8-Gly9, Lys100-Lys101, Arg124-Thr125, Lys141-Ala142, and Arg148-Leu149) of β-Lg were cleaved early (15 s) implying the ease of trypsinolysis at the exposed terminals. Hydrolyses at 25 °C and pH 7.8 as well as at 50 °C and pH 9.5 were slowed down and ordered. Nonspecific chymotrypsin-like behavior occurred more at higher temperatures (50 °C) than at lower ones (25 and 37.5 °C). In addition to our earlier work in the acid pH region, it can be concluded that there is potential for controlled hydrolysis outside the trypsin optimum, where different target peptides with predictable biofunctionalities could be produced. 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adenaturation 3adesorption 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3apeptides 3asolubility 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3awhey protein 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aTemperature 2aTrypsinxmetabolism1 aBrand, Janina1 aLeeb, Elena1 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1572-1581x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10398763Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03913naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245012300168300001800291520164800309650002201957650002401979650001602003650001402019650002302033650001102056650001302067650001402080650003102094650001202125650001802137650001202155650002202167650002102189650002402210650001202234650001302246650002202259650001902281650002002300650001002320650001102330650002402341650006702365650001802432650002802450650002302478650001802501650002002519650002002539650001802559650002802577650003902605650002702644650004302671650006002714650005902774653002802833653001902861700002602880700001602906700001902922700002102941700001502962773009802977852000903075930003303084945001303117946001303130655001203143IND2202253820221122150613.0000119e199906  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220225382DNAL7 a103470262pmid7 aPMC913612pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVries, R.P. de10aDifferential expression of three alpha-galactosidase genes and a single beta-galactosidase gene from Aspergillus niger  ap. 2453-2460.  aA gene encoding a third alpha-galactosidase (AglB) from Aspergillus niger has been cloned and sequenced. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 1,750 bp containing six introns. The gene encodes a protein of 443 amino acids which contains a eukaryotic signal sequence of 16 amino acids and seven putative N-glycosylation sites. The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48,835 Da and a predicted pI of 4.6. An alignment of the AglB amino acid sequence with those of other alpha-galactosidases revealed that it belongs to a subfamily of alpha-galactosidases that also includes A. niger AglA. A. niger AglC belongs to a different subfamily that consists mainly of prokaryotic alpha-galactosidases. The expression of aglA, aglB, aglC, and lacA, the latter of which encodes an A. niger beta-galactosidase, has been studied by using a number of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric compounds as growth substrates. Expression of aglA is only detected on galactose and galactose-containing oligomers and polymers. The aglB gene is expressed on all of the carbon sources tested, including glucose. Elevated expression was observed on xylan, which could be assigned to regulation via XlnR, the xylanolytic transcriptional activator. Expression of aglC was only observed on glucose, fructose, and combinations of glucose with xylose and galactose. High expression of lacA was detected on arabinose, xylose, xylan, and pectin. Similar to aglB, the expression on xylose and xylan can be assigned to regulation via XlnR. All four genes have distinct expression patterns which seem to mirror the natural substrates of the encoded proteins. 3aAspergillus niger 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aamino acids 3aarabinose 3abeta-galactosidase 3acarbon 3afructose 3agalactose 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3aintrons 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apectins 3apolymers 3asequence analysis 3asignal peptide 3atransactivators 3axylan 3axylose 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCulture Media 2aFungal Proteins 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrans-Activatorsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aalpha-Galactosidasexbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2abeta-Galactosidasexbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y185861 aBroeck, H.C. van den.1 aDekkers, E.1 aManzanares, P.1 aGraaff, L.H. de.1 aVisser, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.2453-2460x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03677naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100002000149245019200169300001800361520173100379650002602110650002502136650001602161650001302177650001302190650001002203650001402213650001402227650001602241650001202257650001802269650001102287650001302298650002202311650001002333650001202343650004002355650002902395650002902424650009402453650002802547650003002575650002802605650003002633650003402663650002702697650003502724651001002759653002802769653002102797653002102818700001702839700001702856773009802873852000902971930003302980945001303013946001303026655001203039IND2202257020221122150643.0000119e199906  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220225702DNAL7 a103470392pmid7 aPMC913742pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoettcher, K.J.10aUse of antibacterial agents to elucidate the etiology of juvenile oyster disease (JOD) in Crassostrea virginica and numerical dominance of an alpha-proteobacterium in JOD-affected animals  ap. 2534-2539.  aSince 1988, juvenile oyster disease (JOD) has resulted in high seasonal losses of cultured Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in the Northeast. Although the cause of JOD remains unknown, most evidence is consistent with either a bacterial or a protistan etiology. For the purpose of discerning between these hypotheses, the antibacterial antibiotics norfloxacin and sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim (Romet-B) were tested for the ability to delay the onset of JOD mortality and/or reduce the JOD mortality of cultured juvenile C. virginica. Hatchery-produced C. virginica seed were exposed in triplicate groups of 3,000 animals each to either norfloxacin, sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, or filter-sterilized seawater (FSSW) and deployed in floating trays on the Damariscotta River of Maine on 17 July 1997. Each week thereafter, a subset of animals from each group was reexposed to the assigned treatment. Repeated immersion in either a sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim or a norfloxacin solution resulted in a delay in the onset of JOD mortality in treated animals and reduced weekly mortality rates. Weekly treatments with either norfloxacin or sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in cumulative mortality (55 and 67% respectively) compared to animals treated weekly with FSSW (81%) or those that had received only a single treatment with either norfloxacin, sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, or FSSW (77, 84, and 82%, respectively). Bacteriological analyses revealed a numerically dominant bacterium in those animals with obvious signs of JOD. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene from these bacteria indicates that they are a previously undescribed species of marine alpha-proteobacteria. 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3aetiology 3agenes 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3anorfloxacin 3aoysters 3aribosomal RNA 3arivers 3aseawater 3asequence analysis 3atrays 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNorfloxacinxpharmacology 2aOstreidaexmicrobiology 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSulfadimethoxinexpharmacology 3aMaine 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af114484 0agenbank/af1144851 aBarber, B.J.1 aSinger, J.T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.2534-2539x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02989naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001400149245016700163300001800330520133900348650002301687650002301710650000801733650001301741650001301754650001101767650002101778650002001799650001001819650001001829650000901839650001101848650001201859650001101871650002101882650002501903650001501928650001201943650008301955650002702038650002902065650001302094650002102107650004802128700001702176700002002193700001702213700001502230773009802245852000902343930003302352945001302385946001302398655001202411IND2202257220221122112854.0000119e199906  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220225722DNAL7 a103470402pmid7 aPMC913752pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurdy, D.10aGeneration of a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-deficient mutant of Campylobacter coli: evidence for the significance of SOD in Campylobacter survival and colonization  ap. 2540-2546.  aThe microaerophilic nature of Campylobacter species implies an inherent sensitivity towards oxygen and its reduction products, particularly the superoxide anion. The deleterious effects of exposure to superoxide radicals are counteracted by the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). We have shown previously that Campylobacter coli possesses an iron cofactored SOD. The sodB gene of C. coli UA585 was insertionally inactivated by the site-specific insertion of a tetO cassette. Organisms harboring the inactivated gene failed to produce a biologically functional form of the enzyme. While the ability of this mutant to grow in aerobic conditions was unchanged relative to the parental strain, its survival was severely compromised when non-growing cells were exposed to air. Accordingly, the SOD-deficient mutant was unable to survive for prolonged periods in model foods. Furthermore, inactivation of the sodB gene decreased the colonization potential in an experimental infection of 1-day-old chicks. In contrast, strain CK100, which is deficient in catalase activity, showed the same survival and colonization characteristics as the parental strain. These results indicate that SOD, but not catalase, is an important deteminant in the ability of C. coli to survive aerobically and for optimal colonization within the chicken gut. 3aCampylobacter coli 3aaerobic conditions 3aair 3acatalase 3achickens 3achicks 3adigestive system 3aenzyme activity 3afoods 3agenes 3airon 3amodels 3amutants 3aoxygen 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacter colixenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutation 2aOxidative Stress 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aCawthraw, S.1 aDickinson, J.H.1 aNewell, D.G.1 aPark, S.F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.2540-2546x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02474naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009600172300001800268500002400286500001500310520135600325650002601681650001501707650002401722650000901746650001301755650001401768650001401782650002201796650002601818650001001844653001901854700002201873773010401895852000901999856009202008655001202100IND4458911420221122112903.0110610s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445891142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02580.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMICHEL, MATT J.10aConsequences of an amphibian malformity for development and fitness in complex environments  ap. 1417-1425.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a1. Environmental stressors have both lethal and sublethal effects, such as altered developmental rates and the induction of malformations. Ecological interactions, including predation and competition, often amplify such effects, for instance by inducing behavioural changes that increase susceptibility to the stress. 2. Using experimental mesocosms, we asked whether the density of conspecific competitors and predation risk from larval water beetles (Dytiscus spp.) affect the development of malformations in tadpoles of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). We also examined whether such malformities increase the susceptibility of tadpoles to predation. 3. The risk of predation decreased the frequency of malformities in both low- and high-density treatments, although this effect was greater at low density. Behavioural observations suggested that reductions in activity by amphibian larvae induced by predators mediated these responses by decreasing cumulative exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation, the putative stressor causing the observed malformity. These results suggest that predators can reduce negative impacts of stressors by inducing behavioural changes in prey organisms. 4. Malformed individuals were twice as vulnerable to predators as non-malformed individuals, suggesting that sublethal effects can ultimately cause increased mortality. 3aLithobates sylvaticus 3aColeoptera 3acumulative exposure 3arisk 3atadpoles 3apredators 3apredation 3asublethal effects 3aultraviolet radiation 3afrogs 0aRana sylvatica1 aBurke, Stephanie.0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1417-1425dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02580.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03448naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012100173300001800294500002400312520227800336650001202614650001102626650001002637650001102647650002302658650001102681650001902692650001502711650001402726650001102740651001002751700002302761700002002784700002202804700001902826773010402845852000902949856009202958655001203050IND4458911620221122112924.0110610s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445891162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02582.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOBAYASHI, SOHEI10aLongitudinal changes in δ¹³C of riffle macroinvertebrates from mountain to lowland sections of a gravel-bed river  ap. 1434-1446.  aIncludes references  aSummary 1. To understand longitudinal changes in the trophic base of benthic macroinvertebrates from mountain to lowland river sections, we investigated carbon stable isotopic compositions (δ¹³C) of macroinvertebrates and their food resources in riffles for four seasons at 14 sites along the main stem of the Toyo River, Japan. 2. At each site, δ¹³C was usually highest or nearly highest for periphyton (epilithic biofilm) and was lowest for transported leaf materials. Among macroinvertebrate groups, grazers usually had higher δ¹³C values than filterers or predators. 3. During all seasons, δ¹³C of periphyton and all macroinvertebrate groups increased downstream from mountain to upland sections, but decreased downstream from upland to lowland sections. In addition, the difference between grazer δ¹³C and filterer δ¹³C decreased from mountain to upland sections, but increased from upland to lowland sections. 4. The observed changes in δ¹³C of periphyton and macroinvertebrates from mountain to upland sections agree with previous reports: the δ¹³C of periphyton and consumers increased with stream size and productivity. The decrease in δ¹³C of periphyton and macroinvertebrates from upland to lowland sections has not been reported previously, and this may have resulted from an increased importance of terrestrial detritus relative to periphyton production in the lowland section, where riffles were infrequent and pools dominated the reach. 5. A simple mixing model of δ¹³C showed that grazers rely mostly on periphyton at all sites, whereas the importance of periphyton for filterers changed longitudinally increasing from mountain to upland sections and decreasing from upland to lowland sections. This longitudinal trend for filterers is possibly associated with the changes in the availability or quality of terrestrial detritus in transported particulate organic matter. 6. Longitudinal changes in the relative importance of autochthonous production and allochthonous detritus appear to be reflected in δ¹³C of riffle benthic communities. The longitudinal changes were not monotonic, and specific reach characteristics may be responsible for the greater importance of allochthonous detritus in mountain and lowland sections. 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3afoods 3aleaves 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aperiphyton 3apredators 3arivers 3aJapan1 aAKAMATSU, FUMIKAZU1 aAMANO, KUNIHIKO1 aNAKANISHI, SATORU1 aOSHIMA, YURIKA0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1434-1446dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02582.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04086naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100002200151245021400173300001600387500002400403520158500427650002102012650001902033650002302052650002102075650002102096650001202117650002302129650001302152650001802165650001402183650001502197650003702212650001102249650001802260650003902278650000902317650002102326650004002347650001202387650003602399650003002435650005902465650006802524650002302592650003302615650001102648650001102659650002802670650002402698650005802722650000902780650002102789650006602810650000902876650003302885650002702918650003402945650001402979700002202993700001803015700002003033700001803053700001403071700002603085700002203111700002003133700002003153773012203173852000903295655001203304IND4459202020221122112914.0110620s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445920202DNAL7 a216400272pmid7 aPMC31032822pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDauchy, Robert T.10aEliminating Animal Facility Light-at-Night Contamination and Its Effect on Circadian Regulation of Rodent Physiology, Tumor Growth, and Metabolism: A Challenge in the Relocation of a Cancer Research Laboratory  ap. 326-336.  aIncludes references  aAppropriate laboratory animal facility lighting and lighting protocols are essential for maintaining the health and wellbeing of laboratory animals and ensuring the credible outcome of scientific investigations. Our recent experience in relocating to a new laboratory facility illustrates the importance of these considerations. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that animal room contamination with light-at-night (LAN) of as little as 0.2 lx at rodent eye level during an otherwise normal dark-phase disrupted host circadian rhythms and stimulated the metabolism and proliferation of human cancer xenografts in rats. Here we examined how simple improvements in facility design at our new location completely eliminated dark-phase LAN contamination and restored normal circadian rhythms in nontumor-bearing rats and normal tumor metabolism and growth in host rats bearing tissue-isolated MCF7(SR-) human breast tumor xenografts or 7288CTC rodent hepatomas. Reducing LAN contamination in the animal quarters from 24.5+/- 2.5 lx to nondetectable levels (complete darkness) restored normal circadian regulation of rodent arterial blood melatonin, glucose, total fatty and linoleic acid concentrations, tumor uptake of O2, glucose, total fatty acid and CO2 production and tumor levels of cAMP, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, as well as extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, serine-threonine protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, γ-histone 2AX, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. 3abreast neoplasms 3acarbon dioxide 3acholesteryl esters 3acircadian rhythm 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3alaboratory animals 3alighting 3alinoleic acid 3amelatonin 3ametabolism 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxygen 3aphospholipids 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3arats 3atriacylglycerols 2aAcademies and Institutesxstandards 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratoryxphysiology 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBreast Neoplasmsxblood supplyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxblood supplyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Proliferation 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLaboratoriesxstandards 2aLightingxstandards 2aLiver Neoplasmsxblood supplyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aMelatoninxblood 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxblood supplyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred BUFxphysiology 2aRats, Nudexphysiology 2aTransplantation, Heterologous 2aWorkplace1 aDupepe, Lynell M.1 aOoms, Tara G.1 aDauchy, Erin M.1 aHill, Cody R.1 aMao, Lulu1 aBelancio, Victoria P.1 aSlakey, Lauren M.1 aHill, Steven M.1 aBlask, David E.0 tJournal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.g2011 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.326-336x1559-61097nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100002200151245014200173300001600315500002400331520152500355650001901880650001601899650001401915650001301929650001001942650001001952650001401962650001301976650001601989650001202005650001202017650001302029650002902042650001202071650003602083650005102119650001102170650001902181650002702200650004302227650003002270650002102300650002802321650002802349650002202377650003102399650002702430700002302457700002102480773012202501852000902623655001202632IND4459202420221122092816.0110620s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445920242DNAL7 a216400312pmid7 aPMC31032862pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoble, Dondrae J.10aAnalgesic Effects of Meloxicam, Morphine Sulfate, Flunixin Meglumine, and Xylazine Hydrochloride in African-Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis)  ap. 355-360.  aIncludes references  aWe evaluated analgesic use and analgesiometry in aquatic African-clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). We used the acetic acid test (AAT) to assess the analgesic potential of systemic xylazine hydrochloride, meloxicam, flunixin meglumine, and morphine sulfate after injection into the dorsal lymph sac. Flunixin meglumine provided better analgesia than did the other drugs, most evident at 5 and 9 h after administration. Because the AAT was associated with the development of dermal lesions, we discontinued use of this assay and chose the Hargreaves test as an alternative method of measuring nociception in Xenopus. This assay is commonly performed in rodents, but its efficacy in an aquatic species such as Xenopus was unknown prior to this study. We found that the Hargreaves test was an effective measure of nociception in Xenopus, and we used it to evaluate the effectiveness of the nonopiod agents xylazine hydrochloride, meloxicam, and flunixin meglumine both in the absence of surgery and after surgical oocyte harvest. Similar to findings from the AAT, flunixin meglumine provided better analgesia in the Hargreaves test than did the other agents when analyzed in the absence of surgical intervention. Results were equivocal after oocyte harvest.

An answer to this, an immune breeding program “Analogue” for grapevine was developed at the All-Russian National Research Institute for Viticulture and Winemaking “Magarach”. The program aims at improving the efficiency of grape breeding and producing new cultivars that are resistant to a variety of pests, diseases and environmental stress factors, in combination with fruit quality comparable to other cultivars at the international level. The concept of the models we suggested is based on 16 most desired selection traits that had been chosen from the existing selection pool, identification of the original forms for crossbreeding and multivariate analyses. To facilitate cooperation with other research centers, the information obtained was encoded according to OIV - Bioversity International descriptors. Using the developed models for the creation of new cultivars will, on the one hand, help solve ecological problems in the vineyards, while on the other hand, will ensure high economic effectiveness of viticulture and winemaking, as well as produce grape cultivars for different purposes. 3aVitis vinifera 3abreeding programs 3aclimate change 3acrossing 3aenvironmental impact 3afruit quality 3agene pool 3agrapes 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3apests 3aplant breeding 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awine cultivars 3awinemaking1 aLevchenko, S.

They have aesthetic, medicinal, industrial and commercial potentials and are well adapted to drought conditions of the region. They are, therefore, valuable resources for native landscaping in Iran. However, there are challenges in domesticating these plant species for application in urban landscapes. Using desktop studies and based on field investigation experiences of the co-authors during the last decades, this paper first introduces Iran-o-Turanian phytogeographical region and its major vegetation forms. It will then describe some challenges on adaptation of the important plant forms and groups from this phytogeographical region for application in urban landscaping of Iran. The outcome of this study can provide a step forward introducing native plants of this important region into its adjacent urbanized landscapes. It can, therefore, provide knowledge on sustainable native urban landscaping using flora of Iran's arid and semi-arid environments. 3aaesthetics 3adrought 3aflora 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3aphytogeography 3aplants (botany) 3asemiarid zones 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aIran1 aAbbasi, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Jan. 22, , no. 1190 p.59-66dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1190.10  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014600173300001400319500020200333520156500535650003102100650001902131650001402150650001202164650002602176650002602202650001602228650002102244650001902265650001902284650002702303650001602330650003702346650001702383700001502400700001902415773014302434856005402577852000902631655001202640IND60594577720221122065527.0180520e20180122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059457772DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1190.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahsavandi, F.10aPhysiological responses of two grapevine cultivars to combined drought and high temperature stresses in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza  ap. 45-52.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on the Role of Plant Genetic Resources in Reclaiming Lands and Environment Deteriorated by Human and Natural Actions held May 16-20, 2016 Shiraz, Iran  aDrought stress and high temperature are the most important environmental factors in many parts of the world that pose a threat to the plants' growth and yield production. While the two stresses often occur simultaneously, little information has already been reported about the effects of their interaction on plants and also the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza in these conditions. In this research the effects of Glomus etunicatum on growth and physiological traits were considered in two grapevine cultivars ('Perlette' and 'Yaghouti') under two irrigation levels (water deficit for 9 days and full irrigation regimes) and three temperature levels (25, 40, and 45°C). This experiment was conducted on the basis of randomized complete block design with 4 replications under greenhouse condition. Results indicated that high temperature stress had no effect on photosystem II efficiency, but drought stress decreased photosystem II efficiency. However, photosystem II photochemical efficiency was dramatically decreased under combined application of drought and high temperature stresses. Proline accumulation in plants under drought stress alone and in combination with high temperature was observed. Root colonization in both cultivars increased under drought stress, but under combined drought and high temperature stresses of 45°C reduced. Both 'Perlette' and 'Yaghouti' recovered during 4 days when rewatered. Generally these cultivars tolerated high temperature stress but their growth rate decreased under combined drought and high temperature stresses. 3aClaroideoglomus etunicatum 3aVitis vinifera 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse production 3aheat stress 3airrigation rates 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aphysiological response 3atemperature 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater stress1 aEshghi, S.1 aGharaghani, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Jan. 22, , no. 1190 p.45-52dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1190.8  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245009600170300001500266500020200281520138200483650001201865650001201877650001401889650001201903650001101915650001601926650001401942650002301956650002201979650001702001650000902018650001702027650002202044650002202066650001202088650001202100650000902112651000902121700002602130700001602156773014402172856005502316852000902371655001202380IND60594578520221122065518.0180520e20180122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059457852DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1190.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVahdati, K.10aWalnut: a potential multipurpose nut crop for reclaiming deteriorated lands and environment  ap. 95-100.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on the Role of Plant Genetic Resources in Reclaiming Lands and Environment Deteriorated by Human and Natural Actions held May 16-20, 2016 Shiraz, Iran  aBecause of urban development and changing land-usage, most lands have been deteriorated by human. In addition, natural disasters have exacerbated this problem. Trees with their strong root system have a key role in maintaining lands against destructive factors such as erosion and human activity. Walnut is one of the trees playing a main role in reclaiming lands. Iran is considered a biodiversity-hotspot for walnut in the world. There is a large natural and cultivated population of walnut in Iran. Native walnut trees are found in deep valleys in the “Kopet Dagh” Mountains, the quite dry region in the northern slopes. Natural walnut trees in the northern and western forests of the country not only protect land, but also have a special role in the economy of local people. Because of wide and deep root system, walnut stabilizes and protects the soil from erosion. Furthermore, walnut is a multi-purpose tree that can be used for wood production in forests and as an ornamental plant in landscape design. Generally, existence of very old walnut trees with a minimum attention and conservation reveals that this tree can be cultivated in deteriorated lands not only to prevent soil erosion but also as a productive and lucrative product. Even if walnut trees yield in deteriorated lands is just 1 t ha-1, its revenues will be five times higher than many annual crops. 3aJuglans 3aannuals 3adisasters 3aforests 3aincome 3alandscaping 3amountains 3amultipurpose trees 3aornamental plants 3aroot systems 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3atopographic slope 3aurban development 3avalleys 3awalnuts 3awood 3aIran1 aSarikhani Khorami, S.1 aArab, M.

This study compared a modern microgin located in the southeast United States, a lab gin stand, and five commercial gins in terms of fiber quality properties and lint turnout. Results showed that the lint turnout from the laboratory gin was consistently higher (0.8-2.3%) than that from the commercial gins, while the microgin and commercial gins had similar gin turnout (0.1-1.6% differences). The HVI trash and leaf grade from the lab gin stand were 0.98 (units) and 3 (grades) higher than that from the commercial gins, respectively; the differences between the microgin and commercial gins were only 0.16 and 1, respectively. Color reflectance from the lab gin was 5.92% less than that from the commercial gins; the difference between the microgin and commercial gins in reflectance was only 0.68%. Length and uniformity from the lab gin were 1.02 mm and 1.7% higher than those from the commercial gins, respectively; the differences between the microgin and commercial gins were only 0.25 mm and 0.58%, respectively. Linear regression analyses showed that the microgin had a consistently lower bias than the lab gin stand in estimating commercial gin values in most fiber quality properties except for micronaire. The data confirmed that the microgin outperforms the lab gin stand in estimating the lint turnout and most fiber quality properties and it should be a valuable tool for cotton research. 3acolor 3afiber quality 3aleaves 3alinear models 3alint cotton 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aUnited States1 aKnowlton, A.1 aBrown, S.1 aRitchie, G.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2011, v. 27, no. 2 p.167-175x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=27&issue=2&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01303naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007500127300001600202500002400218520049200242650001500734650001600749650001900765650001300784700001600797773008700813852000900900856012800909655001201037IND4458503920221122051722.0110531s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445850392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, D.G.10aTeaching Control Programming Using Programmable Automation Controllers  ap. 295-302.  aIncludes references  aIntroductory control programming was included as a required course for agricultural systems students.

We used annual fertilization with nitrogen (N as urea, 12.5 g N m⁻² year⁻¹), phosphorus (P as superphosphate, 5 g P m⁻² year⁻¹) and potassium (K as KCl, 5 g K m⁻² year⁻¹) within 38 ha of old-growth lowland tropical moist forest in Panama and examined fine root dynamics with minirhizotron images. We expected that added P, above all, would (i) decrease fine root biomass but, (ii) have no impact on fine root turnover. Soil in the study area was moderately acidic (pH = 5.28), had moderate concentrations of exchangeable base cations (13.4 cmol kg⁻¹), low concentrations of Bray-extractable phosphate (PO₄ = 2.2 mg kg⁻¹), and modest concentrations of KCl-extractable nitrate (NO₃ = 5.0 mg kg⁻¹) and KCl-extractable ammonium (NH₄ = 15.5 mg kg⁻¹). Added N increased concentrations of KCl-extractable NO₃ and acidified the soil by one pH unit. Added P increased concentrations of Bray-extractable PO₄ and P in the labile fraction. Concentrations of exchangeable K were elevated in K addition plots but reduced by N additions. Fine root dynamics responded to added K rather than added P. After 2 years, added K decreased fine root biomass from 330 to 275 g m⁻². The turnover coefficient of fine roots <1 mm diameter ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 per year, and the largest values occurred in plots with added K. This study supported the view that biomass and dynamics of fine roots respond to soil nutrient availability in species-rich, lowland tropical moist forest.

Fine roots smaller than 1 mm have a short lifetime (<140 days), and control of fine root production by nutrient availability in tropical forests deserves more study. 3abiomass 3aexchangeable potassium 3afine roots 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient availability 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3atropical forests 3aurea 3aPanama1 aHARMS, KYLE E.1 aGARCIA, MILTON N.1 aMIRABELLO, MATT J.1 aWRIGHT, S.

Unfortunately, wet fractionation involves consumption of copious amounts of water and energy. In addition, much of the (native) functionality of proteins is lost during processing. This paper reviews the potential of dry fractionation for producing protein-enriched ingredient fractions. Dry fractionation is extremely more energy efficient and is able to produce enriched fractions with retained (native) functionality. Hitherto, dry fractionation is most successfully applied to pulses and cereals, which is correlated to their specific tissue architecture and milling behaviour. Micromechanical studies on plant cell constituents and their interactions could improve milling processes and thus further develop dry fractionation. Moreover, the diversity of available protein fractions could be increased by development of fractionation techniques or innovative combinations thereof. Finally, expansion of scientific knowledge of dry-processed protein concentrates during product preparation is vital from application perspective. It is expected that the availability of a wide variety of protein concentrates with high (native) functionality will contribute to the development of better novel protein foods, provided that food technologists develop scientific tools to cope with the complex fractions. 3aenergy 3afoods 3afractionation 3agrains 3aingredients 3amilling 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein sources1 aGoot, A.J. van der0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2011 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.154-164dElsevier Sciencex0924-22447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/:10.1016/j.tifs.2010.11.0063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014700171300001600318500002400334520135400358650002201712650001101734650001201745650002301757650002201780650002701802650001001829650001101839650001301850650001401863650001401877650000901891650001101900650002201911650001001933651001401943700002701957700002001984773010002004852000902104856009202113655001202205IND4458686920221122041656.0110603s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445868692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02171.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAUBRET, FABIEN10aCorrelated geographic variation in predation risk and antipredator behaviour within a wide-ranging snake species (Notechis scutatus, Elapidae)  ap. 446-452.  aIncludes references  aGeographic variation in antipredator behaviour within wide-ranging species may be driven by both genetic and environmental influences. We quantified antipredator responses in neonatal (laboratory born, n = 555) and adult (field caught, n = 346) tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) from 11 mainland and island sites in southern Australia. We used these data to test predictions from Bonnet et al.'s hypothesis that the vigour of antipredator responses in this species reflects behavioural plasticity (in turn, driven by an individual snake's exposure to predators during its lifetime) rather than by genetic variation in this trait. We used the number of predator taxa in each area as an index of predator risk. As predicted, adult snakes from predator-rich areas had more vigorous defensive responses when handled, whereas neonatal behaviour (although also variable among populations) was unrelated to predator species richness. Adult males bit more readily than adult females (as expected from the greater predation exposure of males during mate searching) but no such sex difference was evident in neonates. Although alternative models remain possible, our data are most consistent with the hypothesis that geographic divergence in antipredator tactics within this species primarily reflects developmentally plastic responses to local predation risk. 3aNotechis scutatus 3aadults 3afemales 3agender differences 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3amales 3amodels 3aneonates 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3asnakes 3aspecies diversity 3avigor 3aAustralia1 aMICHNIEWICZ, RADIKA J.1 aShine, Richard.0 tAustral ecology.g2011 June, v. 36, no. 4 p.446-452dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02171.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03682naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245008100183300001600264500002400280520226500304650001102569650002402580650002202604650001402626650001002640650000902650650001302659650002002672650001402692650001902706650001102725650001902736650001102755650001502766650002502781650002702806650001402833650000902847651001602856700002002872700002102892700002102913700002102934700002002955773010002975852000903075856009203084655001203176IND4458686220221122041627.0110603s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445868622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02148.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohrer, A.

Although a number of studies have identified shifts in functional groups or biological traits in relation to anthropogenic stressors, there have been few field-based assessments of changes in functioning associated with stress gradients. We used a comparative experimental approach to investigate functioning on two sandflats with differing exposures to urban contaminants. Apart from significant differences in sediment contaminant concentrations (43.2 ± 1.8 mg kg⁻¹ Zn and 15.6 ± 0.9 mg kg⁻¹ Pb at the Pollen site; 17.7 ± 0.7 mg kg⁻¹ Zn and 7.9 ± 0.9 mg kg⁻¹ Pb at the Waiheke site), the two sandflats were readily comparable: both had similar sediment grain size distributions and were dominated by the same macrofaunal species; and both were in non-eutrophic New Zealand marine reserves with low ambient sediment organic matter content. To better understand the effects of contaminants on biologically mediated transformations of organic matter into inorganic nutrients, we manipulated sediment organic matter content and macrofaunal abundance in standardized treatments at each site. Fluxes of oxygen and ammonium, which are linked to key sandflat processes such as organic matter decomposition and benthic photosynthesis, were measured as response variables 1 week after the experimental manipulations. We predicted more efficient organic matter processing on the uncontaminated flat and thus expected to see elevated ammonium efflux in response to organic enrichment treatments at this site. Higher rates of benthic photosynthesis were predicted for plots with higher ammonium efflux, as ammonium is a readily utilizable form of limiting inorganic nitrogen. We documented significant positive relationships between ammonium uptake and benthic primary production on the uncontaminated flat, but weaker/insignificant relationships at the contaminated site. Our data were consistent with theories of increased variability and a decoupling of system processes with increasing amounts of stress. 3acarbon 3aecological function 3aenergy conversion 3aestuaries 3afauna 3alead 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3apollen 3apollutants 3aprimary productivity 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3azinc 3aNew Zealand1 aHEWITT, JUDI E.1 aHAILES, SARAH F.1 aTHRUSH, SIMON F.1 aAhrens, Michael.1 aHalliday, Jane.0 tAustral ecology.g2011 June, v. 36, no. 4 p.378-388dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02148.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03117naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245016200143300001400305520118300319650001301502650002501515650002701540650002201567650001901589650002001608650002101628650001801649650002501667650001301692650001801705650002401723650001801747650002501765650001801790650006201808650002301870650003301893650002601926650002101952650002001973650001801993650002802011650001802039650002702057650003002084650003302114650004602147653001702193653002802210653001902238700001302257700001702270700001502287700001402302700001702316773005602333852000902389930003302398945001302431946001102444655001202455IND2045634120221122011745.0950418s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204563412DNAL7 a78679452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondoh, O.12aA fruiting body-specific cDNA, mfbAc, from the mushroom Lentinus edodes encodes a high-molecular-weight cell-adhesion protein containing an Arg-Gly-Asp motif  ap. 31-37.  aA cDNA clone (designated mfbAc), encoding 2157 amino acids (aa), was isolated from a mature fruiting-body cDNA library of the edible mushroom Lentinus edodes. The mfbA transcript was abundant in mature fruiting bodies, detectable in immature fruiting bodies but absent in earlier developmental stages and in the vegetative mycelium. Although more abundant in the pileus than the stipe, only low levels were found in the gill tissue. The deduced MFBA protein (234.5 kDa) contained a cell-surface attachment-promoting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. MFBA was produced in Escherichia coli using a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector but it was cleaved into four fragments even in a protease-deficient host. A 425-aa MFBA peptide containing the RGD motif (named MFBA (582-1006) peptide) was successfully produced using the phage T7 expression system. This MFBA (582-1006) peptide exhibited a cell adhesion and spreading activity toward mammalian cells. This activity of the MFBA fragment was competitively inhibited by the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide but not by the Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro peptide, showing that the RGD motif of MFBA is essential for the cell-binding activity. 3aadhesion 3aamino acid sequences 3abiological development 3acomplementary DNA 3afungal anatomy 3agene expression 3aLentinula edodes 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCell Adhesion 2aCell Adhesion Moleculesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aEscherichia coli 2aFungal Proteins 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligopeptides 2aPolyporaceaexgenetics 2aRNA, Fungalxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 0amfba protein 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d012091 aMuto, A.1 aKajiwara, S.1 aTakagi, J.1 aSaito, Y.1 aShishido, K.0 tGene.g1995, v. 154, no. 1 p.31-37x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02905naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011700146300001600263520116800279650002901447650003701476650002001513650001901533650002301552650002001575650002101595650003601616650003301652650001801685650003301703650001801736650003101754650003001785650003901815650002101854650002001875650003001895650002801925650002801953650003101981650004202012650003902054650003802093650003202131653001402163653002102177700001702198773005802215852000902273930003302282945001302315946001102328655001202339IND2045634220221122011414.0950418s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204563422DNAL7 a78679352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarathe, S.V.10aVectors with the gus reporter gene for identifying and quantitating promoter regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 105-107.  aThe Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase-encoding gene gusA is useful as a reporter gene in a variety of organisms. In this report, we describe the development of two related vectors, pGUS1 and pGUS2, which can be used to identify and quantitate activities of the promoter regions from yeast genes. Both vectors contain several unique restriction sites upstream from gus and the yeast CYC1 transcription terminator downstream from gus. In addition, pGUS2 carries the yeast ADH1 transcriptional terminator sequence upstream from gus, in order to block read-through transcription originating in vector sequences. Both vectors were tested after cloning the well-characterized GAL1,10 promoter region from yeast. These GAL1,10-containing plasmids demonstrated appropriate regulation of the reporter in response to carbon sources. The pGUS1 and pGUS1 vectors provide a simple, reliable and extremely sensitive reporter-gene system that allows quantitative measurement of promoter activity of yeast DNA sequences. Furthermore, the presence of a terminator sequence upstream from gus in pGUS2 should facilitate analysis and quantitation of expression from weak promoters. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aplasmid vectors 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3arecombinant DNA 3apromoter regions 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCytochrome c Groupxgenetics 2aCytochromes c 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTerminator Regions, Genetic 0agusa gene 0agal1,10 promoter1 aMcEwen, J.E.0 tGene.g1995, v. 154, no. 1 p.105-107x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01738naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010100146300001600247500001500263520039200278650002200670650000900692650002500701650003200726650002500758650002400783650001200807650001800819650002300837650003300860650000900893650001100902650002800913650002200941650004600963653000801009653002801017653001901045700002101064700001601085700001901101773005801120852000901178930003301187945001301220946001101233655001201244IND2045862320221122011718.0950502s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204586232DNAL7 a77211102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManning, A.M.10aCloning of a canine cDNA homologous to the human transforming growth factor-beta 1-encoding gene  ap. 307-308.  a2019-12-05  aA 1369-bp cDNA that encodes a homolog of the human transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been isolated from canine endothelial cells using a combination of PCR and traditional plaque-screening methods.

Herein, we focused on the prevention of anthocyanins from amyloid-mediated neurodysfunction. The data demonstrated that combined exposure of Aβ1−40 and Aβ25−35 to Neuro-2A cells resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and perturbation of calcium homeostasis. The expressions of LXRα, ApoE, ABCA1, and seladin-1 genes were significantly down-regulated upon Aβ challenge. β-Secretase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes amyloid precursor protein transform to Aβ, was up-regulated by Aβ treatment. For the duration of Aβ stimulation, malvidin (Mal) or oenin (Oen; malvidin-3-O-glucoside) was added, and the protective effects were observed. Mal and Oen showed protective effects against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through blocking ROS formation, preserving Ca2+ homeostasis, and preventing Aβ-mediated perturbation of certain genes involved in Aβ metabolism and cellular defense. The present study implicates anthocyanin as a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention of amyloid-mediated neurodysfunction. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanthocyanins 3acalcium 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amalvidin 3ametabolism 3aneurotoxicity 3areactive oxygen species 2aAlzheimer Disease 2aAmyloid Precursor Protein Secretasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgenetics. 2aAmyloid beta-Peptidesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAnthocyaninsxpharmacology 2aApolipoproteins Exbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aApoptosisxgenetics 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHomeostasis 2aMice 2aNervous System Diseasesxprevention & control 2aNeuroblastoma 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism1 aWu, Jihao.1 aYeh, Chi-Tai1 aYen, Gow-Chin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1683-1689x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103822h3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02917naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245016000173300001800333500002400351500001500375520146900390650001601859650001901875650001401894650002101908650001801929650000701947650002101954650001401975650001801989650002802007650001302035650001302048650002402061650002802085650003002113650001402143650003502157653001702192700001502209700002102224773010402245852000902349856007702358655001202435IND4459268520221121233111.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445926852DNAL7 a213095752pmid7 a10.1021/jf104420y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukai, Kazuo10aKinetic Study of the Quenching Reaction of Singlet Oxygen by Pyrroloquinolinequinol (PQQH2, a Reduced Form of Pyrroloquinolinequinone) in Micellar Solution  ap. 1705-1712.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA kinetic study of the quenching reaction of singlet oxygen (1O2) with pyrroloquinolinequinol (PQQH2, a reduced form of pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ)), PQQNa2 (disodium salt of PQQ), and seven kinds of natural antioxidants (vitamin C (Vit C), uric acid (UA), epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), α-tocopherol (α-Toc), ubiquinol-10 (UQ10H2), and β-carotene (β-Car)) has been performed. The second-order rate constants kQ (kQ = kq + kr, physical quenching and chemical reaction) for the reaction of 1O2 with PQQH2, PQQNa2, and seven kinds of antioxidants were measured in 5.0 wt % Triton X-100 micellar solution (pH 7.4), using UV−visible spectrophotometry. The kQ values decreased in the order of β-Car > PQQH2 > α-Toc > UA > UQ10H2 > Vit C EGC > EC PQQNa2. PQQH2 is a water-soluble antioxidant. The singlet oxygen-quenching activity of PQQH2 was found to be 6.3, 2.2, 6.1, and 22 times as large as the corresponding those of water-soluble antioxidants (Vit C, UA, EGC, and EC). Further, the activity of PQQH2 was found to be 2.2 and 3.1 times as large as the corresponding activity of lipid-soluble antioxidants (α-Toc and UQ10H2). On the other hand, the activity of PQQH2 is 6.4 times as small as that of β-Car. It was observed that the chemical reaction (kr) is almost negligible in the quenching reaction of 1O2 by PQQH2. The result suggests that PQQH2 may contribute to the protection of oxidative damage in biological systems, by quenching 1O2. 3aepicatechin 3asinglet oxygen 3auric acid 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abeta-carotene 3apH 3aepigallocatechin 3aoctoxynol 3aascorbic acid 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aMicelles 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPQQ Cofactorxchemistry 2aSinglet Oxygenxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0aantioxidants1 aOuchi, Aya1 aNakano, Masahiko0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1705-1712x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104420y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03346naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245013400176300001800310500002400328520160300352650002201955650001801977650001201995650002502007650002202032650001902054650001102073650001902084650001402103650002202117650002202139650001602161650002202177650001502199650004602214650004002260650003502300650001902335650002102354650003702375650002002412650001302432650004102445700001902486700002202505700002102527700002202548700002002570773010402590852000902694856007702703655001202780IND4459270020221121225739.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927002DNAL7 a213095632pmid7 a10.1021/jf103469n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWawire, Michael10aThermal Stability of Ascorbic Acid and Ascorbic Acid Oxidase in African Cowpea Leaves (Vigna unguiculata) of Different Maturities  ap. 1774-1783.  aIncludes references  aCowpea, an African leafy vegetable (Vigna unguiculata), contains a high level of vitamin C. The leaves harvested at 4−9 weeks are highly prone to vitamin C losses during handling and processing. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to study the effect of thermal treatment on the stability of ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), total vitamin C content (l-ascorbic acid, l-AA), and dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) and l-AA/DHAA ratio in cowpea leaves harvested at different maturities (4, 6, and 8 weeks old). The results showed that AAO activity, total vitamin C content, and l-AA/DHAA ratio in cowpea leaves increased with increasing maturity (up to 8 weeks). Eight-week-old leaves were the best source of total vitamin C and showed a high ratio of l-AA/DHAA (4:1). Thermal inactivation of AAO followed first-order reaction kinetics. Heating at temperatures above 90 °C for short times resulted in a complete AAO inactivation, resulting in a protective effect of l-AA toward enzyme-catalyzed oxidation. Total vitamin C in young leaves (harvested at 4 and 6 weeks) was predominantly in the form of DHAA, and therefore temperature treatment at 30−90 °C for 10 min decreased the total vitamin C content, whereas total vitamin C in 8-week-old cowpea leaves was more than 80% in the form of l-AA, so that a high retention of the total vitamin C can be obtained even after heating and/or reheating (30−90 °C for 10 min) before consumption. The results indicated that the stability of total vitamin C in situ was strongly dependent on the plant maturity stage and the processing conditions applied. 3aVigna unguiculata 3aascorbic acid 3acowpeas 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aheat inactivation 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3amaturity stage 3aoxidation 3aprotective effect 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avegetables 2aAscorbate Oxidasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDehydroascorbic Acidxanalysis 2aDrug Stability 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFabaceaexchemistryxenzymology. 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxenzymology.1 aOey, Indrawati1 aMathooko, Francis1 aNjoroge, Charles1 aShitanda, Douglas1 aHendrickx, Marc0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1774-1783x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103469n3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03219naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002300178245010600201300001800307500002400325506007600349520117500425506003701600650004501637650002501682650002401707650001701731650002101748650002301769650001701792650001101809650001601820650002201836650001601858650001501874650001901889650000901908650001401917650001801931650001101949650002101960650003201981650001702013650004102030650001102071650002102082650001702103650002302120650003302143650001502176650003002191650002202221700002302243700001902266700002202285700002502307700002302332773010402355852000902459856007702468655001202545IND4459271020221207114532.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927102DNAL7 a213061062pmid7 aPMC30484502pmcid7 a10.1021/jf10381032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Elizabeth P.10aRice Bran Fermented with Saccharomyces boulardii Generates Novel Metabolite Profiles with Bioactivity  ap. 1862-1870.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEmerging evidence supporting chronic disease fighting properties of rice bran has advanced the development of stabilized rice bran for human use as a functional food and dietary supplement. A global and targeted metabolomic investigation of stabilized rice bran fermented with Saccharomyces boulardii was performed in three rice varieties. Metabolites from S. boulardii-fermented rice bran were detected by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC−MS) and assessed for bioactivity compared to nonfermented rice bran in normal and malignant lymphocytes. Global metabolite profiling revealed significant differences in the metabolome that led to discovery of candidate compounds modulated by S. boulardii fermentation. Fermented rice bran extracts from three rice varieties reduced growth of human B lymphomas compared to each variety’s nonfermented control and revealed that fermentation differentially altered bioactive compounds. These data support that integration of global and targeted metabolite analysis can be utilized for assessing health properties of rice bran phytochemicals that are enhanced by yeast fermentation and that differ across rice varieties.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae var. cerevisiae 3abioactive properties 3adietary supplements 3afermentation 3afunctional foods 3agas chromatography 3ahuman growth 3ahumans 3alymphocytes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3aphytochemicals 3arice 3arice bran 3arice bran oil 3ayeasts 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aFermentation 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aLymphoma, B-Cell 2aMetabolomics 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aProbiotics 2aSaccharomycesxmetabolism 2aSeedsxmetabolism1 aHeuberger, Adam L.1 aWeir, Tiffany.1 aBarnett, Brittany1 aBroeckling, Corey D.1 aPrenni, Jessica E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.1862-1870x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10381033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02692naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015800142300001600300520088900316650001801205650002901223650002201252650001701274650001601291650002001307650001901327650001501346650001401361650002901375650001101404650001801415650002901433650001501462650001101477650003001488650004601518650003101564650002601595650004201621650004101663650005701704650005201761650002401813650003901837653001501876653002701891653003001918700001401948700001601962773005801978852000902036930003302045945001302078946001102091655001202102IND2046517120221121225827.0950621s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204651712DNAL7 a77375062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKacar, Y.14aThe presence of tRNA pseudogenes in mammalia and plants and their absence in yeast may account for different specificities of pre-tRNA processing enzymes  ap. 129-132.  aSix of 13 cloned members of the human tRNAVal gene family code for tRNAVal pseudogenes, of which all but one are transcribed efficiently in HeLa cell extracts. Due to single or multiple mismatches in stem regions, the corresponding pre-tRNAs are resistant against the action of human 5'- and 3'-processing enzymes and are thus prevented from being converted to mature tRNAs. Surprisingly, all of them are accurately and efficiently processed to mature-sized tRNA in yeast nuclear extract. This is in agreement with corresponding studies of plant pre-tRNAs which are not processed in wheat germ extract but are rapidly processed in yeast extract. These observations imply that the yeast pre-tRNA 5' and 3'-maturases do not monitor the three-dimensional structure of their substrates as stringently as mammalian and plant enzymes possibly because tRNA pseudogenes do not occur in yeast. 3ayeast extract 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTriticum aestivum 3atransfer RNA 3apseudogenes 3agene expression 3aplant extracts 3awheat germ 3anucleases 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaline 2aCell Extracts 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPoint Mutationxphysiology 2aPseudogenesxgenetics 2aRNA Precursorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Transfer, Valxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription, Geneticxphysiology 0ahela cells 0ain vitro transcription 0apre-transfer rna maturase1 aBeier, H.1 aGross, H.J.0 tGene.g1995, v. 156, no. 1 p.129-132x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02036naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230500013700246520090400383650002201287650001701309650002001326650001301346650002101359650001801380650001401398650001901412650001501431653002101446700002001467700001701487700002001504773006001524852000901584930003301593945001301626946001101639655001201650IND2046896720221121225805.0950719s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204689672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlasova, T.I.10aIn vitro DNA methylation by wheat nuclear cytosine DNA methyltransferase: effect of phytohormones  ap. 279-281.  aPaper presented at the "Third New England Biolabs Workshop on Biological DNA Modification" held May 22-28, 1994, Vilnius, Lithuania.  aCytosine DNA methyltransferases (MTases) were isolated from nuclei of wheat seedlings and germinating embryos. The MTases isolated from both sources were able to perform de novo and maintenance DNA methylations. The most purified MTase fraction showed the presence of one main 67-kDa protein (embryos) and of a 85-kDa protein (in seedlings) in SDS-PAGE. Some plant growth regulators (gibberellic acid A3, 6-benzylaminopurine and fusicoccin) elevate by 30-65% the extent of in vitro DNA methylation by nuclear extracts with a maximal effect at 10(-6) M phytohormone concentration. The same phytohormones do not increase the extent of in vitro DNA methylation by purified wheat MTase: rather they inhibit it at concentrations of 10(-4) to 10(-5) M. Thus DNA methylation in the plant nucleus is controlled by phytohormones. The phytohormone effect may be mediated by other proteins in nuclear extracts. 3aTriticum aestivum 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 3acytosine 3agibberellic acid 3abenzyladenine 3aseedlings 3aembryo (plant) 3afusicoccin 0adna modification1 aDemidenko, Z.N.1 aDirnos, M.D.1 aVanyushin, B.F.0 tGene.g1995, v. 157, no. 1/2 p.279-281x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02216naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008700144300001600231500001500247520080400262650001001066650001801076650002501094650002101119650002101140650001201161650001801173650001801191650003701209650002001246650002201266650002801288650003001316650004001346650002001386650002901406653001601435653001601451653001201467653002501479700001501504700001401519700001401533700001501547773005801562852000901620930003301629945001301662946001101675655001201686IND2046583220221121201338.0950626s1995    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204658322DNAL7 a77589682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatlova, R.10aProtein-induced bending or flexing at the 5'-end of the duck betaA-globin promoter  ap. 277-281.  a2019-12-05  aThe 5'-end of the duck beta A-globin promoter contains a protein binding site BS-3/Sp1, the A+T-rich part of which could be involved in DNA bending. Plasmids were constructed using the pBend2 plasmid containing BS-3/Sp1. Circular permutation analysis of the fragments cut out from the plasmids using various restriction endonucleases, in the presence of a partially purified protein extract from embryonic duck erythrocytes, was performed. The results indicate that a rather complicated change in the fragment shape takes place upon protein binding, which is best explained as an induction of two points of bending or flexure within the fragment. Analogical points of flexure may exist at the protein-binding sites of the duck and chicken beta A-globin promoters in spite of differing DNA sequences. 3aducks 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDNA conformation 3apromoter regions 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDucksxgenetics 2aGlobinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Binding 2aSp1 Transcription Factor 0asp1 protein 0adna bending 0aglobins 0anucleotide sequences1 aHorska, K.1 aBenes, V.1 aCvekl, A.1 aSponar, J.0 tGene.g1995, v. 156, no. 2 p.277-281x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245007700145300001600222520119200238650002201430650002301452650001801475650002001493650001901513650004101532650001701573650002001590650002701610650002101637650002501658650003501683650001801718650001501736650002201751650001601773650002101789650004101810650002001851650001701871650002001888650002001908650005501928650002801983650003202011653001202043653003402055773005802089852000902147930003302156945001302189946001102202655001202213IND2044656820221121162136.0950217s1994    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204465682DNAL7 a79590442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrbach, M.J.12aA cosmid with a HyR marker for fungal library construction and screening  ap. 159-162.  aThe construction of a double-cos-site cosmid vector, pMOcosX, for use in making filamentous fungal genomic DNA libraries, is described.

Cuticular collagen-encoding genes (col) have been described for the animal parasites Ascaris suum and Haemonchus contortus and for the free-living Caenorhabditis elegans. The proteins encoded by all these genes seem to have the same basic structure, indicating that there is a conserved subfamily of cuticular col in these nematodes. In this paper, we describe the identification and characterization of a cDNA (Lemmi 5) which corresponds to a cuticular col of the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita. The derived protein structure is very similar to the basic structure of the C. elegans cuticular collagens. Using PCR technology, we have shown the presence of Lemmi 5-related sequences in the genome of Ditylenchus destructor. Our data strongly support the existence of a cuticular col subfamily which is highly conserved in the phylum Nemata. 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3astructural genes 3acollagen 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 0acol gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z247341 aAlmeida Engler, J. de.1 aMontagu, M. van.1 aGheysen, G.0 tGene.g1994, v. 151, no. 1/2 p.237-242x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01785naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245009300135300001600228520087000244650002301114650002201137650001701159650001301176650001601189650001101205653001101216653002701227653001601254653002501270700001401295773006001309852000901369930003301378945001301411946001101424655001201435IND2045098220221121162148.0950316s1994    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204509822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Maseda, H.14aThe compositional compartments of the nuclear genomes of Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi  ap. 221-224.  aFractionation of DNA from Trypanosoma panosoma brucei and T. equiperdum by centrifugation in a Cs2SO4/BAMD density gradient indicated that these genomes are compositionally compartmentalized, a conclusion confirmed by the analysis of the compositional distribution of third codon positions from T. brucei and T. cruzi.

In all cases, the compartments displayed remarkable differences.

Anautogenous females survived substantially longer than autogenous females when only sucrose was supplied, but the opposite applied when the flies were supplied with water only. Anautogenous females survived somewhat longer than autogenous females in the absence of both sucrose and water.

Changes in the levels and compositions of free amino acids and small peptides during hydrolysis were investigated to find out their relationships with antioxidant activities. Increased levels of free amino acids, anserine, carnosine and other peptides of the hydrolysates obtained with protease were much higher than those by autolysis. Different antioxidant measurements including the inhibition of linoleic acid autoxidation, the scavenging effect on alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl free radical, and the reducing power showed that mackerel hydrolysates possessed noticeable antioxidant activities. A good correlation existed between the amount of peptides and antioxidant activity. Three peptide fractions were separated from the hydrolysate by size exclusion chromatography. Results revealed that the peptide with molecular weight of approximately 1400 Da possessed a stronger in vitro antioxidant activity than that of the 900 and 200 Da peptides. 3alinoleic acid 3ameat extracts 3afree amino acids 3aproteinases 3amolecular weight 3afree radicals 3aproteolysis 3acarnosine 3amackerel 3aautoxidation 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3areducing agents 3aautolysis 3aantioxidant activity 3afish protein hydrolysate 0aanserine 0ainhibitors 0apeptides1 aChen, H.M.1 aShiau, C.Y.0 tFood research international.g2003, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.949-957x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050923b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/07/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02684naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245006500178300001600243500001500259520123800274650001101512650001601523650002001539650002301559650002501582650001401607650000901621650002101630650001801651650002001669650003101689650001701720650002201737650001601759650001701775653002701792653002501819653002001844653001901864700001801883700001701901700001601918700001801934700001701952773008301969852000902052930003302061945002502094946001102119655001202130IND4363516420221121035632.0040722s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436351642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aValencia, C.10aNon-linear viscoelasticity modeling of tomato paste products  ap. 911-919.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper deals with the characterization and modeling of the non-linear rheological properties of tomato paste samples manufactured under different conditions (sieve pore size and breaking temperature). With this aim, flow measurements, dynamic linear viscoelastic and linear and non-linear stress relaxation tests have been carried out on the above-mentioned tomato paste samples. Different geometries with smooth and serrated surfaces have been used to optimize the viscous flow measurements and avoid wall-depletion phenomena. The viscous flow properties of tomato paste samples depend on water insoluble solids (WIS) content and particle size, which may be highly influenced by processing conditions. In general, viscosity follows a power-law relationship with tomato paste water insoluble content and particle diameter. A factorable non-linear viscoelasticity model, the Wagner integral equation, predicts the non-linear rheological response of these products under shear fairly well. The time-dependent part of this model is described by a continuous linear relaxation spectrum, calculated from regularization techniques. The use of the Soskey-Winter damping function provides the best predictions of the viscous flow curves. 3asieves 3adeformation 3aviscoelasticity 3adry matter content 3atotal soluble solids 3aequations 3aflow 3anonlinear models 3aparticle size 3afood processing 3aparticle size distribution 3ashear stress 3astress relaxation 3atemperature 3atomato paste 0awater insoluble solids 0abreaking temperature 0asieve pore size 0asoluble solids1 aSanchez, M.C.1 aCiruelos, A.1 aLatorre, A.1 aMadiedo, J.M.1 aGallegos, C.0 tFood research international.g2003, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.911-919x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050923b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02158naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245012300194300001600317500007200333500001500405520081300420650001701233650003901250650001901289650002301308650001901331650002701350650001701377650002101394650003801415650000901453650001601462653002501478653001901503700002001522773008001542852000901622930003301631945002501664946001101689655001201700IND4363491120221121035721.0040721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both proteins were partially denatured (26-40%) when applying up to 10 pulses in the order of milliseconds. However, whilst the onset and peak, denaturation temperatures of the beta-lactoglobulin concentrate were reduced by approximately 4-5 degrees C, the thermostability of egg white proteins was partially increased. Electrophoresis analysis revealed the formation of aggregates involving covalent bonds. The gelation rate of beta-lactoglobulin concentrate was increased after the electric-treatment. In contrast, the gelation rate of egg white at 63 degrees C was lowered. 3aconcentrates 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3agelatinization 3achemical structure 3alactoglobulins 3apulsed electric fields 3adenaturation 3aelectric current 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agels 3aegg albumen 0aelectrical treatment 0afield strength1 aPilosof, A.M.R.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 1 p.102-110x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02146naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245007600161300001400237500007200251500001500323520082700338650001701165650001101182650002001193650001501213650001101228650002101239650001401260650001601274650002401290650002701314650001101341650001301352650001701365650001101382650002001393653001601413653002501429653002501454700001701479773007801496852000901574930003301583945002501616946001101641655001201652IND4363490820221121035812.0040721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Narine.  a2019-12-05  aBread from rice flour is very difficult to bake as it lacks gluten like proteins but modification of the rice flour proteins with enzymes like glucose oxidase (GO) to improve its breadmaking properties is an interesting option. In this study the effect of GO on rice flour dough rheology, protein modification and bread quality has been reported. GO modified the rice flour proteins by lowering the thiol and amino group concentration. Protein modification was also confirmed by the changes observed in the free zone capillary electrophoregrams of the rice glutelins. The addition of GO promoted an increase in the elastic and viscous modulus. Rice bread with better specific volume and texture was obtained with GO addition allowing the decrease of the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) levels in the rice bread recipe. 3acrosslinking 3aweight 3amethylcellulose 3arice flour 3avolume 3afree amino acids 3aglutelins 3abreadmaking 3aenzymatic treatment 3arheological properties 3abreads 3adynamics 3arice protein 3athiols 3aglucose oxidase 0aconsistency 0aprotein modification 0aprotein crosslinking1 aRosell, C.M.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 1 p.75-81x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03729naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245015400196300001400350500007200364500001500436520169100451650001302142650001702155650001702172650001002189650001902199650002002218650001602238650001202254650001702266650001802283650002602301650001702327650001702344650001202361650002702373650002002400650001602420650002502436650001702461650001802478650001702496650001702513650001302530650001602543650001602559650001302575650000902588650000702597650001002604650002202614650001902636650001402655653002402669653001102693653002302704653003102727700001902758700001702777700002102794773007802815852000902893930003302902945002502935946001102960655001202971IND4363490920221121024053.0040721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Narine.  a2019-12-05  aLow-fat white-brined cheese was manufactured by a traditional procedure from bovine milk (70% fat reduction) containing two levels of an oat beta-glucan concentrate (CEBA Foods AB) at 0.7% and 1.4% (w/w). For comparison two controls - a full-fat and a low-fat product without addition of the beta-glucan concentrate - were also examined. The results indicated that as the fat content of cheese milk decreased, the fat, moisture in non-fat solids (MNFS) and yield values significantly decreased, and the moisture and total nitrogen values increased. The products fortified with the beta-glucan concentrate exhibited higher yield values and significantly lower pH (at 60 and 90 days of storage) than the control samples. In accordance with the latter values, the HPLC analysis showed that incorporation of the beta-glucan concentrate into the low-fat cheese milk led to a significant increase in the production of lactic, acetic and butyric acid throughout cheese ripening. Also, the extent of proteolysis in the treatments supplemented with the hydrocolloid significantly increased, especially at 60 and 90 days and was higher than the respective values of the control products. With regard to the rheological properties of the cheeses, incorporation of the beta-glucan concentrate brought about amelioration in all the textural parameters of the low-fat product, as determined by large deformation mechanical testing and sensorial analysis; significant correlations (p < 0.01) between instrumental and sensory data for hardness were identified. However, the addition of the beta-glucan preparation adversely affected cheese appearance and flavour in comparison with the control samples. 3ahardness 3aelasticities 3abutyric acid 3aodors 3afood additives 3alow fat cheeses 3alactic acid 3atexture 3aconcentrates 3afat replacers 3amodulus of elasticity 3afood quality 3alow fat milk 3abrining 3atraditional technology 3acheese ripening 3aproteolysis 3aappearance (quality) 3astorage time 3awater content 3abeta-glucans 3asalt content 3acohesion 3adeformation 3aacetic acid 3anitrogen 3aoats 3apH 3acolor 3astress relaxation 3agelatinization 3asaltiness 0awhite-brined cheese 0aflavor 0asensory properties 0aphysicochemical properties1 aBiliaderis, C.1 aVamvakas, C.1 aZerfiridis, G.K.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 1 p.83-94x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01967naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245011600161300001600277500001500293520100500308650001301313650002501326650002301351650001201374653001801386653001401404700002601418700001501444773008001459852000901539930003301548945002501581946001101606655001201617IND4363638320221121024027.0040730s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436363832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ewes milk cheeses sensory description was used as a case study. For this purpose, data was analyzed by means of INDSCAL (individual difference scaling) and panels reproducibility, discrimination and consensus were studied. Trained panel in sensory profiling got better performance quality indexes using Projective Mapping techniques than consumer panel. However, results revealed great individual variability mainly attributable to the absence of specific sensory training. Overall consumer and trained panel sample configurations followed similar trends although several differences were also perceived in the maps. In order to obtain further interesting information and to avoid inaccurate or biased conclusions, the use of specific trained panel in parallel to consumers is highly recommended. 3aewe milk 3aconsumer preferences 3asensory evaluation 3acheeses 0atrained panel 0aconsumers1 aPerez Elortondo, F.J.1 aAlbisu, M.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 7 p.723-729x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20041021b20041101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02623naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178072001700195072001700212072001700229100002100246245007900267300001800346500001500364520109600379650001601475650002501491650001201516650001801528650002301546650002701569650002601596650001701622650001501639650001101654650004301665650002501708650003801733650001801771650000901789650000901798650002001807653001001827700001801837700001301855700001401868773008501882852000901967930003301976945002502009946001102034655001202045IND4363559120221121013037.0040726s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436355912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Means of identifying food products fried in lard has been investigated in this study. Four fat containing products namely, peanuts, tempeh (fermented soybean cake), chicken and beef were subjected to deep-fat frying using lard as the frying medium. Oils extracted from the control and fried samples were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography (GLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In this way, changes in composition and thermal profiles during frying were examined. Results showed that palmitic acid enrichment factor (PAEF) calculated from GLC analysis of fatty acid methyl esters seems to be a useful parameter in determining lard contamination in all four fried products. With the triglycerol (TG) profiling by HPLC it was possible to detect lard in fried chicken and tempeh products while DSC cooling and heating traces were found to be useful for lard detection in fried tempeh, chicken and beef products. 3afried foods 3aproduct authenticity 3apeanuts 3afood analysis 3agas chromatography 3afatty acid composition 3acooking fats and oils 3achicken meat 3aabsorption 3atempeh 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aadulterated products 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3awater content 3abeef 3alard 3adeep fat frying 0afoods1 aGhazali, H.M.1 aLong, K.1 aLai, O.M.0 tFood research international.g2003, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.1047-1060x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050923b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle04047naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245012700159300001300286500007200299500001500371520256100386650001702947650001402964650001902978650001302997650001603010650002703026650002203053650001403075650001703089650001803106650000903124650001803133650002003151650002203171650001603193650001303209653001803222653002103240653001103261653003403272700001503306700001603321700001303337773007703350852000903427930003303436945002503469946001103494655001203505IND4363489520221120232004.0040721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436348952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHigaki, K.10aIn situ optical observation of microstructure of beta-fat gel made of binary mixtures of high-melting and low-melting fats  ap. 2-10.  aIn the special issue: Physical properties IV / edited by S. Narine.  a2019-12-05  aOptical observation was conducted to study the size, morphology and aggregation patterns of high-melting (HM) fat crystals that exhibit gel-like behavior in mixtures of HM and low-melting (LM) fats. The HM fats examined were fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil with a high amount of behenic acid (FHR-B), fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil with a high amount of stearic acid (FHR-S), and tristearoyl-glycerol (SSS). The LM fats examined were sal fat olein (SFO), cocoa butter (CB), palm super olein (PSO) and olive oil. Our previous study [K. Higaki et al., J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 80 (2003) 263] reported that two mixtures, FHR-B/SFO and FHR-B/CB, having solid fat content (SFC) values of 1.5-4% exhibited gel-like behavior when proper tempering procedures were applied. In the present study, we focused on the crystallization behavior of the same two mixtures during different thermal treatments, and compared them with those of other mixture systems. The results obtained indicated that the size and morphology of HM fat crystals play decisive roles in the formation of beta-fat gel. (i) Gel-like behavior occurred when rapid cooling (10 degrees C/min) of a high-temperature liquid mixture formed many small crystals of alpha polymorph of HM fats, and the alpha crystals converted to the most stable beta form in crystals of very small size after heating from 10 to 38 degrees C through the alpha-melt mediated transformation. Slow cooling crystallized the beta' and beta forms with large, aggregated patterns. After subsequent heating, the beta' crystals were converted to large beta crystals by solid-state transformation. This thermal treatment did not produce gel-like behavior. (ii) The polymorphism, crystal size and morphology of HM fats were influenced by crystallization temperature (T(c)) even when rapid cooling was applied. When T(c) was <20 degrees C, the first crystallizing form was alpha form that converted to the beta form. However, the beta' and beta forms were crystallized at T(c) > 20 degrees C, and did not exhibit gel-like behavior. (iii) Mixtures of FHR-S/SFO and SSS/SFO caused the alpha-melt mediated transformation and formed the most stable beta form, similar to the FHR-B/SFO mixture. However, the two fat mixtures did not exhibit gel-like behavior since the crystals of FHR-S/SFO and SSS/SFO were larger than that of FHR-B/SFO, and the HM fat crystals were distributed non-uniformly and possessed crystal aggregates. To conclude, we found that the size and morphology of HM fat crystals play decisive roles in forming beta-fat gel. 3acocoa butter 3apalm oils 3amicrostructure 3apressure 3amorphometry 3afatty acid composition 3acrystal structure 3aolive oil 3arapeseed oil 3aparticle size 3agels 3amelting point 3acrystallization 3ahydrogenated oils 3atemperature 3amixtures 0asal fat olein 0apalm super olein 0alipids 0aalpha-mediated transformation1 aKoyano, T.1 aHachiya, I.1 aSato, K.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 1 p.2-10x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03395naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245010000175300001600275500007300291520183200364650001802196650001102214650001402225650001002239650001702249650001002266650001902276650001402295650001602309650002002325650002402345650001602369650002102385650001602406650001802422650001802440650001102458650001002469650001902479650001802498650002102516650002602537653003302563653003002596700001802626700001502644773008002659852000902739930003302748945002502781946001102806655001202817IND4363303220221120231959.0040712s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436330322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFaraj, A.14aThe effect of extrusion cooking on resistant starch formation in waxy and regular barley flours  ap. 517-525.  aIn the special issue: Starch functionality / edited by T. Vasanthan.  aHull-less barley flours from CDC-Candle (waxy) and Phoenix (regular) were extrusion cooked under various combinations of temperature (90, 100, 120, 140 and 160 °C), moisture content (20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40%) and screw speed (60, 80 and 100 rpm). The effect of processing on the formation of resistant starch (RS3) in the extruded flour was determined by a technique that involved a step in which the flour were heated at 100 °C in the presence of thermostable alpha-amylase which was expected to destroy all the RS1 and RS2. Literature on resistant starch has suggested that RS3 forms only during heat treatment of moist starchy materials. In contrast, when determined by using the same methodology, the native (unprocessed) flours that is supposed to be free of RS3, showed resistant starch value of 40-60 mg/100 g. This indicated that RS1 and RS2 are not totally destroyed by the heat treatment step of the methodology used in determining RS3. Extrusion cooking did not significantly (P<0.05) alter the RS3 content of native flours, the RS3 contents generally decreased. Refrigeration at 4 °C for 24 h before oven drying of extruded flour samples slightly increased the RS3 content. An attempt was made to isolate the RS3 from the extruded flour using enzymes. The methodology involved sequential enzymatic treatments to flours with lichenase, beta-glucosidase, protease, thermostable alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase. The RS3 content in the isolates ranged between 6-34 mg/100 g which was lower than that of the raw materials (extruded samples) before enzymatic isolation. This was unexpected but indicated that the RS3 did not concentrate, suggesting that hydrolysis of the other grain components such as beta-glucan and proteins may have exposed the RS1 and RS2, that initially escaped hydrolysis to alpha-amylase. 3awater content 3abarley 3acultivars 3aseeds 3apretreatment 3aflour 3awater activity 3aextrusion 3atemperature 3acooking quality 3aenzymatic treatment 3alicheninase 3abeta-glucosidase 3aproteinases 3aalpha-amylase 3arefrigeration 3adrying 3aovens 3adrying quality 3abarley starch 3aresistant starch 3aproximate composition 0aregular pearled barley flour 0awaxy pearled barley flour1 aVasanthan, T.1 aHoover, R.0 tFood research international.g2004, v. 37, no. 5 p.517-525x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/07/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03345naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245014900175300002000324500002400344520105700368650002001425650001001445650001701455650002101472650002401493650001701517650001001534650002001544650001001564650001701574650002101591650002401612650001301636650002101649650001401670650000901684650000901693650001001702650002501712650001201737650002801749650002101777650003001798650006101828650005001889650002001939650003301959650001101992650001102003650007302014650000902087650008302096650003902179650000902218650002502227650003502252700001802287700001602305700002002321700002102341700002202362700002302384773011802407852000902525856007702534655001202611IND4459634020221120210838.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963402DNAL7 a214662232pmid7 a10.1021/jf104786t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Chung-Ping10aQuercetin and Rutin Reduced the Bioavailability of Cyclosporine from Neoral, an Immunosuppressant, through Activating P-Glycoprotein and CYP 3A4  ap. 4644–4648.  aIncludes references  aQuercetin and rutin are popular flavonoids in plant foods, herbs, and dietary supplements. Cyclosporine (CSP), an immunosuppressant with a narrow therapeutic window, is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This study investigated the effects of quercetin and rutin on CSP pharmacokinetics from Neoral and relevant mechanisms. Rats were orally administered Neoral with and without quercetin or rutin. The blood CSP concentration was assayed by a specific monoclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The results showed that quercetin and rutin significantly decreased the Cmax of CSP by 67.8 and 63.2% and reduced the AUC0−540 by 43.3 and 57.2%, respectively. The in vitro studies indicated that the quercetin and rutin induced the functions of P-gp and CYP3A4. In conclusion, quercetin and rutin decreased the bioavailability of CSP through activating P-gp and CYP3A. Transplant patients treated with Neoral should avoid concurrent consumption of quercetin or rutin to minimize the risk of allograft rejection. 3abioavailability 3ablood 3acyclosporine 3acytochrome P-450 3adietary supplements 3afluorescence 3afoods 3agraft rejection 3aherbs 3aimmunoassays 3ain vitro studies 3aoral administration 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3aquercetin 3arats 3arisk 3arutin 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChemistry, Pharmaceutical 2aCyclosporinexadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP3Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Antagonism 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinical 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aQuercetinxadministration & dosage 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRutinxadministration & dosage1 aWu, Ping-Ping1 aHou, Yu-Chi1 aLin, Shiuan-Pey1 aTsai, Shang-Yuan1 aChen, Chiung-Tong1 aChao, Pei-Dawn Lee0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4644–4648-4644–4648x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104786t3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02640naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245013200174300002000306500002400326520101400350650001601364650002401380650002001404650001701424650002301441650002101464650002001485650001001505650001301515650002101528650001501549650002601564650006301590650006901653650003801722650001301760650003401773650005301807650002501860700002101885700001501906700002101921773011801942852000902060856007702069655001202146IND4459633920221120210833.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963392DNAL7 a215041622pmid7 a10.1021/jf200259n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Pin-Hui10aFunctional Expression of Geraniol 10-Hydroxylase Reveals Its Dual Function in the Biosynthesis of Terpenoid and Phenylpropanoid  ap. 4637–4643.  aIncludes references  aGeraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, has been reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids. The gene for Catharanthus roseus G10H (CrG10H) was cloned and heterologously expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. A number of substrates were subjected to assay the enzyme activity of CrG10H. As reported in a previous study, CrG10H hydroxylated the monoterpenoid geraniol at the C-10 position to generate 10-hydroxygeraniol. Interestingly, CrG10H also catalyzed 3′-hydroxylation of naringenin to produce eriodictyol. Coexpression of an Arabidopsis NADPH P450 reductase substantially increased the ability of CrG10H to hydroxylate naringenin. The catalytic activity of CrG10H was approximately 10 times more efficient with geraniol than with naringenin, judged by the k(cat)/K(m) values. Thus, G10H also plays an important role in the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids, in addition to its previously described role in the metabolism of terpenoids. 3aArabidopsis 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ageraniol 3aindole alkaloids 3anaringenin 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aCatharanthusxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aKinetics 2aPhenylpropionatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTerpenesxmetabolism1 aHuang, Fong-Chin1 aDo, Yi-Yin1 aHuang, Pung-Ling0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4637–4643-4637–4643x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200259n3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04469naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245010900175300002000284500002400304520266600328650001602994650001203010650002803022650001103050650001703061650002903078650002103107650001803128650002503146650001303171650001803184650001503202650002403217650002103241650002003262650001403282650004603296650002403342650001303366650004603379650001103425650001503436650002303451650002403474650003503498700002003533700001703553700001703570700002703587700002403614700002503638773011803663852000903781856007703790655001203867IND4459635720221120211015.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963572DNAL7 a214629322pmid7 a10.1021/jf200054e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsare, Eric K.10aBarley Grain Constituents, Starch Composition, and Structure Affect Starch in Vitro Enzymatic Hydrolysis  ap. 4743–4754.  aIncludes references  aThe relationship between starch physical properties and enzymatic hydrolysis was determined using ten different hulless barley genotypes with variable carbohydrate composition. The ten barley genotypes included one normal starch (CDC McGwire), three increased amylose starches (SH99250, SH99073, and SB94893), and six waxy starches (CDC Alamo, CDC Fibar, CDC Candle, Waxy Betzes, CDC Rattan, and SB94912). Total starch concentration positively influenced thousand grain weight (TGW) (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.05). Increase in grain protein concentration was not only related to total starch concentration (r2 = −0.80, p < 0.01) but also affected enzymatic hydrolysis of pure starch (r2 = −0.67, p < 0.01). However, an increase in amylopectin unit chain length between DP 12–18 (F-II) was detrimental to starch concentration (r2 = 0.46, p < 0.01). Amylose concentration influenced granule size distribution with increased amylose genotypes showing highly reduced volume percentage of very small C-granules (<5 μm diameter) and significantly increased (r2 = 0.83, p < 0.01) medium sized B granules (5–15 μm diameter). Amylose affected smaller (F-I) and larger (F-III) amylopectin chains in opposite ways. Increased amylose concentration positively influenced the F-III (DP 19–36) fraction of longer DP amylopectin chains (DP 19–36) which was associated with resistant starch (RS) in meal and pure starch samples. The rate of starch hydrolysis was high in pure starch samples as compared to meal samples. Enzymatic hydrolysis rate both in meal and pure starch samples followed the order waxy > normal > increased amylose. Rapidly digestible starch (RDS) increased with a decrease in amylose concentration. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed a higher polydispersity index of amylose in CDC McGwire and increased amylose genotypes which could contribute to their reduced enzymatic hydrolysis, compared to waxy starch genotypes. Increased β-glucan and dietary fiber concentration also reduced the enzymatic hydrolysis of meal samples. An average linkage cluster analysis dendrogram revealed that variation in amylose concentration significantly (p < 0.01) influenced resistant starch concentration in meal and pure starch samples. RS is also associated with B-type granules (5–15 μm) and the amylopectin F-III (19–36 DP) fraction. In conclusion, the results suggest that barley genotype SH99250 with less decrease in grain weight in comparison to that of other increased amylose genotypes (SH99073 and SH94893) could be a promising genotype to develop cultivars with increased amylose grain starch without compromising grain weight and yield. 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aatomic force microscopy 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acarbohydrate composition 3acluster analysis 3adietary fiber 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenotype 3agrain protein 3ahydrolysis 3aphysical properties 3aresistant starch 3astarch granules 2aDigestion 2aDigestive Systemxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Structure 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aJaiswal, Sarita1 aMaley, Jason1 aBaga, Monica1 aSammynaiken, Ramaswami1 aRossnagel, Brian G.1 aChibbar, Ravindra N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4743–4754-4743–4754x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200054e3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02719naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001500195245012800210300001600338520119100354650001101545650002001556650002101576650002201597650001901619650001501638650001301653650001201666650001901678650002501697650002701722650001701749650001801766650001501784650002501799650001801824650002001842650002101862651001101883700001901894700001801913700001801931700001801949700001901967773008901986852000902075930003302084945002502117946001102142655001202153IND4380059620141222000000.0060508e20051230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438005962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLana, R.P.10aApplication of Lineweaver-Burk data transformation to explain animal and plant performance as a function of nutrient supply  ap. 219-224.  aThis study evaluates the effect of dry-season concentrate supplementation on growing cattle performance grazing tropical pasture and the impact of nitrogen fertilization on the growth rate of tropical pasture (tons of dry herbage mass/ha/110 days) and on the subsequent stocking rate and cattle performance during the rainy season (kg body weight gain/ha/110 days). The animal and plant responses were curvilinear to the increasing amount of nutrient supply and followed the typical saturation kinetics of enzyme systems, a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The Lineweaver-Burk data transformation explained efficiently the animal and plant responses to the nutrient supply. This methodology consists in evaluating the linear regressions of the reciprocal of animal and plant responses as a function of the reciprocal of nutrient supply. The half maximum growth rates for plant and animal to nutrient supply were verified with the proportions from .048 to .056 of the amount needed to cause .95 of theoretical maximum responses. From the curvilinear response, it can be verified that the marginal increase in animal and plant growth rate reduces as the amount of nutrient supply increases. 3acattle 3aliveweight gain 3afeed supplements 3afeed concentrates 3acattle feeding 3adry season 3apastures 3agrazing 3apasture plants 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aplant growth 3astocking rate 3awet season 3anutrient utilization 3aanimal growth 3aplant nutrition 3aanimal nutrition 3aBrazil1 aGoes, R.H.T.B.1 aMoreira, L.M.1 aMâncio, A.B.1 aFonseca, D.M.1 aTedeschi, L.O.0 tLivestock production science.g2005 Dec. 30, v. 98, no. 3 p.219-224x0301-62267nnas  aDNAL  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002500156245010700181300001800288500002400306520154300330650001901873650003001892650001401922650001501936650000901951650001601960650001601976650001101992650001202003650005102015650002602066650004302092650002802135650002902163650002402192651001202216651001202228700002602240700001902266700001702285700002302302700002502325773010402350852000902454856007702463655001202540IND4459274220221120191724.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927422DNAL7 a212992382pmid7 a10.1021/jf103282g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoucke, Christof Van10aInvestigation into the Possible Natural Occurence of Semicarbazide in Macrobrachium rosenbergii Prawns  ap. 2107-2112.  aIncludes references  aIn the past year there has been an increased incidence in Belgium of cases of positive semicarbazide (SEM) tests in imported freshwater Macrobrachium rosenbergii prawns, seemingly indicating the possible abuse of nitrofurazone, a banned antimicrobial agent. This was in contrast to all other European countries where no significant increase in SEM-positive samples was detected. A possible explanation for this discrepancy between Belgium and the other European Union member states could be the fact that only in Belgium were whole prawns (meat + shell) analyzed for the presence of tissue-bound metabolites of nitrofurans, whereas in the other countries only the edible part (meat) of these prawns was analyzed. To investigate the possible natural occurrence of SEM in freshwater prawns, an animal trial was set up. In this experiment two groups of 10 juvenile M. rosenbergii, previously raised under standardized laboratory conditions, were stocked into two separate aquaria, a control group under reference conditions (no addition of nitrofurazone) and a group exposed to a daily dose of 50 mg of nitrofurazone L−1 of culture water. Results of this animal trial proved that SEM naturally occurs in M. rosenbergii prawns but that at the current minimum required performance limit (MRPL) no tissue-bound SEM can be found in the meat of nontreated animals. In addition to this animal trial, commercial samples of other crustacean species, the shell and meat of which were analyzed separately, were also analyzed for the presence of SEM. 3aEuropean Union 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3aaquariums 3afreshwater 3ameat 3ametabolites 3anitrofurans 3ashrimp 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aNitrofurazonexadministration & dosage 2aPalaemonidaexchemistry 2aSemicarbazidesxanalysis 2aShellfishxanalysis 3aBelgium 0aBelgium1 aDetavernier, Christ'l1 aWille, Mathieu1 aKwakman, Jan1 aSorgeloos, Patrick1 aPeteghem, Carlos Van0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 59, no. 5 p.2107-2112x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103282g3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03081naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001600219500019300235500002400428520162400452650002002076650002602096650002302122650001102145650000902156650001602165650001302181650001102194650001302205650001002218650001402228650002202242650002102264650001002285650001302295650001402308651001102322700001602333700002002349700001702369773014102386852000902527856008702536655001202623IND4463086820221120172159.0120426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446308682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolizzi, G.10aEffects of innovative films in soil solarization for the control of soil-borne pathogens  ap. 805-811.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 2, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aThe effectiveness of soil solarization during autumn was evaluated in Sicily (36°48’N, 14°36’E) in a multi-span tunnel greenhouse through the survival of two soil-borne pathogens Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and Cylindrocladium pauciramosum. The greenhouse was covered with a 130-μm thick ethlylene vynilacetate film (EVA) and with a 60 μm-tick ethlylene tetrafluoroethlylene film (ETFE). Nylon mesh bags containing carnation leaves and basal tomato stems infested respectively with C. pauciramosum and FORL were buried 15 and 30 cm deep. Soil solarization was performed during a 30-day period using a 30 μm-thick clear EVA film. Under the ETFE cover a plot mulched with a 35 μm-thick green coextruded film was also used. ETFE cover allowed to keep maximum soil temperature over 40 °C at 15 cm depth in the plot mulched with the EVA film for most of the period considered. The green coextruded film though inducing a lower thermal regime than the EVA film allowed to provide a good reduction of viability of pathogens. Inoculum recovery of FORL was strongly decreased in tomato stem buried in the mulched plots inside the greenhouse covered with the ETFE film after 15 days. C. pauciramosum was not recovered from carnation leaves in solarized plots sampled of both greenhouses covered with ETFE and EVA film. In contrast, inoculum recovery of C. pauciramosum ranged from 26.5 to 50.5 % for samples of unsolarized plots. Solarization using ETFE as cover in closed greenhouses also in autumn could provide a good management for several important soil-borne pathogens in eastern Sicily. 3aCylindrocladium 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aautumn 3abags 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3aleaves 3amulching 3anylon 3apathogens 3asoil solarization 3asoil temperature 3astems 3atomatoes 3aviability 3aSicily1 aLa Rosa, R.1 aArcidiacono, C.1 aD'Emilio, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.805-811dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_118.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01822naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012600129300001600255520094300271650003101214650003101245650000801276650001001284650003001294650001301324700001601337700001801353773009401371852000901465939003301474946001301507655001201520IND9203492320221120172012.0920601e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920349232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckenbach, K.10aTaxonomic affinities and intra-interspecific variation in Bursaphelenchus spp. as determined by polymerase chain reaction  ap. 140-147.  aIdentification of closely related nematode species or races can be very difficult when diagnostic characters are plastic and overlapping. In this study we describe the use of polymerase chain reaction technology and direct DNA sequencing on 19 populations of Bursaphelenchus spp. to help understand their taxonomic relationships. The 5' end of the heat shock 70A gene from Caenorhabditis elegans was used as the target DNA sequence because it contains both coding and noncoding regions. The results indicate that the 19 populations could be divided into five types within B. xylophilus and four types within B. mucronatus. On a larger scale, the data revealed three distinct groups, representing B. xylophilus from North America and Japan, B. mucronatus from Japan, and "B. mucronatus" from Europe. There is sufficient difference between the European and Japanese "B. mucronatus" groups to warrant their consideration as separate species. 3aBursaphelenchus mucronatus 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aDNA 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ataxonomy1 aSmith, M.J.1 aWebster, J.M.0 tJournal of nematology.g1992 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.140-147wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03454naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009500125300001600220500019300236500002400429520194300453650001002396650001202406650001102418650001002429650002802439650001302467650001102480650001202491650001602503650000902519650000902528650001402537650001302551650000702564650001502571650001402586650001302600650001002613650001702623650001202640650001102652650002302663650000902686700001602695773014102711852000902852856008702861655001202948IND4463084020221120172139.0120426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446308402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso, G.10aEffect of nutritive solution EC and shading on the "fruit" quality of NFT-grown strawberry  ap. 719-726.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 2, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aWe report the results of research carried out in Campania in 1995/96 and 1996/97 with the aim of investigating the “fruit” quality of strawberry grown with the NFT. Comparisons were made of eight electrical conductivity (EC)-levels (1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 mS·cm-1) of the nutritive solutions, in factorial combination with crops arranged in pairs on double vertical layers; a control crop was managed traditionally. All the parameters attained the highest values with the upper crop layer, except for nitrates and pH which did not vary in relation to the plant position. Among the EC treatments, the dry and optical residues, together with the sugars and the titratable acidity, showed an increasing trend from 1.0 to 2.4 mS·cm-1; among the acids, citric and succinic increased very gradually, while malic did not change. All the analysed macronutrients attained increasing “fruit” concentrations up to the 2.4 mS·cm-1 treatment, whereas micronutrient contents were generally highest within the range 1.8-2.4 mS·cm-1. Dry and optical residues and sucrose values recorded with hydroponics in the upper level were significatively higher than those found in the control “fruits”, whose contents of glucose and fructose were lower referring to the highest salinity levels; by contrast, the acids were more highly concentrated in the control berries. Nitrates, calcium, magnesium, chloride, iron, copper and zinc accumulated in larger amounts in the “fruits” obtained with the traditional technique, whereas the control contents of phosphorus, potassium and sulphur were intermediate with respect to the 1.0-2.4 mS·cm-1 EC range. Compared to the lower crop layer, the values of dry and optical residues and sugars of the control “fruits” generally fell in the middle of the levels obtained with the tested EC range. The contents of acids and mineral ions were often highest in the control “fruits”. 3aacids 3acalcium 3acopper 3acrops 3aelectrical conductivity 3afructose 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahydroponics 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asalinity 3ashade 3astrawberries 3asucrose 3asulfur 3atitratable acidity 3azinc1 aVillari, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.719-726dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_107.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02332naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100002000151245006900171300001400240520141700254650002501671650000801696650004501704650001101749651001901760653001901779700001601798700001601814700001701830773009201847852000901939939003301948946001301981655001201994IND9203490520221120172122.0920601e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920349052DNAL7 a192831972pmid7 aPMC26192422pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, A.S.10aGenomic RFLP analysis of Meloidogyne arenaria race 2 populations  ap. 23-28.  aTraditional morphological methods of Meloidogyne identification have been unsuccessful in distinguishing three South Carolina, USA Meloidogyne arenaria race 2 populations--Govan, Pelion, and Florence. These populations differ greatly in reproductive rate and aggressiveness on soybean hosts. Total genomic DNA from eggs of each population was digested with the restriction endonuclease Eco RI and Southern hybridization analyses were performed with single-copy and interspersed multi-copy cloned probes. Probes were isolated from a genomic library of Eco RI, M. arenaria DNA fragments cloned into pUC8. One probe, designated pE1.6A, when hybridized to Southern blots of M. arenaria genomic DNAs, displayed an interspersed repetitive pattern, and the RFLPs distinguished the Govan population from the Pelion and Florence populations. Another clone, pE6.0A, carrying moderately repeated sequences, distinguished the Pelion and Florence isolates. This communication demonstrates the utility of genomic RFLP analysis for distinguishing populations of the same race within the same species. To test the possible utility of these moderately repeated sequence probes for detecting the presence of nematode DNA in DNA samples from roots inoculated with varying numbers of nematodes, dot blot hybridization analyses were performed. It is possible to detect as few as 30 nematodes per root sample with these cloned probes. 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3aDNA 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenome 3aSouth Carolina 0aidentification1 aHiatt, E.E.1 aLewis, S.A.1 aAbbott, A.G.0 tJournal of nematology.g1992 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.23-28wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02057naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008100124300001600205500019300221500002400414500001500438520081300453650001301266650002101279650002801300650001801328650001301346650002501359650001501384650000701399650001701406653001901423700001601442773014101458852000901599856008701608655001201695IND4463085220221120172105.0120426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446308522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLao, M.T.10aEffect of soil solution salinity on the quantity and quality of tomato yield  ap. 741-747.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 2, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis work studies the effect of salinity on the tomato crop var.

In this trial there were no significant differences in total production, although there was a modification in the fruit diameter, which decreased with the highest saline treatment. The qualitative parameters considered here were the firmness of the fruit and those measured in the fresh juice of the tomato: E C, soluble solids content and pH. Salinity increased the firmness of the fruit, the E C and the soluble solids.

Dual applications of nematode inoculum (at planting and 6 weeks later) were superior to single applications (at planting or 6 weeks after planting). Field-site infestation levels at the end of the first year were related to the amount of inoculum dispersed and timing of the infestation (P = 0.001).

The negative relationship between the numbers of M. arenaria eggs and juvenile per 500 cm3 soil in the fall and the percentage of peanut hull galled the second year was described by a quadratic model (P = 0.002, R2 = 0.41). 3aArachis hypogaea 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3aova 3aencapsulation 3apopulation density 3aeconomic threshold 0ainfestation 0acalcium alginate1 aBarker, K.R.0 tJournal of nematology.g1992 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.183-186wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245009900132300001600231500019300247500002400440520105700464650001501521650002701536650001501563650001201578650001401590650002601604650001601630650003001646650001001676650001001686650003101696650001501727650002001742650001601762650001401778650001301792651001001805651001101815700001601826773014101842852000901983856008701992655001202079IND4463087320221120160957.0120426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446308732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTropea Garzia, G.10aNotes on natural enemies of armyworms infesting tomato protected crops in South-Eastern Sicily  ap. 837-841.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 2, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aSpodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) and Chrysodeixis chalcites (Esper) cause serious economic damages on tomato protected crops in South-Eastern Sicily (Italy), due to their peculiar habits and the difficulty of controlling their populations. The role of biocontrol agents of armyworms is mainly carried out by generalist predators and parasitoids, especially during spring-summer. Protection and maintenance of existing natural enemies population in IPM context represent an efficacious strategy to reduce pest incidence. Data on the abundance and behaviour of native antagonists is a first step to reach successful results in IPM strategies. In such a context during field monitoring, five hymenopterous parasitoids have been found in the investigated area, three collected on S. littoralis and two on C. chalcites. Among these, Campoletis annulata Gravenhorst, Hyposoter didymator Thunberg and Copidosoma truncatellum (Dalman), are already known for Sicilian fauna, whereas Meloboris collector Thunberg and Cotesia rufricrus (Haliday) are new records. 3aCampoletis 3aChrysodeixis chalcites 3aCopidosoma 3aCotesia 3aHyposoter 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aantagonists 3abiological control agents 3acrops 3afauna 3aintegrated pest management 3amonitoring 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 3apredators 3atomatoes 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aSiscaro, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.837-841dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_123.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009100125300001800216500001500234520151000249650001401759650001001773650001601783650001201799650003601811650002001847650001901867650001301886650002201899650002001921650001501941650001001956653002301966653001801989700002002007700001802027773011202045852000902157930003302166945001302199946001302212655001202225IND2038965020221120154226.0940421e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203896502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGijzen, M.10aSoybean seed coat peroxidase: a comparison of high-activity and low-activity genotypes  ap. 1061-1066.  a2019-12-05  aPeroxidase activity in the seed coats of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is controlled by the Ep locus. We compared peroxidase activity in cell-free extracts from seed coat, root, and leaf tissues of three EpEp cultivars (Harosoy 63, Harovinton, and Coles) to three epep cultivars (Steele, Marathon, and Raiden). Extracts from the seed coats of EpEp cultivars were 100-fold higher in specific activity than those from epep cultivars, but there was no difference in specific activity in crude root or leaf extracts. Isoelectric focusing of root tissue extracts and staining for peroxidase activity showed that EpEp cultivars had a root peroxidase of identical isoelectric point to the seed coat peroxidase, whereas roots of the epep types were lacking that peroxidase, indicating that the Ep locus may also affect expression in the root. In seed coat extracts, peroxidase was the most abundant soluble protein in EpEp cultivars, whereas this enzyme was present only in trace amounts in epep genotypes, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Histochemical localization of peroxidase activity in seed coats of EpEp cultivars shows that the enzyme occurs predominately in the cytoplasm of hourglass cells of the subepidermis. No obvious difference in the gross or microscopic structure of the seed coat was observed to be associated with the Ep locus. These results suggest that soybean seed coat peroxidase may be involved in processes other than seed coat biosynthesis. 3acultivars 3atesta 3aGlycine max 3aalleles 3achemical constituents of plants 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 3aroots 0agenetic regulation 0aplant anatomy1 aVan Huystee, R.1 aBuzzell, R.I.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1061-1066aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02749naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011500166300001800281520078600299650002501085650002201110650001201132650001201144650001401156650001801170650001601188650001001204650001201214650002001226650002201246650001801268650002501286650002501311650001401336650002401350650002601374650001801400650002301418650003301441650002001474650002001494650001701514650002801531650002201559650001401581650002901595650003301624650001801657650003101675650006601706650003601772653002301808653002801831700001701859700001901876773011201895852000902007930003302016945001302049946001302062655001202075IND2038963920221120154245.0940421e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203896392DNAL7 a75072552pmid7 aPMC1590872pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempin, S.A.10aConversion of perianth into reproductive organs by ectopic expression of the tobacco floral homeotic gene NAG1  ap. 1041-1046.  aMutations in the AGAMOUS (AG) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana result in the conversion of reproductive organs, stamens and carpels, into perianth organs, sepals and petals. We have isolated and characterized the putative AG gene from Nicotiana tabacum, NAG1, whose deduced protein product shares 73% identical amino acid residues with the Arabidopsis AG gene product. RNA tissue in situ hybridizations show that NAG1 RNA accumulates early in tobacco flower development in the region of the floral meristem that will later give rise to stamens and carpels. Ectopic expression of NAG1 in transgenic tobacco plants results in a conversion of sepals and petals into carpels and stamens, respectively, indicating that NAG1 is sufficient to convert perianth into reproductive floral organs. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amutants 3astamens 3agynoecium 3amorphogenesis 3amutagenesis 3acalyx 3acorolla 3agene expression 3atransgenic plants 3agene transfer 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aphenotype 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aMandel, M.A.1 aYanofsky, M.F.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1041-1046aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01870naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009400164300001600258520073200274650001601006650001101022650002501033650001601058650001101074650001401085700002201099700002001121700002101141700001801162700002301180700002501203773012801228852000901356856008501365930003301450946001301483655001201496IND4425390220221120143925.0090829e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442539022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-009-9213-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPouyani, Tara 13aDe novo synthesis of human dermis in vitro in the absence of a three-dimensional scaffold  ap. 430-441.  aNeonatal human dermal fibroblasts cultured in vitro synthesize an organized and physically substantial three-dimensional extracellular matrix, without the addition of exogenous matrix components or synthetic scaffolds.

Elevated [CO2] allows high CO2 assimilation rates by this enzyme and prevents Rubisco oxygenase activity and O2 inhibition of carboxylation. Bundle sheath conductance to CO2 was estimated by chemically inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and calculating the slope of the linear response of leaf CO2 uptake to [CO2]. The inhibitor 3,3-dichloro-2-dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl-2-propenoate was supplied to detached leaves of Panicum maximum, Panicum miliaceum, and Sorghum bicolor at 4 mM. Uptake of CO2 was measured at 210 mL L-1 O2 over the CO2 concentration range of 0.34 to 28 mL L-1. Without the inhibitor, CO2 uptake increased steeply at low [CO2] and saturated at about 1 mL L-1. After inhibition, CO2 uptake was a linear function of [CO2] over much of the range tested. The slope of this CO2 response, taken as bundle sheath conductance, was 2.35, 1.96, and 1.13 mmol m-2 s-1 for P. maximum, P. miliaceum, and S. bicolor, respectively, on a leaf area basis. Conductance based on bundle sheath area was 0.76, 0.93, and 0.54 mmol m-2 s-1, respectively. Uptake of CO2 by leaves of P. maximum supplied with the inhibitor was not affected by reduction of [O2] from 210 to 20 mL L-1 over the range of [CO2] used. Because [CO2] in bundle sheath cells of inhibited leaves is likely to be much lower than ambient, the lack of O2 sensitivity of CO2 uptake cannot be ascribed to lack of O2 reaction with ribulose bisphosphate and is probably due to the low conductance of bundle sheath cells, especially at low ambient [CO2]. The likely result of reducing [O2] from 210 to 20 mL L-1 is to stimulate carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate, thus further reducing [CO2] in bundle sheath cells and increasing CO2 diffusion to these cells from the mesophyll. However, the increase in diffusion is greatly limited by low conductance of the bundle sheath cell walls. Calculations based on estimated bundle sheath conductance show that changes in bundle sheath [CO2] of 0.085 to 0.5 mL L-1, which might be associated with reduced [O2], would have a negligible effect on CO2 uptake. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aGlycine max 3aPanicum miliaceum 3agas exchange 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3anet assimilation rate 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aSorghum bicolor 3aphotosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen 3avascular bundles 0asubstrates 0aelectrical conductance 0aPanicum maximum1 aByrd, G.T.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1183-1188aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03114naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001800221500001500239520176600254650001402020650001102034650003602045650003402081650001102115650001702126650002202143650001102165650001702176650002202193650001902215650002002234650002002254650001602274653001602290653001702306653001502323653003602338653001502374653001102389700002002400700002002420773011202440852000902552930003302561945001302594946001302607655001202620IND2038969720221120143921.0940421e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203896972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRundle, S.J.10aEffects of inhibitors of protein serine/threonine phosphatases on pollination in Brassica  ap. 1165-1171.  a2019-12-05  aWe have examined the effect of the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin on pollen-pistil interactions in Brassica. Inhibitor-treated flowers or floral buds were pollinated with untreated pollen and examined for pollen tube growth by fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that type 1 or type 2A serine/threonine phosphatases play a crucial role in the pollination responses of Brassica. We observed two distinct effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors on pollination: (a) the inhibition of pollen tube growth during cross-pollination in flowers, and (b) the breakdown of self-incompatibility or promotion of pollen tube growth during self-pollination in flower buds just prior to anthesis. Thus, treatment of flower pistils with protein phosphatase inhibitors resulted in the inhibition of pollen tube growth at the surface of the papillar cells of the stigma in crosses between different self-incompatible Brassica oleracea strains, in an interspecific cross between oleracea and Brassica campestris, and in self-pollinations of a self-fertile Brassica napus cultivar. With four different self-incompatibility genotypes, treatment of mature flowers with protein phosphatase inhibitors had no effect on self-pollination response. In contrast, treatment of flower buds just prior to the anthesis stage allowed self-pollen tube invasion of papillar cells. However, the magnitude of this effect was genotype dependent, being most pronounced in the S22 genotype. The data support the conclusion that pollinations in Brassica are controlled in part by the presence of phosphorylated proteins in the papillar cells of the stigma, and that the quantity of these proteins or their levels of phosphorylation changes during stigma development. 3athreonine 3aserine 3aphosphoric monoester hydrolases 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aenzyme inhibitors 3astigma 3aokadaic acid 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica napus 3aphosphorylation 3aenzyme activity 3apollination 0amicrocystin 0ainteractions 0aregulation 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris 0ainhibition 0agrowth1 aNasrallah, M.E.1 aNasrallah, J.B.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1165-1171aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle04215naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245013000176300001800306500002400324520248100348650001002829650001402839650001902853650001002872650001402882650002502896650000902921650000902930650001002939650001302949650002302962650001702985650000903002650000703011650001303018650001303031650001403044650001003058650001403068650004203082650001903124650001203143650002903155650001103184650000903195650000903204650002203213650002003235700001603255700001603271700001603287700001503303700001703318700001403335773013803349852000903487856008103496655001203577IND4457354620221120143900.0110429e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445735462DNAL7 a211837122pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-29202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, K.D.10aHead-only followed by cardiac arrest electrical stunning is an effective alternative to head-only electrical stunning in pigs  ap. 1412-1418.  aIncludes references  aMany small slaughter facilities use head-only electrical stunning to render swine unconscious and insensible to pain before slaughter. Head-only electrical stunning is a reversible procedure that is optimally effective for approximately 15 s after stun completion. In many small North American slaughter plants, the authors have observed hoist speeds that are too slow to achieve a short enough stun-to-bleed interval to maintain insensibility through exsanguination. Unlike many European plants, there is no separate high-speed hoist for pigs and exsanguination on the floor is not condoned. As a result, a 2-stage stunning method was proposed where head-only stunning for 3 s was immediately followed by application of the same stunning wand to the cardiac region of the animal for 3 s while lying in lateral recumbancy. A paired-comparison study was conducted on 89 pigs in a small slaughter facility to compare the head-only method applied for 6 s with the head/heart method. The objective was to evaluate signs of return to sensibility, stun-to-bleed time, blood lactate concentration, muscle pH, drip loss, and fresh meat color to validate the head/heart electrical stunning method for small slaughter plants. Incidence of corneal reflex was not different (P > 0.05) between head/heart (93.8%) and head only (85%) stunning. Nose twitching was more common (P < 0.05) in head only (26.5%) than head/heart (5%) stunning. Head/heart stunning eliminated rhythmic breathing, natural blinking, eye tracking to moving objects, and righting reflex, which were all observed in head-only stunned pigs. Eye tracking to moving objects was observed in 40.8% of head-only stunned pigs. Blood lactate was not different (P > 0.05) between stunning methods (head only: 8.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L, head/heart: 7.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L). Stun-to-bleed time did not differ (P > 0.05; head only: 32 ± 1 s, head/heart: 33 ± 1 s). Mean time to loss of heartbeat with the head-only method was 121 ± 5 s. No heartbeat was observed with the head/heart method. Longissimus thoracis pH, color, and drip loss were not different (P > 0.05) between stunning methods. This study determined that the head/heart electrical stunning method reduces the incidence of signs of return to sensibility without significant effects on meat quality, plant operation speed, or blood lactate concentration. In addition, the head/heart method requires no capital investment for plants that are currently using the head-only method. 3ablood 3abreathing 3acardiac arrest 3acolor 3adrip loss 3aelectrical treatment 3aeyes 3ahead 3aheart 3alactates 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3anose 3apH 3araw meat 3areflexes 3aslaughter 3aswine 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethodsxstandards. 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aElectroshockxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMeat 2aSwinexphysiology 2aUnconsciousness1 aBadtram, G.1 aClaus, J.R.1 aGrandin, T.1 aTurpin, S.1 aWeyker, R.E.1 aVoogd, E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1412-1418dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-29203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03102naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003300152245009000185300001800275500002400293520201900317650001502336650002602351650002502377650001102402650002202413650002502435700002702460700001802487700001902505700001802524700002202542700001902564773009302583852000902676856005502685655001202740IND4410349220221120124050.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441034922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16776.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernhardt-Römermann, Markus10aOn the identification of the most suitable traits for plant functional trait analyses  ap. 1533-1541.  aIncludes references  aWithin the past few years plant functional trait analyses have been widely applied to learn more about the processes and patterns of ecosystem development in response to environmental changes. These approaches are based on the assumption that plants with similar ecologically relevant trait attributes respond to environmental changes in comparable ways. Several methods have been described on how to analyse a priori defined trait sets with respect to environment. Irrespective of the statistical methods used to contrast ecosystem responses and environmental conditions, each functional trait approach depends strongly on the initial trait set. In nearly all recent studies on functional trait analysis a test, if a trait is responsible, is applied independently from the core analysis. In the current study we present a method that extracts those traits from a wider set of traits which are optimal for describing the ecosystem response to a given environmental gradient. This was done by the use of iterative three-table ordination techniques with each possible trait combination. We further concentrated on the effect of the inclusion of too many traits in such analyses. As examples the method was applied to three long term studies on abandoned arable fields. The approach was validated by comparing the results with literature-knowledge on arable field succession. Although the trait pre-selection was only based on a statistical procedure, our method was able to identify all relevant processes of ecosystem responses. All three sites show comparable ecosystem responses; the importance of the competitive ability of plants was highlighted. We further demonstrated that the use of too many traits results in an over-fitting of the trait-environment model. The presented method of iterative RLQ-analyses is adequate to identify responding traits to environmental changes: the discovered processes of successional development of abandoned arable fields are consistent with our knowledge from the literature. 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afunctional diversity 3amodels 3aplant competition 3astatistical analysis1 aRömermann, Christine.1 aNuske, Robert1 aParth, Andreas1 aKlotz, Stefan1 aSchmidt, Wolfgang1 aStadler, Jutta0 tOikos.g2008 Oct., v. 117, no. 10 p.1533-1541dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16776.x 7aarticle02907naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001700193245007100210300001800281500002400299506007600323520128100399506003701680650002001717650003201737650002501769650001301794650001801807650001301825650001901838650001401857650001001871650002501881650002901906650008801935650001802023650001802041650003902059650002802098650001402126650002602140700001402166700001802180700001502198773011202213852000902325856005502334655001202389IND4424240120221207112140.0090807e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442424012DNAL7 a196897062pmid7 aPMC27840362pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01927.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yanlin10aGenome sequences of two novel phages infecting marine roseobacters  ap. 2055-2064.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo bacteriophages, DSS3Φ2 and EE36Φ1, which infect marine roseobacters Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 and Sulfitobacter sp. EE-36, respectively, were isolated from Baltimore Inner Harbor water. These two roseophages resemble bacteriophage N4, a large, short-tailed phage infecting Escherichia coli K12, in terms of their morphology and genomic structure. The full genome sequences of DSS3Φ2 and EE36Φ1 reveal that their genome sizes are 74.6 and 73.3 kb, respectively, and they both contain a highly conserved N4-like DNA replication and transcription system. Both roseophages contain a large virion-encapsidated RNA polymerase gene (> 10 kb), which was first discovered in N4. DSS3Φ2 and EE36Φ1 also possess several genes (i.e. ribonucleotide reductase and thioredoxin) that are most similar to the genes in roseobacters. Overall, the two roseophages are highly closely related, and share 80-94% nucleotide sequence identity over 85% of their ORFs. This is the first report of N4-like phages infecting marine bacteria and the second report of N4-like phage since the discovery of phage N4 40 years ago. The finding of these two N4-like roseophages will allow us to further explore the specific phage-host interaction and evolution for this unique group of bacteriophages.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aRuegeria 3aSulfitobacter 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3aevolution 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aribonucleotide reductase 2aBacteriophagesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aBase Sequence 2aGenome, Viral 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRoseobacterxvirology1 aWang, Kui1 aJiao, Nianzhi1 aChen, Feng0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.2055-2064dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01927.x 7aarticle03742naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003000152245009400182300001600276500002400292520216000316650002202476650001702498650001402515650000802529650002302537650001002560650001802570650002402588650002102612650002202633650002102655650001002676650001802686650001302704650004702717650001602764651001102780651001802791653002202809653003002831653002602861700004702887700004902934700002802983700003503011773011403046852000903160856005503169655001203224IND4418537620100715000000.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441853762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01475.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Gil Rodrigues dos10aHost Specificity and Genetic Diversity of Didymella bryoniae from Cucurbitaceae in Brazil  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  aThirty-seven isolates of Didymella bryoniae from three Cucurbitaceae species were collected in Brazil and tested for pathogenicity to watermelon. All isolates were pathogenic but differed in aggressiveness levels. Seven representative isolates were used in cross-pathogenicity tests against 10 cucurbitaceous hosts. Most isolates were pathogenic to most host species tested, except to Sechium edule. Among the susceptible species, Citrullus and Cucumis species were the most susceptible hosts, while pumpkin and Luffa purgans were the most resistant. Host of origin affected the pattern of aggressiveness on each host. Isolates from watermelon were very aggressive to their original host, but much less aggressive or not pathogenic at all to some Cucurbita. Two previously described random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-specific primers indicated that 81% of the isolates could be classified into the so-called RG I group, while the remaining isolates could not be classified into any of the described RG groups. All 37 isolates were further characterized by RAPD fingerprinting and compared with three US isolates representative of RG I and RG II groups. The Brazilian D. bryoniae isolates could be separated into genetically similar clusters. The majority of the isolates were grouped in cluster DB Ia, which contained only isolates of Citrullus lanatus and Cucumis melo. Two of the American isolates used as controls clustered with this group at 68% similarity level. The DB Ib cluster included three Brazilian isolates obtained from melon and watermelon and the American representative for RG II, at a lower similarity level (43%). Two isolates from watermelon clustered with one isolate from melon in a separate group (DB II), while one single isolate from pumpkin (DB III) showed the lowest genetic similarity to all other isolates. Didymella bryoniae isolates from Brazil showed, therefore, a level of genetic diversity higher than previously reported for the species. RAPD fingerprinting allowed for geographical distinction of D. bryoniae isolates but no correlation between genetic distance, aggressiveness or origin of the isolate was found. 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aCucumis melo 3aCucurbita 3aDNA 3aDidymella bryoniae 3aLuffa 3aSechium edule 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3apathogenicity 3apumpkins 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3awatermelons 3aBrazil 3aUnited States 0aAscochyta cucumis 0aMycosphaerella citrullina 0aPhoma cucurbitacearum1 aFerreira, Marisa Álvares da Silva Velloso1 aPessoa-Filho, Marco Aurélio Caldas de Pinho1 aFerreira, Márcio Elias1 aCafé-Filho, Adalberto Corréa0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2009 May, v. 157, no. 5 p.265-273dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01475.x 7aarticle02510naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245010500162300001600267500002400283500001500307520140700322650001101729650001501740650001801755650001601773650002101789650002101810650001501831650000901846650001501855653001601870653001601886700001701902700001401919700002401933773009401957852000902051856005202060655001202112IND4439953120221120104241.0100716e20100728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443995312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming12aA new regionalization approach and its application to predict flow duration curve in ungauged basins  ap. 137-145.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrediction in ungauged basins is an important task for water resources planning and management and remains a fundamental challenge for the hydrological community. Regionalization is typically used to estimate parameter values of hydrological predictive tools for catchments without observed streamflow. This study proposes a new regionalization method, called the index model. The index model establishes a nonparametric relationship between each parameter of predictive tools and a linear combination of predicators. This method is able to describe a wide range of functions, linear or nonlinear, and avoids the potential misspecification which usually occurs as a result of using the ordinary linear regression. We illustrate the method by predicting flow duration curves at 227 unimpaired catchments in southeast Australia. This study also compares results from regional models based on the linear regression, nearest neighbour and hydrological similarity. The results show that the index model produces the most accurate prediction with highest coefficients of efficiency, followed by the linear regression. In particular, the index model improves the model performance substantially at catchments where the linear regression is a fair to poor fit. The index model was also interpretable and showed that potential evapotranspiration and summary statistics of rainfall are predominant in prediction. 3abasins 3astatistics 3alinear models 3astream flow 3awater management 3amodel validation 3awatersheds 3arain 3aprediction 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aShao, Quanxi1 aZhang, Lu1 aChiew, Francis H.S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 July 28, v. 389, no. 1-2 p.137-145dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.039 7aarticle03376naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245013700184300001400321500002400335520149300359650001801852650002501870650001201895650001601907650001801923650001301941650004301954650001301997650001302010650001502023650001702038650001602055650001602071650004102087650001802128650003102146650002202177650003802199650002602237650002702263700001902290700002202309700002702331700001702358700001802375700002702393700001902420700002102439700002902460700002102489700001802510700002702528700003602555773010202591852000902693856004802702655001202750IND4423667620221120104202.0090724e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442366762DNAL7 a195936622pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-009-9468-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteban, Raquel10aAlternative methods for sampling and preservation of photosynthetic pigments and tocopherols in plant material from remote locations  ap. 77-88.  aIncludes references  aCurrent methods for the study of pigments involve freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at -80°C or lyophilization until HPLC analysis.

Main artefacts were chlorophyll epimerization or phaeophytinization, carotenoid isomerization, altered de-epoxidation index and tocopherol degradation. Among all methods, sample desiccation in silica gel provides robust samples (pigment composition was unaffected by storage time or temperature) and almost unaltered pigment profiles, except for a shift in epoxidation state. Although liquid nitrogen freezing and subsequent lyophilization or freezer storage were preferred, when these facilities are either not available or not suitable for long-distance transport, desiccation with silica gel, passive extraction in acetone and/or storage of fresh samples in water vapour saturated atmospheres enable a complete pigment characterization. Silica gel is advisable for long-term sample conservation. 3aOlea europaea 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aacetone 3achlorophyll 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anitrogen 3apigments 3asilica gel 3astorage time 3atocopherols 3awater vapor 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFreeze Drying 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aPreservation, Biologicalxmethods 2aTocopherolsxanalysis 2aXanthophyllsxanalysis1 aBalaguer, Luis1 aManrique, Esteban1 aRubio de Casas, Rafael1 aOchoa, Raúl1 aFleck, Isabel1 aPintó-Marijuan, Marta1 aCasals, Isidre1 aMorales, Domingo1 aJiménez, María Soledad1 aLorenzo, Roberto1 aArtetxe, Unai1 aBecerril, José María1 aGarcía-Plazaola, José Ignacio0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2009 July, v. 101, no. 1 p.77-88dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-009-9468-5 7aarticle02047naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016800126300001600294520074600310650001801056650001901074650001201093650001801105650001901123650001001142650001701152650002301169650001601192650002401208650001601232650003601248653001401284653001401298653001501312653001501327700001701342700001901359700001601378700001701394773011001411852000901521930003301530945001301563946001301576655001201589IND2039799620221120094532.0940525e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203979962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmart, L.B.10aGenetic manipulation of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

By selecting under light-activated heterotrophic conditions, we have inactivated the psaA-psaB operon encoding the PSI reaction center proteins in cells containing deletions of the three psbA genes. We have also introduced deletions into both copies of psbD in a strain containing a mutation that inactivates psaA (ADK9). These strains, designated D1-/PSI- and D2-/PSI-, may serve as recipient strains for the incorporation of site-directed mutations in either psbA2 or psbD1. The characterization of these cells, which lack both PSI and PSII, is described. 3aCyanobacteria 3aplant breeding 3amutants 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3agenes 3agenetic code 3astrain differences 3amutagenesis 3arestriction mapping 3achlorophyll 3achemical constituents of plants 0adeletions 0aselection 0apsaa genes 0apsba genes1 aBowlby, N.R.1 aAnderson, S.L.1 aSithole, I.1 aMcIntosh, L.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.349-354aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02390naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010900124300001600233500001500249520123800264650002501502650001401527650001401541650001501555650001201570650001101582650001501593650002101608650001001629653001501639653002301654653001501677653002401692700001701716700001201733700001701745700001601762773011001778852000901888930003301897945001301930946001301943655001201956IND2039798320221120094528.0940525e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203979832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChory, J.12aA role of cytokinins in de-etiolation in Arabidopsis. det Mutants have an altered response to cytokinins  ap. 339-347.  a2019-12-05  aWhen grown in the absence of light, Arabidopsis thaliana de-etiolated (det) mutants develop many of the characteristics of light-grown plants, including the development of leaves and chloroplasts, the inhibition of hypocotyl growth elongation, and elevated expression levels of light-regulated genes. We show here that dark-grown wild-type seedlings exhibit similar phenotypic traits if any one of a variety of cytokinins are present in the growth medium. We further show that the striking phenotype of det mutants is unlikely to be caused by different levels of cytokinins in these mutants. The three major Arabidopsis cytokinins, zeatin, zeatin riboside, and isopentenyladenosine, accumulate to similar levels in wild-type seedlings grown in either the light or the dark. There is no consistently different pattern for the levels of these cytokinins in wild-type versus det1 or det2 mutants. However, det1 and det2 have an altered response to cytokinin in a detached leaf senescence assay and in tissue culture experiments. A model is proposed in which light and cytokinins act independently or sequentially through common signal transduction intermediates such as DET1 and DET2 to control the downstream light-regulated responses. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aphenotype 3aseedlings 3acytokinins 3amutants 3aleaves 3aetiolation 3aplant morphology 3alight 0asenescence 0agenetic regulation 0aregulation 0acell ultrastructure1 aReinecke, D.1 aSim, S.1 aWashburn, T.1 aBrenner, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.339-347aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02174naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245012800135300001400263500001500277520084800292650002401140650001801164650003201182650003301214650001801247650001301265650002501278650001001303650001401313650002001327650002001347650001701367650001101384650002301395653002301418653001401441653002101455700001401476700001501490700002301505773010801528852000901636930003301645945001301678946001301691655001201704IND2039235420221120094627.0940504e199401  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203923542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckey-Kaltenbach, H.10aBiochemical plant responses to ozone.

Cross-induction of defensive pathways in parsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) plants  ap. 67-74.  a2019-12-05  aParsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) is known to respond to ultraviolet irradiation by the synthesis of flavone glycosides, whereas fungal or elicitor stress leads to the synthesis of furanocoumarin phytoalexins. We tested how these defensive pathways are affected by a single ozone treatment (200 nL L-1; 10 h). Assays were performed at the levels of transcripts, for enzyme activities, and for secondary products. The most rapid transcript accumulation was maximal at 3 h, whereas flavone glycosides and furanocoumarins were maximally induced at 12 and 24 h, respectively, after the start of ozone treatment. Ozone acted as a cross-inducer because the two distinct pathways were simultaneously induced. These results are consistent with the previously observed ozone induction of fungal and viral defense reactions in tobacco, spruce, and pine. 3ahexosyltransferases 3amessenger RNA 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphytotoxicity 3aflavones 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aozone 3apsoralens 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 3aphytoalexins 3aleaves 3adefense mechanisms 0aflavone glycosides 0acoumarins 0aacyltransferases1 aErnst, D.1 aHeller, W.1 aSandermann, H.

We constructed a cDNA library from brassinosteroid-treated soybean epicotyls and used differential hybridization to isolate a cDNA (pBRU1) corresponding to a transcript whose abundance is increased by brassinosteroid treatment. Sequence analysis of pBRU1 revealed an open reading frame of 283 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 29 amino acids. The sequence had extensive homology (77% identity, 89% similarity) over 114 contiguous amino acids to the meri-5 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (J.I. Medford, J.S. Elmer, H.J. Klee [1991] Plant Cell 3: 359-370), and significant homology (48% identity, 62% similarity) to a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase localized in the cell walls of nasturtium (J. de Silva, C.D. Jarman, D.A. Arrowsmith, M.S. Stronach, S. Chengappa, C. Sidebottom, J.S. Reid [1993] Plant J 3: 701-711). RNase protection studies showed that BRU1 transcript levels are not increased by 1.0 micromolar auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, or gibberellic acid and that BRU1 expression is highest in stem tissue. Findings from studies with run-on transcripts from isolated soybean nuclei most likely indicate that the regulation of BRU1 by brassinosteroids is largely posttranscriptional. The elevated levels of BRU1 transcripts in elongating tissue and the homology with a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase suggest a possible role for the BRU1 protein in brassinosteroid-stimulated elongation. 3aGlycine max 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3abeta-glucanase 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3abrassinosteroids 3aepicotyls 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBrassinosteroids 2aCholestanolsxpharmacology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plantxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSoybeansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxpharmacology 0agenetic regulation 0acloning 0axyloglucan endotransglycosylase 0abru1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l221621 aClouse, S.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Jan., v. 104, no. 1 p.161-170aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02804naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001400163245013400177300001300311520100500324650002601329650002101355650001401376650002101390650001701411650001501428650002001443650001001463650001401473650001601487650001401503650001801517650001301535650001501548650003201563650001801595650002801613650001801641650003001659650001901689650001101708650001101719650003301730650005701763650002601820653001501846653002401861700001901885700001501904700001801919700001801937773007001955852000902025856008502034930003302119945001302152946001302165655001202178IND2164393520221120084126.0981001s1998    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216439352DNAL7 a96822432pmid7 a10.1080/016355898095146722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, X.S.10aGrowth inhibition and cytotoxicity induced by Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate in cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells  ap. 8-17.  aBowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) is a soybean-derived anticarcinogenic protease inhibitor that was shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in our previous studies. To assess the potential of BBI as a sensitizing agent for the chemotherapy of cisplatin-resistant cancers, we evaluated the effects of a soybean concentrate enriched in BBI (known as BBI concentrate or BBIC) on cell growth and clonogenic survival of a human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant sublines, C30 and C200. The presence of BBI and BBIC in the cell culture medium reduced the clonogenic survival of the A2780, C30, and C200 cells in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced cisplatin-induced growth inhibition and/or cytotoxicity. BBIC alone showed greater inhibitory effects on growth in the cisplatin-resistant cell lines. These results suggest that BBI and BBIC could be useful agents for the treatment of cancers, especially with cisplatin, in tumors resistant to this important anticancer agent. 3aproteinase inhibitors 3asoybean products 3acarcinoma 3aovarian diseases 3acytotoxicity 3acell lines 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3asynergism 3acell growth 3amortality 3adose response 3aduration 2aCell Death 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Survival 2aCisplatinxpharmacology 2aCulture Media 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aDrug Synergism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxpathology 2aTrypsin Inhibitor, Bowman-Birk Soybeanxpharmacology 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0ainhibition 0aclonogenic survival1 aHamilton, T.C.1 aWare, J.H.1 aDonahue, J.J.1 aKennedy, A.R.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1998, v. 31, no. 1 p.8-17x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355898095146723Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001900163245006200182300001600244520131100260650000901571650000901580650001401589650001601603650001601619650001301635650002301648650001901671650000801690650001001698650001001708650000901718650002301727650004601750650001101796650004501807650001101852650000901863650001601872650003101888650002101919650003001940650002601970650001601996700002002012700001502032773007302047852000902120856008502129930003302214945001302247946001302260655001202273IND2164360620221120084317.0980929s1998    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216436062DNAL7 a95894332pmid7 a10.1080/016355898095146542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScioscia, K.A.10aAltered serum amino acid profiles in head and neck cancer  ap. 144-147.  aPatients who develop squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) are often malnourished because of poor dietary habits, excessive alcohol consumption, local tumor effects, tumor-induced cachexia, and the effects of various therapies. The composition of the diet may be a risk factor for the development of head and neck cancer as well as tumor progression. This study compares the amino acid profiles in the banked serum of patients with and without SCCHN. In comparison to the control group, patients with SCCHN had significantly decreased preoperative serum levels of alanine (p = 0.006), asparagine (p = 0.002), aspartic acid (p = 0.0001), glycine (p = 0.0002), histidine (p = 0.002), 3-methylhistidine (p = 0.001), ornithine (p = 0.001), phenylalanine (p = 0.002), serine (p = 0.002), taurine (p < 0.0001), and threonine (p = 0.001). Levels of cystine were significantly elevated in the group of cancer patients (p < 0.0001). No significant differences were noted on the basis of T stage, N stage, or nutritional status. Serum levels increased postoperatively for the majority of the amino acids tested. Postoperative histidine levels were associated with tumor recurrence (p = 0.04). Serum amino acid levels may prove to be useful markers of disease status and provide prognostic information. 3ahead 3aneck 3acarcinoma 3ablood serum 3aamino acids 3apatients 3anutritional status 3adisease course 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxbloodxsurgery. 2aFemale 2aHead and Neck Neoplasmsxbloodxsurgery. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Recurrence, Local 2aReference Values 2aSerum Albuminxmetabolism 2aTransferrinxanalysis 2aWeight Loss1 aSnyderman, C.H.1 aWagner, R.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1998, v. 30, no. 2 p.144-147x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355898095146543Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03139naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010100123300001300224520212800237650002202365650001102387650001402398650001202412650002102424650001902445650003002464650001902494650002102513650003702534653001402571700001702585773010702602852000902709930003302718945001302751946001302764655001202777IND2039232320221120084238.0940504e199401  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203923232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, N.10aMonitoring phloem unloading and post-phloem transport by microperfusion of attached wheat grains  ap. 7-16.  aPhloem unloading and post-phloem transport in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains were investigated by perfusing the endosperm cavities of attached grains. Relative unloading ratio (RUR) and the rate of sucrose release into the endosperm cavity (SRR) were calculated, respectively, from 14C import and from sucrose washout from the cavity. RUR and SRR continued at or near in vivo rates over a wide range of cavity sap osmolality (90 to approximately 500 milliosmolal) and sucrose concentration (14-430 mM) and for long times (29 h). These are much greater ranges than have been observed for the endosperm cavity in vivo (230-300 300 milliosmolal, and 40-120 mM, respectively), indicating that neither the cavity sap osmolality nor sucrose concentration are controlling factors for the rate of assimilate import into the cavity. The maintenance of in vivo transport rates over a wide range of conditions strongly implicates the role of transport processes within the maternal tissues of the wheat grain, rather than activities of the embryo or endosperm, in determining the rate of assimilate import into the grain. RUR was decreased by high concentrations of sucrose and sorbitol, but not of mannitol. By plasmolyzing some chalazal cells, sorbitol appeared to block symplastic transport across the crease tissues, but neither sucrose nor mannitol caused plasmolysis in maternal tissues of attached grains. The inhibition of RUR by KCN and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl (CCCP) and the continued import of sucrose into grains against its concentration gradient suggest that solute movement into the endosperm cavity might occur by active membrane transport. However, the evidence is weak, since KCN and CCCP appeared to act primarily on some aspect of symplastic (i.e. nonmembrane) transport. Also, sucrose could move from the endosperm cavity into the maternal tissues (i.e. opposite to the normal direction of sucrose movement), suggesting that transmembrane movement in the nucellus may be a reversible process. Pressure-driven flow into the grain could account for movement against a concentration gradient. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aphloem 3aendosperm 3asucrose 3aactive transport 3acell membranes 3asource-sink relationships 3aosmoregulation 3aosmotic pressure 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 0aperfusion1 aFisher, D.B.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Jan., v. 104, no. 1 p.7-16aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02217naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013600131300001800267520109300285650001801378650001401396650001101410650001701421650003901438650002001477650003001497653002101527653001501548700001401563700001801577700008001595773011201675852000901787930003301796945001301829946001301842655001201855IND2038981920221120084203.0940421e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203898192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Albert L.14aThe regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in pea leaf mitochondria: the effect of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation  ap. 1431-1435.  aThe regulation of the pea (Pisum sativum) leaf mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by respiratory rate and oxidative phosphorylation has been investigated by measuring the respiratory activity, the redox poise of the quinone pool (Q-pool), and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (mtPDC) activity under various metabolic conditions. It was found that, under state 4 conditions, mtPDC activity was unaffected by either the addition of succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, or glycine or the overall respiratory rate and redox poise of the Q-pool but was partially inhibited by NADH due to product inhibition. In the presence of ADP significant inactivation of PDC, which was sensitive to oligomycin, was observed with all substrates, apart from pyruvate, suggesting that inactivation was due to ATP formation. Inactivation of PDC by ADP addition was observed even in the presence of carboxyatractyloside, an inhibitor of the ATP/ADP translocator, suggesting that other mechanisms to facilitate the entry of adenylates, in addition to the adenylate carrier, must exist in plant mitochondria. 3aPisum sativum 3aseedlings 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidative phosphorylation 0arespiration rate 0aregulation1 aGemel, J.1 aRandall, D.D.1 aThe regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in pea leaf mitochondria.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1431-1435aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03098naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015900128300001800287500001500305520176900320650003602089650001402125650002002139650002502159650002002184650002902204650002002233650002302253650001002276650002102286650001402307650002002321653002302341653003402364653002102398700001602419700001802435700001902453773011202472852000902584930003302593945001302626946001302639655001202652IND2038977920221120084235.0940421e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203897792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarpinski, S.10aMolecular responses to photooxidative stress in Pinus sylvestris (L.).

The study was carried out in the field during spring recovery. From mid-April the top shoots of seedlings protruded above the snow and thus were exposed to sunlight, whereas the side shoots were covered with snow until May 4. Needles were sampled from top and side shoots on five different occasions. At the beginning of May the mRNA levels for cytosolic CuZn-Sod were significantly higher in top-shoot needles than in side-shoot needles. Similar results were obtained for chloroplastic CuZn-Sod mRNA. After May 6 we could not detect any significant differences between top- and side-shoot needles for either CuZn-Sod mRNA level. Transcript accumulation for the chloroplastic CuZn-Sod was up to 4-fold higher than for cytosolic CuZn-Sod in both types of shoots. On june 1 minimum transcript levels were observed for both CuZn-SOD isoforms. Protein activity analysis for CuZn-SOD isozymes did not reveal any significant differences between top- and side-shoot needles during the whole period of measurements. The mRNA level for chloroplastic Gor was similar in both types of shoots. However, the total GR activity was significantly higher in top-shoot needles than in side-shoot needles at the beginning of May. The analysis of mRNA accumulation for chloroplastic CuZn-Sod and Gor indicates that transcript levels were at least 5- to 20-fold higher for CuZn-Sod than for chloroplastic Gor. The differential expressions of Sod and Gor genes are discussed in relation to regulation of the enzymic scavenging system during photooxidative stress conditions. 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aseedlings 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aphotoinhibition 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aseasonal variation 3agenes 3aPinus sylvestris 3aoxidation 3aenzyme activity 0agenetic regulation 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0aprotein analysis1 aWingsle, G.1 aKarpinska, B.1 aHallgren, J.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 103, no. 4 p.1385-1391aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02113naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010300165300001400268500001500282520080000297650002101097650002001118650001601138650001001154650003101164650001001195650002101205650001801226650001201244650001501256650001401271650001701285650001801302651001101320653000901331653001401340700001901354700001801373700001601391773007101407852000901478856008501487930003301572945001301605946001301618655001201631IND2164128720221120074137.0980918s1998    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216412872DNAL7 a10.1080/016355898095146382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwasniewska, A.10aDietary factors in women with dysplasic colli uteri associated with human papillomavirus infection  ap. 39-45.  a2019-12-04  aThe studies were carried out in a group of 228 female patients with normal cytological smear and 324 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

A total of 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 240-270 g were fed, for a period of 22 days, one of three experimental diets: a control diet, a diet supplemented with 0.2% cholic acid, or a diet supplemented with 0.2% cholic acid + 2% dietary phytosterols. Two hours before decapitation animals were injected with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg body wt ip). Cell proliferation in the proximal colon was measured using a monoclonal antibody to BrdU. PKC activity in the proximal colonic mucosa was assayed using a myelin basic protein as a substrate. Cell proliferation was significantly increased by 276% with 0.2% cholic acid feeding compared with controls. The presence of 2% phytosterols in the diet abolished the cholic acid-induced hyperplasia. Cholic acid induced a 31% expansion of the proliferative zone. Only the cytosolic PKC was significantly lower in the phytosterol-fed group. Neither the total PKC nor the particulate PKC demonstrated an effect of phytosterols on enzyme activity. In conclusion, we found that dietary supplementation with 2% phytosterol has a significant protective effect on enhanced cell proliferation and that this effect is not mediated through the PKC system. 3aphytosterols 3afood intake 3acholic acid 3aexperimental diets 3abody weight 3acell division 3adietary supplements 3aanimal models 3aintestinal mucosa 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBromodeoxyuridinexmetabolism 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCholic Acid 2aCholic Acidsxpharmacology 2aColonxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aDiet 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMale 2aPhytosterolsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0adiet 0aepithelium1 aHernandez, A.Y.T.1 aFink, C.S.1 aMendel, S.L.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 27, no. 2 p.210-215x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145273Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02944naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014200128300001600270520177100286650001302057650001702070650001602087650002202103650002402125650001402149650001302163650001102176650001302187650001402200650001702214650002602231650002202257650001702279653001502296653001502311700001802326773011002344852000902454930003302463945001302496946001302509655001202522IND2037431420221120063415.0940222e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203743142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoloney, A.H.12aA model of the regulation of nitrogenase electron allocation in legume nodules. I. The diffusion barrier and H2 inhibition of N2 fixation  ap. 421-428.  aA mathematical model is presented to explain the regulation of nitrogenase electron allocation to fixation (EAC) in legume nodules. The model is based an two assumptions: (a) that inhibits N2 fixation in a competitive manner; and (b) that and move into and out of nodules by diffusion and their movement is impeded by a diffusion barrier, the permeability of which is controlled to maintain a very low infected cell concentration. When the model was used to simulate nodules displaying a range of values for total nitrogenase activity (TNA), maximum EAC values were predicted to be between 0.69 and 0.71, and a negative correlation was predicted to exist between EAC and TNA. These predictions were in good agreement with empirically derived values reported in the literature and support the suggestion that H, inhibition of fixation is a major determinant in the regulation of nitrogenase EAC in legume nodules. Two versions of the model were constructed. A closed-pore model assumed that the diffusion barrier consisted of a solid shell of water of variable thickness in the nodule cortex. An open-pore model assumed that a small number of gas-filled intercellular spaces connected the nodule central zone with the root atmosphere and these pores were opened or closed by water to provide variations in the nodule's permeability to gas diffusion. Because of differences in the diffusivity of gases in the gaseous and aqueous phases, the model predicted that, at a given infected cell concentration, an open-pore diffusion barrier would result in less accumulation in the infected cells than a closed-pore diffusion barrier. Therefore, the model may be used to test specific hypotheses about the physical structure of the barrier to gas diffusion in legume nodules. 3aFabaceae 3aroot nodules 3anitrogenase 3anitrogen fixation 3amathematical models 3aequations 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3anitrogen 3adiffusion 3agas exchange 3amembrane permeability 3aelectron transfer 3aion exchange 0ainhibition 0aregulation1 aLayzell, D.B.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 103, no. 2 p.421-428aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02366naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008400124300001600208520123200224650002201456650001301478650001401491650001001505650001101515650001801526650002101544650002201565650000801587650002301595650002301618650001901641650001201660653001501672700001801687700001401705700001601719700001901735773011001754852000901864930003301873945001301906946001301919655001201932IND2037433320221120053410.0940222e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203743332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRygol, J.10aTranspiration induces radial turgor pressure gradients in wheat and maize roots  ap. 493-500.  aPrevious studies have shown both the presence and the absence of radial turgor and osmotic pressure gradients across the cortex of roots. In this work, gradients were sought in the roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays) under conditions in which transpiration flux across the root was varied. This was done by altering the relative humidity above the plant, by excising the root, or by using plants in which the leaves were too young to transpire. Roots of different ages (4-65 d) were studied and radial profiles at different distances from the tip (5-30 mm) were measured. in both species, gradients of turgor and osmotic pressure (increasing inward) were found under transpiring conditions but not when transpiration was inhibited. The presence of radial turgor and osmotic pressure gradients, and the behavior of the gradient when transpiration is interrupted, indicate that active membrane transport or radial solvent drag may play an important role in the distribution of solutes across the root cortex in transpiring plants. Contrary to the conventional view, the flow of water and solutes across the symplastic pathway through the plasmodesmata cannot be inwardly directed under transpiring conditions. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aseedlings 3aroots 3aturgor 3atranspiration 3aosmotic pressure 3arelative humidity 3aage 3anutrient transport 3amembrane potential 3acell membranes 3asolutes 0aregulation1 aPritchard, J.1 aZhu, J.J.1 aTomos, A.D.1 aZimmermann, U.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 103, no. 2 p.493-500aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02736naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245010000180300001600280500001500296520097200311650001601283650001601299650002301315650001601338650001301354650002401367650000901391650001301400650001801413650002201431650001701453650001401470650001001484650001201494650004501506650001701551650001601568650002101584650007601605650000901681650000901690650008201699650003001781650002401811653000901835653001501844653001201859653001101871700001401882773007301896852000901969856008501978930003302063945001302096946001302109655001202122IND2123465520221120041744.0980618s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346552DNAL7 a91219512pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoratkar, R.10aEffect of soya bean saponins on azoxymethane-induced preneoplastic lesions in the colon of mice  ap. 206-209.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of saponins isolated from soya bean flour on the incidence of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) induced by azoxymethane (AOM) in the colonic wall of CF1 mice was investigated. Four weekly injections of AOM, a known colon carcinogen, were administered to mice. One week after the last injection, mice were placed on an AIN-76 diet supplemented with 3% soya bean saponins or continued on the basal AIN-76 diet. Another group of mice was placed on the saponin diet without AOM initiation to observe the effect of saponins on the growth characteristics of mice. Dietary intake of soya saponins significantly reduced the incidence of ACF at the end of 14 weeks (postinitiation). Noninitiated mice maintained on a similar soya bean saponin-supplemented diet did not show any adverse effects on the growth and overall health of the animals. These findings suggest that soya bean saponins can play an important role in inhibiting the incidence of ACF in the colon of mice. 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3aexperimental diets 3abody weight 3asoybeans 3adietary supplements 3amice 3asaponins 3aanimal models 3aintestinal mucosa 3aazoxymethane 3aincidence 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAzoxymethane 2aCarcinogens 2aColonxpathology 2aColonic Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aMice 2aPrecancerous Conditionsxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aSaponinsxtherapeutic use 2aSoybeansxchemistry 0adiet 0aefficiency 0alesions 0agrowth1 aRao, A.V.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 27, no. 2 p.206-209x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145263Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03853naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245012000179300001400299500001500313520178100328650001902109650002002128650001302148650001102161650001802172650001602190650001602206650001802222650002302240650001602263650001902279650001002298650001802308650001202326650001802338650001402356650000902370650001402379650002102393650001202414650001402426650002402440650003202464650000902496650003402505650002502539650003202564650000902596650002902605650002702634650006002661650000902721650001702730650003302747650003002780653001102810653001202821653000902833700002102842700002002863773007102883852000902954856008502963930003303048945001303081946001303094655001203107IND2123599920221120041637.0980624s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212359992DNAL7 a93837822pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppel, M.J.10aEffects of dietary galactooligosaccharide on azaserine-induced acinar pancreatic carcinogenesis in male Wistar rats  ap. 35-41.  a2019-12-04  aIn the present study the effects of dietary galactooligosaccharide (GOS) on dietary fat-promoted pancreatic carcinogenesis in azaserine-treated rats were investigated. The aims of this study were to determine 1) whether GOS acts as an inhibitor of pancreatic carcinogenesis and 2) whether GOS interacts with dietary fat-promoted pancreatic tumor development. Four groups of 39 azaserine-treated rats were maintained on different experimental diets that were formulated as follows: 4.3 wt% fat-8.3 wt% GOS (low fat-low GOS), 3.5 wt% fat-27.4 wt% GOS (low fat-high GOS), 15.5 wt% fat-9.5 wt% GOS (high fat-low GOS), and 14.3 wt% fat-28.6 wt% GOS (high fat-high GOS). Autopsies were performed after 6 months (9 animals/group) and 12 months (30 animals/group). Five rats per group were treated with bromodeoxyuridine before autopsy. Parallel sections of the pancreas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with hematoxylin and a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine and examined by light microscopy. A high fat diet caused a significant decrease, whereas a diet high in GOS caused a significant increase, in absolute and relative weight of the cecum content. A high level of dietary fat caused a highly significant increase in multiplicity and incidence of pancreatic (pre)neoplastic lesions after 6 and 12 months of feeding. A high level of GOS in the diet did not influence the number of atypical acinar cell nodules or the tumor incidence in comparison with controls. Dietary fat and dietary GOS caused a significant increase in cell proliferation in atypical acinar cell nodules after six months. It was concluded that dietary GOS has no modulating effect on pancreatic carcinogenesis in azaserine-treated rats or on the tumor-promoting effect of a high-fat diet. 3acarcinogenesis 3anutrient intake 3apancreas 3aweight 3adose response 3adietary fat 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3aexperimental diets 3abody weight 3aenergy content 3acecum 3acell division 3adigesta 3aanimal models 3aazaserine 3arats 3aincidence 3aoligosaccharides 2aAnimals 2aAzaserine 2aCecumxdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadverse effects 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effects 2aMale 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPancreasxdrug effects 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxdiet therapy. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTrisaccharidesxpharmacology 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0agrowth 0alesions 0adiet1 aWijnands, M.V.W.1 aWoutersen, R.A.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 29, no. 1 p.35-41x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145993Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03459naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245006300179300001600242500001500258520149700273650001801770650001601788650001301804650001101817650002001828650000901848650001001857650002001867650001201887650001701899650002301916650002001939650001801959650000801977650002501985650002302010650002402033650002002057650003402077650000902111650002502120650004702145650001102192650001102203650000902214650001602223650001502239650002202254650001702276650002002293651001902313653003602332653002002368653002802388653000902416700001702425700002102442700001802463700001802481773007302499852000902572856008502581930003302666945001302699946001302712655001202725IND2090636620221120041704.0980522s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209063662DNAL7 a92901162pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusso, M.W.10aPlasma selenium levels and the risk of colorectal adenomas  ap. 125-129.  a2019-12-04  aPrevious research has suggested that selenium may protect against the development of colorectal neoplasia. We examined the potential chemopreventive properties of selenium against colorectal adenomas while controlling for a number of dietary and life-style factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients referred for colonoscopy to University of North Carolina Hospitals. Cases had one or more pathologically confirmed adenomas, and noncases had none. Plasma selenium levels were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman background correction and platform technique. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. The mean plasma selenium concentrations for cases (n = 37) and noncases (n = 36) were 107 and 120 micrograms/l, respectively (p = 0.06). Those in the fourth quartile of plasma selenium level had 0.24 times the risk (95% confidence interval = 0.06-1.04)for colorectal adenomas of those in the first quartile. The adjusted odds ratio for colorectal adenomas was 0.58 (95% confidence interval = 0.31-1.08) for a 30 micrograms/l increase in plasma selenium level. Lower plasma selenium levels were associated with multiple adenomas but not with adenoma size or location. These data support a protective effect of selenium against colorectal adenomas after adjustment for possible confounders. Selenium might be a potentially useful chemopreventive agent for colorectal neoplasia. 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3aselenium 3aBlacks 3anutrient intake 3arisk 3awomen 3asmoking (habit) 3aadenoma 3ablood plasma 3afamilial incidence 3adietary surveys 3adietary fiber 3amen 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agender differences 3aalcoholic beverages 3adisease surveys 2aAdenomaxprevention & control 2aAged 2aCase-Control Studies 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxprevention & control 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdds Ratio 2aPatient Selection 2aRisk Factors 2aSeleniumxblood 3aNorth Carolina 0anationalities and ethnic groups 0aage differences 0aepidemiological studies 0adiet1 aMurray, S.C.1 aWurzelmann, J.I.1 aWoosley, J.T.1 aSandler, R.S.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 28, no. 2 p.125-129x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145633Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04065naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245011400179300001600293500001500309520162700324650001901951650002001970650001001990650001402000650001202014650001202026650002302038650001002061650002502071650002802096650001502124650001802139650002202157650000902179650001702188650001402205650002002219650001902239650001002258650004402268650001202312650001702324650004302341650001602384650002102400650001902421650006602440650006302506650003602569650005502605650002902660650005702689650000902746650002602755650000902781650002202790653001402812653001202826653000902838700001502847700001702862700001602879700002302895700001302918700001802931700001502949700001802964700001502982773007302997852000903070856008503079930003303164945001303197946001303210655001203223IND2090638420221120041753.0980522s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209063842DNAL7 a92901202pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaderni, G.10aModification of azoxymethane intestinal carcinogenesis in rats by feeding sucrose boluses, pasta, and glucose  ap. 146-152.  a2019-12-04  aWe studied whether repeated boluses of sucrose or diets containing carbohydrates with a variable glycemic index (GI) affect intestinal carcinogenesis in rats. Male F344 rats were treated twice (1 wk apart) with 15 mg/kg sc azoxymethane (AOM) and then divided into four experimental dietary groups with different carbohydrate composition and administration schedules: the sucrose group was fed 44% (wt/wt) sucrose (GI = 65), the bolus group was fed sucrose as carbohydrate and 43 boluses of sucrose (10-15 g/kg) at various time intervals, the pasta group was fed pasta 177% (wt/wt) cooked pasta, GI = 55], and the glucose group was fed 44% (wt/wt) glucose (GI = 97). All nutrients, including carbohydrates, were provided in similar amount to the different groups. The experiment was terminated between Day 230 and Day 245 after AOM administration. At this time the pasta group had significantly higher cecal short-chain fatty acids than the other groups. Intestinal adenomas and cancers occurred with the same frequency in the bolus, sucrose, and glucose groups. On the contrary, we observed a significant decrease (p = 0.03) in the cumulative incidence of intestinal adenomas, but not adenocarcinomas, in the pasta group compared with the sucrose group (intestinal adenoma incidence in the pasta group was 31% compared with 63% in the sucrose group, 46% in the bolus group, and 37% in the glucose group). In conclusion, these results do not support the hypothesis that sucrose boluses or carbohydrates with a high GI stimulate colon carcinogenesis, but they indicate that foods such as pasta may exert a protective effect. 3acarcinogenesis 3anutrient intake 3apasta 3aneoplasms 3aglucose 3asucrose 3aexperimental diets 3acecum 3adietary carbohydrate 3ashort chain fatty acids 3adimensions 3aanimal models 3aintestinal mucosa 3arats 3aazoxymethane 3aincidence 3asmall intestine 3adisease course 3acolon 2aAdenomaxchemically inducedxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aAzoxymethane 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCarcinogens 2aCecumxchemistry 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aGlucosexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aInjections, Subcutaneous 2aIntestinal Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxpathology. 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 0adysplasia 0aboluses 0adiet1 aLuceri, C.1 aLancioni, L.1 aBiggeri, A.1 aGiannini, Adriana.1 aFazi, M.1 aBrighenti, F.1 aCresci, A.1 aOrpianesi, C.1 aDolara, P.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 28, no. 2 p.146-152x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145673Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03155naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245010600181300001600287500001500303520103100318650001401349650001801363650002901381650001301410650001601423650001701439650000801456650001101464650001901475650001401494650001701508650001801525650002201543650001501565650001401580650004101594650004201635650004501677650004701722650002901769650004701798650003701845650001901882650001101901650001101912650005801923650002201981650003502003650002602038650001202064650002602076653001302102653001502115653001402130700001702144700001102161700001902172700001602191773007302207852000902280856008502289930003302374945001302407946001302420655001202433IND2090638720221120035942.0980522s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209063872DNAL7 a92901212pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSignounas, G.10aS-allylmercaptocysteine, a stable thioallyl compound, induces apoptosis in erythroleukemia cell lines  ap. 153-159.  a2019-12-04  aThe antiproliferative potential of S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), a stable organosulfur compound of aged garlic extract, has been investigated using two erythroleukemia cell lines, HEL and OCIM-1. It induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth with a 50% lethal dose of 0.046 mM for OCIM-1 cells and 0.093 mM for HEL cells. [3H]thymidine incorporation was reduced in cells treated with this thioallyl compound, and analysis of high-molecular-weight DNA showed fragmentation compatible with apoptosis. Flow cytometric analyses of DNA revealed an abnormal cell cycle progression in both types of erythroleukemia cells, with the major portion of the unsynchronized cells in the G2/M phase. Measurement of acid-soluble free sulfhydryl groups showed an initial increase in response to SAMC followed by a progressive dose-dependent decrease with extended incubation of cells. We conclude from these studies that SAMC is an effective antiproliferative agent against erythroleukemia cells that induces cell death by apoptosis. 3aviability 3adose response 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aleukemia 3acell growth 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA 3agarlic 3aplant extracts 3athymidine 3aerythrocytes 3acell division 3asulfhydryl groups 3acell lines 3aapoptosis 2aApoptosisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Divisionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCysteinexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aDNAxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA Fragmentationxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGarlic 2aHumans 2aLeukemia, Erythroblastic, Acutexgeneticsxpathology. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxanalysis 2aThymidinexmetabolism 2aTritium 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0abreakage 0acell cycle 0aresponses1 aHooker, J.L.1 aLi, W.1 aAnagnostou, A.1 aSteiner, M.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 28, no. 2 p.153-159x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145683Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02774naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100002400163245011600187300001400303500001500317520102500332650002101357650001801378650001601396650001401412650002301426650001401449650001801463650002701481650002401508650000901532650001201541650007101553650004601624650001401670650005901684650000901743650002201752650006701774650000901841650002501850650005801875653000901933653001301942653001101955700001801966773007101984852000902055856008502064930003302149945001302182946001302195655001202208IND2063104320221117175647.0980414s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206310432DNAL7 a92001492pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollard, M.q(Mary)10aInfluence of isoflavones in soy protein isolates on development of induced prostate-related cancers in L-W rats  ap. 41-45.  a2019-12-04  aLobund-Wistar (L-W) rats are inherently susceptible to spontaneous and induced metastasizing adenocarcinomas in the prostate-seminal vesicle (P-SV) complex. L-W rats were fed soy protein isolates containing high isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) or low isoflavones to determine their effects on development of induced P-SV tumors in two stages of the tumorigenic process. In rats fed the high-isoflavone-supplemented soy diet before initiation by methylnitrosourea (MNU), the incidence of induced prostate-related cancer was reduced and the disease-free period was prolonged by 27% compared with rats fed the same diet but low in isoflavones. Rats fed the same diets, started after MNU, manifested suggestive but less consistent results than those noted above. The incidence rates were of marginal significance, suggesting that the high intensity of the active induced disease may not represent the character of the slower-growing spontaneous (natural) disease. The delay of disease onset is of clinical significance. 3aprotein isolates 3adose response 3asoy protein 3aneoplasms 3aexperimental diets 3agenistein 3aanimal models 3aN-methyl-N-nitrosourea 3adietary supplements 3arats 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aGenistein 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aMethylnitrosourea 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aRats 2aRats, Mutant Strains 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 0adiet 0aprostate 0aintake1 aLuckert, P.H.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 28, no. 1 p.41-45x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145513Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04214naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001300163245019300176300001400369500001500383520141100398650001701809650001601826650002801842650002001870650001101890650001801901650001501919650001401934650001501948650001601963650002101979650000902000650001702009650001302026650002002039650001402059650001702073650001002090650002302100650002702123650001802150650002102168650001702189650002102206650001202227650004302239650001802282650004902300650004702349650007302396650001102469650005702480650001102537650002702548650006202575650000902637650002402646650001502670650002702685650003402712650002902746650002902775653001202804653002802816653001502844653003102859653001102890653001402901653003202915653002302947653001602970653000902986653003502995700001603030700001803046773007103064852000903135856008503144930003303229945001303262946001303275655001203288IND2063105520221117175623.0980414s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206310552DNAL7 a92001522pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Y.10aIntervention of transplantable human mammary carcinoma MX-1 chemotherapy with dietary menhaden oil in athymic mice: increased therapeutic effects and decreased toxicity of cyclophosphamide  ap. 63-73.  a2019-12-04  aWe investigated the effects of dietary menhaden oil on cyclophosphamide (CP) antineoplastic activity and its protective effect against CP toxicity. We found that dietary menhaden oil (HMO, 20% menhaden oil + 5% corn oil) enhanced the CP antitumor effect at the lowest dose tested (50 mg/kg) compared with the control group (LCO, 5% corn oil). Dietary HMO and CP treatment had a significant effect on the activities of tumor and liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (CYP) over the controls. Activity of one of the key CP activating enzymes, CYP2B1 (which is similar to human CYP2B6), was significantly enhanced in the liver and tumor by the HMO diet, which could result in the formation of more pharmacologically active CP metabolites and, therefore, increased CP antitumor response. Moreover, the HMO diet exhibited a very significant protective effect against CP acute toxicity. The activity of the CP detoxifying enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH) was significantly increased in the liver after HMO feeding; thus the observed protective effect of HMO feeding against CP toxicity may be partially the result of induction of ADH activity in the liver. In summary, our findings suggested that dietary menhaden oil can modulate ADH and CYP activities in a manner that may alter the metabolism of CP and, therefore, improve its therapeutic index by increasing its therapeutic effect and decreasing its toxicity. 3adrug therapy 3adietary fat 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3anutrient intake 3alyases 3adose response 3amicrosomes 3asynergism 3ametabolism 3abody weight 3acytochrome P-450 3amice 3atestosterone 3atoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3amortality 3amenhaden oil 3aliver 3aexperimental diets 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aanimal models 3acyclophosphamide 3atransferases 3abreast neoplasms 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCell Division 2aCyclophosphamidextherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxmetabolism 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Nude 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymology 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aTestosteronexmetabolism 0aenzymes 0aerythromicin demthylase 0aprotection 0aethoxyresorufin dealkylase 0acyp2b1 0areductase 0apentocyresorufin dealkylase 0anitrosomethylamine 0adetoxicants 0adiet 0anitrosomethylamine demethylase1 aPardini, L.1 aPardini, R.S.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 28, no. 1 p.63-73x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145543Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03274naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001900163245013000182300001400312500001500326520122700341650001101568650001601579650001701595650000901612650001801621650002301639650001601662650001001678650001301688650001101701650001201712650000701724650001801731650002201749650002001771650002001791650001501811650001001826650001201836650003701848650001601885650001101901650002201912650002201934650003101956650001801987650001102005650002302016650002102039650003102060650003302091650000902124650003402133650000902167650002502176650001302201650001302214653002602227653001502253653000902268700001502277773007102292852000902363856008502372930003302457945001302490946001302503655001202516IND2060203120221117165113.0971021s1995    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020312DNAL7 a77399162pmid7 a10.1080/016355895095143622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallaher, D.D.10aBeef tallow, but not corn bran or soybean polysaccharide, reduces large intestinal and fecal bile acid concentrations in rats  ap. 63-75.  a2019-12-04  aDiets high in fat and low in dietary fiber have been associated with a higher incidence of colon cancer, possibly by increasing bile acid concentration in the colon. Therefore changes in bile acid metabolism due to beef tallow, corn bran (CB), and soy polysaccharide (SP) feeding were studied. Rats were fed one of four diets for six weeks: 5% beef tallow fiber-free (LF), 20% beef tallow fiber-free (HF), 25% beef tallow with CB (HFCB), and 20% beef tallow with SP (HFSP). HF increased fecal output compared with LF, and HFCB and HFSP increased fecal output compared with HF. HF reduced fecal bile acid concentration by two-thirds compared with LF, although daily bile acid excretion was similar. There was a tendency toward a smaller bile acid quantity in the small intestine with HF than with LF. Neither fiber altered total fecal bile acid concentration or small intestinal bile acid quantity compared with HF. However, 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the colon was lower with HFSP than with HFCB. Increasing dietary beef tallow from 5% to 20% in animals fed a fiber-free diet greatly reduced the concentration of bile acids in the large intestine and feces, an effect associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. 3aweight 3afood intake 3ahydro-lyases 3arats 3adietary fiber 3aexperimental diets 3abody weight 3acecum 3asoybeans 3atallow 3adigesta 3apH 3aanimal models 3afeces composition 3apolysaccharides 3aenzyme activity 3abile acids 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aCattle 2aCecumxmetabolism 2aColonxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aDietary Fiber 2aEating 2aFatsxpharmacology 2aFecesxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestine, Largexmetabolism 2aMale 2aPolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSoybeans 2aZea mays 0a7-alpha-dehydroxylase 0amaize bran 0adiet1 aChen, C.L.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1995, v. 23, no. 1 p.63-75x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355895095143623Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03621naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245013200181300001600313520186400329650001002193650002002203650002102223650001802244650002402262650001602286650002002302650002902322650001702351650001202368650003102380650003002411650002302441650000902464650004902473650003702522650001802559650003702577650000902614650003502623650000902658650002502667650002802692650001202720650001802732700001602750700002202766700001702788773007302805852000902878856008502887930003302972945001303005946001303018655001203031IND2062259520221123034826.0980305s1996    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206225952DNAL7 a87106812pmid7 a10.1080/016355896095144342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittaker, P.10aEffects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on hepatic lipid peroxidation and blood lipids in rats with dietary iron overload  ap. 119-128.  aThe ability of dietary antioxidants to reduce lipid peroxidation induced by iron overload was examined in weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were fed ad libitum a modified AIN- 76A diet (control) or control diet with 0.5% alpha-tocopherol acid succinate, 0.5% crystalline trans-beta- carotene, or 0.5% alpha-tocopherol acid succinate + 0.5% trans-beta-carotene for four weeks. In the following four-week period, the animal received the above diets with 10,000 microgram Fe/g; a control group continued to receive 35 microgram Fe/g, and a high-iron group received 10,000 microgram Fe/g with no antioxidants. After four weeks of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or alpha-tocopherol + beta-carotene, liver concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene increased significantly (p < 0.001). Liver lipid peroxidation, measured by the Lipid-conjugated diene assay, increased significantly from 0.012 micromole/mg of lipid in the controls to 0.021 micromole/mg of lipid in animals receiving the high-iron diet. However, lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in all animals fed the antioxidants, with the group fed alpha-tocopherol + beta-carotene having a lower level than the high-iron group. Total serum cholesterol was elevated in animals fed a high-iron diet and in animals fed the high-iron diet with alpha-tocopherol. In contrast, total serum cholesterol levels in the two groups of animals receiving the diets containing high iron with beta-carotene alone or high iron with beta-carotene + alpha-tocopherol were significantly reduced to the level of the control group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol also decreased to baseline in the animals receiving beta-carotene alone. Modulation of lipid peroxidation by alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene may be an important mechanism for reducing oxidative stress. 3aliver 3anutrient excess 3adietary minerals 3aanimal models 3avitamin supplements 3ablood serum 3anutrient intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCarotenoidsxpharmacology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiet 2aIronxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxblood 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aVitamin Expharmacology 2aWeaning 2abeta Carotene1 aWamer, W.G.1 aChanderbhan, R.F.1 aDunkel, V.C.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1996, v. 25, no. 2 p.119-128x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355896095144343Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03730naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001200163245012200175300001500297500001500312520171700327650002002044650001902064650000902083650001802092650001002110650001302120650002102133650002302154650002302177650001402200650001602214650002202230650001702252650002302269650002502292650001002317650002802327650003202355650001202387650001702399650003202416650003302448650007602481650000902557650002802566650004902594650003602643650000902679650002202688650004602710653000902756653001202765653001302777700001402790700001502804773007202819852000902891856008502900930003302985945001303018946001303031655001203044IND2058011420221123034830.0970626s1996    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205801142DNAL7 a88447262pmid7 a10.1080/016355896095144672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, K.10aModulation of colonic aberrant crypt foci and proliferative indexes in colon and prostate glands of rats by vitamin E  ap. 99-109.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of a high vitamin E diet on the early stages of colon carcinogenesis and on the proliferative indexes in the colon and in the prostate glands was investigated in rats. F344 male rats were injected with azoxymethane (AOM, 15 mg/kg sc). One week later, animals were randomly allocated into two dietary groups (n = 8 rats/group): normal vitamin E (50 IU/kg diet) and high vitamin E (200 IU/kg diet). The basal diet was the AIN-76 diet modified to contain high corn oil (23% wt/wt). After eight weeks of feeding, concentrations of vitamin E in plasma, liver, and prostate were analyzed. Enumeration of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in colons and proliferative indexes of colons and prostate glands were determined. The total number of ACF and the average number of aberrant crypts (AC) per focus were similar in both dietary groups. ACF were classified as small (1-3 crypts/focus), medium (46 crypts/focus), or large (greater than or equal to 7 crypts/focus). Only the ACF in the small category showed a significant treatment effect, with values being lower in the high vitamin E group than in the control group (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant difference was observed in colonic proliferative indexes assessed by enumeration of metaphase cells, S phase cells, or cells exhibiting proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA labeling index in the prostate glands and the activity of prostatic acid phosphatase in plasma were higher in high vitamin E fed rats (p less than or equal to 0.05) than in control animals. The present study demonstrates that additional vitamin E does not inhibit the induction and growth of ACF; also it enhances the proliferative status of the prostate glands. 3anutrient intake 3acarcinogenesis 3arats 3adose response 3aliver 3aantigens 3aacid phosphatase 3aexperimental diets 3adisease prevention 3avitamin E 3abody weight 3aintestinal mucosa 3ablood plasma 3acell proliferation 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acolon 2aAcid Phosphatasexblood 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAzoxymethane 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aColonxchemistryxpathology. 2aColonic Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aPrecancerous Conditions 2aProliferating Cell Nuclear Antigenxanalysis 2aProstatexchemistryxpathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aVitamin Expharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 0adiet 0alesions 0aprostate1 aLatta, M.1 aBird, R.P.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1996, v. 26, no. 1 p.99-109x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355896095144673Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02707naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245008000200300001800280506007600298520131000374506003701684650000801721650001501729650002101744650002001765650001201785650001501797650001601812650002101828650001101849650001501860650001101875700001901886700002601905700002001931700002101951700002001972700001901992773008302011852000902094856007802103939003302181946001102214655001202225IND4459147220221207100215.0110617e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445914722DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr0182doi7 aPMC31135662pmcid7 a213006442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitts, Steven L.10aUse of divalent metal ions in the DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase IV  ap. 4808-4817.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has long been known that type II topoisomerases require divalent metal ions in order to cleave DNA. Kinetic, mutagenesis and structural studies indicate that the eukaryotic enzymes utilize a novel variant of the canonical two-metal-ion mechanism to promote DNA scission. However, the role of metal ions in the cleavage reaction mediated by bacterial type II enzymes has been controversial. Therefore, to resolve this critical issue, this study characterized the DNA cleavage reaction of Escherichia coli topoisomerase IV. We utilized a series of divalent metal ions with varying thiophilicities in conjunction with oligonucleotides that replaced bridging and non-bridging oxygen atoms at (and near) the scissile bond with sulfur atoms. DNA scission was enhanced when thiophilic metal ions were used with substrates that contained bridging sulfur atoms. In addition, the metal-ion dependence of DNA cleavage was sigmoidal in nature, and rates and levels of DNA cleavage increased when metal ion mixtures were used in reactions. Based on these findings, we propose that topoisomerase IV cleaves DNA using a two-metal-ion mechanism in which one of the metal ions makes a critical interaction with the 3'-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate and facilitates DNA scission by the bacterial type II enzyme.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3adivalent metals 3aenzymes 3ametal ions 3amutagenesis 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3asulfur1 aLiou, Grace F.1 aMitchenall, Lesley A.1 aBurgin, Alex B.1 aMaxwell, Anthony1 aNeuman, Keir C.1 aOsheroff, Neil0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 June, v. 39, no. 11 p.4808-4817x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr0183Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aNon-US 7aarticle02865naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001200179245010400191300001800295500001500313506007600328520131400404506003701718650002101755650002601776650001201802650001401814650001601828650001701844650001101861650001401872650001701886650002901903650001101932650002601943650001701969653001001986700002301996700001902019700002302038700001902061700001802080773008302098852000902181856007802190939003302268946001102301990002302312655001202335IND4459147720221207100213.0110617e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445914772DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr0732doi7 aPMC31135832pmcid7 a213210192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Dan13aAn unusual tRNAThr derived from tRNAHis reassigns in yeast mitochondria the CUN codons to threonine  ap. 4866-4874.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe standard genetic code is used by most living organisms, yet deviations have been observed in many genomes, suggesting that the genetic code has been evolving. In certain yeast mitochondria, CUN codons are reassigned from leucine to threonine, which requires an unusual tRNAThr with an enlarged 8-nt anticodon loop (Formula ). To trace its evolutionary origin we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis which revealed that Formula evolved from yeast mitochondrial tRNAHis. To understand this tRNA identity change, we performed mutational and biochemical experiments. We show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (MST1) could attach threonine to both Formula and the regular Formula , but not to the wild-type tRNAHis. A loss of the first nucleotide (G₋₁) in tRNAHis converts it to a substrate for MST1 with a Km value (0.7 μM) comparable to that of Formula (0.3 μM), and addition of G₋₁ to Formula allows efficient histidylation by histidyl-tRNA synthetase. We also show that MST1 from Candida albicans, a yeast in which CUN codons remain assigned to leucine, could not threonylate Formula , suggesting that MST1 has coevolved with Formula . Our work provides the first clear example of a recent recoding event caused by alloacceptor tRNA gene recruitment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3ahistidine-tRNA ligase 3aleucine 3athreonine 3acoevolution 3agenetic code 3ayeasts 3aphylogeny 3atransfer RNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acodons 3athreonine-tRNA ligase 3amitochondria 0agenes1 aLieberman, Allyson1 aLang, B.

In a case-control study in western New York State, interviews were conducted with 232 incident endometrial cancer cases, diagnosed between 1986 and 1991, and 631 community controls. Body mass index at 16 years of age and 20, 10, and 2 years before interview and changes in body mass index between these time periods were examined. While being relatively heavy at 16 years of age was associated with slightly increased risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.84-1.96], large gains over the entire period from 16 years of age to 2 years ago (OR = 3.45, CI = 2.13-5.37) and high body mass index close to the time of diagnosis (OR = 3.21, CI = 2.01-5.15) were associated with greater risk. Differences in mean body mass index between cases and controls increased over time. 3aepidemiological studies 3aweight gain 3aneoplasms 3abody weight 3awomen 3arisk factors 3aendometrium 3aage 3aduration 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aEndometrial Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMenarche 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 3aNew York 0aNew York 0arisk1 aTrevisan, M.1 aMarshall, J.R.1 aGraham, S.1 aZielezny, M.1 aVena, J.E.1 aHellmann, R.1 aFreudenheim, J.L.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1995, v. 23, no. 2 p.141-149x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355895095143703Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02048naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245020000165300001600365520102900381650001601410650003301426650001301459650002501472650001101497700001801508773008501526852000901611856008201620939003301702946001101735655001201746IND4459163320221123010524.0110617e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445916332DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2011000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Felicity Z.10aSUMO meets meiosis: An encounter at the synaptonemal complex: SUMO chains and sumoylated proteins suggest that heterogeneous and complex interactions lie at the centre of the synaptonemal complex  ap. 529-537.  aRecent discoveries have identified the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) as the potential ‘missing link' that could explain how the synaptonemal complex (SC) is formed during meiosis. The SC is important for a variety of chromosome interactions during meiosis and appears ladder-like. It is formed when ‘axes' of the two homologous chromosomes become connected by the deposition of transverse filaments, forming the steps of the ladder. Although several components of axial and transverse elements have been identified, how the two are connected to form the SC has remained an enigma. Recent discoveries suggest that SUMO modification underlies protein-protein interactions within the SC of budding yeast. The versatility of SUMO in regulating protein-protein interactions adds an exciting new dimension to our understanding of the SC and suggests that SCs are not homogenous structures throughout the nucleus. We propose that this heterogeneity may allow differential regulation of chromosome structure and function. 3achromosomes 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asynaptonemal complex 3ayeasts1 aHoffmann, Eva0 tBioEssays.g2011 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.529-537dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2011000023Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aNon-US 7aarticle03212naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245009100167300001800258500001500276520142900291650002101720650003201741650001601773650000801789650003001797650001601827650002501843650001601868650002501884650001201909650002001921650002401941650001801965650004101983650002302024650003302047650002302080650001602103650005302119650001202172650002802184650004302212650003902255650002702294650003402321653002802355653001402383700002002397700002602417773009902443852000902542930003302551945001302584946001302597655001202610IND2054537820221123010619.0961218e199610  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205453782DNAL7 a88374292pmid7 aPMC1681812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Souza, T.M.10aIsolation of laccase gene-specific sequences from white rot and brown rot fungi by PCR  ap. 3739-3744.  a2019-12-05  aDegenerate primers corresponding to the consensus sequences of the copper-binding regions in the N-terminal domains of known basidiomycete laccases were used to isolate laccase gene-specific sequences from strains representing nine genera of wood rot fungi. All except three gave the expected PCR product of about 200 bp. Computer searches of the databases identified the sequence of each of the PCR products analyzed as a laccase gene sequence, suggesting the specificity of the primers. PCR products of the white rot fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Phlebia brevispora, and Trametes versicolor showed 65 to 74% nucleotide sequence similarity to each other; the similarity in deduced amino acid sequences was 83 to 91%. The PCR products of Lentinula edodes and Lentinus tigrinus, on the other hand, showed relatively low nucleotide and amino acid similarities (58 to 64 and 62 to 81%, respectively); however, these similarities were still much higher than when compared with the corresponding regions in the laccases of the ascomycete fungi Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. A few of the white rot fungi, as well as Gloeophyllum trabeum, a brown rot fungus, gave a 144-bp PCR fragment which had a nucleotide sequence similarity of 60 to 71%. Demonstration of laccase activity in C. trabeum and several other brown rot fungi was of particular interest because these organisms were not previously shown to produce laccases. 3astructural genes 3aligninolytic microorganisms 3aDNA primers 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adecay fungi 3aamino acid sequences 3aPolyporales 3anucleotide sequences 3alaccase 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aLaccase 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0aisolation1 aBoominathan, K.1 aAdinarayana Reddy, C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.3739-3744x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245022300160300001600383520101800399650002901417650001701446650001501463650001401478650002601492650001101518650001801529650001501547650001501562700002801577700002201605700002101627700002401648773010501672852000901777856008201786939003301868946001101901655001201912IND4459163120221122234652.0110617e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445916312DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2010001542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrispo, Erika10aBroken barriers: Human-induced changes to gene flow and introgression in animals: An examination of the ways in which humans increase genetic exchange among populations and species and the consequences for biodiversity  ap. 508-518.  aWe identify two processes by which humans increase genetic exchange among groups of individuals: by affecting the distribution of groups and dispersal patterns across a landscape, and by affecting interbreeding among sympatric or parapatric groups. Each of these processes might then have two different effects on biodiversity: changes in the number of taxa through merging or splitting of groups, and the extinction/extirpation of taxa through effects on fitness. We review the various ways in which humans are affecting genetic exchange, and highlight the difficulties in predicting the impacts on biodiversity. Gene flow and hybridization are crucially important evolutionary forces influencing biodiversity. Humans alter natural patterns of genetic exchange in myriad ways, and these anthropogenic effects are likely to influence the genetic integrity of populations and species. We argue that taking a gene-centric view towards conservation will help resolve issues pertaining to conservation and management. 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic recombination 3ahumans 3aintrogression 3alandscapes 3aprediction1 aMoore, Jean-Sébastien,1 aLee-Yaw, Julie A.1 aGray, Suzanne M.1 aHaller, Benjamin C.0 tBioEssays.g2011 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.508-518dWiley-VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2010001543Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aNon-US 7aarticle01874naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245006800162300001600230520088500246650001501131650002501146650001001171650001201181650001101193650001301204650002101217650001701238650003601255650001301291773008501304852000901389856008201398939003301480946001101513655001201524IND4459163220221122234542.0110617e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445916322DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2011000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, Giuseppe14aThe time of timing: How Polycomb proteins regulate neurogenesis  ap. 519-528.  aThe study of mammalian corticogenesis has revealed a critical role for Polycomb group (PcG) factors in timing the execution of developmental choices. Meanwhile, the study of post-translational modifications of PcG factors marks a symmetrical point, namely that the activity of PcG proteins is itself timed in a manner that links progression through the cell cycle to targeting of downstream genes. Finally, in a third symmetrical twist, the studies that dissect the timing of neural fate by Polycomb are also uncovering the importance of timing in the experimental mutation, since ablation of the same PcG member at different developmental stages yields dramatically different results. Here, I weave together these three lines of evidence and develop a unifying model that clarifies the dynamics of Polycomb function in neural development and defines the salient challenges ahead. 3acell cycle 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3amammals 3amodels 3amutation 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurogenesis 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins0 tBioEssays.g2011 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.519-528dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2011000213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aNon-US 7aarticle00986naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004400133300001400177300001900191500001500210520022000225650001500445650002000460650002000480653002000500653001200520653001300532773006400545852000900609930003300618945000800651946001300659655001200672991601391110742620221122230943.0911114e199106  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910034312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdiorne, G.S.10aFour magic moments in changing behavior  ap. 43-46.  ap. 43-46. ill.  a2019-12-06  aMajor learning theories are presented to offer insight into human behavior as it relates to learning.

Since wheat is rich in endogenous phytase activity it was examined whether wheat phytases could improve phytate degradation compared to microbial phytases. Moreover, it was investigated whether enzymatic degradation of phytate is influenced by the matrix surrounding it. Phytate degradation was defined as the decrease in the sum of InsP₆ + InsP₅. RESULTS: Endogenous wheat phytase effectively degraded wheat InsP₆ + InsP₅ at pH 4 and pH 5, while this was not true for a recombinant wheat phytase or phytase extracted from wheat bran. Only microbial phytases were able to degrade InsP₆ + InsP₅ in the entire pH range from 3 to 5, which is relevant for feed applications. A microbial phytase was efficient towards InsP₆ + InsP₅ in different phytate samples, whereas the ability to degrade InsP₆ + InsP₅ in the different phytate samples ranged from 12% to 70% for the recombinant wheat phytase. CONCLUSION: Wheat phytase appeared to have an interesting potential. However, the wheat phytases studied could not improve phytate degradation compared to microbial phytases. The ability to degrade phytate in different phytate samples varied greatly for some phytases, indicating that phytase efficacy may be affected by the phytate matrix. 3abiodegradation 3aenzyme activity 3afeeds 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3awheat 3awheat bran 2a6-Phytasexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAnimal Feed 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxmetabolism 2aPhytic Acidxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSeeds 2aTriticumxenzymologyxmetabolism.1 aDionisio, Giuseppe1 aGlitsoe, Vibe1 aSkov, Lars K.1 aBrinch-Pedersen, Henrik0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 June, v. 91, no. 8 p.1398-1405dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4324 7aarticle04111naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245017500168300001600343500001500359520177900374650002502153650001702178650002802195650002002223650002502243650002202268650002502290650001902315650003602334650002002370650001702390650001102407650002402418650001802442650002302460650002302483650008502506650002302591650001502614650002102629650002002650650001702670650001702687650006702704650002802771650003302799650001802832650003402850650002402884650003402908650004902942650003702991653001703028653001203045653001603057653002303073653001503096653002803111700001703139700001503156700001603171773011003187852000903297930003303306945001303339946001303352655001203365IND2037461820221122112928.0940223e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203746182DNAL7 a75180882pmid7 aPMC1590102pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellegrini, L.10aMolecular cloning and expression of a new class of ortho-diphenol-O-methyltransferases induced in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves by infection or elicitor treatment  ap. 509-517.  a2019-12-05  aIn tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Samsun NN), three distinct enzymes account for ortho-diphenol-omega-methyltransferase (OMT) activity. OMT I is the major enzyme of healthy leaves, whereas enzymes OMT II and III are preferentially induced during the hypersensitive reaction to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Using an anti-OMT III antiserum, we isolated a partial OMT III cDNA clone by immunoscreening an expression library made from mRNA of TMV-infected tobacco leaves. Using this OMT III clone as a probe, we isolated a full-length clone with a deduced amino acid sequence encompassing all of the sequences obtained by Edman degradation of both purified proteins II and III. Thus, OMT II and III of tobacco are likely to be encoded by the same genes and to arise from different posttranslational modifications. Sequence analysis showed that this OMT clone represents a new class of OMT enzymes (class II) with a low level of similarity (53-58%) to OMTs cloned previously from other dicotyledonous plants. Southern analysis indicated that a small family of class II OMT genes inherited from ancestors related to Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis occurs in the tobacco genome. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that class II OMT genes, unlike class I OMT genes, are not expressed at a high constitutive level in lignified tissues of tobacco. Class II OMT transcripts were found to accumulate in tobacco leaves infected with TMV or treated with megaspermin, a proteinaceous elicitor from Phytophthora megasperma, but not in leaves treated with salicylic acid, a molecule known to trigger many defense genes. In TMV-infected or elicitor-treated tissues, a marked increase in catechol-methylating activity accompanied the accumulation of class II OMT gene products. 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3agenetic code 3aPhytophthora megasperma 3astress response 3aamino acid sequences 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anucleotide sequences 3asalicylic acid 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCatechol O-Methyltransferasexbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Probes 2aEnzyme Induction 2aGene Expression 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aIsoenzymesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistry 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNAxisolation & purification 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxphysiology 0apurification 0acloning 0amegaspermin 0agenetic regulation 0asubstrates 0amolecular sequence data1 aGeoffroy, P.1 aFritig, B.1 aLegrand, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 103, no. 2 p.509-517aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02044naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245005700159300001600216500002400232520112200256650001401378650002401392650002101416650002501437650002001462650002401482650001501506650001101521650001101532700002301543773008601566852000901652856004501661655001201706IND4446145020101208214150.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444614502DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2010000672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhigang10aImmobilization of urease on dialdehyde porous starch  ap. 652-657.  aIncludes references  aDialdehyde porous starch (DPS) was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis and periodate oxidation. Urease was immobilized on DPS by several techniques including physical adsorption and covalent bonding. Optimum urease immobilization conditions for maximum enzyme activity were shown as following: immobilization pH 6.0, processing time of immobilization 25 h, immobilization temperature 25°C, aldehydic groups content 79.6% and ratio of supporter to urease 1:2 (w/v in g/mL). Temperature optimum of the free and immobilized urease were 60 and 70°C, respectively. The temperature curve of the immoblized urease was wider than that registered for the free urease. After being stored at ambient temperature for 42 days, the immobilized urease retained almost all of the original activity. DPS was found capable of holding the urease enzyme during a repeated cyclic test for ten times. An increase of the Km value for the immobilized urease was found. The foregoing data indicated that DPS is a fine supporter for urease and provided a basis for biosensor or bioreactor development with reduced costs and improved shelf life. 3aaldehydes 3aambient temperature 3achemical bonding 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3ashelf life 3astarch 3aurease1 aFuehrer, Bernhard.0 tStärke =.g2010 Dec., v. 62, no. 12 p.652-657dWiley-VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201000067 7aarticle03117naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009700192300001600289500002400305520129600329650001701625650001901642650001801661650002801679650002401707650001501731650001301746650001401759650001801773650001901791650002701810650002701837650002201864650001401886650001001900650001301910650001001923650003701933650006701970650002802037650007002065650007502135650003802210650007002248650006802318700002502386773010002411852000902511856005502520655001202575IND4449896520221122113024.0110225e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444989652DNAL7 a212108172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZadworny, Marcin10aContrasting the morphology, anatomy and fungal colonization of new pioneer and fibrous roots  ap. 213-221.  aIncludes references  a• Not all roots born as first-order branches are the same and this has important consequences for overall function. We hypothesized that, compared with fibrous roots, pioneer roots are built to live longer at the expense of absorptive capacity. • We tested this hypothesis by investigating pioneer and fibrous roots in their first 14 d of life in the arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species: Acer negundo, Acer saccharum, Juglans nigra, Liriodendron tulipifera and Populus tremuloides. Root observations were made with root-access boxes that allowed roots to be sampled at known ages in field-grown trees. • Compared to fibrous roots, pioneer roots had larger diameter, lower specific root length, greater average length and a lack of mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal fungal colonization. Pioneer roots < 14 d old had more layers of hypodermis with a lower percentage of putative passage cells and more protoxylem groups than similar age fibrous roots. • Our results suggest that pioneer roots are constructed for defense against biotic and abiotic challenges, exploration of soil distal to the stem, high fibrous root branching and secondary development with high axial hydraulic conductivity at the expense of mycorrhizal colonization and high absorptive capacity for water and nutrients. 3aAcer negundo 3aAcer saccharum 3aJuglans nigra 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aabsorption 3abranches 3abranching 3afibrous roots 3afungal anatomy 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amicrobial colonization 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrients 3aroots 3atree age 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aAcerxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aJuglansxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aLiriodendronxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & development 2aPopulusxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology.1 aEissenstat, David M.0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Apr., v. 190, no. 1 p.213-221dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03598.x 7aarticle02124naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016700125300001600292500001500308520104900323650001301372650002201385650002001407650001401427650001001441650001601451653002101467653002001488700001501508700001801523700001501541700001601556773011001572852000901682930003301691945001301724946001301737655001201750IND2037465220221122112933.0940223e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203746522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuthje, S.10aPenetration by artificial electron acceptors of the plasma membrane-bound redox system into intact Zea mays L. roots investigated by proton-induced X-ray emission  ap. 593-596.  a2019-12-05  aProton-induced X-ray emission was used to investigate the penetration of compounds of the membrane-impermeant electron acceptors hexabromoiridate IV, hexachloroiridate IV, and hexacyanoferrate III into corn (Zea mays L.) roots. Maps of the heavy element distribution in cross-sections of fixed, epoxy-embedded roots showed for hexabromoiridate IV small amounts of Br in samples treated for 24 h with concentrations normally used in physiological experiments (0.02 mM). After treatment with high concentrations (0.8 mM) of these complexes, Fe and Ir as well as Br were found in root cross-sections. In samples taken at a distance of 5 mm behind the root tip, we found an even distribution of Fe, Ir, and Br over the whole cross-section. In samples taken 15 mm behind the root tip, about 99% of both Br and Ir was confined to the rhizodermal cell layer. The distribution did not change with the complex used. These data are consistent with the view that apoplastic diffusion of the electron acceptors was blocked by the hypodermal Casparian band. 3aZea mays 3aelectron transfer 3aplasma membrane 3adetection 3aroots 3aX-radiation 0aproton radiation 0aredox reactions1 aDoring, O.1 aGrossmann, D.1 aNiecke, M.1 aBottger, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 103, no. 2 p.593-596aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02236naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100001400183245012500197300001800322506007600340520080800416506003701224650001201261650001801273650002001291650001601311650001401327650001801341650005301359650001301412650000701425650002601432650001901458650001601477700001201493700002201505700002201527773009401549852000901643856008201652930003301734946001101767655001201778IND4425408520221207095857.0090829e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442540852DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008008512doi7 aPMC27327532pmcid7 a196500462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin10aCombined use of chiral ionic liquid and cyclodextrin for MEKC: Part I.

The enantioseparation of the enantiomers was achieved by PF-ACE. Subsequently, the binding characteristics of the enantiomers to the serum albumins were investigated. Based on the PF-ACE data, the following binding constants were obtained: Kb,HSA,S=8884±255 M⁻¹, Kb,HSA,R=17648±587 M⁻¹, Kb,BSA,S=7348±237 M⁻¹, Kb,BSA,R=9353±352 M⁻¹. It revealed that Rotigotine had weaker affinity for the two serum albumins, and both enantiomers showed stronger affinity for HSA than BSA. The presence of either site marker (warfarin or ketoprofen) had adverse effect on the enantioseparation due to the competitive binding, or even eliminated the enantioselective binding of the enantiomers to the albumin when the molar ratio of the site marker to the albumin was at certain level. Although there might be a synergistic binding between the drug and the albumin, it was suggested that site II and I were the preferential binding site of the drug on HSA and BSA, respectively. 3aadverse effects 3aalbumins 3abinding properties 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3adrug therapy 3aelectrophoresis 3aenantiomers 3aketoprofen 3apH 3awarfarin1 aLin, Jin-Ming1 aWang, Zhihua1 aGuo, Baoyuan0 tElectrophoresis.g2009 Aug., v. 30, no. 16 p.2845-2852dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008005213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090830b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03892naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245009700179300001600276500001500292520184200307650002002149650001802169650001602187650001502203650002002218650001002238650002002248650001302268650001802281650002302299650002902322650001602351650001702367650002002384650002402404650002502428650002102453650001502474650001002489650000902499650001102508650002202519650005402541650004202595650001802637650001102655650001102666650001602677650001602693650001602709650001702725651001102742651001302753653000902766653000902775700001902784700001502803700001502818700001502833700001402848700001802862700001602880773007302896852000902969856008502978930003303063945001303096946001303109655001203122IND2123462920221122045406.0980618s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346292DNAL7 a91219402pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, M.S.12aA randomized trial of a low-fat dietary intervention in women at high risk for breast cancer  ap. 136-142.  a2019-12-04  aA randomized intervention trial of dietary fat reduction to 15% of total calories was initiated in 1987 for women at high risk for breast cancer to determine the feasibility of recruiting and maintaining them on a low-fat diet. The study has enrolled 194 women between the ages of 18 and 67 years who met at least one of three eligibility criteria: 1) a first-degree relative with breast cancer, 2) a P2 or DY Wolfe mammographic pattern, and 3) a prior breast biopsy demonstrating epithelial hyperplasia with or without atypia. Eligible women must also have had diets that contained >30% of calories from fat at entry. Women were randomized to a nonintervention usual diet vs. a 15% low-fat diet. Recruitment was sought through physicians, personal mailings, breast cancer patients, and the news media. Two study sites participated: a large urban hospital affiliated with a university medical center and a community oncology private practice. The results from both institutions were similar and demonstrated that a low-fat dietary plan could be effectively conducted in private as well as academic settings with recruitment tailored to the community where the trial is being conducted. Reduction in dietary fat intake was maximal during the first three months of the dietary intervention and remained stable throughout 12 months of follow-up. Reductions in total calories, weight loss, and percent body fat were minimal. The nonintervention group experienced no major change in their diet. We conclude that it is feasible to recruit women who are at high risk for breast cancer into a dietary intervention trial, and with sufficient dietary counseling and motivation on the part of participants, reduction in dietary fat intake can be achieved and maintained. More in-depth analyses of these data will be presented in subsequent reports. 3adiet counseling 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3ademography 3anutrient intake 3awomen 3adata collection 3abody fat 3adietary fiber 3apatient compliance 3anutritional intervention 3abody weight 3arisk factors 3aclinical trials 3aexperimental design 3alongitudinal studies 3abreast neoplasms 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBiopsy 2aBreastxpathology 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgeneticsxprevention & control. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperplasia 2aMammography 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 3aKansas 3aMichigan 0arisk 0adiet1 aHeilbrun, L.K.1 aBoomer, A.1 aKresge, C.1 aDepper, J.1 aKim, P.N.1 aValeriote, F.1 aMartino, S.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 27, no. 2 p.136-142x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145153Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03064naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010400164300001600268500001500284520169300299650001801992650002202010650000802032650001702040650001402057650002102071650001002092650001402102650001502116650002402131650001802155650001202173650001402185650001602199653001502215653004302230653001102273653001702284700001702301700002602318773007302344852000902417856008502426930003302511945001302544946001302557655001202570IND2123462420221122045422.0980618s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346242DNAL7 a10.1080/016355897095145132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweetman, S.F.10aEffect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation on DNA damage and repair in human lymphoblastid cells  ap. 122-130.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study the possible protective effects of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol (singly and in combination) on Raji lymphoblastoid cells exposed to various doses of X-rays or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are investigated. DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites were measured using the alkaline comet assay. Survival and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mutant frequency were measured using the colony-forming assay. Ascorbic acid (60 micromolar) and alpha-tocopherol (30 micromolar) were added singly or together to cell culture medium 24 hours before treatment and were present during treatment. After the 24-hour supplementation period with ascorbic acid alone, alpha-tocopherol alone, and ascorbic acid + alpha-tocopherol, the level of endogenous DNA damage was significantly lower (p <0.05) than in the nonsupplemented culture, as assessed by the comet assay. By use of the comet assay, it was observed that ascorbic acid exhibited an overall protective effect against DNA damage induced after X-ray treatment, whereas alpha-tocopherol exhibited an overall protective effect against DNA damage induced after H2O2 treatment. Significant increases were observed in the percent survival after 1-Gy X-rays and 5 and 20 micromolar H2O2 in those cultures supplemented with ascorbic acid alone and alpha-tocopherol alone relative to the nonsupplemented cultures. The endogenous level of mutant frequency, was also significantly decreased in the presence of ascorbic acid relative to the nonsupplemented culture. These findings are consistent with the concept that ascorbic acid alpha-tocopherol can, under certain conditions, protect against oxidatively induced DNA damage. 3adose response 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aDNA 3acell culture 3afrequency 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acells 3amortality 3aDNA repair 3avitamin supplements 3aascorbic acid 3amutants 3asynergism 3aX-radiation 0aprotection 0ahypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 0adamage 0aantioxidants1 aStrain, J.J.1 aMcKelvey-Martin, V.J.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 27, no. 2 p.122-130x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145133Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03543naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001100163245010000174300001600274500001500290520159100305650002001896650001901916650001801935650000901953650001801962650002301980650002102003650002102024650001802045650000902063650001202072650002102084650001802105650003702123650001202160650005802172650003302230650001602263650004202279650001102321650001802332650004902350650002102399650003902420650007902459650003002538650000902568650002502577653001702602653001102619653001902630700001802649773007302667852000902740856008502749930003302834945001302867946001302880655001202893IND2123462620221122045232.0980618s1997    nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346262DNAL7 a91219392pmid7 a10.1080/016355897095145142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIp, C.10aConjugated linoleic acid and linoleic acid are distinctive modulators of mammary carcinogenesis  ap. 131-135.  a2019-12-04  aPrevious work by Ip and co-workers showed that mammary cancer prevention by conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is independent of the level of fat in the diet. Because CLA is an isomer of linoleic acid, there is the question regarding whether the effect of CLA is due to a displacement of linoleic acid in cells. To further evaluate whether there might be an interaction between linoleic acid and CLA the present study was designed to examine the dose response to CLA (at 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) in rats fed a 2% or a 12% linoleate diet (both basal diets contained 20% total fat by weight). The end points of investigation included the bioassay of mammary tumorigenesis in the rat dimethylbenz[a]anthracene model as well as the incorporation of CLA, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid in mammary glands. The mammary carcinogenesis results showed that the efficacy of tumor suppression by CLA was not affected by linoleate intake. With either linoleate diet, no further protection was evident with levels of CLA >1%. Analysis of neutral lipids and phospholipids of the mammary tissue indicated that 1) the accumulation of CLA in mammary tissue was dose dependent from 0.5% to 2%, 2) CLA concentration was 10 times higher in neutral lipids than in phospholipids, 3) the incorporation of CLA in either fraction was not affected by the availability of linoleic acid, and 4) CLA did not appear to displace linoleic acid or arachidonic acid in the mammary tissue. The above findings suggest that there may be distinctive mechanisms in the modulation of tumor development by linoleic acid and CLA. 3anutrient intake 3acarcinogenesis 3alinoleic acid 3adiet 3adose response 3adisease prevention 3atriacylglycerols 3aarachidonic acid 3aanimal models 3arats 3afemales 3abreast neoplasms 3aphospholipids 2a9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aArachidonic Acidxmetabolism 2aCarcinogens 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aLinoleic Acid 2aLinoleic Acidsxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0ainteractions 0alipids 0amammary tissue1 aScimeca, J.A.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1997, v. 27, no. 2 p.131-135x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355897095145143Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03711naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014200182300001600324500002400340520141300364650001501777650001801792650002701810650001301837650002101850650002201871650002501893650001401918650001701932650001701949650001001966650002101976650002901997650002702026650001402053650001702067650001402084650002102098650001202119650007902131650007802210650007302288650002102361650002002382650003102402650001102433650008202444650002902526650004202555650005802597650002802655651001102683651001102694700002602705700002302731700003002754700002902784700002002813700002002833773010302853852000902956856004802965655001203013IND4416966120221122045317.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441696612DNAL7 a191947812pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-009-9306-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, Luiz H.10aCytotoxic, immunosuppressive, trypanocidal and antileishmanial activities of Basidiomycota fungi present in Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil  ap. 227-237.  aIncludes references  aOne hundred three Basidiomycota fungi representing 84 species and 17 families were collected from different Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil. Their basidiomes and fermentation broth extracts were screened in a bioassay panel that included three human cancer cells lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the enzyme trypanothione reductase (TryR) from Trypanosoma cruzi, and amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis. Forty-two extracts representing 21 genera and 35 species presented activities higher than 60% in one or more assays employed in this study. Eighteen extracts were toxic to one or more human cancer cell lines. Extracts from Lentinus strigosus CCB 178 and Lentinus sp. UFMGCB 38 showed selectivity towards cancer cells as they showed only a minor impact on PBMCs. Six extracts suppressed PBMCs proliferation and showed low toxic effect to cancer cells. Thirty-four extracts inhibited the activity of the TryR. Of these, five showed low toxicity towards PBMCs. Extracts from Gymnopilus areolatus, Irpex lacteus, L. strigosus, Nothopanus hygrophanus, Pleurotus flabellatus, and unidentified Basidiomycetes were toxic to L. amazonensis. The results of this screening reinforce the potential of Basidiomycota fungi as sources of bioactive natural products that may be developed into new therapeutic agents for cancer and neglected diseases such as trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. 3aGymnopilus 3aIrpex lacteus 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aLentinus 3aPleurotus djamor 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aantiprotozoal agents 3abioassays 3acytotoxicity 3afermentation 3afungi 3ahuman cell lines 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aneoplasms 3arain forests 3ascreening 3atoxic substances 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBasidiomycotaxclassificationxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCells, Cultured 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aHumans 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aLeishmaniaxdrug effects 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxdrug effects 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aTrypanosomaxenzymology 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aMachado, Kátia M.

  1 aLokupitiya, Erandathie10aAgricultural Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions  ap. 1413-1427.  aParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to submit national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, together with information on methods used in estimating their emissions. Currently agricultural activities contribute a significant portion (approximately 20%) of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, and agricultural soils have been identified as one of the main GHG source categories within the agricultural sector. However, compared to many other GHG sources, inventory methods for soils are relatively more complex and have been implemented only to varying degrees among member countries. This review summarizes and evaluates the methods used by Annex 1 countries in estimating CO and NO emissions in agricultural soils. While most countries utilize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default methodology, several Annex 1 countries are developing more advanced methods that are tailored for specific country circumstances. Based on the latest national inventory reporting, about 56% of the Annex 1 countries use IPCC Tier 1 methods, about 26% use Tier 2 methods, and about 18% do not estimate or report NO emissions from agricultural soils. More than 65% of the countries do not report CO emissions from the cultivation of mineral soils, organic soils, or liming, and only a handful of countries have used country-specific, Tier 3 methods. Tier 3 methods usually involve process-based models and detailed, geographically specific activity data. Such methods can provide more robust, accurate estimates of emissions and removals but require greater diligence in documentation, transparency, and uncertainty assessment to ensure comparability between countries. Availability of detailed, spatially explicit activity data is a major constraint to implementing higher tiered methods in many countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3aagricultural soils 3agas emissions 3aestimation 3amethodology 3aspatial data 3acompliance 3ainternational cooperation 3aequations 3acarbon sequestration 2aAgriculture 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aGeography 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aInternational Cooperation 2aMethanexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNitrous Oxidexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTemperature 0agreenhouse gas inventories1 aPaustian, Keith0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2006 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.1413-1427dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.01573Available from publisher's Web site  a20070925b20071002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03207naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100002300215245006700238300001800305500001500323520129700338650002201635650001201657650002001669650002001689650001701709650002201726650001701748650003401765650003401799650001201833650004501845650003501890650001801925650004201943650004401985650004802029650005102077650001702128653002002145653002602165653002702191653002802218653002502246653002502271700003002296773013202326852000902458856006902467930003302536945002502569946001102594655001202605IND4385306620221122034959.0061119e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438530662DNAL7 a169644942pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0164-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this species, more intersegmental sound-activated neurons have been identified than in any other bush cricket so far, among them a new type of ascending neuron with posterior soma in the prothoracic ganglion (AN4). These interneurons show not only morphological differences in the prothoracic ganglion and the brain, but also respond differently to carrier frequencies, intensity and direction. As a set of neurons, they show graded differences for all of these parameters. A response type not described among intersegmental neurons of crickets and other bush crickets so far is found in the AN3 neuron with a tonic response, broad frequency tuning and little directional dependence. All neurons, with the exception of AN3, respond in a relatively similar manner to the temporal patterns of the male song: phasically to high syllable repetitions and rhythmically to low syllable repetitions. The strongest coupling to the temporal pattern is found in TN1. In contrast to behavior the neuronal responses depend little on syllable duration. AN4, AN5 and TN1 respond well to the female song. AN4 (at higher intensities) and TN1 respond well to a complete duet. 3ainsect morphology 3ahearing 3aPhaneropteridae 3aneural pathways 3ainterneurons 3aelectrophysiology 3astridulation 2aAcoustic Stimulationxmethods 2aAction Potentialsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAuditory Pathwaysxcytologyxphysiology. 2aAuditory Thresholdxphysiology 2aBrain Mapping 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aGanglia, Sensoryxcytologyxphysiology. 2aGryllidaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aNeurons, Afferentxclassificationxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 0aneurophysiology 0aauditory interneurons 0aacoustic communication 0aAncistrura nigrovittata 0ainsect communication 0aprothoracic ganglion1 aMolina Valdivieso, Jorge.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2006 Dec., v. 192, no. 12 p.1359-1376dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0164-z3electronic resource  a20061122b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03431naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245015500165300001800320500001500338520169400353650001402047650001202061650001402073650001302087650001702100650001202117650001902129650001802148650000802166650001302174650001902187650001802206650001502224650001202239650001902251650002702270650003002297650002602327650002802353650002102381650001802402650002202420650004902442650002302491650002602514650003402540653001102574653001402585653001102599653001502610653001302625773009902638852000902737930003302746945001302779946001302792655001202805IND2053688420221122031000.0961023e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205368842DNAL7 a87951942pmid7 aPMC1680992pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, L.T.10aRole of osmolytes in adaptation of osmotically stressed and chill-stressed Listeria monocytogenes grown in liquid media and on processed meat surfaces  ap. 3088-3093.  a2019-12-05  aListeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that is widely distributed in nature and is found in many kinds of fresh and processed foods. The pervasiveness of this organism is due, in part, to its ability to tolerate environments with elevated osmolarity and reduced temperatures. Previously, we showed that L. monocytogenes adapts to osmotic and chill stress by transporting the osmolyte glycine betaine from the environment and accumulating it intracellularly (R. Ko, L. T. Smith, and G. M. Smith, J. Bacteriol. 176:426-431, 1994). In the present study, the influence of various environmental conditions on the accumulation of glycine betaine and another osmolyte, carnitine, was investigated. Carnitine was shown to confer both chill and osmotic tolerance to the pathogen but was less effective than glycine betaine. The absolute amount of each osmolyte accumulated by the cell was dependent on the temperature, the osmolarity of the medium, and the phase of growth of the culture. L. monocytogenes also accumulated high levels of osmolytes when grown on a variety of processed meats at reduced temperatures. However, the contribution of carnitine to the total intracellular osmolyte concentration was much greater in samples grown on meat than in those grown in liquid media. While the amount of each osmolyte in meat was less than 1 nmol/mg (fresh weight), the overall levels of osmolytes in L. monocytogenes grown on meat were about the same as those in liquid samples, from about 200 to 1,000 nmol/mg of cell protein for each osmolyte. This finding suggests that the accumulation of osmolytes is as important in the survival of L. monocytogenes in meat as it is in liquid media. 3abratwurst 3abetaine 3acarnitine 3ahot dogs 3acell culture 3acooling 3aluncheon meats 3aculture media 3aham 3asurfaces 3aosmoregulation 3acytochemistry 3aosmolarity 3abologna 3acold tolerance 3aListeria monocytogenes 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aBetainexpharmacology 2aCarnitinexpharmacology 2aCold Temperature 2aCulture Media 2aFood Microbiology 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 0auptake 0atolerance 0astress 0aadaptation 0asausages0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3088-3093x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03018naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245017200165300001800337500001500355520120800370650002201578650004601600650002401646650002101670650001501691650001301706650002101719650001501740650002101755650001201776650003701788650003301825650003101858650002301889650002801912650002501940650002301965650002401988650003102012650001302043653003402056653001602090653001402106653002302120653001602143653001602159700001402175700001402189700001702203700001702220773009902237852000902336930003302345945001302378946001302391655001202404IND2053689620221122031035.0961023e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205368962DNAL7 a87952012pmid7 aPMC1681072pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Dov, E.10aRestriction map of the 125-kilobase plasmid of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis carrying the genes that encode delta-endotoxins active against mosquito larvae  ap. 3140-3145.  a2019-12-05  aA large plasmid containing all delta-endotoxin genes was isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis; restricted by BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, SacI, and SalI; and cloned as appropriate libraries in Escherichia coli. The libraries were screened for inserts containing recognition sites for BamHI, SacI, and SalI. Each was labeled with 32P and hybridized to Southern blots of gels with fragments generated by cleaving the plasmid with several restriction endonucleases, to align at least two fragments of the relevant enzymes. All nine BamHI fragments and all eight SacI fragments were mapped in two overlapping linkage groups (with total sizes of about 76 and 56 kb, respectively). The homology observed between some fragments is apparently a consequence of the presence of transposons and repeated insertion sequences. Four delta-endotoxin genes (cryIVB-D and cytA) and two genes for regulatory polypeptides (of 19 and 20 kDa) were localized on a 21-kb stretch of the plasmid; without cytA, they are placed on a single BamHI fragment. This convergence enables subcloning of delta-endotoxin genes (excluding cryIVA, localized on the other linkage group) as an intact natural fragment. 3aSouthern blotting 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aDNA probes 3aplasmids 3acrystal proteins 3aendotoxins 3abacterial toxins 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCulicidaexdrug effects 2aEndotoxinsxgenetics 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPlasmids 0ainsecticidal crystal proteins 0acryivd gene 0acyta gene 0achromosome mapping 0acryivb gene 0acryivc gene1 aEinav, M.1 aPeleg, N.1 aBoussiba, S.1 aZaritsky, A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3140-3145x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03611naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100001600188245008600204300001600290520172800306650002302034650002002057650001902077650002002096650001702116650001302133650001102146650001902157650001602176650001202192650001102204650004702215650001102262650000902273650006002282650007002342650001302412650001502425650001702440650001602457651002702473653004102500653003002541700001502571700002002586700001402606773022402620852000902844856007602853930003302929945002502962946001102987990002302998655001203021IND4385330620221122031147.0061119e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438533062DNAL7 a171055752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0442.2006.00881.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWittwer, C.10aPrevalence of Osteochondrosis in the Limb Joints of South German Coldblood Horses  ap. 531-539.  aThis study aimed to quantify the factors associated with the prevalence of the radiological signs of osteochondrosis (OC) and osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) in South German Coldblood (SGC) horses. The prevalence of OC and OCD in fetlock and hock joints was analysed in 167 young coldblood horses with a mean age of 14 months. The presence of at least one osteochondrotic lesion (OC) in fetlock or hock joints was documented for 61.7% of the horses and 26.9% of the horses had osseus fragments. Osteochondrotic findings at the dorsal aspect of the sagittal ridge of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bone were seen in 53.9% of the horses and palmar/plantar osseous fragments in fetlock joints in 16.2% of the horses. Hock joint OC was found in 40.1% of the horses and hock OCD in 0.6%. Osteochondrotic findings in the distal part of the tibia were prevalent in 28.1% and in the lateral trochlea tali in 17.4% of the horses. The sex of the investigated horses significantly influenced the prevalence of OC in fetlock and hock joints, as well as the findings in the distal part of the tibia and lateral trochlea tali. Age at radiological examination was significant for the prevalence of OC in hock joints, palmar/plantar osseous fragments in fetlock joints and osteochondrotic findings in the distal part of the tibia. Female horses showed a 2-fold higher risk for OC in fetlock and hock joints than male horses. The distribution of the affected horses by age classes showed that radiographic signs of OC in fetlock and hock joints significantly increased at an age of about 1 year.

Suspected cases of food-borne cryptosporidiosis are rarely confirmed because of the limited numbers of oocysts in the samples and the lack of sensitive detection methods adaptable to food. PCR was investigated as a means of overcoming this problem. A PCR assay was designed for the specific amplification of a previously sequenced portion of an oocyst protein gene fragment of Cryptosporidium parvum (N. C. Lally, G. D. Baird, S. J. McQuay, F. Wright, and J. J. Oliver, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 56:69-78, 1992) and compared with the primer set of Laxer et al. (M. A. Laxer, B. K. Timblin, and R.J. Patel, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 45:688-694, 1991). The PCR products were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled internal probes and detected by chemiluminescence to enhance sensitivity. The two sets of primers were compared with regard to their sensitivity and specificity by using a variety of human and animal isolates of C. parvum and related parasites. Both assays enabled the detection of 1 to 10 oocysts in 20 ml of artificially contaminated raw milk. The assay based on the PCR set and probe of Laxer et al. detected DNAs from Eimeria acervulina and Giardia intestinalis. The new assay has good specificity for C. parvum bovine isolates and hence has a better potential for monitoring the prevalence of C. parvum in raw milk and other environmental samples. 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aoocysts 3alabeling techniques 3achemiluminescence 3araw milk 3aDNA primers 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3adetection 3adigoxigenin 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aCryptosporidium parvumxisolation & purification 2aDNA, Protozoanxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMilkxparasitology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aDNA probes1 aIbrahim, A.q(Abdelwahid),d1933-1 aBarta, J.R.1 aGriffiths, M.W.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3259-3264x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03388naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245007800162300001800240520174600258650002102004650002302025650001402048650001402062650002602076650002202102650001902124650001302143650001802156650001402174650003802188650001202226650003902238650002502277650003402302650002002336650003802356650003302394650000902427650002402436650001502460653001902475653002202494653002102516653002402537700001502561700002002576700002102596700001402617773009902631852000902730930003302739945001302772946001302785655001202798IND2053707320221121045400.0961024e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205370732DNAL7 a87952222pmid7 aPMC1681282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, H.S.10aMonoclonal antibodies for detection of the H7 antigen of Escherichia coli  ap. 3325-3332.  aTwo murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2B7 and 46E9-9) reactive with the H7 flagellar antigen of Escherichia coli were produced and characterized. A total of 217 E. coli strains (48 O157:H7, 4 O157:NM, 23 O157:non-H7, 22 H7:non-O157, and 120 non-O157:non-H7), 17 Salmonella serovars, and 29 other gram-negative bacteria were used to evaluate the reactivities of the two MAbs by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both MAbs reacted strongly with all E. coli strains possessing the H7 antigen and with H23- and H24-positive E. coli strains. Indirect ELISA MAb specificity was confirmed by inhibition ELISA and by Western blotting (immunoblotting), using partially purified flagellins from E. coli O157:H7 and other E. coli strains. On a Western blot, MAb 46E9-9 was more reactive against H7 flagellin of E. coli O157:H7 than against H7 flagellin of E. coli O1:K1:H7. Competition ELISA suggested that MAbs 2B7 and 4CE9-9 reacted with closely related H7 epitopes. When the ELISA reactivities of the MAbs and two commercially available polyclonal anti-H7 antisera were compared, both polyclonal antisera and MAbs reacted strongly with E. coli H7 bacteria. However, the polyclonal antisera cross-reacted strongly both with non-H7 E. coli and with many non-E. coli bacteria. The polyclonal antisera also reacted strongly with H23 and H24 E. coli isolates. The data suggest the need to define serotype-specific epitopes among H7, H23, and H24 E. coli flagella. The anti-H7 MAbs described in this report have the potential to serve as high-quality diagnostic reagents, used either alone or in combination with O157-specific MAbs, to identify or detect E. coli O157:H7 in food products or in human and veterinary clinical specimens. 3aEscherichia coli 3abacterial antigens 3aflagellum 3adetection 3amonoclonal antibodies 3agenetic variation 3aimmunoblotting 3aepitopes 3aserodiagnosis 3aantiserum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysis 2aCross Reactions 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEscherichia coliximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aSerotyping 0aindirect elisa 0acompetition elisa 0ainhibition elisa 0apolyclonal antisera1 aKeen, J.E.1 aWesterman, R.B.1 aLittledike, E.T.1 aKwang, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3325-3332x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03692naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245018500165300001800350500001500368520181400383650002902197650001702226650002702243650002502270650001702295650002402312650002902336650001502365650001402380650001402394650002902408650002402437650002702461650006302488650001902551650002802570650003202598650003602630653002702666653001802693653001402711653001402725653001302739653001802752653003102770653001502801700001902816700001602835700001302851700001402864700002102878773009902899852000902998930003303007945001303040946001303053655001203066IND2053707020221121045301.0961024e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205370702DNAL7 a87952202pmid7 aPMC1681262pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFimland, G.10aNew biologically active hybrid bacteriocins constructed by combining regions from various pediocin-like bacteriocins: the C-terminal region is important for determining specificity  ap. 3313-3318.  a2019-12-05  aThe pediocin-like bacteriocins, produced by lactic acid bacteria, are bactericidal polypeptides with very similar primary structures. Peptide synthesis followed by reverse-phase and ion-exchange chromatographies yielded biologically active pediocin-like bacteriocins in amounts and with a purity sufficient for characterizing their structure and mode of action. Despite similar primary structures, the pediocin-like bacteriocins, i.e., pediocin PA-1, sakacin P, curvacin A, and leucocin A, differed in their relative toxicities against various bacterial strains. On the basis of the primary structures, the polypeptides of these bacteriocins were divided into two modules: the relatively hydrophilic and well conserved N-terminal region, and the somewhat more diverse and hydrophobic C-terminal region. By peptide synthesis, four new biologically active hybrid bacteriocins were constructed by interchanging corresponding modules from various pediocin-like bacteriocins. All of the new hybrid bacteriocin constructs had bactericidal activity. The relative sensitivity of different bacterial strains to a hybrid bacteriocin was similar to that to the bacteriocin from which the C-terminal module was derived and quite different from that to the bacteriocin from which the N-terminal was derived. Thus, the C-terminal part of the pediocin-like bacteriocins is an important determinant of the target cell specificity. The synthetic bacteriocins were more stable than natural isolates, presumably as a result of the absence of contaminating proteases. However, some of the synthetic bacteriocins lost activity, but this was detectable only after months of storage. Mass spectrometry suggested that this instability was due to oxidation of methionine residues, resulting in a 10- to 100-fold reduction in activity. 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3apolypeptides 3aLactobacillus curvatus 3alactic acid bacteria 3abacteriocins 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aCarnobacterium piscicola 3amethionine 3aoxidation 3asynthesis 3aantibacterial properties 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aBacteriocinsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDrug Stability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0asynthetic bacteriocins 0aLactobacillus 0asakacin p 0astability 0apeptides 0apediocin pa-1 0alactobacillus coryneformis 0acurracin a1 aBlingsmo, O.R.1 aSletten, K.1 aJung, G.1 aNes, I.F.1 aNissen-Meyer, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3313-3318x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02346naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245008200166300001800248500001500266520082100281650002701102650001801129650001601147650002001163650001701183650002001200650002101220650001101241650001101252650001001263650002101273650001801294650003601312650002501348650003101373650002801404650003901432650005001471653001701521653001301538653001601551653002701567653002401594700001901618773009901637852000901736930003301745945001301778946001301791655001201804IND2053707520221121033339.0961024e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205370752DNAL7 a87952232pmid7 aPMC1681292pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStreit, W.R.10aRecombinant Rhizobium meliloti strains with extra biotin synthesis capability  ap. 3333-3338.  a2019-12-05  aThe growth of Rhizobium meliloti 1021 in an experimental alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) rhizosphere was stimulated by adding nanomolar amounts of biotin. To overcome this biotin limitation, R. meliloti strains were constructed by conjugating the Escherichia coli biotin synthesis operon into biotin auxotroph R. meliloti 1021-B3. Transconjugant strains Rm1021-WS10 and Rm1021-WS11 grew faster in vitro and achieved a higher cell density than did R. meliloti 1021 and overproduced biotin on a defined medium. The increase in cell yield was associated with as much as a 99% loss in viability for Rm1021-WS11, but data suggested that a separate stabilizing factor in the E. coli DNA reduced cell death in Rm1021-WS10. In rhizosphere tests, the recombinant strains showed delayed growth and competed poorly against Rm1021. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3arhizosphere 3arecombinant DNA 3abiosynthesis 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aoperon 3abiotin 3aroots 3aEscherichia coli 2aBase Sequence 2aBiotinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acolonization 0ain vitro 0agrowth rate 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0acompetitive ability1 aPhillips, D.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3333-3338x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01759naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008000126300001600206520067900222650001700901650002700918650001000945650001500955650001300970650001300983650001800996650002301014650001001037650001201047650001101059651001001070700001601080700001801096700001801114700001601132700001901148700001601167700002001183773006901203852000901272939003301281946001101314655001201325IND4459036920221121033423.0110616s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445903692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, S.V.10aKufri frysona: first high yielding potato variety for french fries in India  ap. 103-109.  aFrozen French fries are the most popular processed potato product throughout the world.

Both chloromethane (CH3Cl) and L-methionine caused earlier initiation of veratryl alcohol biosynthesis, but S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) retarded the formation of the compound. A high level of C2H3 incorporation into both the 3- and 4-O-methyl groups of veratryl alcohol occurred when either L-[methyl-2H3]methionine or C2H3Cl was present, but no significant labelling was detected when S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-2H3]methionine was added. Incorporation of C2H3 from C2H3Cl was strongly antagonized by the presence of unlabelled L-methionine; conversely, incorporation of C2H3 from L-[methyl-2H3] methionine was reduced by CH3Cl. These results suggest that L-methionine is converted either directly or via an intermediate to CH3Cl, which is utilized as a methyl donor in veratryl alcohol biosynthesis. SAM is not an intermediate in the conversion of L-methionine to CH3Cl. In an attempt to identify the substrates for O methylation in the metabolic transformation of benzoic acid to veratryl alcohol, the relative activities of the SAM- and CH3Cl-dependent methylating systems on several possible intermediates were compared in whole mycelia by using isotopic techniques. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid was a much better substrate for the CH3Cl-dependent methylation system than for the SAM-dependent system. The CH3Cl-dependent system also had significantly increased activities toward both isovanillic acid and vanillyl alcohol compared with the SAM-dependent system. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the conversion of benzoic acid to veratryl alcohol involves para hydroxylation, methylation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, meta hydroxylation of 4-methoxybenzoic acid to form isovanillic acid, and methylation of isovanillic acid to yield veratric acid. 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3abiosynthesis 3amethylation 3aadenosylmethionine 3amethionine 3abenzoic acid 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aalcohols 0amethyl donors 0aaromatic compounds 0achemical reactions 0aprecursors1 aMcRoberts, W.C.1 aKennedy, J.T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.3366-3370x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03769naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001500184245009200199300001800291520181700309650000902126650002202135650001802157650002502175650001902200650002102219650002302240650001502263650001202278650002202290650002802312650001802340650001802358650001602376650001202392650003302404650001802437650004402455650000902499650002802508650004602536650002302582650001502605650000902620650001602629650002702645650006702672650004602739651002602785653002002811700001702831700002202848773009902870852000902969856007202978930003303050945002503083946001103108655001203119IND4386114120221121013801.0061218e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438611412DNAL7 a169898362pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAfonso, E.10aTransmission of Toxoplasma gondii in an urban population of domestic cats (Felis catus)  ap. 1373-1382.  aToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects humans and animal species worldwide. The relative importance of each potential transmission route in the complex life cycle of this coccidia is largely unknown, due to the lack of studies taking into account all routes simultaneously. In this study, we analyzed the transmission of T. gondii in an urban population of stray cats captured between 1993 and 2004. Analyzing prevalence, our aim was to determine which factors influence transmission in this population. Specific anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies were detected using the modified agglutination test. Firstly, we analyzed the kinetics of antibody titers in cats captured several times, using mixed linear models and correspondence analysis. We showed that antibody titers did not vary significantly with time and that titer 40 was the best threshold to separate individuals into two serological groups. Overall, prevalence was only 18.6%, thus transmission of T. gondii is infrequent in this population. As expected, a highly significant association was detected between age and presence of IgG antibodies. Prevalence was lowest in kittens aged 3-4 months, suggesting that newborn kittens may carry maternal antibodies and that vertical transmission is rare. After taking into account the effect of age, logistic regression showed that antibody carriage was related to factors that possibly related to the survival of oocysts: localization in the study site, origin of the cats, maximal temperatures and rain. Our results suggest that in this population, vertical transmission is rare, low predation limits prevalence, and oocyst survival is a determining factor in the risk of infection. We discuss the more general importance of conditions determining oocyst survival in the life cycle of T. gondii. 3acats 3aToxoplasma gondii 3atoxoplasmosis 3adisease transmission 3aseroprevalence 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aantibody detection 3aanimal age 3aoocysts 3apathogen survival 3aepidemiological studies 3astray animals 3aferal animals 3aurban areas 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aCarrier State 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aCats 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical 2aPopulation Density 2aPrevalence 2aRain 2aTemperature 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalxepidemiologyximmunologyxtransmission. 2aUrban Healthxstatistics & numerical data 0aFrancexepidemiology. 0aoocyst survival1 aThulliez, P.1 aGilot-Fromont, E.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2006 Nov., v. 36, no. 13 p.1373-1382x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.07.0103electronic resource  a20061220b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01790naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245008600165300001800251520056900269650002700838650001500865650001900880650001600899650002300915650002200938650006100960650002201021650004701043653001901090700002101109700001301130700001701143700002101160700002001181773009901201852000901300930003301309945001301342946001301355655001201368IND2053710620221121002315.0961024e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205371062DNAL7 a87952412pmid7 aPMC1681472pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, D.G.10aFungal biotransformation of the antihistamine azatadine by Cunninghamella elegans  ap. 3477-3479.  aThe metabolism of the antihistamine azatadine by the zygomycete fungus Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 9245 was investigated.

Design: A randomised meal study. Setting: Metabolic ward. Subjects and methods: In total, 17 healthy women, 30-65 years old, consumed three meals in randomised order. The meals consisted of foodstuffs with similar nutrient composition but different types of protein (cod, cottage cheese, or soy protein isolate). The distribution of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrates was 33, 26, and 41 energy percent, respectively. Total amount of energy was 2300 kJ. Blood samples were drawn for assay of B-glucose, S-insulin, S-free fatty acids, S-triglycerides, and C-peptide in the fasting state and at seven times (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min) after starting to eat the test meal. Results: The blood glucose response after the cod protein meal differed from that of the soy protein meal, with a larger area under the curve (AUC) calculated up to 120 min. The serum insulin response after the milk protein meal differed from that of the cod protein meal with a larger AUC calculated up to 240 min. The insulin/C-peptide and the insulin/glucose ratios differed between the meals; the insulin/C-peptide ratio was higher after the milk protein meal compared to the cod, and soy protein meal at 120 min. The insulin/glucose ratio was lower after the cod protein meal compared to the milk, and soy protein meals at 120 min. The results showed that the metabolic responses differed after meals with similar macronutrient composition containing cod-, milk-, or soy protein. 3adairy protein 3asoy protein 3awomen 3ablood glucose 3ainsulin 3ahuman nutrition 3atest meals 2aAdult 2aAged 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aC-Peptidexblood 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilk Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aPostprandial Period 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0adietary protein 0acod protein 0afish protein1 aVessby, B.1 aKarlstrom, B.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.949-954x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16024043electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/06  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03552naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245019700183300001600380500001500396520134700411650001301758650001301771650002001784650001801804650002601822650001101848650001601859650002501875650002301900650002301923650003601946650002001982650002002002650002502022650001902047650003702066650001202103650002802115650002102143650003202164650001602196650004602212650002202258650001102280650002702291650001802318650000902336650003702345650001202382651001002394651001002404653001802414653001302432700002002445700001702465773018602482852000902668856008502677930003302762945002502795946001102820990002302831655001202854IND4385885520221121002241.0061210e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438588552DNAL7 a167863352pmid7 a10.1007/s00360-006-0089-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian-Mei10aSeasonal regulations of energetics, serum concentrations of leptin, and uncoupling protein 1 content of brown adipose tissue in root voles (Microtus oeconomus) from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau  ap. 663-671.  a2019-12-04  aSurvival of small mammals in winter requires proper adjustments in physiology, behavior and morphology. The present study was designed to examine the changes in serum leptin concentration and the molecular basis of thermogenesis in seasonally acclimatized root voles (Microtus oeconomus) from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. In January root voles had lower body mass and body fat mass coupled with higher nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) capacity. Consistently, cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) protein contents in brown adipose tissues were higher in January as compared to that in July. Circulating level of serum leptin was significantly lower in winter and higher in July. Correlation analysis showed that serum leptin levels were positively related with body mass and body fat mass while negatively correlated with UCP1 protein contents. Together, these data provided further evidence for our previous findings that root voles from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau mainly depend on higher NST coupled with lower body mass to enhance winter survival. Further, fat deposition was significantly mobilized in cold winter and leptin was potentially involved in the regulation of body mass and thermogenesis in root voles. Serum leptin might act as a starvation signal in winter and satiety signal in summer. 3aMicrotus 3aplateaus 3abody mass index 3aoverwintering 3abody fat distribution 3aleptin 3aacclimation 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aseasonal variation 3aindigenous species 3aNADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 3aheat production 3aprotein content 3abrown adipose tissue 3alean body mass 2aAdipose Tissue, Brownxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexmetabolism 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aBody Weight 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxmetabolism 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aIon Channelsxanalysis 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxanalysis 2aSeasons 3aChina 0aTibet 0afat free mass 0abody fat1 aZhang, Yan-Ming1 aWang, De-Hua0 tJournal of comparative physiology.

Strain RFM-1 was a short straight rod (0.4 by 1.2 micrometers), whereas strain RFM-2 was a slightly curved rod (0.34 by 1.6 micrometer) that possessed polar fibers. Their morphology, gram-positive staining reaction, resistance to cell lysis by chemical agents, and narrow range of utilizable substrates were typical of species belonging to the family Methanobacteriaceae. Analysis of the nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA-encoding genes confirmed this affiliation and supported their recognition as new species of Methanobrevibacter: M. cuticularis (RFM-1) and M. curvatus (RFM-2). The per cell rates of methanogenesis by strains RFM-1 and RFM-2 in vitro, taken together with their in situ population densities (ca. 10(6) cells . gut-1; equivalent to 10(9) cells . ml of gut fluid-1), could fully account for the rate of methane emission by the live termites. UV epifluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed that RFM-1- and RFM-2-type cells were the dominant methanogens in R. flavipes collected in Michigan (but were not the only methanogens associated with this species) and that they colonized the peripheral, microoxic region of the hindgut, i.e., residing on or near the hindgut epithelium and also attached to filamentous prokargotes associated with the gut wall. An examination of their oxygen tolerance revealed that both strains possessed catalase-like activity. Moreover, when dispersed in tubes of agar medium under H2-CO2-O2 (75:18.8:6.2, vol/vol/vol), both strains grew to form a thin plate about 6 mm below the meniscus, just beneath the oxic-anoxic interface. Such growth plates were capable of mediating a net consumption of O2 that otherwise penetrated much deeper into uninoculated control tubes. Similar results were obtained with an authentic strain of Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus. This is the first detailed description of an important and often cited but poorly understood component of the termite gut microbiota. 3aMethanobacteriaceae 3acatalase 3ahindgut 3aribosomal DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aphylogeny 3adigestive tract mucosa 3amicroorganisms 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aadhesion 3anew species 3aoxygen 3achemotaxonomy 3aReticulitermes flavipes 2aAnimals 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDigestive Systemxmicrobiology 2aEcology 2aInsectaxmicrobiology. 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMethanobacteriaceaexclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxygenxpharmacology 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0agenbank/u62533 0agenbank/u41095 0aepithelium 0atolerance 0aidentification 0amolecular sequence data 0aanatomy and morphology0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.3620-3631x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01835naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005200124520069000176650001000866650002000876650002100896650001700917650001800934650002200952650001500974650002200989650002501011651001001036653002701046653002401073653000901097655002701106700001901133773025401152852000901406939003301415946001301448655001201461IND9302382620221120220434.0930420s1989    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930238262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, J.G.10aBio-economic modeling for conservation planning  aA multi-year/multi-crop growth simulation model called EPIC was used to generate stochastic yields and wind erosion rates for twelve cropping systems on the Texas High Plains.

The profit distributions and wind erosion rates provided input into a multi-period recursive quadratic programming model to evaluate the economic impact of alternative soil erosion levels at the farm level. Results from the analysis indicate that compliance with commodity base acreage limits the adoption of profitable soil conserving cropping systems. 3acrops 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3awind erosion 3agrowth models 3asimulation models 3airrigation 3asoil conservation 3astochastic processes 3aTexas 0astochastic programming 0acomputer simulation 0aepic 7aconference publication1 aLacewell, R.D.0 tProceedings of the 1989 Summer Computer Simulation Conference : July 24-27, 1989, the Stouffer Austin Hotel, Austin, Texas / edited by Joe K.

Levels of extractable lipA transcript and protein (LiP H8) were well correlated, although they were separated by a 2-day lag period. The patterns of transcript abundance over time in soil-grown P. chrysosporium varied among the nine lip mRNAs detected; comparison with lip gene expression under different liquid culture conditions suggested an early phase of carbon limitation for the cultures as a whole, which was followed by a transition to nitrogen starvation. Anthracene transformation occurred throughout the 25-day course of the experiment and, therefore, likely involves mechanisms distinct from those involved in oxidation of non-LiP substrate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 3amessenger RNA 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3astructural genes 3aDNA primers 3aDNA 3abioremediation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aoxidation 3abiodegradation 3anucleotide sequences 3alignin peroxidase 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3apolluted soils 3asandy loam soils 2aAnthracenesxmetabolism 2aAnthraquinonesxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeroxidasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0alipa gene 0aglx gene 0aperoxidases 0asimulation 0aglyoxal oxidase1 aSchoenike, B.1 aLamar, R.T.1 aCullen, D.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1996 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.3697-3703x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02434naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010700127300001600234500002400250500001500274520113800289650001601427650002101443650004701464650003001511650001801541650002701559650002601586650001301612650001201625650001501637650001401652650002501666650002601691650002001717650003101737653001101768700001401779700001701793700001701810700002001827700001601847773010401863852000901967655001201976IND4365246920221120195222.0041028e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436524692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardi, A.10aCharacterization of Streptococcus macedonicus strains isolated from artisanal Italian raw milk cheeses  ap. 967-976.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this research was to elucidate the potential technological role of Streptococcus macedonicus in cheese. For this purpose, phenotypic and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR subtyping as well as biochemical characterization were carried out on 37 S. macedonicus isolates collected from several artisanal, Italian raw milk cheeses. Identification was achieved by a species-specific PCR assay developed in this study. A wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity between the isolates was observed. A certain variability of the acidifying and peptidase activities was observed and the comparison between some technological characteristics displayed by S. macedonicus and Streptococcus thermophilus indicated a clear distinction of these species. The presence of dairy grade characteristics, such as peptidase activities, ability to produce inhibitory compounds, absence of antibiotic resistance and haemolytic activity, may suggest the rational design of a novel starter culture for dairy application composed of strains of both S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus species, with the former used as a starter adjunct. 3acheese milk 3astarter cultures 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aStreptococcus macedonicus 3aacidification 3atraditional technology 3aantibiotic resistance 3araw milk 3acheeses 3apeptidases 3ahemolysis 3aphenotypic variation 3agenetic heterogeneity 3aenzyme activity 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 0agrades1 aGatti, M.1 aRizzotti, L.1 aTorriani, S.1 aAndrighetto, C.1 aGiraffa, G.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2004 Nov., v. 14, no. 11 p.967-976dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245003500190300001600225500002400241520086000265650003001125650002101155650001501176650002201191650002201213650002401235650002101259700001801280700001401298773009201312852000901404856005501413655001201468IND4388470620221120174952.0070304e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438847062DNAL7 a173354782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2006.00281.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, V.10aDomenico Solution--Is It Valid  ap. 136-146.  aIncludes references  aThe Domenico solution is widely used in several analytical models for simulating ground water contaminant transport scenarios. Unfortunately, many textbook as well as journal article treatments of this approximate solution are full of empirical statements that are developed without mathematical rigor. For this reason, a rigorous analysis of this solution is warranted. In this article, we present a mathematical method to derive the Domenico solution and explore its limits. Our analysis shows that the Domenico solution is a true analytical solution when the value of longitudinal dispersivity is zero. For nonzero longitudinal dispersivity values, the Domenico solution will introduce a finite amount of error. We use an example problem to quantify the nature of this error and suggest some general guidelines for the appropriate use of this solution. 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3aguidelines 3ahydrologic models 3asimulation models 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Pollutants1 aClement, T.P.1 aLee, K.K.0 tGround water.g2007 , v. 45, no. 2 p.136-146dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2006.00281.x 7aarticle02880naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245008300175300001800258500002400276520145200300650001401752650002201766650001601788650000901804650001801813650001601831650002501847650001101872650001201883650001201895650001501907650002401922650002601946650004701972650001202019650002402031650002202055650002302077650001202100650002302112700001602135700001502151700001502166773010302181852000902284856008102293655001202374IND4456706220221120175037.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445670622DNAL7 a214899652pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2010-010052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedghi, M.10aEstimation and modeling true metabolizable energy of sorghum grain for poultry  ap. 1138-1143.  aIncludes references  aSorghum grain is an important ingredient in poultry diets. The TMEn content of sorghum grain is a measure of its quality. As for the other feed ingredients, the biological procedure used to determine the TMEn value of sorghum grain is costly and time consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to find an alternative method to accurately estimate the TMEn content. In this study, 2 methods of regression and artificial neural network (ANN) were developed to describe the TMEn value of sorghum grain based on chemical composition of ash, crude fiber, CP, ether extract, and total phenols. A total of 144 sorghum samples were used to determine chemical composition and TMEn content using chemical analyses and bioassay technique, respectively. The values were consequently subjected to regression and ANN analysis. The fitness of the models was tested using R² values, MS error, and bias. The developed regression and ANN models could accurately predict the TMEn of sorghum samples from their chemical composition. The goodness of fit in terms of R² values corresponding to testing and training of the ANN model showed a higher accuracy of prediction than the equation established by regression method. In terms of MS error, the ANN model showed lower residuals distribution than the regression model. The results suggest that the ANN model may be used to accurately estimate the TMEn value of sorghum grain from its corresponding chemical composition. 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3acrude fiber 3adiet 3agrain sorghum 3aingredients 3ametabolizable energy 3amodels 3aphenols 3apoultry 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aComputer Simulation 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aPoultry 2aSorghumxchemistry1 aEbadi, M.R.1 aGolian, A.1 aAhmadi, H.0 tPoultry science.g2011 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.1138-1143dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2010-010053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01614naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238500001500254520057600269650002100845650001000866650003500876650001900911650001200930650000700942650001300949650001600962653002100978653003200999653002001031700001601051700001701067773010101084852000901185939003301194946001301227655001201240IND9104331120221120164028.0911104e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910433112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, M.F.10aKinetics of methylmethionine sulfonium in buffer solutions for estimating thermal treatment of liquid foods  ap. 475-488.  a2019-12-04  aReaction kinetics of MMS degradation in sodium citrate buffer solutions followed a first order reaction kinetics in the temperature range of 121.1 degrees C-132.2 degrees C and the pH range of 4 to 6.

The components of EPS were shown to be L-fucose, D-galactose, pyruvate, succinate, and acetate in the approximate molar ratio of 2:1:1:1:0.5:1.5. Methylation analysis revealed that the tetrasaccharide-repeating unit consisted of one 1,3-linked glucosyl, one 1,4-linked fucosyl, one 1,3,4-linked fucosyl (branch unit) and one 1-linked galactosyl residue (terminal group). Pyruvate occupied the O-4 and O-6 position of the galactosyl residue, whereas the positions of the succinyl and O-acetyl substituents are, as yet, undetermined. These results indicate that the structure of the EPS, as far as the carbohydrate portion is concerned, is identical to that of the EPS of C. m. subsp. insidiosus, except for the presence of the succinyl and O-acetyl groups, which were not observed in the latter. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated the molecular weight of the EPS to be variable, with sizes of about 10(6) and 10(7) Da. The high molecular weight of the EPS may be associated with the wilting symptoms shown by infected plants. Evidence is given that a high-molecular-weight EPS produced in planta is similar in composition to EPS produced in vitro. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apathogenesis 3apolysaccharides 3amolecular weight 3achemical composition 3achemical analysis 0acharacterization 0asecretions1 aZevenhuizen, L.P.T.M.1 aCordewener, J.H.G.1 aDons, J.J.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1991 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.619-623x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02017naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245014700147300001600294500001500310520038700325650002000712650002400732650003000756650002500786650001000811650002500821650002000846650003800866650002000904650002400924650001800948650006300966650004101029650003101070650001901101650002801120650002401148650005101172650003601223653001201259653001301271653002801284653001901312653003001331700001601361773005701377852000901434939003301443946001101476655001201487IND9104326720221120144244.0911101s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910432672DNAL7 a20134032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTennigkeit, J.10aNucleotide sequence analysis of a chloramphenicol-resistance determinant from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and identification of its gene product  ap. 113-116.  a2019-12-04  aThe nucleotide sequence of a chloramphenicol-resistance (CmR) determinant from the Gram- soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens was determined, and its gene product was identified as Cm acetyltransferase (CAT).

Suppression of nodulation by SCN was influenced by the nematode race/soybean cultivar interaction but not by bradyrhizobial strains. Nodulation of susceptible Lee 68 soybeans was suppressed by race 1, regardless of the bacterial strain. In contrast, nodulation of resistant soybeans was less affected despite comparable penetration rates of juveniles and subsequent necrosis in the roots. Nodules from race 3-infected Lee 68 soybean had similar ultrastructures of bacteroid-containing cells and uninvaded cells and protein patterns in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, but reduced heme contents and nitrogen-fixation efficiency, as compared with those from the controls. Emerging nodules from race 1-infected plants accumulated phytoferritin and starch granules and had altered protein patterns in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, when compared to nodules of similar size from control or race 3-infected plants. Such differences were indicative of differentially altered nodule physiology and function as a result of infection by these two SCN races. 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3acultivars 3aHeterodera glycines 3aGlycine max 3araces 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ahost-parasite relationships 3astrain differences 3aroot nodules 3avarietal resistance 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3anodulation 3aultrastructure 3apest resistance 0astrains 0anodule physiology 0aplant physiology1 aHuang, P.Y.1 aHuang, J.S.1 aBarker, K.R.0 tPhytopathology.g1991 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.591-595x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01557naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009400126300001600220520076100236650001700997650001801014650001101032650001301043650002201056700001601078700001601094773007701110852000901187930003301196945001301229946001301242655001201255IND2198723120221120144213.0990514e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219872312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmyth, A.B.10aDisulfide bonds influence the heat-induced gel properties of chicken breast muscle myosin  ap. 584-588.  aThe functions of thiol groups in the denaturation, aggregation and gelation of chicken breast muscle myosin during heating in 0.6M NaCl, 50mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was investigated by inhibiting disulfide (SS) bond formation using dithiothreitol (DTT). The endotherm of myosin heated in the presence or absence of DTT had similar thermal transition temperatures. Preventing SS bond formation increased the onset temperature for aggregation and gelation and decreased the elastic-like properties of the final gel matrix. Results indicated that SS bond formation was not a prerequisite for the gelation of chicken breast myosin. However, intermolecular SS bonds, especially from thiol groups on subfragment-1, contributed to gel network formation. 3achicken meat 3abreast muscle 3amyosin 3agelation 3asulfhydryl groups1 aSmith, D.M.1 aO'Neill, E.0 tJournal of food science.g1998 , v. 63, no. 4 p.584-588x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01622naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011600124300001600240520085700256650001701113650001301130650002301143650001601166700001701182773007701199852000901276930003301285945001301318946001301331655001201344IND2198724320221120144225.0990514e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219872432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, H.Y.10aSelective solubilization of alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin into reversed micelles from their mixtures  ap. 601-605.  aPhase transfer experiments were performed, involving contact between an aqueous 1:1 solution of alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin and an AOT-in-isooctane reversed micellar phase.

At low protein concentrations, the extent of reversed micellar solubilization of the two pure proteins predicted well the extraction from mixtures. However, at higher protein concentrations beta-lactoglobulin appeared to be excluded from the micellar droplets. Because of the significantly different partitioning behavior of the two proteins, reversed micellar extraction from an initially equal weight mixture led to an effective separation of the proteins. 3awhey protein 3amicelles 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3alactalbumin1 aDungan, S.R.0 tJournal of food science.g1998 , v. 63, no. 4 p.601-605x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01569naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001600218520075200234650001400986650001001000650001701010650001801027650001501045650002201060700001401082700001401096773007701110852000901187930003301196945001301229946001301242655001201255IND2198723720221120144303.0990514e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219872372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, M.Y.10aRetinyl palmitate isomers in skim milk during light storage as affected by ascorbic acid  ap. 597-600.  aEffects of ascorbic acid addition on the contents of retinyl palmitate isomers in skim milk treated with or without 3 mg/mL added riboflavin were studied during storage for 30 h under fluorescent light.

Binding of p40 to coxII RNA protects an 8-10 nucleotide segment from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, indicating that the protein interacts with only a restricted region of the 5'-leader. This segment is located at position -12 with respect to the initiation AUG. Deletion of 10 nucleotides encompassing this site completely abolishes protein binding. Nevertheless, Bal31 deletion analysis within the coxII leader shows that a major part of the leader is essential for p40 binding, suggesting that binding of the protein is also dependent on secondary structural features. p40 binds to other mitochondrial leader mRNAs including those for coxI, coxIII and cyt b. p40 is present in a cytoplasmic (rho(0)) petite mutant lacking mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is therefore presumably nuclear encoded. The possible biological function of the protein is discussed. 3amessenger RNA 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3amitochondria 3aSaccharomyces bayanus 0apurification 0agenetic regulation 0atranslation 0aSaccharomyces uvarum1 aDekker, P.1 aBlom, J.1 aGrivell, L.A.0 tEMBO journal.g1990 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.4135-4143x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03767naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245013100166300001800297520233700315650002202652650001202674650001902686650002202705650001702727650001402744650001702758650001702775650001502792650003902807650001302846650001402859650001902873650006202892650004402954650001802998650003503016650002703051653002303078653004203101700001703143773007203160852000903232939003303241946001103274655001203285IND9104360120221120035848.0911104e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910436012DNAL7 a22496722pmid7 aPMC5521962pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawata, E.E.10aMolecular analysis of an aurea photosynthetic mutant (Su/Su) in tobacco: LHCP depletion leads to pleiotropic mutant phenotypes  ap. 4197-4203.  aSu is a nuclear encoded, semi-dominant aurea mutation in Nicotiana tabacum L. The homozygous plants (Su/Su) are pale yellow and non-photosynthetic while the heterozygous (Su/+) are photosynthetically competent and have a yellow-green phenotype which is distinct from that of green wild-type plants (+/+). We have examined the RNA and protein levels for a number of nuclear and plastid encoded chloroplast proteins under high and low light plant growth conditions. Under high light conditions, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCP) were undetectable in the homozygous Su/Su plants, and the large subunit (LSu) and the small subunit (SSu) of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) and cytochrome b559 were severely deficient. However, only the nuclear encoded cab and plastid encoded psbE mRNA (encoding LHCP and cytochrome b559 respectively) were reduced significantly. In heterozygous Su/+ plants, the level of LHCP was reduced to 25% of that in wild-type plants while cab and psbE mRNA, LSu, SSu and cytochrome b559 remained at normal levels, suggesting that LCHP is more immediately affected by the Su mutant gene product than the rest of the photosynthetic proteins and mRNA examined. Under low light conditions, the levels of cab and psbE mRNA, LSu, SSu and cytochrome b559 in homozygous Su/Su plants were equivalent to those in wild-type plants except LHCP which remained undetectable. Similarly, the LHCP level in low light grown Su/+ plants still remained at 25% of wild-type level. These results indicate that the decrease in LHCP is independent of light conditions and has not resulted from photooxidation, whereas the depletion of other proteins and mRNA examined under high light growth conditions is a consequence of photooxidative damage to Su/Su plastids. Furthermore, transgenic Su/Su and Su/+ plants with a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S)--cab construct constitutively maintained high levels of cab mRNA but displayed the same pattern of diminished LHCP accumulation as their non-transformed counterparts when grown under both high and low light conditions. These results indicate that the Su mutation primarily causes depletion of LHCP. The depletion of LHCP leads to photooxidative damage which results in decreased cab mRNA levels and other pleiotropic lesions in Su/Su plants. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein depletion 3agenetic code 3aphenotype 2aGenes, Plant 2aHeterozygote 2aHomozygote 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0alight-harvesting chlorophyll proteins1 aCheung, A.Y.0 tEMBO journal.g1990 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.4197-4203x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02815naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245013000164300001800294500001500312520131100327650002301638650001301661650001101674650001301685650002001698650002001718650001501738650003101753650001201784650002301796650001501819650003801834650002701872650001101899650003101910650000901941650002201950650004501972650003102017650002302048653002302071653002402094700002502118700001702143773007202160852000902232939003302241946001102274655001202285IND9104359220221117184715.0911104e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910435922DNAL7 a17011412pmid7 aPMC5521692pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBownes, M.10aDifferential control of yolk protein gene expression in fat bodies and gonads by the sex-determining gene tra-2 of Drosophila  ap. 3975-3980.  a2019-12-04  aWe studied the regulation of the yolk protein (YP) genes in the somatic cells of the gonads, using temperature sensitive mutations (tra-2ts) of transformer-2, a gene required for female sexual differentiation. XX;tra-2ts mutant animals were raised at the permissive temperature so that they developed as females and were then shifted to the restrictive male-determining temperature either 1-2 days before or 0-2 h after eclosion. These animals formed vitellogenic ovaries. Likewise, mutant gonads transplanted into either normal female hosts or normal male hosts, kept at the restrictive temperature, underwent vitellogenesis. Thus, the ovarian follicle cells can mature and express their YP genes in the absence of a functional product of the tra-2 gene. Although the gonadal somatic cells of ovary and testis may derive from the same progenitor cells, the testicular cells of XX;tra-2ts pseudomales did not express their YP genes nor take up YP from the haemolymph at the permissive female-determining temperature. We conclude that in the somatic cells of the gonad, the YP genes are no longer under direct control of the sex-determining genes, but instead are regulated by tissue specific factors present in the follicle cells. It is the formation of follicle cells which requires the activity of tra-2. 3asexual development 3afat body 3agonads 3aegg yolk 3agene expression 3aprotein content 3aDrosophila 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA Probes 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEgg Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMale 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSex Determination Analysis 2aTestisxmetabolism 0agenetic regulation 0aprotein composition1 aSteinmann-Zwicky, M.1 aNothiger, R.0 tEMBO journal.g1990 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.3975-3980x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03044naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245017400167300001800341500001500359520132200374650001501696650001701711650002901728650002001757650002301777650002501800650001201825650002101837650001801858650002901876650003101905650002801936650002801964650003101992650002302023650002202046650001302068650003002081650001302111650003202124650002702156653002302183653002802206653002502234653003702259653001702296700001502313700001302328773007202341852000902413939003302422946001102455655001202466IND9104359320221117184729.0911104e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910435932DNAL7 a22496592pmid7 aPMC5521702pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisermann, A.10aIn vitro transcription and DNA binding characteristics of chloroplast and etioplast extracts from mustard (Sinapis alba) indicate differential usage of the psbA promoter  ap. 3981-3987.  a2019-12-04  aThe psbA gene which is differentially expressed in vivo in chloroplasts and etioplasts has an unusual promoter, containing both prokaryotic-type '-35' and '-10' elements and a sequence motif that resembles the nuclear TATA box. Single base pair substitutions were introduced into the mustard psbA promoter and the mutants were tested in transcription and DNA binding experiments, using extracts from either chloroplasts or etioplasts. Positions within the '-35' region appear to play an essential role in the chloroplast but not in the etioplast system. Altering the first or second position of the 'TATA box'-like region led to decreased psbA in vitro transcription in either plastid extract. These two mutations, however, did not affect binding of extracts to the (linear) psbA promoter fragment in gel retardation assays. Fragments carrying two other plastid promoters effectively competed psbA promoter binding of the etioplast extract, but more weakly that of the chloroplast extract. Lambda exonuclease mapping shows that the 5' border of the binding region is more upstream with the etioplast than with the chloroplast system, whereas the 3' border appears to be the same. Hence, protein(s) of the two plastid types seem to interact differently with the mustard psbA promoter in vitro and perhaps also in vivo. 3aetioplasts 3aSinapis alba 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3aDNA-binding proteins 3amutants 3apromoter regions 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aDNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMustard Plantxgenetics 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNucleotide Mapping 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPlasmids 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aTATA Box 2aTissue Extractsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0achloroplasts1 aTiller, K.1 aLink, G.0 tEMBO journal.g1990 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.3981-3987x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01707naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005600129300001900185520071800204650004200922650002000964650001900984650001901003650001601022650002001038650001101058650002401069650002201093653001201115700002101127700001801148700001901166773008001185852000901265930003301274945001301307946001301320655001201333IND2062976820221117172741.0980407e199612  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206297682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, H.T.

The pore of the conceptacle was occluded by the tightly appressed tips of the paraphyses. These were embedded in copious ECM within the conceptacle. The ECM inside the conceptacle and in the medulla differed markedly in texture and with respect to the distribution of S and Cl, as revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. High levels of S were restricted to the conceptacle's ECM, whereas the ECM in the medulla was always S poor and Cl rich. Receptacles frozen naturally at low tide during the winter of 1998 showed extensive damage in the medulla, and this likely accounts for the cessation of reproduction during the winter on the Maine shore. The damaged receptacles recovered and resumed growth during the spring, and they released gametes by May. Abscission of the overwintered receptacles was observed in June to July, coincident with the formation of new receptacles at the tips of newly grown portions of the fronds. 3aFucus vesiculosus 3aX-radiation 3aabscission 3aelectron microscopy 3aextracellular matrix 3afreezing 3afronds 3agerm cells 3areproduction 3aspring 3atexture 3awinter 3aMaine1 aSperansky, Svetlana R.1 aBrawley, Susan H.0 tJournal of phycology.g1999 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1264-1275dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1999.3561264.x 7aarticle02569naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002000158245014700178300001800325500002400343520137400367650001401741650002501755650002001780650001101800650002201811650002401833650001501857650001201872650001001884650002201894651001801916700002101934700002301955773011701978852000902095856007902104655001202183IND4413400720221123023123.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441340072DNAL7 a216281692pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.08001292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurata, Kaoruko10aGenetic diversity and geographical structure of the pitcher plant Nepenthes vieillardii in New Caledonia: A chloroplast DNA haplotype analysis  ap. 1632-1644.  aIncludes references  aAmong the many species that grow in New Caledonia, the pitcher plant Nepenthes vieillardii (Nepenthaceae) has a high degree of morphological variation. In this study, we present the patterns of genetic differentiation of pitcher plant populations based on chloroplast DNA haplotype analysis using the sequences of five spacers. We analyzed 294 samples from 16 populations covering the entire range of the species, using 4660 bp of sequence. Our analysis identified 17 haplotypes, including one that is widely distributed across the islands, as well as regional and private haplotypes. The greatest haplotype diversity was detected on the eastern coast of the largest island and included several private haplotypes, while haplotype diversity was low in the southern plains region. The parsimony network analysis of the 17 haplotypes suggested that the genetic divergence is the result of long-term isolation of individual populations. Results from a spatial analysis of molecular variance and a cluster analysis suggest that the plants once covered the entire serpentine area of New Caledonia and that subsequent regional fragmentation resulted in the isolation of each population and significantly restricted seed flow. This isolation may have been an important factor in the development of the morphological and genetic variation among pitcher plants in New Caledonia. 3aNepenthes 3aanalysis of variance 3achloroplast DNA 3acoasts 3agenetic variation 3aground cover plants 3ahaplotypes 3aislands 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3aNew Caledonia1 aJaffré, Tanguy.1 aSetoguchi, Hiroaki0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2008 Dec., v. 95, no. 12 p.1632-1644dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.08001293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03607naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002700179245012500206300001800331500002400349506007600373520185600449506003702305650000902342650002202351650001802373650001802391650001802409650001602427650002302443650002202466650001702488650002902505650002502534650001302559650001302572650002402585650002202609650003402631650003202665650001302697650001702710700001602727700001902743700002402762700002602786700001902812700002202831773010102853852000902954856007802963655001203041IND4405214020221207112022.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440521402DNAL7 a177663102pmid7 aPMC27102712pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarczi, Jean-François10aAmapSim: A Structural Whole-plant Simulator Based on Botanical Knowledge and Designed to Host External Functional Models  ap. 1125-1138.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: AmapSim is a tool that implements a structural plant growth model based on a botanical theory and simulates plant morphogenesis to produce accurate, complex and detailed plant architectures. This software is the result of more than a decade of research and development devoted to plant architecture. New advances in the software development have yielded plug-in external functions that open up the simulator to functional processes. METHODS: The simulation of plant topology is based on the growth of a set of virtual buds whose activity is modelled using stochastic processes. The geometry of the resulting axes is modelled by simple descriptive functions. The potential growth of each bud is represented by means of a numerical value called physiological age, which controls the value for each parameter in the model. The set of possible values for physiological ages is called the reference axis. In order to mimic morphological and architectural metamorphosis, the value allocated for the physiological age of buds evolves along this reference axis according to an oriented finite state automaton whose occupation and transition law follows a semi-Markovian function. KEY RESULTS: Simulations were performed on tomato plants to demostrate how the AmapSim simulator can interface external modules, e.g. a GREENLAB growth model and a radiosity model. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithmic ability provided by AmapSim, e.g. the reference axis, enables unified control to be exercised over plant development parameter values, depending on the biological process target: how to affect the local pertinent process, i.e. the pertinent parameter(s), while keeping the rest unchanged. This opening up to external functions also offers a broadened field of applications and thus allows feedback between plant growth and the physical environment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abuds 3acomputer software 3agrowth models 3ametamorphosis 3amorphogenesis 3aoccupations 3aplant architecture 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aresearch and development 3astochastic processes 3atomatoes 3atopology 2aComputer Simulation 2aPlant Development 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxanatomy & histology 2aSoftware 2aTime Factors1 aRey, Hervé1 aCaraglio, Yves1 ade Reffye, Philippe1 aBarthélémy, Daniel.1 aDong, Qiao Xue1 aFourcaud, Thierry0 tAnnals of botany.g2008 May, v. 101, no. 8 p.1125-1138dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm1943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04341naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014200167300001600309500002400325520247800349650001302827650002202840650003202862650001702894650001102911650001802922650002202940650001502962650002302977650001503000650002703015650001403042650001203056650001503068650002203083650002103105650001903126650002403145650001903169650002103188650002603209650001403235650002403249650003003273650001003303650001303313650003103326650001703357650001903374650001403393700002003407700001603427700001803443700002103461700001803482700002903500773010503529852000903634856004803643655001203691IND4422800820221123014425.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442280082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-009-0370-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Eekeren, Nick10aSoil biological quality of grassland fertilized with adjusted cattle manure slurries in comparison with organic and inorganic fertilizers  ap. 595-608.  aIncludes references  aWe studied the effect of five fertilizers (including two adjusted manure slurries) and an untreated control on soil biota and explored the effect on the ecosystem services they provided. Our results suggest that the available N (NO ₃ ⁻ and NH ₄ ⁺ ) in the soil plays a central role in the effect of fertilizers on nematodes and microorganisms. Microorganisms are affected directly through nutrient availability and indirectly through grass root mass. Nematodes are affected indirectly through microbial biomass and grass root mass. A lower amount of available N in the treatment with inorganic fertilizer was linked to a higher root mass and a higher abundance and proportion of herbivorous nematodes. A higher amount of available N in the organic fertilizer treatments resulted in a twofold higher bacterial activity (measured as bacterial growth rate, viz. thymidine incorporation), a higher proportion of bacterivorous nematodes, a 30% higher potential N mineralization (aerobic incubation), and 25-50% more potentially mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation). Compared to inorganic fertilizer, organic fertilization increased the C total, the N total, the activity of decomposers, and the supply of nutrients via the soil food web. Within the group of organic fertilizers, there was no significant difference in C total, abundances of soil biota, and the potential N mineralization rate. There were no indications that farmyard manure or the adjusted manure slurries provided the ecosystem service “supply of nutrients” better than normal manure slurry. Normal manure slurry provided the highest bacterial activity and the highest amount of mineralizable N and it was the only fertilizer resulting in a positive trend in grass yield over the years 2000-2005. The number of earthworm burrows was higher in the treatments with organic fertilizers compared to the one with the inorganic fertilizer, which suggests that organic fertilizers stimulate the ecosystem service of water regulation more than inorganic fertilizer. The trend towards higher epigeic earthworm numbers with application of farmyard manure and one of the adjusted manure slurries, combined with the negative relation between epigeic earthworms and bulk density and a significantly lower penetration resistance in the same fertilizer types, is preliminary evidence that these two organic fertilizer types contribute more to the service of soil structure maintenance than inorganic fertilizer. 3aNematoda 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiological activity in soil 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acattle manure 3aearthworm burrows 3aearthworms 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afertilizer application 3afood webs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3amineral fertilizers 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aorganic fertilizers 3aresistance to penetration 3aroots 3aslurries 3asoil biological properties 3asoil quality 3asoil structure 3athymidine1 ade Boer, Herman1 aBloem, Jaap1 aSchouten, Ton1 aRutgers, Michiel1 ade Goede, Ron1 aBrussaard, L.q(Lijbert)0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2009 July, v. 45, no. 6 p.595-608dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-009-0370-2 7aarticle02937naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013800166300001400304520134900318592002801667650002401695650001901719650001501738650001201753650002301765650001201788650001101800650002301811650000901834650001101843650002301854650001901877650001501896650001901911650001001930650001901940650001501959653002201974653002301996653003102019653002302050653001902073700001402092700001702106700001502123700001702138700001602155700001402171773010502185856008402290852000902374655001202383IND60111655720221122222414.0160903e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011165572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAustruy, A.10aPhysiological impacts of soil pollution and arsenic uptake in three plant species: Agrostis capillaris, Solanum nigrum and Vicia faba  ap. 28-34.  aIn order to revegetate an industrial soil polluted by trace metals and metalloids (As, Pb, Cu, Cd, Sb), the impact of pollution on three plant species, Solanum nigrum and Agrostis capillaris, both native species in an industrial site, and Vicia faba, a plant model species, is studied. Following the study of soil pollution from the industrial wasteland of Auzon, it appears that the As is the principal pollutant. Particular attention is given to this metalloid, both in its content and its speciation in the soil that the level of its accumulation in plants. In V. faba and A. capillaris, the trace metals and metalloids inhibit the biomass production and involve a lipid peroxidation in the leaves. Furthermore, these pollutants cause a photosynthesis perturbation by stomatal limitations and a dysfunction of photosystem II. Whatever the plant, the As content is less than 0.1 percent of dry matter, the majority of As absorbed is stored in the roots which play the role of trap organ. In parallel, the culture of S. nigrum decreases significantly the exchangeable and weakly adsorbed fraction of As in rhizospheric soil. This study has highlighted the ability of tolerance to trace metals of S. nigrum and to a lesser extent A. capillaris. Our data indicate that V. faba is not tolerant to soil pollution and is not a metallophyte species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis capillaris 3aSolanum nigrum 3aVicia faba 3aarsenic 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3acopper 3aindigenous species 3alead 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3asoil pollution 3awastelands 0aContaminated soil 0aLeaf gas exchanges 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aLipid peroxidation 0aArsenic uptake1 aWanat, N.1 aMoussard, C.1 aVernay, P.1 aJoussein, E.1 aLedoigt, G.1 aHitmi, A.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 90 p.28-34dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007800168300001600246520096200262592002801224650001301252650001301265650001501278650002001293650001401313650001901327650001101346650002201357650002201379700001901401700001801420773011701438856008201555852000901637655001201646IND60100795920221121012825.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010079592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eun-Kyeong10aSuperhydrophobicity of electrospray-synthesized fluorinated silica layers  ap. 599-602.  aThe preparation of superhydrophobic SiO₂ layers through a combination of a nanoscale surface roughness and a fluorination treatment is reported. Electrospraying SiO₂ precursor solutions that had been prepared by a sol–gel chemical route produced very rough SiO₂ layers. Subsequent fluorination treatment with a solution containing trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane resulted in highly rough, fluorinated SiO₂ layers. The fluorinated rough SiO₂ layers exhibited excellent repellency toward various liquid droplets. In particular, water repellency of 168° was observed. On the bases of Cassie–Baxter and Young–Dupre equations, the surface fraction and the work of adhesion of the rough, fluorinated SiO₂ layers were respectively estimated. In light of the durability in water, ultraviolet resistance, and thermal stability, the superhydrophobic SiO₂ layers prepared in this work hold promise in a range of practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3adroplets 3adurability 3aelectrospraying 3aequations 3ahydrophobicity 3asilica 3asurface roughness 3athermal stability1 aLee, Chul-Sung1 aKim, Sang Sub0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 368, no. 1 p.599-602dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009600163300001600259520090200275592002801177650004401205650002201249650002301271650001801294650001801312650001401330650001901344650004401363650003301407650001101440650002201451700002001473700001301493700001501506773011001521856008201631852000901713655001201722IND60100877920221120224814.0141105e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010087792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.08.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wenshi10aHighly monodisperse polysilsesquioxane spheres: Synthesis and application in cotton fabrics  ap. 194-200.  aHighly monodisperse methyl-functionalized, vinyl-functionalized, and thiol-functionalized polysilsesquioxane spheres (MPSQ, VPSQ, and MPPSQ spheres) have been successfully prepared through a one-pot emulsion approach with one organosilane as sole precursor in aqueous medium.

Our research turns out that the organofunctional groups play a key role in thermostability and hydrophobicity of polysilsesquioxane spheres, MPSQ, and VPSQ spheres possess better thermostability than MPPSQ spheres, the order of hydrophobicity is as follows: MPSQ>VPSQ>MPPSQ.

We have investigated the key biological pathways that define susceptibility for pulmonary infection during obesity in diet-induced obese (DIO) and regular weight (RW) C57BL/6 mice exposed to inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induced a strong inflammatory response in all mice as indicated by elevated cell counts of macrophages and neutrophils and levels of proinflammatory cytokines (MDC, MIP-1γ, IL-12, RANTES) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, DIO mice exhibited 50% greater macrophage cell counts, but decreased levels of the cytokines, IL-6, TARC, TNF-α, and VEGF relative to RW mice. Microarray analysis of lung tissue showed over half of the LPS-induced expression in DIO mice consisted of genes unique for obese mice, suggesting that obesity reprograms how the lung responds to subsequent insult. In particular, we found that obese animals exposed to LPS have gene signatures showing increased inflammatory and oxidative stress response and decreased antioxidant capacity compared with RW. Because signaling pathways for these responses can be common to various sources of environmentally induced lung damage, we further identified biomarkers that are indicative of specific toxicant exposure by comparing gene signatures after LPS exposure to those from a parallel study with cigarette smoke. These data show obesity may increase sensitivity to further insult and that co-occurrence of environmental stressors result in complex biosignatures that are not predicted from analysis of individual exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3achemokine CCL5 3acigarettes 3adisease resistance 3aendotoxins 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aneutrophils 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3arisk 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aWaters, Katrina M.1 aKarin, Norman J.1 aWebb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M.1 aZangar, Richard C.1 aLee, K.

The formation of a single PA6/water phase during extrusion (shown by High Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimetry (HPDSC)) improves the clay dispersion, decreases the PA6 melting temperature by 66°C (so-called cryoscopic effect), and thus prevents the polymer matrix degradation during processing. This process enables the compounding of pristine clay-based nanocomposites whose dispersion state, thermal and mechanical performances are close to what is generally reported for organo-modified montmorillonite-based nanocomposites. Advantage was taken of water-assisted extrusion to optimize the clay dispersion by increasing shear rate and of the cryoscopic effect to limit the degradation by decreasing the processing temperature. Using these conditions PA6/pristine clay nanocomposites properties are similar to those of more conventional PA6/organomodified clay nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aextrusion 3amelting point 3amontmorillonite 3ananocomposites 3apolyamides 3atemperature1 aSoulestin, J.1 aSclavons, M.1 aDevaux, J.1 aLacrampe, M.F.1 aKrawczak, P.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2011 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.1890-1900dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011900181300001600300520134500316592002801661650001901689650000901708650001101717650001601728650002001744650001201764650001301776650001501789650001301804650002301817650001601840650001601856650000901872700003101881700004201912700003501954700003801989700003802027700003402065700003302099700002902132700002402161773009202185856008102277852000902358655001202367IND60103533520221119182628.0141106e20120409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010353352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPôrto, Laura Cristina Jardim10aImprovement of the energy supply and contractile function in normal and ischemic rat hearts by dietary orotic acid  ap. 476-483.  aAIMS: As cardiac performance is closely related to its energy supply, our study investigated the effect of the orotic acid cardioprotective agent on the pathways of energy supply, in both conditions of normal flow and ischemia. MAIN METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed during nine days with a balanced diet only or supplemented with 1% orotic acid. KEY FINDINGS: Dietary administration of orotic acid increased the cardiac utilization of fatty acids, activity of the lipoprotein lipase, expression of the gene of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its target enzymes. In addition, orotic acid increased the myocardial uptake and incorporation of glucose, glycogen content and level of GLUT4, concentration of glycolytic metabolites and lactate production in both experimental conditions, baseline and after regional ischemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, in orotic acid hearts there was a simultaneous stimulus of fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic pathway, reflected in increased energetic content even in pre-ischemia. The analysis of the cardiac contractility index showed a positive inotropic effect of orotic acid due, at least in part, to the increased availability of energy. The result allows us to suggest that the metabolic changes induced by orotic acid result in appreciable alterations on myocardial contractile function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3adiet 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aglycolysis 3aischemia 3alipoprotein lipase 3ametabolites 3aorotic acid 3arats1 ade Castro, Carlos Henrique1 aSavergnini, Sílvia Silveira Quintão1 aSantos, Sérgio Henrique Sousa1 aFerreira, Adaliene Versiani Matos1 aCordeiro, Letícia Maria de Souza1 aSobrinho, Deny Bruce de Sousa1 aSantos, Robson Augusto Souza1 ade Almeida, Alvair Pinto1 aBotion, Leida Maria0 tLife sciences.g2012 Apr. 9, v. 90, no. 13-14 p.476-483dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001400275520144100289592002801730650002201758650001401780650002301794650002401817650001201841650002401853650001501877650001101892700002101903700002301924700002401947700002401971700002701995700002202022700002102044700002602065773010802091856008502199990002302284852000902307655001202316IND60102267620221118093159.0141106e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010226762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Ana C.10aTris(pyrazolyl)methane molybdenum tricarbonyl complexes as catalyst precursors for olefin epoxidation  ap. 64-74.  aThe molybdenum tricarbonyl complexes [Mo(CO)₃(HC(3,5-Me₂pz)₃)] (1) and [Mo(CO)₃(HC(pz)₃)] (2) (HC(3,5-Me₂pz)₃=tris(3,5-dimethyl-1-pyrazolyl)methane, HC(pz)₃=tris(1-pyrazolyl)methane) were obtained in good yields by the microwave-assisted reaction of Mo(CO)₆ with the respective organic ligand. Complete oxidative decarbonylation of 1 and 2 was achieved by reaction with excess tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) in 1,2-dichloroethane at 55°C. For complex 1, the (μ₂-oxo)bis[dioxomolybdenum(VI)] hexamolybdate of composition [{MoO₂(HC(3,5-Me₂pz)₃)}₂(μ₂-O)][Mo₆O₁₉] (3) was obtained in good yield, and its structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound (4) obtained by oxidative decarbonylation of 2 was not unambiguously identified, but may be chemically analogous to 3. Compounds 1–4 were examined for the first time as homogeneous (pre)catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins with TBHP, using different types of cosolvents at 55°C. During the catalytic reactions 1 and 2 transform in situ into 3 and 4, respectively, and the latter two are fairly stable catalysts. Catalytic tests and characterization studies of the recovered catalysts were carried out in an attempt to understand the kinetic differences observed between the compounds prepared in situ during the catalytic reaction and those prepared prior to the catalytic reaction, from the same precursor complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene dichloride 3amethane 3amicrowave treatment 3amolybdenum 3aolefin1 aNeves, Patrícia1 aFigueiredo, Sónia1 aFernandes, José A.1 aValente, Anabela A.1 aAlmeida Paz, Filipe A.1 aPillinger, Martyn1 aLopes, André D.1 aGonçalves, Isabel S.0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

A coupling procedure was used with γ-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APS) as coupling agent and silver nitrate as activator. The resultant Ni-Fe-P/FACs composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The results show that continuous and uniform films of Ni-Fe-P alloy were obtained on the surfaces of the FACs. DSC traces indicated that two distinct exothermic peaks appeared during the heat treatment, which moved to higher temperature with decrease in mole ratios of Ni²⁺/Fe²⁺ in the coating. XRD spectra confirmed that electroless Ni-Fe-P alloy deposits were amorphous in the as-plated condition, which transformed from the amorphous to crystalline phase with increase in calcining temperature. In addition, VSM data revealed that the resulting sample exhibited characteristics of soft magnetic materials at room temperature. The magnetic performances of the composites would be ameliorated with an increase in iron content in the coating and calcining temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3acoatings 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afly ash 3aheat production 3aheat treatment 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver nitrate 3atemperature1 aLi, Qin1 aWang, Bing1 aTao, Dejing1 aXu, Xiaotian1 aWang, Wei1 aZhai, Jianping0 tPowder technology.g2012 Aug., v. 226 p.246-252dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.04.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012200176300001600298520170100314592002802015650002102043650002602064650003002090650002702120650001402147650001402161650001902175650001802194650001902212650001302231650002002244650001502264650000902279650001902288650001502307650001402322650001502336650001302351650003102364650004002395650001402435700001702449700001802466700001702484700002002501700001702521700002102538700001902559773008102578856008602659852000902745655001202754IND60105451620221120025149.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010545162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi-Lin Sophia10aNovel cationic antimicrobial peptide GW-H1 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines  ap. 257-265.  aDue to its malignancy, the development of effective therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of urgent needs. Natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides (HDPs), not only act as direct antimicrobial agents, but also represent important regulators of the innate immune system. It has been reported that cationic AMPs may exhibit cancer-selective toxicity. We have designed a series of novel AMPs with potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. In the current study, we evaluate the antitumor potency of these AMPs toward HCC cell lines J5, Huh7, and Hep3B. Selected AMPs inhibit the viability of HCC cells in a dose-dependent fashion, while the normal 3T3 cells were significantly less susceptible to these AMPs. GW-H1 treatment (20μM) of J5 cells for 24–72h resulted in the induction of apoptosis, as revealed by flow cytometry (increased sub-G1 populations), and western blot analysis for the appearance of activated caspase-3, -7 and -9 cleavages. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was applied to further analyze the AMP-responsive protein profiles of HCC, down-regulation of Hsp27, phophoglycerate kinase 1 and triosephosphate isomerase indicated that GW-H1 may induce apoptosis, and further inhibit progression and metastasis of J5 HCC cells. FITC-labeled GW-H1 was found to attach to cell membrane initially, then translocated into the cytoplasm, and eventually membranous organelles or nucleus. GW-H1 induced a marked growth suppression of J5 xenografts in nude mice in a dose dependent manner. These findings provided support for future application of GW-H1 as potential therapeutic agent for HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-infective agents 3aanti-infective properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell membranes 3adose response 3aflow cytometry 3ahepatoma 3ainnate immunity 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aorganelles 3apathogens 3apopulation 3atoxicity 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aviability1 aLi, Jun-Hong1 aYu, Chao-Yuan1 aLin, Jingru,1 aChiu, Pai-Hsuan1 aChen, Po-Wen1 aLin, Chai Ching,1 aChen, Wei-Jung0 tPeptides.g2012 Aug., v. 36, no. 2 p.257-265dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016400171300001400335520127000349592002801619650001601647650002401663650001901687650003101706650003401737650001701771700001601788700001801804700001701822700001601839700001301855700001901868700001301887773008701900856008601987990002302073852000902096655001202105IND60110873720221121043500.0141109e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011087372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, M.L.10aCombining scanning tunneling microscopy and synchrotron radiation for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with chemical, electronic, and magnetic contrast  ap. 22-31.  aThe combination of high-brilliance synchrotron radiation with scanning tunneling microscopy opens the path to high-resolution imaging with chemical, electronic, and magnetic contrast. Here, the design and experimental results of an in-situ synchrotron enhanced x-ray scanning tunneling microscope (SXSTM) system are presented. The system is designed to allow monochromatic synchrotron radiation to enter the chamber, illuminating the sample with x-ray radiation, while an insulator-coated tip (metallic tip apex open for tunneling, electron collection) is scanned over the surface. A unique feature of the SXSTM is the STM mount assembly, designed with a two free-flex pivot, providing an angular degree of freedom for the alignment of the tip and sample with respect to the incoming x-ray beam. The system designed successfully demonstrates the ability to resolve atomic-scale corrugations. In addition, experiments with synchrotron x-ray radiation validate the SXSTM system as an accurate analysis technique for the study of local magnetic and chemical properties on sample surfaces. The SXSTM system's capabilities have the potential to broaden and deepen the general understanding of surface phenomena by adding elemental contrast to the high-resolution of STM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aexperimental design 3aimage analysis 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aChien, T.Y.1 aPreissner, C.1 aMadhavan, V.1 aDiesing, D.1 aBode, M.1 aFreeland, J.W.1 aRose, V.0 tUltramicroscopy.g2012 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.22-31dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.09.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300001600267520191900283592002802202650001002230650002102240650001002261650001202271650001702283650001102300650001502311650002802326650001002354650001502364650000902379700001802388700001602406700001302422700001702435700001702452700001402469700001902483700001502502700001802517773011102535856008202646990002302728852000902751655001202760IND60110472820221119002247.0141109e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011047282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Zhong-Ze10aStructure–inhibition relationship of ginsenosides towards UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)  ap. 149-154.  aThe wide utilization of ginseng provides the high risk of herb–drug interaction (HDI) with many clinical drugs. The inhibition of ginsenosides towards drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) has been regarded as an important reason for herb–drug interaction (HDI). Compared with the deep studies on the ginsenosides' inhibition towards cytochrome P450 (CYP), the inhibition of ginsenosides towards the important phase II enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) remains to be unclear. The present study aims to evaluate the inhibition behavior of ginsenosides towards important UGT isoforms located in the liver and intestine using in vitro methods. The recombinant UGT isoform-catalyzed 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation reaction was employed as in vitro probe reaction. The results showed that structure-dependent inhibition existed for the inhibition of ginsenosides towards UGT isoforms. To clarify the possibility of in vivo herb–drug interaction induced by this kind of inhibition, the ginsenoside Rg₃ was selected as an example, and the inhibition kinetic type and parameters (Kᵢ) were determined. Rg₃ competitively inhibited UGT1A7, 2B7 and 2B15-catalyzed 4-MU glucuronidation reaction, and exerted noncompetitive inhibition towards UGT1A8-catalyzed 4-MU glucuronidation. The inhibition parameters (Kᵢ values) were calculated to be 22.6, 7.9, 1.9, and 2.0μM for UGT1A7, 1A8, 2B7 and 2B15. Using human maximum plasma concentration of Rg₃ (400ng/ml (0.5μM)) after intramuscular injection of 60mg Rg₃, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was extrapolated to increase by 2.2%, 6.3%, 26.3%, and 25% for the co-administered drugs completely undergoing the metabolism catalyzed by UGT1A7, 1A8, 2B7 and 2B15, respectively. All these results indicated that the ginsenosides' inhibition towards UGT isoforms might be an important reason for ginseng–drug interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3acytochrome P-450 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aginsenosides 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aintramuscular injection 3aliver 3ametabolism 3arisk1 aCao, Yun-Feng1 aHu, Cui-Min1 aHong, Mo1 aSun, Xiao-Yu1 aGe, Guang-Bo1 aLiu, Yong1 aZhang, Yan-Yan1 aYang, Ling1 aSun, Hong-Zhi0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 267, no. 2 p.149-154dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.12.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006700167300001600234520120400250592002801454650002501482650001601507650001101523650001901534650002901553651001501582700002501597700002101622700001501643773010401658856008201762990002301844852000901867655001201876IND60108050020221119174215.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010805002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Ferdous10aAlternative energy resources in Bangladesh and future prospect  ap. 698-707.  aPresent energy scenario, alternative energy resources and future prospect in Bangladesh have been reviewed comprehensively and presented in this paper. This work compiles latest literatures in terms of thesis, journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on energy and renewable energy resources in Bangladesh. Deficiency in the energy sector is a major problem in Bangladesh, which hinders the smooth economic development workflows. Being the eighth most populated country in the world, Bangladesh is one of the most electricity deprived nations with a total electricity generation of only 5000MW. Thus, Bangladesh is facing difficulty to achieve an overall sustained progress in the economy due to the lack of a sound energy security. In this context, alternatives of conventional energy sources, renewable energy resources can be the sustainable solution for the energy security. This study has discovered the factors that are useful to lessen the existing power supply crisis and summarized the current energy scenario, lack of infrastructure and conventional energy sources to promote the renewable energy sources to fulfill the power demand in Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3arenewable energy sources 3aBangladesh1 aAl Amin, Abul Quasem1 aHasanuzzaman, M.1 aSaidur, R.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Sept., v. 25 p.698-707dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012100178300001400299520131200313592002801625650001501653650000801668650001301676650000901689650001401698650001201712650001801724650001101742700002401753700002601777700001801803700002101821700002101842700001801863773009801881856008501979852000902064655001202073IND60101395520221118085550.0141106e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010139552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.07.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittleston, Robert A.10aChromate reduction in Fe(II)-containing soil affected by hyperalkaline leachate from chromite ore processing residue  ap. 15-23.  aHighly alkaline (pH 12.2) chromate contaminated leachate (990μmolL⁻¹) has been entering soils below a chromite ore processing residue disposal (COPR) site for over 100 years. The soil immediately beneath the waste has a pH of 11→12.5, contains 0.3→0.5% (w/w) chromium, and 45→75% of the microbially available iron is Fe(II). Despite elevated pH, a viable microbial consortium of Firmicutes dominated iron reducers was isolated from this COPR affected soil. Soil pH and Cr concentration decrease with distance from the waste. XAS analysis of soil samples indicated that Cr is present as a mixed Cr(III)–Fe(III) oxy-hydroxide phase, suggesting that the elevated soil Cr content is due to reductive precipitation of Cr(VI) by Fe(II). Microcosm results demonstrate the capacity of COPR affected soil to abiotically remove all Cr(VI) from the leachate within 40 days. In air oxidation experiments less than 2% of the total Cr in the soil was remobilised despite significant Fe(II) oxidation. XAS analysis after air oxidation showed no change in Cr-speciation, indicating the Cr(III)-containing phase is a stable long term host for Cr. This work suggests that reductive precipitation of Cr(VI) is an effective method of contaminant immobilisation in soils where microbially produced Fe(II) is present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFirmicutes 3aair 3achromium 3airon 3aoxidation 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3awastes1 aStewart, Douglas I.1 aMortimer, Robert J.G.1 aTilt, Zana C.1 aBrown, Andrew P.1 aGeraki, Kalotina1 aBurke, Ian T.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 194 p.15-23dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001600273520074700289592002801036650002701064650002601091650000901117650001101126650002301137650001401160651001001174700001901184700001801203700001501221700002101236700002401257700002901281700001801310700002101328700002001349773010101369856008401470990002301554852000901577655001201586IND60104462220221118032419.0141107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010446222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micinf.2011.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuursted, Kurt10aVirulence of a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain carrying the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1)  ap. 155-158.  aThe aim of the study was to compare and evaluate virulence in five strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, including an isolate carrying New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In vivo virulence was assessed using a murine sepsis model and using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans killing model, and in vitro virulence by assessing various virulence factors. The NDM-1 carrying K. pneumoniae isolate was the most virulent in the murine sepsis model but there was no clear cut correlation to in vitro virulence factors or killing in C. elegans. It is concluded that K. pneumoniae carrying NDM-1 have an intrinsic virulence potential, which in coexistence with its multiresistance could promote and partly explain its epidemiological success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3amice 3amodels 3asepsis (infection) 3avirulence 3aIndia1 aSchøler, Lone1 aHansen, Frank1 aDam, Karen1 aBojer, Martin S.1 aHammerum, Anette M.1 aDagnæs-Hansen, Frederik1 aOlsen, Anders1 aJasemian, Yousef1 aStruve, Carsten0 tMicrobes and Infection.g2012 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.155-158dElsevier Masson SASx1286-45797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.08.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170300001600298520103300314592002801347650003701375650001801412650002901430650001301459650002001472650002101492650001801513650001601531650001801547650001601565650002501581700002301606700001601629700002101645700002301666700002001689700002001709700002001729773010501749856008501854852000901939655001201948IND60101028320221121023744.0141105e20120510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010102832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKee, Sara J.10aVirus-like particles and α-galactosylceramide form a self-adjuvanting composite particle that elicits anti-tumor responses  ap. 338-345.  aVirus-like particles (VLP) are effective vehicles for delivery of heterologous antigen to antigen-presenting cells. However VLP alone are insufficiently stimulatory to generate the signals required to facilitate effective priming of naïve T cells. We show that the VLP derived from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus can bind the galactose-containing adjuvant α-galactosylceramide to form a composite particle for co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant to the same antigen-presenting cell. Vaccination with VLP and α-galactosylceramide activated splenic iNKT cells to produce IFN-γ and IL-4, led to the generation of antigen-specific T cells that protected prophylactically against subcutaneous tumor challenge, and was more effective at generating anti-tumor immune responses than either component individually. These data demonstrate a novel method for immunopotentiating VLP to increase their efficacy in the generation of anti-tumor responses via the innate ligand recognition properties of calicivirus-derived nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3amethodology 3ananoparticles 3avaccination 3avirus-like particles1 aYoung, Vivienne L.1 aClow, Fiona1 aHayman, Colin M.1 aBaird, Margaret A.1 aHermans, Ian F.1 aYoung, Sarah L.1 aWard, Vernon K.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 May 10, v. 159, no. 3 p.338-345dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01391naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008800167300001800255520054300273592002800816650002000844650001100864650002600875773011100901856008101012990002301093852000901116655001201125IND60104087120221119195327.0141107e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunga, M.

A number of numerical implementations are also given to show the performance of this new method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2011 May, v. 53, no. 9-10 p.1970-1982dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.01.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100001700190245008500207300001600292506007600308520139400384592002801778506003701806650001601843650001401859650002201873650003701895650002301932650003801955650003501993650005902028650002402087650002402111700002502135700001502160773009602175856008302271852000902354655001202363IND60103137420221207083706.0141106e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010313742DNAL7 a210554892pmid7 aPMC31860612pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Gelio10aAssigning statistical significance to proteotypic peptides via database searches  ap. 199-211.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuerying MS/MS spectra against a database containing only proteotypic peptides reduces data analysis time due to reduction of database size. Despite the speed advantage, this search strategy is challenged by issues of statistical significance and coverage. The former requires separating systematically significant identifications from less confident identifications, while the latter arises when the underlying peptide is not present, due to single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) or post-translational modifications (PTMs), in the proteotypic peptide libraries searched. To address both issues simultaneously, we have extended RAId's knowledge database to include proteotypic information, utilized RAId's statistical strategy to assign statistical significance to proteotypic peptides, and modified RAId's programs to allow for consideration of proteotypic information during database searches. The extended database alleviates the coverage problem since all annotated modifications, even those that occurred within proteotypic peptides, may be considered. Taking into account the likelihoods of observation, the statistical strategy of RAId provides accurate E-value assignments regardless whether a candidate peptide is proteotypic or not. The advantage of including proteotypic information is evidenced by its superior retrieval performance when compared to regular database searches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3adatabases 3apeptide libraries 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aDatabases, Protein 2aInformation Storage and Retrieval 2aPeptidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aTrypsinxmetabolism1 aOgurtsov, Aleksey Y.1 aYu, Yi-Kuo0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 74, no. 2 p.199-211dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002200190245009000212300001900302520149000321592002801811650001901839650001301858650001301871650001701884650001301901650001701914650001701931650001301948650002401961650000901985650001501994650004502009650001002054650002102064650001102085650001102096650005402107650001102161650000902172650001902181700001702200700001602217700001802233773009602251856008302347990002302430852000902453655001202462IND60102583220221121232601.0141106e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010258322DNAL7 a220563522pmid7 aPMC34096902pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalbach, Susan M.10aPredictors of Blood Pressure and Its Control in Pediatric Patients Receiving Dialysis  ap. 621-625.e1.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate and characterize the degree of blood pressure (BP) control in children on chronic dialysis and to identify significant predictors of hypertension and BP control in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine trends in BP and BP control in a cross-sectional sample of patients on chronic dialysis aged 1-21 years enrolled in the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies registry from 1992-2008. RESULTS: At 6 months after dialysis initiation, 67.9% of patients had uncontrolled or untreated hypertension, and 57.8% were prescribed antihypertensive medications. More recent year of dialysis initiation was associated with a higher use of antihypertensive medication and lower systolic BP and diastolic BP z scores (P < .001) measured over time from 6 months to 3 years post dialysis initiation. Other factors associated with higher BP included black race, glomerular disease, younger age, hemodialysis (systolic BP only), and antihypertensive use. There were significant differences in BP control by dialysis modality and disease etiology, with patients on hemodialysis or those with glomerular diseases having the highest percentage of uncontrolled hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread antihypertensive use, many pediatric patients on dialysis are at risk for untreated or uncontrolled hypertension. Additional efforts are needed to improve management of hypertension in these children.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3achildren 3adialysis 3adrug therapy 3aetiology 3ahemodialysis 3ahypertension 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk 2aAdolescent 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aInfant 2aMale 2aRenal Dialysis1 aMartz, Karen1 aMattoo, Tej1 aFlynn, Joseph0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Apr., v. 160, no. 4 p.621-625.e1dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.09.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012600164300001200290520211700302592002802419650001102447650001602458650001102474650001302485650002002498650002002518650001102538650000902549650001702558650001802575650001802593650002002611650001202631650001902643650000902662650001302671650001502684650005202699650003202751651001002783700001702793700001702810700001402827700001602841700001502857773007802872856008502950990002303035852000903058655001203067IND60103443020221122114547.0141106e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010344302DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60522-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkoro, T10aDoes muscle inflammation influence recovery of muscle strength and function in patients undergoing total hip replacement?  ap. S82.  aBACKGROUND: Genetic markers of muscle inflammation (eg, tumour necrosis factor α [TNFα] and interleukin [IL] 6 are downregulated following repeated transient increases after bouts of exercise. Total hip replacement (THR) typically resolves preoperative pain, although strength deficits of 10–21% persist in the affected hip at 1 year postoperatively. This study assessed whether mRNA expression of TNFα and IL6 in the vastus lateralis (VL) of the operated leg was related to changes in the strength of the operated leg quadriceps in patients following THR. METHODS: Ten patients were recruited prospectively after ethical approval. Distal VL (5 cm proximal to lateral suprapatellar pouch) biopsy samples were obtained intraoperatively and at 6 weeks postoperatively, with maximal voluntary contraction of the operated leg quadriceps (MVCOLQ) in Newtons (N), assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks postoperatively. RT-PCR was used to assess mRNA expression in the biopsy samples and associations evaluated with Spearman's correlation coefficient. FINDINGS: Mean mRNA relative quotient (RQ) for comparison of 6 week intraoperative VL samples was 6·23 [SD 12·85] for TNFα and 17·10 [47·46] for IL6. Preoperatively, mean MVCOLQ was 188·90 N [76·84] and at 6 weeks it was 217·00 N [53·91]. There was no significant relation between TNFα or IL-6 RQ and absolute MVCOLQ at 6 weeks (r=0·115 [p=0·376] and −0·491 [p=0·075], respectively). No statistically significant relation existed between TNFα mRNA RQ and the improvement in MVCOLQ at 6 weeks (r=–0·498, p=0·071) nor with IL6 and the same measure (r=0·091, p=0·401). INTERPRETATION: There is a trend to correlation that exists for improvement in MVCOLQ with a reduction in TNFα mRNA expression, as well as between absolute MVCOLQ and reduction in IL-6 mRNA expression at 6 weeks postoperatively. Improvement in muscle strength may be mediated by reduced muscle inflammation and the associated reduction in pain in patients with severe osteoarthritis.

To allow rational selection of human antibodies with favorable characteristics for ADC development a screening tool was designed obviating the need of preparing individual covalently linked conjugates. Therefore, α-kappa-ETA′ was designed as a fusion protein consisting of a human kappa light chain binding antibody fragment and a truncated version of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. α-kappa-ETA′ specifically bound to human kappa light chains of human or human–mouse chimeric antibodies and Fab fragments. Antibody-redirected α-kappa-ETA′ specifically inhibited proliferation of antigen-expressing cell lines at low toxin and antibody concentrations. Selected antibodies that efficiently delivered α-kappa-ETA′ in the novel assay system were used to generate scFv-based covalently linked immunotoxins. These molecules efficiently triggered apoptosis of target cells, indicating that antibodies identified in our assay system can be converted to functional immunoconjugates. Finally, a panel of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies was screened — demonstrating favorable characteristics with antibody 2F8. These data suggest that antibodies with potential for Pseudomonas exotoxin A-based ADC development can be identified using the novel α-kappa-ETA′ conjugate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3achimerism 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aexotoxins 3ahumans 3ascreening 3atherapeutics1 aBleeker, W.K.1 aLammerts van Bueren, J.J.1 aStaudinger, M.1 aKlausz, K.1 aDerer, S.1 aGlorius, P.1 aMuskulus, A.1 ade Goeij, B.E.C.G.1 avan de Winkel, J.G.J.1 aParren, P.W.H.I.1 aValerius, T.1 aGramatzki, M.1 aPeipp, M.0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 Aug. 31, v. 371, no. 1-2 p.122-133dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008300167300001600250520129700266592002801563650001501591650001501606650001401621650001701635650001601652650001301668650001901681650002201700650002601722650001401748650001901762650001701781650001101798650001001809700001101819700001901830700001201849700001501861700002101876773007001897856008201967990002302049852000902072655001202081IND60102835420221121015451.0141106e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010283542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, M.R.10aLong term storage of biodiesel/petrol diesel blends in polyethylene fuel tanks  ap. 771-779.  aThis paper explores the long-term effects that an ageing biodiesel fuel blended with low sulfur diesel fuel at concentrations of 0%, 15%, 50%, 85%, and 100% (v/v) can have on polyethylene materials. Rotationally molded fuel tanks made of linear low density polyethylene or crosslinked polyethylene were used to appropriately mimic the storage environment of fuels, though the study also considered immersed polymer specimens as this test approach is more commonly reported on in the literature. The extent of oxidation for the fuels was monitored by determination of its peroxide value and acid number over time, with both values being consistently higher for blends with higher biodiesel content. Storage at 80°C for up to 56days resulted in significant oxidation of the fuel while testing up to 380days at 23°C produced no change in peroxide or acid concentration. The change in mechanical properties for the polyethylenes due to fuel was determined by tensile testing. Comparing the tensile data to the oxidation species in the stored fuels revealed that noted mechanical losses did not correspond with higher concentration of hydroperoxides or acid species but rather occurred as a result of fuel absorption. No difference was found in this regards between the two polyethylene species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacid value 3abiodiesel 3acrosslinking 3adiesel fuel 3agasoline 3ahydroperoxides 3along term effects 3amechanical properties 3aoxidation 3aperoxide value 3apolyethylene 3asulfur 3atanks1 aMu, B.1 aEwaschuk, C.M.1 aCai, Y.1 aOxby, K.J.1 aVlachopoulos, J.0 tFuel.g2013 June, v. 108 p.771-779dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.02.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013000164300001600294520087200310592002801182650000801210650001301218650002001231650001701251650003901268650001801307650000701325650001401332700001801346700001701364773009801381856008101479990002301560852000901583655001201592IND60108519020221117034456.0141108e20110810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010851902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Yongnian10aStudy of the interaction between 10-hydroxycamptothecine and DNA with the use of ethidium bromide dye as a fluorescence probe  ap. 290-297.  aThe interaction of 10-hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT) with DNA under pseudo-physiological conditions (Tris–HCl buffer of pH 7.4), using ethidium bromide (EB) dye as a probe, was investigated with the use of spectrofluorimetry, UV–vis spectrometry and viscosity measurement. The binding constant and binding number for HCPT with DNA were evaluated as (7.1±0.5)×10⁴M⁻¹ and 1.1, respectively, by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). Moreover, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was applied to resolve the three-way fluorescence data obtained from the interaction system, and the concentration information for the three components of the system at equilibrium was simultaneously obtained.

The heat-resistant PET nonwoven is employed as a physical support to suppress thermal shrinkage of the NW-separator. A distinctive characteristic of the NW-separator is the well-connected interstitial voids formed between compactly packed SiO₂ nanoparticles adhered by polyvinylidene fluoride–hexafluoropropylene (PVdF–HFP) binders. This allows for the evolution of highly percolated, electrolyte-philic microporous architecture in the NW-separator. In comparison to a commercialized polyethylene (PE) separator, the NW-separator featuring the aforementioned structural uniqueness exhibits substantial improvements in porosity, air permeability, and electrolyte wettability, which contribute to the facile ionic transport and retarded growth of cell impedance during cycling. As a result, superior cell performance is obtained in the NW-separator. Notably, this advantageous effect of the NW-separator on cell performance becomes more pronounced at challenging charge/discharge conditions of high voltages (herein, 4.4 V) and high current densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3asilica 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3acell growth 3aelectrolytes 3aporosity 3ashrinkage 3apolyethylene 3aair 3agrowth retardation 3aelectric power 3awettability 3acommercialization 3apermeability 3abatteries 3ananoparticles 0aimpedance1 aChoi, Eun-Sun1 aLee, Sang-Young1 aKim, Jong Hun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 415-416 p.513-519dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008100160300001600241520122000257592002801477650000801505650001401513650001601527650002001543650001101563650001801574650002101592650001901613700001801632773009801650856008101748990002301829852000901852655001201861IND60108519120221117033838.0141108e20110810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010851912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Rui10aDetecting adenosine with an autonomic cycle of cascading DNA polymerizations  ap. 298-303.  aIn this study, an autonomic DNA-reaction cycle involving two cascading DNA polymerization steps was established and utilized for adenosine detection. The reaction cycle was operated based on a probe that was immobilized on the magnetic beads (MBs) and tagged with PbS nanoparticle (NP). Adenosine, as the target, was recognized by its aptamer segment in the probe to initiate the cycle. Two strand-displacement polymerizations took place successively, and in the second polymerization, adenosine was released into the solution, which was then able to initiate another round of cycle. The cycles were automatically repeated, thus adenosine was repetitively utilized as target, amplifying the signal to a great extent. The PbS NP tags were released with the aptamer segments in the cycle, after being separated from the MBs, they were quantified with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). It was found that adenosine could be quantified in the range from 2.0×10⁻¹¹M to 1.0×10⁻⁹M. The detection limit was 3.6×10⁻¹²M based on 3σ rule. Good selectivity against the analogous nucleosides was shown for this system. The system was also proven to be capable of detecting adenosine in real human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenosine 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerization1 aZou, Yuanming0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Aug. 10, v. 156, no. 1 p.298-303dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013100174300001600305520218800321592002802509650001402537650001302551650002302564650001302587650003402600650001202634650003002646650001102676650001102687650001402698650001702712650001202729650001602741650001302757651001002770700002102780700001902801773007702820856008502897852000902982655001202991IND60111245020221119130551.0141109e20120427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011124502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRheingans, Richard10aDistributional impact of rotavirus vaccination in 25 GAVI countries: Estimating disparities in benefits and cost-effectiveness  ap. A15-A23.  aBACKGROUND: Other studies have demonstrated that the impact and cost effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination differs among countries, with greater mortality reduction benefits and lower cost-effectiveness ratios in low-income and high-mortality countries. This analysis combines the results of a country level model of rotavirus vaccination published elsewhere with data from Demographic and Health Surveys on within-country patterns of vaccine coverage and diarrhea mortality risk factors to estimate within-country distributional effects of rotavirus vaccination. The study examined 25 countries eligible for funding through the GAVI Alliance. METHODS: For each country we estimate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination for each wealth quintile assuming current vaccination patterns and for a scenario where vaccine coverage is equalized to the highest quintile's coverage. In the case of India, variations in coverage and risk proxies by state were modeled to estimate geographic distributional effects. RESULTS: In all countries, rates of vaccination were highest and risks of mortality were lowest in the top two wealth quintiles. However countries differ greatly in the relative inequities in these two underlying variables. Similarly, in all countries examined, the cost-effectiveness ratio for vaccination ($/Disability-Adjusted Life Year averted, DALY) is substantially greater in the higher quintiles (ranging from 2–10 times higher). In all countries, the greatest potential benefit of vaccination was in the poorest quintiles. However, due to reduced vaccination coverage, projected benefits for these quintiles were often lower. Equitable coverage was estimated to result in an 89% increase in mortality reduction for the poorest quintile and a 38% increase overall. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus vaccination is most cost-effective in low-income groups and regions. However in many countries, simply adding new vaccines to existing systems targets investments to higher income children, due to disparities in vaccination coverage. Maximizing health benefits for the poorest children and value for money require increased attention to these distributional effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3achildren 3acost effectiveness 3adiarrhea 3adisability-adjusted life year 3afunding 3ageographical distribution 3aincome 3amodels 3amortality 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aIndia1 aAtherly, Deborah1 aAnderson, John0 tVaccine.g2012 Apr. 27, v. 30S1 p.A15-A23dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009700168300001600265520233600281592002802617650001102645650002502656650001202681650002302693650001502716650001102731650002402742650001102766650001102777650001602788650001402804650001402818650002602832650001202858650001102870651001002881700001202891700001802903773008802921856008703009990002303096852000903119655001203128IND60108193820221122032757.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010819382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Yalin10aEconomic and social effects analysis of mineral development in China and policy implications  ap. 448-457.  aMineral development has contributed greatly to China's economic and social development. Many challenges remain, however, including environmental pollution and resource waste in practice, as well as a dearth of systematic theoretical research. The goal of this study is to analyze the economic and social effects of various mineral developments in China from diversified perspectives, so as to provide the basis for the formulation of China's mineral development policy. The input–output effects, industrial linkage effects and income distribution effects of different mining industries are quantitatively analyzed by adopting basic hypotheses of input–output economics, industrial linkage model and income distribution antitheses based on the latest available official data from China Statistical Yearbook from 2004 to 2010 and the 2007 Input–Output Table of China. The empirical results obtained in this study indicate that all mineral development industries, especially coal mining and washing, and petroleum and natural gas extraction industries, have given a strong impetus to the increase of China's fixed asset investment and GDP. Moreover, they have provided a large number of jobs, thereby alleviating ongoing employment pressure, and they have also played a positive role in promoting China's technology investment. The analysis of industrial linkages demonstrates that mining industries are basic to the national economy and produce a significant impetus to its downstream industries, but create weak pull effects in terms of national economic development. From the perspective of income distribution, mining industries play an important role in increasing China's fiscal revenue and per capital income. Hence, China's mineral development policy should (1) encourage additional investment in technology for exploration and development to insure sufficient supply and expand the input effects; (2) attract additional talent to work in remote regions; (3) optimize the industrial structure and promote the industrial transformation in resource regions; (4) adjust the interest distribution between the central and local governments to enable the local regions to become more self-sufficient; and (5) enhance the legal environment so that companies can more readily undertake their social responsibilities voluntarily.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abusiness enterprises 3acapital 3adevelopment policy 3aemployment 3aincome 3aincome distribution 3amining 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apetroleum 3apollution 3aquantitative analysis 3awashing 3awastes 3aChina1 aCui, Na1 aPan, Dongyang0 tResources policy.g2013 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.448-457dElsevier Ltdx0301-42077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165300001600304520109500320592002801415650001501443650002301458650001401481650003801495650001101533650001801544650001801562650001801580650002601598650002701624650001301651650001401664650001501678650000901693650001701702650003201719700002001751700002001771700002201791700001601813700001801829700002101847700001801868700002301886700001901909773011101928856008102039852000902120655001202129IND60101640420221118020803.0141106e20110831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010164042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFindlay, Lucy10aComparison of novel methods for predicting the risk of pro-inflammatory clinical infusion reactions during monoclonal antibody therapy  ap. 134-142.  aTwo methods for predicting the risk of pro-inflammatory clinical infusion reactions during monoclonal antibody therapy were evaluated. In the first, the antibody of interest is immobilised by air-drying onto 96-well plates prior to the addition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the second, the antibody is added in aqueous phase to a co-culture of human PBMCs and human endothelium-derived cells. In both methods the cells are incubated with the antibody to allow the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibodies associated with clinical infusion reactions, Herceptin, Campath-1H and TGN1412, gave the largest responses taking into account the data for all readouts (tumour necrosis factor-α, TNF, interleukin-6, IL-6, IL-8, IL-2 and cell proliferation) for both methods. Overall, the antibodies tested could be ranked as follows: Tysabri<Avastin<Herceptin<Campath-1H<TGN1412, with only the “superagonistic” CD28 monoclonal antibody (TGN1412) stimulating IL-2 release and cell proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aprediction 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aEastwood, David1 aBall, Christina1 aRobinson, C.

In this contribution, it is shown that their computational argument cannot be used for this purpose, since after the improvement of their orthogonal projection method, it gives very similar results to those criticised in their paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3anaphthalene 3azeolites1 aPálinkó, István0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 279, no. 1 p.229-230dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2011.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167300001400283520090000297592002801197650000801225650001501233650002201248650001501270650002001285650002601305650002001331650003301351700002001384700002201404700001601426700001501442700001701457773009901474856008101573990002301654852000901677655001201686IND60108440420221119210904.0141108e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010844042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaschenko, A.A.10aOn the feasibility to apply a neural network processor for analyzing a gas response of a multisensor microarray  ap. 61-65.  aWe describe an effort to implement a hardware neural network processor to carry out pattern recognition of signals generated by a multisensor microarray of electronic-nose type.

Some micro phenomena, such as ‘anomalous rotation’, ‘rotation shift’ and ‘zig-zag’ migration are observed for one particle sedimentation, depending on the initial particle position and the mean terminal settling Reynolds number. The ‘anomalous rotation’ is related to the wall effect, and the ‘rotation shift’ as well as the ‘zig-zag’ migration is closely associated with the vortex shedding. For the cases of two particles settling near a vertical wall side by side, the outside particle always rotates anomalously except when vortex sheds from the particle and the ‘rotation shift’ occurs. But the inside particle may rotate normally or anomalously at the early stage of the sedimentation, depending on the ratio of the initial distance between the two particles to the initial distance between this particle and the wall. For the heavier particle, alternate vortex shedding eventually happens, leading to the ‘rotation shift’. Even for the lighter particle without vortex shedding, ‘rotation shift’ may also appear to the inside particle, which is related to competition between the wall effect and the effect of the outside particle. In addition, it is found that three-dimensionality imposes additional effect on the rotation behaviors of particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprocessing technology 3asimulation models 3aReynolds number 3apowders 0amathematical models1 aWei, Anyang1 aWang, Zeli1 aFan, Jianren0 tPowder technology.g2013 Sept., v. 245 p.115-125dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2013.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010500168300001800273520044600291592002800737650003300765650002300798650002300821650001300844650002600857650000900883700002100892700001800913700002400931773008800955856008101043852000901124655001201133IND60109376120221119165230.0141109e20110603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010937612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarko, Ampofo K.10aCarbonylation of functionalized diamine diols to cyclic ureas: application to derivatives of DMP 450  ap. 3976-3983.  aSynthesis of the cyclic urea core structure of the HIV protease inhibitor DMP 450 has been achieved via W(CO)₆/I₂-catalyzed carbonylation of diamine intermediates.

Understanding of proteome changes that mediate oxidative stress-induced degeneration of RPE cells may provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of retinal diseases. In the current study, comparative proteomics has been applied to investigate global changes of RPE proteins under oxidative stress. Proteomic techniques, including 2D SDS-PAGE, differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and tandem time-of-flight (TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry, were used to identify early protein markers of oxidative stress in the RPE. Two biological models of RPE cells revealed several differentially expressed proteins that are involved in key cellular processes such as energy metabolism, protein folding, redox homeostasis, cell differentiation, and retinoid metabolism. Our results provide a new perspective on early signaling molecules of redox imbalance in the RPE and putative therapeutic target proteins of RPE diseases caused by oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3aenergy metabolism 3aepithelium 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeostasis 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aphagocytosis 3aphotoreceptors 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein folding 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aretinal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aEye Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOxidative Stress 2aRetinal Pigment Epitheliumxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aLee, Hyunju1 aZhang, Ruonan1 aChung, Hyewon1 aHunt, Richard C.1 aJahng, Wan Jin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 74, no. 2 p.254-261dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245009600218300001600314506007600330520074100406592002801147506003701175650001401212650001701226650001601243650001701259650001001276650001801286650001401304650002101318650001701339700002201356700001901378700002301397773010501420856008501525852000901610655001201619IND60101028620221207121823.0141105e20120510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010102862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.02.0302doi7 aPMC33483772pmcid7 a224214242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDaniel, Jonathan R.10aDoxorubicin-conjugated chimeric polypeptide nanoparticles that respond to mild hyperthermia  ap. 362-367.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper reports the design, physicochemical characterization and in vitro cytotoxicity of a thermally responsive chimeric polypeptide (CP), derived from an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). The CP self-assembles into ~40nm diameter nanoparticles upon conjugation of multiple copies of doxorubicin (Dox), and displays a nanoparticle-to-aggregate phase transition between 39 and 42°C in media, a temperature range suitable for mild hyperthermia of solid tumors. The CP-Dox nanoparticle is stable upon dilution to low micromolar concentrations, and is cytotoxic at both 37 and 42°C.

Survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and prognostic factors were tested with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Between January 1987 and December 2008, 214 patients underwent Kasai surgery for BA. In this series, the 4-year transplant-free survival was 46%±4%, and 4-year overall survival was 73%±3%. Clearance of jaundice, surgery within 60 days, and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis use were independently associated with increased transplant-free survival. The yearly caseload per center (range, 0.5-2.1) was not correlated with transplant-free survival (r=0.024; P=.73). CONCLUSION: During the past 2 decades, outcome parameters have remained constant and are comparable with those reported from other Western countries, despite a relatively low annual caseload per center. Timely surgical correction and postoperative antibiotic therapy were associated with a higher transplant-free survival rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aantibiotics 3abilirubin 3achildren 3adatabases 3adisease control 3ajaundice 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3asurgery 3asurvival rate 2aBiliary Atresiaxdiagnosisxsurgery. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands1 ade Langen, Zacharias J.1 aGroen, Henk1 aScheenstra, Rene1 aPeeters, Paul M.J.G.1 aHulscher, Jan B.F.1 aVerkade, Henkjan J.2 aNetherlands Study Group of Biliary Atresia and Registry (NeSBAR)0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Apr., v. 160, no. 4 p.638-644.e2dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.09.0613Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001200282520238100294592002802675650002402703650001702727650001802744650002202762650001002784650002702794650001502821650001402836650001502850650002002865650002402885650001602909650001702925651001702942700001902959700002002978700001802998700001903016700002103035700001903056700002103075700002103096700002203117700002503139700002103164773007803185856008503263990002303348852000903371655001203380IND60103443320221120233852.0141106e20130617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010344332DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61308-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroenewald, Pam10aStrengthening local-level cause of death surveillance: a case study of Western Cape Province, South Africa  ap. S54.  aBACKGROUND: The Western Cape Province has a local-level mortality surveillance system that has been upgraded to do automated cause of death coding using IRIS software, in concordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. This paper reviews the achievements in providing district-level and subdistrict-level mortality data, and describes the lessons learnt and the challenges for sustaining such a system. METHODS: Cause of death coding was upgraded from a shortlist to full ICD-10 coding for natural causes of death in a customised data capture system. We manually coded injury deaths information obtained from mortuaries. We continuously reviewed the development of the project to identify the progress, challenges, and lessons learnt. FINDINGS: A total of 33 564 deaths from natural causes were coded for 2009, with 9·4% (95% CI 9·1–9·7) due to ill-defined causes. We estimated that completeness was 83·7% (95% CI 76·9–90·4) and provided mortality profiles for all health districts for the first time, highlighting district variations in age-standardised mortality rates, although HIV and tuberculosis were the leading causes of premature mortality across all districts. We learned of the necessity of training data capturers in medical terminology and doctors in death certification, as well as building quality assurance measures into the system. Local cause of death coding enables quality issues to be identified and addressed directly at source. IRIS makes it possible to standardise coding across districts for routine cases. Dissemination of local mortality information creates a demand for updated results, which are sometimes difficult to meet. Challenges include securing the appropriate resource allocation, integrating into a fragmented health system, and ensuring co-operation between government departments. Utilisation of information technology opportunities (eg, electronic registration of death) remains a challenge. INTERPRETATION: IRIS-automated coding software has made it possible to provide routine ICD-10 cause of death coding at local level in South Africa, providing opportunities for improving the quality and use of mortality data at both local and national levels.

The dehydrogenation turn-over frequency (TOF) and selectivity to the completely dehydrogenated product, N-ethylcarbazole, were dependent upon Pd particle size, with a maximum in both occurring with a 4wt.% Pd/SiO₂ catalyst that had an average Pd particle size of 9nm. Over this catalyst, the dehydrogenation reaction proceeded to complete conversion within 22min and complete H₂ recovery (5.8wt.%) within 1.6h at 443K and 101kPa. The structure sensitivity of the reaction and the observed product distribution are discussed in view of DFT calculations that showed that the adsorption of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole on Pd required multiple catalytic sites and the heat of adsorption was dependent upon the surface structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aair 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aparticle size1 aSmith, Kevin J.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 279, no. 1 p.36-47dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168300001800295520064400313592002800957650002200985650001801007650001801025650003301043650001701076650001501093700001201108700001701120700001601137700001901153700001201172773009601184856008401280990002301364852000901387655001201396IND60103695720221122042209.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Jun bo10aFabrication and photocatalytic activity of ZnO prepared by different precipitants using paralled flaw precipitation method  ap. 1995-1997.  aParalled flaw precipitation method has been employed to fabricate nanostructured ZnO. It is found that the morphology and photocatalytic activity of ZnO has a strong dependence on the kind of precipitant. The mixed weak base is the key to determine the honeycomb-like nanostructure of ZnO. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by BET, XRD and SEM. The results show that ZnO prepared by the mixed weak base possesses the highest BET surface area, pore volume, the smallest pore size and the particle average size. ZnO prepared by the mixed weak base exhibits the best photocatalytic activity and the possible reason was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ananomaterials 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3azinc oxide1 aXu, Bin1 aFeng, Fa Mei1 aHe, Xi yang1 aLi, Jian zhang1 aHu, Wei0 tMaterials letters.g2011 June 30, v. 65, no. 12 p.1995-1997dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0633Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010100170300001400271520121400285592002801499650001501527650002101542650002501563650001701588650001701605650002101622650002201643650001301665650001901678650001701697650000901714700001901723700002201742700001801764700001901782700002101801773010601822856008101928990002302009852000902032655001202041IND60107621520221120223128.0141108e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010762152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Surinder M.10aSolubilization of inclusion body proteins using n-propanol and its refolding into bioactive form  ap. 75-82.  aInclusion bodies of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) were isolated from Escherichia coli, enriched and solubilized in 100mM Tris buffer containing 6M n-propanol and 2M urea. Around 4mg/ml of r-hGH from inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6M n-propanol-based buffer containing 2M urea. Existence of native-like secondary structure of r-hGH in 6M n-propanol solution was confirmed by CD and fluorescence spectra. Solubilized r-hGH was subsequently refolded by pulsatile dilution, purified to homogeneity and found to be functionally active. Tris buffer containing 6M n-propanol and 2M urea also effectively solubilized a number of proteins expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Mild solubilization of inclusion body proteins, chaotropic effect of n-propanol at high concentration and kosmotropic effect at lower concentration helped in improved refolding of the solubilized protein. Around 40% of the r-hGH in the form of inclusion body aggregates was refolded into bioactive form while using n-propanol as solubilization agent. Solubilization with 6M n-propanol solution thus can be a viable alternative for achieving high throughput recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies of E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aEscherichia coli 3abioactive properties 3afluorescence 3ahuman growth 3ainclusion bodies 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asolubilization 3asomatotropin 3aurea1 aSharma, Aparna1 aUpadhyay, Arun K.1 aSingh, Anupam1 aGarg, Lalit C.1 aPanda, Amulya K.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.75-82dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012500164300001800289520078500307592002801092650001701120650001701137650003001154700001501184700001101199700001501210700001301225773009601238856008401334990002301418852000901441655001201450IND60103695820221122042311.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, G.Q.10aConcentration detection of quantum dots in the visible and near-infrared range based on surface plasmon resonance sensor  ap. 1998-2000.  aWe employ an optical sensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) operating in the near-infrared and in the visible range to determine the concentration of CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots (QDs) which are embedded in the SU8 organic films. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) measurements show that the amplitude of the shift of the resonance dip is closely related to the concentration variation of QDs in the organic films and the incident laser. The sensitivity is enhanced by 1.5-time and the detect limitation is expanded to 10⁻⁵μmol/L in the visible range as compared to that in the near-infrared. The sensitivity enhancement and the expansion of detect limitation of the visible SPR sensor may originate from the coupling of surface plasmons to luminescence from QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aluminescence 3aquantum dots 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aTang, F.L.1 aLi, L.1 aGong, L.X.1 aYe, Z.Q.0 tMaterials letters.g2011 June 30, v. 65, no. 12 p.1998-2000dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0883Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04249naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001200282520233100294592002802625650002002653650002502673650001302698650001402711650002002725650002202745650002202767650002102789650001602810651001002826651001002836651001102846651001102857700001602868700001802884700002402902700001802926700002102944700002102965700001902986700001903005700002103024700002203045700002003067700002803087700002003115700001903135700001803154700002003172700001803192700002103210700001703231700002003248700001803268700001803286700001403304700002303318700002703341773007803368856008503446990002303531852000903554655001203563IND60103443520221120222459.0141106e20130617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010344352DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61310-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanlon, Michael14aThe production and costs of health service across four African countries: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia  ap. S56.  aBACKGROUND: Few data exist for the production or costs of health service in developing countries. Consequently, researchers and policy makers have not been able to clearly identify technical or allocative inefficiencies in the provision of care. To remedy this shortcoming, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, UNICEF, and others have collaborated on de-novo costing exercises across a dozen developing countries. This project has engaged in-country partners to survey over 2300 health facilities. These facilities range from large, referral hospitals to small clinics and pharmacies. Facility-level data are supplemented by centralised information from ministries of health and other national-level financing agents. In most countries, panel data were collected, from 2007 to 2011. METHODS: Data collection and analysis is ongoing in many countries, but it is complete for a subset, including four African countries: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia. This work will report descriptive values of costs and provision across these countries, as well as results from country-level and cross-country production and cost functions. We particularly focus on quantifying technical inefficiencies in service provision, and on identifying how the degree of those inefficiencies has changed over time. FINDINGS: Patterns in expenditure and levels of service provision vary across countries, and these differences are in part explained by each country's level of economic development. Personnel expenditure is more important in less-developed countries and less-sophisticated facilities, and in general levels of service provision have increased at a faster rate than either personnel counts or expenditure. INTERPRETATION: These data and subsequent analyses are critically important to in-country policy makers and international donors. Undoubtedly, the demand for health service will increase in these countries along with population growth and economic wealth. To maintain (let alone improve) current service levels, policy makers must understand the sources and degrees of inefficiency in service provision, and have reliable estimates of the costs of expanding service. This study is the most comprehensive exercise conducted to date to understand these issues across countries.

However, there is growing evidence that antiviral treatment of infections with avian-derived strains even as late as 6 days post-infection (dpi) can significantly reduce infection severity and duration. Using a mathematical model of in-host influenza viral infections which can capture the kinetics of both a short-lived, typical, seasonal infection and a severe infection exhibiting sustained viral titer, we explore differences in the effects of NAI treatment on both types of influenza viral infections. Comparison of our model's behavior against experimental data from patients naturally infected with avian strains yields estimates for the times at which patients were infected that are consistent with those reported by the patients, and estimates of drug efficacies that are lower for patients who died than for those who recovered. In addition, our model suggests that the sustained, high, viral titers often seen in more severe influenza virus infections are the reason why antiviral treatment delayed by as much as 6 dpi will still lead to reduced viral titers and shortened illness. We conclude that NAIs may be an effective and beneficial treatment strategy against more severe strains of influenza virus characterized by high, sustained, viral titers. We believe that our mathematical model will be an effective tool in guiding treatment of severe influenza viral infections with antivirals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3abirds 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3amathematical models 3apatients 3asialidase 3aviral load 2aAnimals 2aAntiviral Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBirdsxvirology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInfluenza in Birdsxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aInfluenza, Humanxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aModels, Biological 2aNeuraminidasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aOseltamivirxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aViral Loadxdrug effects1 aGieschke, Ronald1 aDavies, Brian E.1 aJumbe, Nelson L.1 aBeauchemin, Catherine A.A.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Jan. 21, v. 269, no. 1 p.234-244dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010300172300001400275520078900289592002801078650002901106650001101135650001201146650001101158650001501169650001001184700001901194700002001213773012001233856008201353990002301435852000901458655001201467IND60101233320221121230552.0141106e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010123332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKallbekken, Steffen10aDo you not like Pigou, or do you not understand him? Tax aversion and revenue recycling in the lab  ap. 53-64.  aTax-aversion reduces the likelihood that price rationing can be a politically viable tool for environmental protection. We examine the case of the classic Pigouvian tax to control a negative externality, and consider how recycling the revenues, labeling of the tax and information about its purpose affects the support for taxation. We test the support for taxation within a single-price market experiment, in which purchases by some buyers impose external costs on others. Observing behavior consistent with tax-aversion, we also find that recycling the revenues to more narrowly targeted groups seems to increase support for taxation. In the absence of narrow revenue recycling, labeling a Pigouvian instrument as a ‘tax’ may significantly lower the likelihood of voter support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3aincome 3amarkets 3aprices 3apurchasing 3ataxes1 aKroll, Stephan1 aCherry, Todd L.0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2011 July, v. 62, no. 1 p.53-64dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017700165300001600342520106600358592002801424650001301452650002001465650001501485650001501500650000701515650001401522700002501536700002001561700001801581773008801599856008101687990002301768852000901791655001201800IND60108767620221120030753.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010876762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, Carlos10aHigh sensitivity adsorptive stripping voltammetric method for antimony(III) determination in the presence of quercetin-5′-sulfonic acid. Substituent effect on sensitivity  ap. 560-567.  aA high sensitivity method for voltammetric determination of Sb(III) using quercetin-5′-sulfonic acid (QSA) as complexing and adsorbing agent is presented. The Sb–QSA is accumulated on the electrode surface and then reduced at about −0.67V. Optimal analytical conditions were pH: 5.5, CQSA: 3.0μmolL⁻¹, Eₐdₛ: −0.10V and tₐdₛ: 60s. The detection limit (3σ) depends on accumulation time, reaching 3.6ngL⁻¹ and 1.6ngL⁻¹ with tₐdₛ of 60s and 180s, respectively. Peak current is proportional to Sb(III) concentration up to 10.0μgL⁻¹ and 1.5μgL⁻¹ with tₐdₛ of 60s and 180s, respectively. The relative standard deviation were 1.7% and 2.5% for a solution containing 1.0μgL⁻¹ and 5.0μgL⁻¹ of Sb(III), respectively (n=10). Interference by other metal ions was studied. The proposed method was applied to the determination of antimony in natural and spiked water samples, with satisfactory results. The method was designed in order to compare the sensitivity of the methods that use quercetin and the sulfonic derivative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3ametal ions 3apH 3aquercetin1 aArancibia, Verónica1 aGómez, Marisol1 aNagles, Edgar0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Aug., v. 185 p.560-567dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.0583Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010700165300001600272520085800288592002801146650002201174650003701196650001301233650002401246650001801270650001501288650003401303650001901337650001701356650001501373700001501388700001801403700001501421700001501436773008601451856008401537990002301621852000901644655001201653IND60103844820221119093444.0141107e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010384482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Libo10aMicrowave-assisted synthesis and photocatalytic performance of Ag-doped hierarchical ZnO architectures  ap. 277-280.  aHierarchical ZnO and Ag doped ZnO nanostructures have been successfully fabricated on a large scale using zinc acetate and silver nitrate as starting reactants via a microwave-assisted process. The structural and morphologies of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocatalytic property of the Ag/ZnO heterostructures is evaluated by photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under UV–vis illumination. Results of photodegradation tests reveal that the Ag doped hierarchical ZnO microspheres show much better photocatalytic activity than pure ZnO nanomaterials. The excellent photocatalytic activities can be ascribed to the high effective electron–hole separation which results in the significant improvement of the photocatalytic activity of ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3alighting 3amicrowave treatment 3ananomaterials 3aphotolysis 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilver nitrate 3azinc acetate 3azinc oxide1 aHu, Qianku1 aLi, Zhengyang1 aGuo, Jinyu1 aLi, Yanwei0 tMaterials letters.g2012 July 15, v. 79 p.277-280dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167300001800281520088600299592002801185650001101213650002101224650002601245650002601271650001801297650000901315700002001324700001701344700001401361700001401375773009601389856008401485990002301569852000901592655001201601IND60103696020221122051614.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hongming12aA pressure enhanced CVD method for large scale synthesis of carbon microtubes and their mechanical properties  ap. 2004-2006.  aCarbon microtubes (CMTs) are a new morphological form of carbon with micrometer scale internal diameters and thin walls made of a few graphitic layers.

In this paper, we report a gas pressure enhanced CVD method for large-scale preparation of high-purity, crystalline and thin-walled CMTs in a gas pressure furnace using urea as raw material in the absence of catalyst. The as-obtained CMTs have highly graphitized structure and have a homogenous morphology with an internal diameter of about 1μm, a wall thickness of 5nm and several millimeters in length. The Young's modulus of the CMTs was determined to be 0.652TPa on average, which is comparable to that of carbon nanotubes reported in previous research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3araw materials 3aurea1 aHuang, Xiaoxiao1 aWen, Guangwu1 aZhong, Bo1 aXia, Long0 tMaterials letters.g2011 June 30, v. 65, no. 12 p.2004-2006dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0923Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009400174300001600268520099500284592002801279650002301307650002301330650000901353650002501362650001301387650002401400650002001424650001301444650001301457650001601470650001001486650001601496700003101512700002901543700001801572700001901590773008401609856008401693990002301777852000901800655001201809IND60110872220221121043518.0141109e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011087222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2010.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaete-Garretón, L.10aUltrasonically enhanced extraction of bioactive principles from Quillaja Saponaria Molina  ap. 581-585.  aA study of ultrasonic enhancement in the extraction of bioactive principles from Quillaja Saponaria Molina (Quillay) is presented. The effects influencing the extraction process were studied through a two-level factorial design. The effects considered in the experimental design were: granulometry, extraction time, acoustic Power, raw matter/solvent ratio (concentration) and acoustic impedance. It was found that for aqueous extraction the main factors affecting the ultrasonically-assisted process were: granulometry, raw matter/solvent ratio and extraction time. The extraction ratio was increased by Ultrasonics effect and a reduction in extraction time was verified without any influence in the product quality. In addition the process can be carried out at lower temperatures than the conventional method. As the process developed uses chips from the branches of trees, and not only the bark, this research contributes to make the saponin exploitation process a sustainable industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja saponaria 3aacoustic impedance 3abark 3abioactive properties 3abranches 3aexperimental design 3aproduct quality 3asaponins 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atrees 3aultrasonics1 aVargas-Hernández, Yolanda1 aCares-Pacheco, María G.1 aSainz, Javier1 aAlarcón, John0 tUltrasonics.g2011 July, v. 51, no. 5 p.581-585dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2010.12.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001800257520151200275592002801787650002101815650001601836650001601852650002001868650001601888650001101904650002101915650001001936650001801946650001101964650001501975650002201990650000902012650005202021650002402073650003502097700001402132700001402146700001402160700001702174700002002191773009302211856008102304990002302385852000902408655001202417IND60110560420221123004256.0141109e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011056042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2013.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Chun-Yan10aSophocarpine alleviates hepatocyte steatosis through activating AMPK signaling pathway  ap. 1065-1071.  aSophocarpine, an effective compound derived from foxtail-like sophora herb and seed, has been reported that it can alleviate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in rats and affect adipocytokine synthesis. Meanwhile, adipocytokines could adjust hepatic lipid metabolism through AMPK signaling pathway. In the work presented here, primary hepatocytes were isolated from specific pathogen-free male SD rats and incubated with 200μmol/L oleic acid for 24h to induce steatotic model, then treated with sophocarpine for 72h. Oil red staining was performed to evaluate steatosis, total RNA and protein of primary hepatocytes were extracted for real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. A cluster of aberrances were observed in the model group, including hepatocyte steatosis, increased leptin and decreased adiponectin mRNA expressions. While sophocarpine treatment resulted in: significant improvement of steatosis (>50% decrease), decrease of leptin expression (<0.57-fold) and increase of adiponectin expression (>1.48-fold). Moreover, compared with the model group, sophocarpine could significantly increase P-AMPKα (>5.82-fold), AMPKα (>1.29-fold) and ACC (>3.27-fold) protein expressions, and reduce P-ACC (<0.30-fold) and HNF-4α (<0.20-fold) protein expression. The mRNA expression of Srebp-1c was downregulated significantly simultaneously (<0.68-fold). We concluded that sophocarpine could alleviate hepatocyte steatosis and the potential mechanism might be the activated signaling pathway of AMPK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadiponectin 3afatty liver 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3aleptin 3alipid metabolism 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aoleic acid 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3aspecific pathogen-free animals1 aShi, Jian1 aZeng, Xin1 aZhang, Yi1 aXie, Wei-Fen1 aChen, Yue-Xiang0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Apr., v. 27, no. 3 p.1065-1071dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2013.01.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245014200188300001600330520184900346592002802195650003402223650001602257650002502273650001302298650003402311650004602345650001802391650001802409650002802427650002102455650004302476650003202519650002102551650001302572650004402585650001902629650001402648650001402662650001302676650001302689650005502702650003402757650003602791650005002827650004102877650005302918650004502971650002403016650003003040650003103070650001303101700001603114700001703130700001803147773010203165856008503267852000903352655001203361IND60100336220221120235723.0141105e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010033622DNAL7 a211834112pmid7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuping10aTarget-guided isolation and purification of antioxidants from Selaginella sinensis by offline coupling of DPPH-HPLC and HSCCC experiments  ap. 191-196.  aSelaginella sinensis (Selaginellaceae) is used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of many kinds of chronic diseases. In this study, fractionation of the methanol extract of S. sinensis by different polarity solvents indicated the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited an potent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity with the IC₅₀ value of 44.9μM. In order to evaluate the scientific basis, antioxidant peaks were firstly screened using DPPH spiking test through high performance liquid chromatography (DPPH-HPLC). Under the target-guidance of DPPH-HPLC experiment, two flavonoids and six biflavonoids, quercetin (1), apigenin (2), amentoflavone (3), robustaflavone (4), 2,3-dihydroamentaflavone (5), hinokiflavone (6), 4′-O-methyl-robustaflavone (7) and ginkgetin (8) were separated by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method using n-hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (8:8:9:7) as the solvent system with purities 98.2%, 97.6%, 99.4%, 92.3%, 98.5%, 98.9% and 99.6%, respectively. The structures were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Antioxidant activity of eight isolated compounds was assessed by the radical scavenging effect on DPPH radical, compound 1 showed strongest antioxidant activities with IC₅₀ values of 3.2μM, while compounds 2–8 showed weak antioxidant activities. This is the first report on simultaneous separation of eight antioxidant compounds from S. sinensis by HSCCC, moreover, apigenin and 4′-O-methyl-robustaflavone were first identified from this plant. Results of the present study indicated that the combinative method using DPPH-HPLC and HSCCC could be widely applied for rapid screening and isolating of antioxidants from complex TCM extract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSelaginella 3aantioxidant activity 3aapigenin 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethyl acetate 3afractionation 3afree radical scavengers 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant extracts 3aquercetin 3ascreening 3asolvents 2aAcetates 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxchemistry 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCountercurrent Distributionxmethods 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aNuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular 2aPicratesxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aSelaginellaceaexchemistry 2aSolvents1 aShi, Shuyun1 aWang, Yuanxi1 aHuang, Kelong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 879, no. 2 p.191-196dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010700170300001400277520091700291592002801208650002001236650001401256650001801270650001601288650002201304700003001326700001501356700002101371700002101392773008601413856008101499852000901580655001201589IND60110249020221116163418.0141109e20120310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011024902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2011.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero, Hernando10aCorrelation of the volumetric behaviour of pyridinium-based ionic liquids with two different equations  ap. 21-27.  aDensities as a function of temperature (283.15–333.15K) and pressure (0.1–60MPa) for the isomeric ionic liquids 1-butyl-2-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate, 1-butyl-3-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate, and 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate have been determined. Experimental data have been correlated using two different equations for evaluating their suitability to describe the volumetric behaviour of these materials. In addition, derived properties such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, the isothermal compressibility and the internal pressure have been calculated from densities making use of these two expressions. A detailed analysis of data in terms of the structural characteristics has been carried out.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses have been used to identify and quantify the various oligomeric and polymeric degradation products from the soluble fraction. The products were analysed directly after release and also after complete hydrolysis of the soluble fraction. The study shows a rapid release of residual photo-initiator followed by a gradual release of lactide/di-ethyleneglycol/glycolide oligomers with varying composition and chain length. The final stage of the sigmoidal weight loss profile reflects the release of polyacrylate chains with lactide/glycolide side chains. The molecular weights of the polyacrylate chains released increase with degradation time, which indicates that the release of these polyacrylate chains is determined by the number and type of ester-groups that must be degraded hydrolytically to dissolve these chains. The analysis of the soluble degradation products provides detailed insights in the chemical changes at the different stages of degradation; extraction, network attack, network penetration, bulk degradation, and finally release of persistent network fragments. Chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques prove to be powerful tools to enhance the understanding of the hydrolytic degradation of chemically cross-linked acrylates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3acrosslinking 3ahydrolysis 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aweight loss1 aLebouille, Jeromme1 aPlum, Bart1 aSchoenmakers, Peter1 avan der Wal, Sjoerd0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2011 Sept., v. 96, no. 9 p.1589-1601dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245013300184300001600317520103000333592002801363650001601391650001501407650001501422650001501437650001001452650001901462650001001481650001701491650001301508653001701521653002101538653001901559653002501578653001901603653001901622700003001641700002801671773010701699856008401806852000901890655001201899IND60111654620221123032824.0160903e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011165462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas-Veizaga, Daniel Martín10aEvaluation of the genotoxic potential of reactive black 5 solutions subjected to decolorizing treatments by three fungal strains  ap. 125-129.  aThe genotoxic potential of solutions of the textile dye “Reactive Black 5” that were subjected to decolorizing treatments with the fungal strains Coriolopsis polyzona MUCL33483, Penicillium sp.

Solutions of dye treated with C. polyzona MUCL33483 and Pycnoporus sp. MUBA002 showed color loss, probably due to enzymatic breakdown of the colorant, but maintenance or even an increase in genotoxicity.

In this paper, RF is introduced and investigated for electronic tongue (E-tongue) data processing. The experiments were designed for type and brand recognition of orange beverage and Chinese vinegar by an E-tongue with seven potentiometric sensors and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the distribution of total samples of each data set. Back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM), as comparative methods, were also employed to deal with four data sets. Five-fold cross-validation (CV) with twenty replications was applied during modeling and an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction performance of models. The average correct rates (CR) on CV sets of the four data sets performed by BPNN, SVM and RF were 86.68%, 66.45% and 99.07%, respectively. RF has been proved to outperform BPNN and SVM, and has some advantages in such cases, because it can deal with classification problems of unbalanced, multiclass and small sample data without data preprocessing procedures. These results suggest that RF may be a promising pattern recognition method for E-tongues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3adata collection 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic tongue 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asupport vector machines 3avinegars1 aWang, Mingjun1 aWang, Jun1 aLi, Duo0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Feb., v. 177 p.970-980dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.0713Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245013400177300001800311520156800329592002801897650002601925650002201951650002101973650001901994650002302013650002002036650003802056650002002094650003302114650002102147650001802168650003302186650002202219650002102241700001802262700001602280773010802296856009302404852000902497655001202506IND60105850120221117074803.0141108e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010585012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhijiang, Cai10aCrystallization behavior, thermal property and biodegradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)/poly(ethylene glycol) grafting copolymer  ap. 1602-1609.  aThe poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)(PHB)/poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG) grafting copolymer was successfully prepared by PHB and acrylate groups ended PEGM using AIBN as initiator. The crystallization behavior, thermal stability and environmental biodegradability of PHB/PEG grafting copolymers were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Biodegradation test in vitro. In the results, all the grafting copolymers were found to show the X-ray diffraction arising from the PHB crystal lattice, while none of the PEG crystallized peaks could be found even though the graft percent reached 20%. This result indicated that PEG molecules were randomly grafted onto PHB chain. The thermal properties measured by DSC showed that the melting temperature(Tₘ) and glass transition temperature (Tg) were both shifted to lower temperature with the graft percent increasing, and this broadened the narrow processability window of PHB. According to TGA results, the thermal stability of the grafting copolymers is not changed compared to pure PHB. From the biodegradation test, it could be concluded that degradation occurred gradually from the surface to the inside and that the degradation rate could be adjusted by the PEG grafting ratio. In another words, the biodegradation profiles of PHB/PEG grafting copolymer can be controlled. These properties make PHB/PEG grafting copolymer have promising potential applications especially in agriculture fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethylene glycol 3aglass transition temperature 3ain vitro studies 3amelting point 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aChengwei, Hou1 aGuang, Yang0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2011 Sept., v. 96, no. 9 p.1602-1609dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001600297520190700313592002802220650002102248650001302269650001302282650003802295650001602333650001902349650003602368650001502404650001302419650002602432650002002458650001102478650002702489650001702516650002102533650001702554650001302571650002202584650000902606650002502615700002202640773009302662856008102755852000902836655001202845IND60103532220221119183655.0141106e20120310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010353222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeeba, Gehan H.10aNebivolol regulates eNOS and iNOS expressions and alleviates oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats  ap. 388-395.  aAIMS: Oxidative stress-induced cell damage is reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study investigated the neuroprotective effect of nebivolol against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion insult in rats. MAIN METHODS: The model adopted was that of surgically-induced forebrain ischemia, performed by means of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 1h, followed by reperfusion for 24h. The effects of 5 and 10mg/kg nebivolol, treated for 7days prior to ischemia/reperfusion insult, were investigated by estimating endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and iNOS) protein expressions and assessing oxidative stress-related biochemical parameters in the rat forebrain. Also, infarct volume measurement and histopathological study of the forebrain were examined. KEY FINDINGS: Administration of nebivolol increased eNOS expression with simultaneous decrease in iNOS expression in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, nebivolol inhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced depletion of reduced glutathione level and decreased the elevated total nitric oxide end production and malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. A notable finding is that catalase activity was not changed in response to either ischemia/reperfusion insult or nebivolol treatment. However, the results confirmed that nebivolol significantly reduced infarct volume and alleviated ischemia/reperfusion-induced histopathological changes. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of nebivolol against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion insult. Neuroprotection observed with nebivolol may possibly be explained by regulating eNOS and iNOS expressions and by inhibition of oxidative stress-induced injury. Thus, nebivolol may be considered as a potential candidate for treatment in patients who are prone to stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarotid arteries 3acatalase 3acerebrum 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aneuroprotective effect 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aEL-Hanafy, Amr A.0 tLife sciences.g2012 Mar. 10, v. 90, no. 11-12 p.388-395dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01306naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245019500160300001800355520023600373592002800609650002300637650002300660650002300683650001200706700001800718700001300736700001800749700001600767700002000783773008700803856008100890852000900971655001200980IND60109463720221120141406.0141109e20120204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010946372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin12aA novel NH₄OAc and CuBr(PPh₃)₃-induced intermolecular Pummerer-type reaction between free (NH)-indoles and dimethylsulfoxide: facile synthesis of 3-methylthiomethyl substituted indoles  ap. 1560-1565.  aA novel NH₄OAc/CuBr(PPh₃)₃-induced intermolecular Pummerer-type reaction between free (NH)-indoles and dimethylsulfoxide is first reported, which offers the 3-methylthiomethyl substituted indoles conveniently and efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aindoles1 aWang, Xianxue1 aGuo, Han1 aShi, Xiaokang1 aRen, Xiaoyu1 aHuang, Guosheng0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Feb. 4, v. 68, no. 5 p.1560-1565dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001400290520110200304592002801406650002201434650002001456650002101476650002401497650000701521650002001528650002401548650001301572700002101585773010501606856008401711990002301795852000901818655001201827IND60108848520221119010530.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010884852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2011.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, Basudev10aCompetitive extraction of lanthanides by solvent extraction using Cyanex 272: Analysis, classification and mechanism  ap. 82-90.  aThe competitive simultaneous extraction and separation of 14 lanthanide elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) from perchloric acid aqueous solution by solvent extraction using bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272) as an extractant was studied. The effect of different parameters such as aqueous phase equilibrium pH and Cyanex 272 concentration in the organic phase on the extraction/separation behavior was investigated. From the experimental data a suitable cation exchange mechanism has been proposed. Dependencies of log D versus pH and log D versus log [Cyanex 272] and the cation exchange mechanism were analyzed and the proposed mechanism validated. Mathematical models (2D and 3D) were developed to correlate metal extractability. Hierarchical cluster analysis reveals the existence of (dis)similarity among elements in the series. Statistical cluster analysis divides the series into four different groups within the broad grouping of light and heavy lanthanides. An interesting diagonal relationship with consecutive elements was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acation exchange 3acluster analysis 3amathematical models 3apH 3aperchloric acid 3arare earth elements 3asolvents1 aOtu, Emmanuel O.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 83 p.82-90dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2011.09.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245006300211300001600274506007600290520084500366592002801211506003701239650002801276650002001304650001201324650001801336650001701354700002401371773010201395856008201497852000901579655001201588IND60110716620221207142749.0141109e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011071662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2012.04.0012doi7 aPMC37351332pmcid7 a225643632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemlow, Daniel R.10aStaying on message: ensuring fidelity in pre-mRNA splicing  ap. 263-273.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe faithful expression of genes requires that cellular machinery select substrates with high specificity at each step in gene expression. High specificity is particularly important at the stage of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, during which the spliceosome selects splice sites and excises intervening introns. With low specificity, the usage of alternative sites would yield insertions, deletions and frame shifts in mRNA. Recently, biochemical, genetic and genome-wide approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of splicing fidelity. In particular, we have learned that DExD/H-box ATPases play a general role in rejecting and discarding suboptimal substrates and that these factors serve as a paradigm for proofreading NTPases in other systems. Recent advances have also defined fundamental questions for future investigations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3agene expression 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3aspliceosomes1 aStaley, Jonathan P.0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2012 July, v. 37, no. 7 p.263-273dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013000164300001600294520089400310592002801204650002401232650001501256650000901271650002101280650002901301650001601330650002101346700001901367700001901386700001401405773008101419856008401500852000901584655001201593IND60108116520221119042315.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010811652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Bin10aNumerical studies on power generation from co-produced geothermal resources in oil fields and change in reservoir temperature  ap. 722-731.  aThe effects of injection rate and the temperature of injected (or re-injected) water on reservoir temperature during power generation by utilizing hot fluids co-produced from oil and gas field were studied using a numerical simulation approach.

The Atmospheric Scanning Electron Microscope (ASEM) can observe dynamic phenomena in liquid or gas under atmospheric pressure in real time. An electron-permeable window made of pressure-resistant 100nm-thick silicon nitride (SiN) film, set into the bottom of the open ASEM sample dish, allows an electron beam to be projected from underneath the sample. A detector positioned below captures backscattered electrons. Using the ASEM, we observed the radiation-induced self-organization process of particles, as well as phenomena accompanying volume change, including evaporation-induced crystallization. Using the electrochemical ASEM dish, we observed tree-like electrochemical depositions on the cathode. In silver nitrate solution, we observed silver depositions near the cathode forming incidental internal voids. The heated ASEM dish allowed observation of patterns of contrast in melting and solidifying solder. Finally, to demonstrate its applicability for monitoring and control of industrial processes, silver paste and solder paste were examined at high throughput. High resolution, imaging speed, flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use facilitate the observation of previously difficult-to-image phenomena, and make the ASEM applicable to various fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acrystallization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrons 3aimage analysis 3amelting 3amonitoring 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilicon nitride 3asilver 3asilver nitrate1 aNishiyama, Hidetoshi1 aKonyuba, Yuji1 aIwamatsu, Shinnosuke1 aWatanabe, Yoshiyuki1 aYoshiura, Chie1 aUeda, Takumi1 aSato, Chikara0 tUltramicroscopy.g2011 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.1650-1658dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009400173300001600267520110700283592002801390650002201418650002401440650001301464650002601477650001401503651001001517651001201527653000901539653001401548653001501562653001601577653001401593700001901607700002401626700002501650773008101675856008401756852000901840655001201849IND60111513020221119065240.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011151302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorretta, Vincenzo10aManagement of waste electrical and electronic equipment in two EU countries: A comparison  ap. 117-122.  aThe paper presents some data regarding waste electrical and electronic (WEEE) management in one of the founding countries of the EU, Italy, and in a recent entry into the EU, Romania. The aim of this research was to analyze some problems that countries entering the EU will have to solve with respect to WEEE management. The experiences of Italy and Romania could provide an interesting reference point. The strengths and weaknesses that the two EU countries have encountered can be used in order to give a more rational plan for other countries. In Italy the increase of WEEE collection was achieved in parallel with the increase of the efficiency of selective Municipal Solid Waste collection. In Romania, pilot experiences were useful to increase the awareness of the population. The different interests of the two populations towards recyclable waste led to a different scenario: in Romania all types of WEEE have been collected since its entrance into the EU; in Italy the “interest” in recycling is typically related to large household appliances, with a secondary role of lighting equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic wastes 3ahousehold equipment 3alighting 3amunicipal solid waste 3arecycling 3aItaly 3aRomania 0aWEEE 0aRecycling 0aRegulation 0aConsumption 0aReduction1 aRagazzi, Marco1 aIstrate, Irina Aura1 aRada, Elena Cristina0 tWaste management.g2013 Jan., v. 33 p.117-122dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014300167300001400310520172300324592002802047650003202075650001602107650003402123650002302157650001402180650003802194650001002232650001502242650001102257650001002268650000902278650003702287650001302324650002102337650002202358650003102380650001702411700001502428700001802443700001802461773011002479856008202589990002302671852000902694655001202703IND60110471720221119001913.0141109e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011047172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Zhi-Guo10aBisphenol A at a low concentration boosts mouse spermatogonial cell proliferation by inducing the G protein-coupled receptor 30 expression  ap. 88-94.  aBisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most prevalent chemicals in daily-use materials, therefore, human exposure to BPA is ubiquitous. We found that low concentrations of BPA stimulate the spermatogonial GC-1 cells proliferation by G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-c-Fos pathway. However, through the same pathway GPR30 expression has been shown to be induced by EGF, an EGFR ligand. Thus, we want to know if low concentrations of BPA are able to induce the GPR30 expression and the possible mechanism(s) in GC-1 cells. By transient transfection with expression plasmids, 10⁻⁹M BPA significantly transactivates the Gpr30-5′-flanking region through activating the GPR30, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), and EFGR-ERK pathways. Furthermore, an activator protein-1 (AP-1) site located within this region is found to be responsible for the transactivation of BPA. Expectedly, through the same pathways, BPA significantly induces the gene and protein expression of GPR30. c-Fos is further observed to be strongly recruited to the AP-1 site in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and its dysfunction on the AP-1 site markedly suppresses the expression of GPR30, p-ERK1/2, p-Ser118-ER-α and cell proliferation by BPA. Our results demonstrate that a low-concentration BPA induces GPR30 expression through the GPR30-EFGR-ERK-c-Fos, ER-α, and PKG pathways, presumably boosting the cells proliferation via a regulatory loop. The present study provides a novel insight into the potential role of GPR30 in the initiation and progression of male germ cell cancer induced by environmentally relevant BPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abisphenol A 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amales 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aplasmids 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscriptional activation 3atransfection1 aHuang, Wei1 aLiu, Yu-Xiang1 aZhu, Ben-Zhan0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 267, no. 1 p.88-94dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.12.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245026500168300001800433520067300451592002801124650002301152650002301175650002201198650001801220700001801238700001901256773009001275856008101365852000901446655001201455IND60109537920221120060407.0141109e20120923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010953792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.06.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, Shigeo10aNon-enzymatic diastereoselective asymmetric desymmetrization of 2-benzylserinols giving optically active 4-benzyl-4-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinones: asymmetric syntheses of α-(hydroxymethyl)phenylalanine, N-Boc-α-methylphenylalanine, cericlamine and BIRT-377  ap. 8033-8045.  aA reaction of (S)-2-benzyl-2-(α-methylbenzyl)amino-1,3-propanediol (S)-4a and 2-chloroethyl chloroformate, and the subsequent addition of DBU gave (4R,αS)-4-benzyl-4-hydroxymethyl-3-(α-methylbenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone (4R)-5a (92% de) via a diastereoselective asymmetric desymmetrization process.

Extraction of SCFAs from supernatants of bacterial cultures is aggravated due to their polarity and volatility. Detection can only be performed at a short, non-selective UV wavelength (210nm), due to the lack of any significant chromophore. Therefore special attention was paid to the optimization of the sample preparation procedure and the HPLC–UV conditions. The final extraction procedure consisted of a liquid–liquid back extraction using diethylether. Prior to HPLC–UV analysis the samples were acidified (pH<2) in order to improve retention of the SCFA's and LA on the Hypersil Gold aQ column. Matrix-matched calibration graphs were prepared for all analytes of interest (range 0.5–50mM) and correlation and goodness-of-fit coefficients were between 0.9951–0.9993 and 3.88–8.27%, respectively. Limits of detection and quantification ranged from 0.13 to 0.33mM and 0.5 to 1.0mM, respectively. The results for the within-day and between-day precision and accuracy fell within the ranges specified. The reported validated method has been successfully used for the in vitro screening of supernatants of bacterial cultures for the presence of butyric acid, aiming to select for butyric acid-producing bacteria. In addition, the method has been used to determine the production pattern of selected fatty acids by bacterial species isolated from human feces and chicken caeca.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abutyric acid 3acecum 3achickens 3adetection limit 3afeces 3afermentation 3agold 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening 3awavelengths1 aEeckhaut, V.1 aSteppe, M.1 aDe Maesschalck, C.1 aBacker, P. de,1 aVan Immerseel, F.1 aCroubels, S.0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 June, v. 80 p.107-115dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.02.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007600164300001600240520123900256592002801495650001001523650001201533650001401545650002101559650001901580650001701599650001801616650001901634650001101653650004401664650001601708650001701724650000901741700001401750700001601764700001601780700001601796700001801812700001501830773007601845856008201921990002302003852000902026655001202035IND60102684320221117230820.0141106e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010268432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelkior, T.10aNMR analysis of the transformation of wood constituents by torrefaction  ap. 271-280.  aThe injection of biomass in a pressurised entrained flow reactor is challenging. Biomass preparation by torrefaction before gasification could be a suitable option to improve it. Transformation of the material induced by this treatment lead to interesting features: increased brittleness, improved fluidisation properties of the powder, hydrophobicity, higher energy content. The major biomass constituents, cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin are variously affected by torrefaction, depending on their respective reactivity. The objective of this work is to investigate the transformation of the biomass constitutive polymers induced by this thermal treatment. For that purpose, both solid-state NMR and EPR investigations have been performed on wood samples (beech) torrefied at different temperatures ranging from 200°C to 300°C. The results of these investigations have been compared with data obtained on untreated wood. These characterizations have brought to light different transformations of the polymers: de-acetylation of hemicelluloses, demethoxylation of lignin, changes in the cellulose structure. Furthermore, the temperature at which depolymerisation of the different components begins to occur has been identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3abiomass 3acellulose 3adepolymerization 3aenergy content 3agasification 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 3awood1 aJacob, S.1 aGerbaud, G.1 aHediger, S.1 aLe Pape, L.1 aBonnefois, L.1 aBardet, M.0 tFuel.g2012 Feb., v. 92, no. 1 p.271-280dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008800169300001600257520163200273592002801905650001701933650001601950650001301966650001701979650002401996650001702020650001902037650000902056650001402065700001802079700001702097700001702114700001602131773008102147856008602228852000902314655001202323IND60105450820221120025245.0141108e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010545082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrella, C.10aTLQP-21, a VGF-derived peptide, stimulates exocrine pancreatic secretion in the rat  ap. 133-136.  aThe aims of this paper were to study: (1) the effects of TLQP-21 (non-acronic name), the C-terminal region of the VGF (non-acronic name), polypeptide (from residue 557 to 576 of VGF), on in vitro amylase release from rat isolated pancreatic lobules and acinar cells; (2) the mechanism through which TLQP-21 regulates exocrine pancreatic secretion, by using the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (10⁻⁶M) and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10⁻⁶M). On pancreatic lobules of rats, concentrations of TLQP-21 from 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁵M significantly (p<0.05) induced a 2–3-fold increase of baseline pancreatic amylase release, measured at the end of 60min incubation period. Co-incubation with atropine 10⁻⁶M did not antagonise the enzyme outflow induced by the peptide. On the contrary, co-incubation of TLQP-21 (10⁻⁷ and 10⁻⁶M) with indomethacin, at concentration of 10⁻⁶M, which alone did not modify enzyme secretion, completely suppressed the increase of amylase evoked by TLQP-21 on pancreatic lobules. On rat pancreatic acinar cells, TLQP-21, at all the concentrations tested, was unable to affect exocrine pancreatic secretion, indicating an indirect mechanism of action on acinar cells. These results put in evidence, for the first time, that TLQP-21, a VGF-derived peptide, modulates exocrine pancreatic secretion in rats through a stimulatory mechanism involving prostaglandin release. In conclusion, TLQP-21 could be included among the neurohumoral signals regulating pancreatic exocrine secretion, and increases the knowledge concerning the systems controlling this function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacinar cells 3aantagonists 3aatropine 3aindomethacin 3amechanism of action 3apolypeptides 3aprostaglandins 3arats 3asecretion1 aBroccardo, M.1 aPossenti, R.1 aSeverini, C.1 aImprota, G.0 tPeptides.g2012 July, v. 36, no. 1 p.133-136dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006700169300001800236520131700254592002801571650001901599650002401618650003701642700002001679700001801699700001701717700001701734700001601751700001601767773009201783856008601875990002301961852000901984655001201993IND60110872720221121043520.0141109e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011087272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, B.D.10aThermal diffuse scattering in transmission electron microscopy  ap. 1670-1680.  aIn conventional transmission electron microscopy, thermal scattering significantly affects the image contrast. It has been suggested that not accounting for this correctly is the main cause of the Stobbs factor, the ubiquitous, large contrast mismatch found between theory and experiment. In the case where a hard aperture is applied, we show that previous conclusions drawn from work using bright field scanning transmission electron microscopy and invoking the principle of reciprocity are reliable in the presence of thermal scattering. In the aperture-free case it has been suggested that even the most sophisticated mathematical models for thermal diffuse scattering lack in their numerical implementation, specifically that there may be issues in sampling, including that of the contrast transfer function of the objective lens. We show that these concerns can be satisfactorily overcome with modest computing resources; thermal scattering can be modelled accurately enough for the purpose of making quantitative comparison between simulation and experiment. Spatial incoherence of the source is also investigated. Neglect or inadequate handling of thermal scattering in simulation can have an appreciable effect on the predicted contrast and can be a significant contribution to the Stobbs factor problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3amathematical models 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aD'Alfonso, A.J.1 aFindlay, S.D.1 aVan Dyck, D.1 aLeBeau, J.M.1 aStemmer, S.1 aAllen, L.J.0 tUltramicroscopy.g2011 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.1670-1680dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.09.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015000169300001800319500001500337520158300352592002801935650002201963650001301985650002201998650001702020650002802037650003802065650001902103650001802122650001302140650002102153653002102174700002002195700001902215700002202234700002202256773008302278856008502361990002302446852000902469655001202478IND60105760220221119155011.0141108e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010576022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.12.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Allison10aSemicrystalline polyphosphazenes: A comparative study of topology, morphology, and contact angles for three fluorous and one aryl polyphosphazene  ap. 1123-1129.  a2019-12-04  aThis report describes the surface morphology and wetting behavior of one aryl and three fluorous polyphosphazenes: poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene], PTFEP, 1, poly[bis(para-fluorophenoxy)phosphazene] 2, poly[bis(meta-trifluoromethylphenoxy)phosphazene] 3, and poly(diphenoxyphosphazene) 4. Thermal analysis confirms high thermal stability for these polyphosphazenes. With phenyl side chains, 2–4 are particularly stable with T₅% >400 °C. Surface morphology via tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) and dynamic contact angles (DMA) are correlated with composition and crystallinity estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The resulting structure property relationships define trends in processability, hydrophobicity and oleophobicity. Compared to 1, 3, and 4 poly[bis(para-fluorophenoxy)phosphazene] 2 is noteworthy by virtue of a high melting point (179 °C), high crystallinity (ΔHf, 30.2 J/g), and a moderate molecular weight. The remaining polyphosphazenes in this group have Tₘ <100 °C. Heats of fusion (J/g) are in the order 1 (29.4) ≈ 2 (30.2) > 3 (17) >> 4 (4.0). High molecular weights for 3 and 4 (>10³ kDa) would make melt processability problematic. Thus 1 or 2 has a favorable combination of properties, with 2 favored for many applications due to a higher Tₘ. In summary, for performance and processing, high Tₘ, and resistance to water and hydrocarbons poly[bis(para-fluorophenoxy)phosphazene], 2 is attractive. This finding suggests other para-substituted phenyl phosphazenes are worth further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3atopology 3acrystal structure 3ahydrocarbons 3aatomic force microscopy 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahydrophobicity 3amelting point 3apolymers 3amolecular weight 0athermal analysis1 aPresnall, David1 aSteely, Lee B.1 aAllcock, Harry R.1 aWynne, Kenneth J.0 tPolymer.g2013 Feb. 5, v. 54, no. 3 p.1123-1129dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.12.0633Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006700165300001400232520132300246592002801569650002001597650001301617650002301630650000901653650001401662650000901676650002701685650001201712650002501724650002801749650002301777651001101800700001801811700002101829700001901850700001901869700002001888700001601908773009201924856004802016852000902064655001202073IND4494114820221118012736.0150225e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449411482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-011-0036-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDING, JUN-QIANG10aQTL mapping for test weight by using F 2:3 population in maize  ap. 75-80.  aTest weight is an important trait in maize breeding. Understanding the genetic mechanism of test weight is important for effective selection of maize test weight improvement. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for maize test weight were identified. In the years 2007 and 2008, a F2:3 population along with the parents Chang7-2 and Zheng58 were planted in Zhengzhou, Peopleâs Republic of China. Significant genotypic variation for maize test weight was observed in both years. Based on the genetic map containing 180 polymorphic SSR markers with an average linkage distance of 11.0Â cM, QTL for maize test weight were analysed by mixed-model composite interval mapping. Five QTL, including four QTL with only additive effects, were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and together explained 25.2% of the phenotypic variation. Seven pairs of epistatic interactions were also detected, involving 11 loci distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, respectively, which totally contributed 18.2% of the phenotypic variation. However, no significant QTL Ã environment (QÃE) interaction and epistasis Ã environment interaction effects were detected. The results showed that besides the additive QTL, epistatic interactions also formed an important genetic basis for test weight in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3acorn 3aepistasis 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3astatistical models 3aTaiwan1 aMA, JIN-LIANG1 aZHANG, CHUN-RONG1 aDONG, HUA-FANG1 aXI, ZHANG-YING1 aXIA, ZONG-LIANG1 aWU, JIAN-YU0 tJournal of genetics.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 1 p.75-80dSpringer-Verlagx0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-011-0036-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013000166300001600296520108900312592002801401650002201429650001801451650002401469650001901493650001601512650001801528650000701546650001301553700001901566700001601585700001801601700002001619700002001639700001801659773010901677856008201786852000901868655001201877IND60100877220221122053024.0141105e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010087722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.09.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hee-Man12aA direct surface modification of iron oxide nanoparticles with various poly(amino acid)s for use as magnetic resonance probes  ap. 158-167.  aWater soluble and biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles coated with poly(aspartic acid) (PAsp), poly(asparagines) (PAsn), poly(2-hydroxy-ethyl l-aspartamide) (PHEA), and poly-α,β-(N-2-dimethylaminoethyl l-aspartamide) (PDMAEA) were prepared by hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles and each amphiphilic poly(amino acid)s graft polymer.

In all cases the trans amide conformation, with reference to the carbonyl oxygen and the 3-position of the isoquinoline ring, predominates in solution. In the solid state the nitrile moieties are pseudo-axial and the amides exist almost exclusively in the trans form, except for the case of 2-isobutyryl-3-methyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinaldonitrile (2c), which exists exclusively as the cis amide form in the solid state. In N-aroyl 3-CH₃ compounds with two ortho-aroyl substituents both amide isomerism and hindered aryl/carbonyl rotation are observed by ¹H NMR spectroscopy. In other N-aroyl derivatives only hindered aryl/carbonyl rotations are observed by NMR and in N-alkanoyl compounds amide isomerism is observable only at very low temperatures. X-ray crystallography reveals the two rotamers in the solid state in four cases of ortho-substituted benzoyl compounds; with one exception, the rotamer with the larger ortho-aroyl substituent syn to the pseudo-axial cyano group is favored. Unusual solubility and reactivity patterns observed with these compounds are rationalized in terms of the interplay between steric and electronic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamides 3achemical structure 3aisomerization 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3asolubility 3astereochemistry 3atemperature1 aBerg, Michael A.G.1 aPrice, Terry L., Jr.cJr.1 aNiu, Zhenbin1 aLee, Minjae1 aRouser, Mason A.1 aDickson, Jennifer Clifton1 aSlebodnick, Carla0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Sept. 23, v. 68, no. 38 p.8052-8067dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009300169300001600262520202500278592002802303650002002331650002102351650001302372650000802385650001302393650001002406650001102416650001402427650001702441650002202458650001402480650000902494650001802503700002202521700002202543773011702565856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60100795320221121051241.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010079532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.10.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Elena10aContact line extraction and length measurements in model sediments and sedimentary rocks  ap. 558-577.  aThe mechanisms that govern the transport of colloids in the unsaturated zone of soils are still poorly understood, because of the complexity of processes that occur at pore scale. These mechanisms are of specific interest in quantifying water quality with respect to pathogen transport (e.g. Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium) between the source (e.g. farms) and human users. Besides straining in pore throats and constrictions of smaller or equivalent size, the colloids can be retained at the interfaces between air, water, and grains. Theories competing to explain this mechanism claim that retention can be caused by adhesion at the air–water-interface (AWI) between sediment grains or by straining at the air–water–solid (AWS) contact line. Currently, there are no established methods for the estimation of pathogen retention in unsaturated media because of the intricate influence of AWI and AWS on transport and retention. What is known is that the geometric configuration and connectivity of the aqueous phase is an important factor in unsaturated transport. In this work we develop a computational method based on level set functions to identify and quantify the AWS contact line (in general the non-wetting–wetting–solid contact line) in any porous material. This is the first comprehensive report on contact line measurement for fluid configurations from both level-set method based fluid displacement simulation and imaged experiments. The method is applicable to any type of porous system, as long as the detailed pore scale geometry is available. We calculated the contact line length in model sediments (packs of spheres) as well as in real porous media, whose geometry is taken from high-resolution images of glass bead packs and sedimentary rocks. We observed a strong dependence of contact line length on the geometry of the sediment grains and the arrangement of the air and water phases. These measurements can help determine the relative contribution of the AWS line to pathogen retention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3aair 3acolloids 3aglass 3ahumans 3apathogens 3aporous media 3asedimentary rocks 3asediments 3asoil 3awater quality1 aProdanovic, Masa,1 aBryant, Steven L.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 368, no. 1 p.558-577dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001800284520112400302592002801426650002201454650001501476650002401491650001201515650000901527650001201536650001101548650001301559650002001572650002401592650001901616650001101635650001701646650001101663650001401674650003101688700002101719700001801740700001801758773009001776856008101866990002301947852000901970655001201979IND60108700120221119144508.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010870012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontes, L.F.B.L.10aGas sensor based on montmorillonite/polypyrrole composites prepared by in situ polymerization in aqueous medium  ap. 1115-1121.  aWe have synthesized clay/polypyrrole composites via in situ polymerization in aqueous medium, with the anionic surfactant dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (DBSA) playing a dual role as a dopant. We submitted the commercial clay k10 montmorillonite to a previous organophilic treatment with hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C₁₉H₄₂NBr). The lattice parameters, as determined by X-ray diffraction, were d=1.35nm, 1.9nm and 4.2nm, for the pure montmorillonite (MMTK10), organophilic MMT (MMTO), and MMTO/polypyrrole samples, respectively. Infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of vibration peaks associated to both CC and NH polypyrrole bonds and also to MMT characteristic groups. When tested as active materials in sensors of methanol, ethanol, hexane and benzene vapors, these composites have shown a significant sensitivity to the presence of both polar and nonpolar volatile organic compounds. In special, these hybrid (organophilic clay)/polypyrrole films have shown a better level of recognition towards nonpolar compounds than other doped PPY films previously examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3abenzene 3aclay 3aethanol 3ahexane 3amethanol 3amontmorillonite 3anon-polar compounds 3apolymerization 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3avapors 3avibration 3avolatile organic compounds1 ade Souza, J.E.G.1 aGalembeck, A.1 ade Melo, C.P.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Feb., v. 177 p.1115-1121dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01572naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008100172300001600253520072000269592002800989650001701017650001101034650001501045650001001060651001201070773008201082856008601164990002301250852000901273655001201282IND60111580320221119071932.0141109e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011158032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowson, Cynthia10aAdverse Incorporation and Microfinance among Cross-Border Traders in Senegal  ap. 199-208.  aThis paper highlights the relevance of adverse incorporation as a neglected theoretical approach to debates on microfinance through a case study of cross-border traders in Senegal. Although women’s organizations do not exclude even the poorest women, traders in remote areas were unable to access credit due to particularly harsh standards of joint liability and adverse relations with donors, lenders, and elite women. Meanwhile, the peer monitoring function of group microcredit schemes is challenged by the fact that traders are strikingly uncritical of defaulting borrowers. Findings highlight the detrimental consequences of donors’ misconceptions regarding women’s organizations and economic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acredit 3amonitoring 3awomen 3aSenegal0 tWorld development.g2013 Feb., v. 42 p.199-208dElsevier Ltdx0305-750X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011100163300001600274520081400290592002801104650001101132650002101143650001301164650001501177650001301192650001001205650002501215650001801240650002201258650000901280650001101289650001301300700001601313700001401329700001301343700001601356773008601372856008401458990002301542852000901565655001201574IND60103843020221119093603.0141107e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010384302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.03.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Wei10aSilicone rubber as a novel insulating material for manufacturing cylindrical glass carbon fiber electrodes  ap. 159-162.  aGood insulation at the glass/fiber interfaces is the most critical factor for successfully manufacturing high-quality cylindrical glass carbon fiber electrodes (CgCFEs). In the conventional process of fabricating CgCFEs, poor insulation is unavoidable when using epoxy as the insulator. In this study, we were the first to use silicone rubber as a new type of insulating material to make silicone rubber-insulated CgCFEs (SCgCFEs) which detected dopamine release in the striatum in vivo after medial forebrain bundle stimulation and recorded quantal catecholamine release from rat adrenal chromaffin cells. Our results indicate that silicone rubber can form perfect insulation in SCgCFEs which are stable, easily manufactured, and can be used in the measurement of easily oxidized monoamine neurotransmitters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achromaffin cells 3adopamine 3aelectrodes 3aepoxides 3aglass 3ainsulating materials 3amanufacturing 3aneurotransmitters 3arats 3arubber 3asilicone1 aZhu, Dexiao1 aLiu, Jing1 aYu, Xiao1 aMa, Xuelian0 tMaterials letters.g2012 July 15, v. 79 p.159-162dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.03.0933Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245008800183300001800271520110400289592002801393650001401421650002601435650001201461650002401473650001301497650001001510650001101520650002001531650002101551650002301572650001201595650001101607650001401618650001101632650002401643650001301667700001901680700002101699700001801720700002101738773008501759856008501844852000901929655001201938IND60111088820221120083616.0141109e20110811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011108882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacpac, Nirianne Marie Q.10aPlasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 (SE36) as a malaria vaccine candidate  ap. 5837-5845.  aA devastating disease spread by mosquitoes with high-efficiency, malaria imposes an enormous burden for which no licensed vaccine currently exists. Although the genome complexity of the parasite has made vaccine development tenuous, an effective malaria vaccine would be a valuable tool for control, elimination and eventual eradication. The Plasmodium serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) is an abundant asexual blood stage antigen that does not show any antigenic variation and exhibits limited polymorphism, making it a suitable vaccine candidate. Identified by comparing the IgG status of people in endemic areas with protective immunity and those with malaria symptoms, the vaccine potential of the N-terminal domain of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5 is also strongly supported by experimental data and immune responses both measured in vitro and in animal challenge models. The current understanding of SERA5 will be presented, particularly in relation to its path towards clinical development. The review highlights lessons learned and sorts out issues upon which further research efforts are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aanimals 3aantigenic variation 3aantigens 3ablood 3agenome 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aindigenous peoples 3amalaria 3amodels 3aparasites 3aserine 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aArisue, Nobuko1 aTougan, Takahiro1 aIshii, Ken J.1 aHorii, Toshihiro0 tVaccine.g2011 Aug. 11, v. 29, no. 35 p.5837-5845dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008200168300001800250520094800268592002801216650002401244650002001268650002401288650001601312700002101328700001201349773011101361856008101472990002301553852000901576655001201585IND60104086220221119195415.0141107e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2010.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Liang-Lin10aDelay-dependent BIBO stability analysis of switched uncertain neutral systems  ap. 1607-1620.  aThis paper presents the analysis of delay-dependent bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stability for a class of switched uncertain neutral systems. The uncertainty is assumed to be of structured linear fractional form which includes the norm-bounded uncertainty as a special case. First, by introducing the general variation-of-constants formula of neutral systems with perturbation, the BIBO stability property of general linear switched neutral systems with perturbation is established. Next, combining the general variation-of-constants formula with the state-dependent switching rule, new approaches are presented to design the feedback controller and the switching rules. Furthermore, the BIBO stability criteria are obtained in terms of the so-called Lyapunov–Metzler linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed techniques in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3adecision making 3amathematical models 3auncertainty1 aZhong, Shou-Ming1 aYe, Mao0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2011 May, v. 53, no. 9-10 p.1607-1620dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2010.12.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01316naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008300168300001400251520041000265592002800675650001100703650001500714650001700729650001100746650001000757650001700767700001700784773008500801856008400886990002300970852000900993655001201002IND60104002420221122170730.0141107e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010400242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.04.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Eun-Joo,10aMesoporous Ni(OH)₂ tubes on carbon fiber paper for pseudocapacitor electrode  ap. 28-31.  aA nanostructured Ni(OH)₂ electrode was prepared and evaluated in supercapacitor application.

A linear relation between the ECL intensity and H₂O₂ concentration, I=2.4212+2.1713 c, was obtained with a detection limit of 1×10⁻⁸mol·L⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aemissions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate1 aSong, Caixia1 aSun, Yuwei1 aWang, Debao0 tMaterials letters.g2011 June 30, v. 65, no. 12 p.1762-1764dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0913Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006800168300001800236520091300254592002801167650000801195650001901203650002401222650001701246700001901263700002101282773008601303856008501389852000901474655001201483IND60109141220221119002135.0141109e20110930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010914122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seungah10aEnzyme digestion of entrapped single-DNA molecules in nanopores  ap. 2135-2141.  aThe real-time digestion of entrapped single-DNA molecules by λ-exonuclease in nanoporous alumina membranes was observed using an epifluorescence microscope. The alumina membrane provides pL (∼10⁻¹²L) containers for confining single-DNA molecules without immobilization. When one end of the DNA molecule was inserted into a nanopore, it was possible to monitor the digestion process outside, near and inside the pore, where the individual DNA molecules exhibited different characteristic digestion modes. The digestion rates calculated from the decrease in fluorescence intensity showed different values according to the location of the individual molecules. Entrapment rather than immobilization allows the DNA strand to be fully exposed to the enzyme and the reaction buffer. These results confirm that the enzymatic digestion of DNA molecules is affected by their three-dimensional (3D) environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaluminum oxide 3aenzymatic reactions 3afluorescence1 aKang, Seong Ho1 aYeung, Edward S.0 tTalanta.g2011 Sept. 30, v. 85, no. 4 p.2135-2141dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009400191300001600285520107900301592002801380650001901408650001101427650002101438650001601459653002201475653001901497653000901516700002301525700001701548773011901565856010301684852000901787655001201796IND50065134120221122040327.0151127e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006513412DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0619:AWDNPC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWamelink, G.

Witte & von Asmuth (2003; this volume) have two major points of criticism: (1) the data we used would be systematically biased; (2) in calibrating Ellenberg indicator values for moisture availability against mean spring groundwater level we should have assumed a sigmoid response instead of a linear one. As to (1), a bias in the data would require that wet vegetation types were visited in wet years and dry vegetation types in dry years. We do not see any evidence for this. As to (2), our data do not provide strong evidence for a sigmoid relation instead of a linear one. Neither is there any indication that the bias in the Ellenberg indicator values would disappear when a sigmoid function would be fitted. We do agree with Witte & von Asmuth that it is preferable to characterize the species' response by those variables to which they most directly respond.Abbreviations: MSL == Mean spring groundwater level; WvA == Witte & von Asmuth (2003).  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytosociology 3aspring 3avegetation types 3awater table 0aGroundwater level 0aPhytosociology 0aSoil1 aDobben, H.

Ongoing studies that are investigating the in vivo relevance of these findings by assessing the therapeutic potential of grB in a human xenograft tumor mouse model required the development of an expression system for the production of high yields of enzymatic and biologically active human grB. In order to maintain potentially important posttranslational modifications that occur in mammalian cells, human embryonal kidney cells (HEK293) were stably transfected with human grB. The HEK293 host cells were protected from apoptotic cell death by fusing an inactivation site coupled to a (His)₆ tag to the gene sequence of GrB. Inactive grB which was actively released from HEK293 cells by insertion of a Igκ leader sequence was purified on a nickel column utilizing the (His)₆ tag. After enterokinase digestion and heparin affinity chromatography, high yields of enzymatic and biologically active human grB were obtained. The perforin-independent interaction of grB with membrane Hsp70 positive tumor cells appeared to be associated with mammalian glycosylation and mediated by the oligosaccharide moiety of neuraminic acid (NANA).  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3akidney cells 3aglycosylation 3aserine proteinases 3adigestion 3aheparin 3aanimal models 3aneoplasm cells 3anickel 3aaffinity chromatography 3anucleotide sequences 3aneuraminic acid 3aoligosaccharides 3aapoptosis 0apost-translational modification1 aDoß, Brigitte T.1 aWagner, Michaela1 aZettlitz, Kirstin A.1 aKontermann, Roland E.1 aFoulds, Gemma1 aPockley, Alan G.1 aMulthoff, Gabriele0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 Aug. 31, v. 371, no. 1-2 p.8-17dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010500173300001400278520079300292592002801085650001401113650001001127650001101137700001901148700001901167700003101186700001801217700002001235700002401255773009901279856008101378990002301459852000901482655001201491IND60108439820221119210518.0141108e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010843982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohannsmann, Diethelm10aTowards in vivo differentiation of brain tumor versus normal tissue by means of torsional resonators  ap. 25-31.  aIt was tested to what extend torsional acoustic resonators can serve to in vivo differentiate between healthy and tumorous brain tissue. The resonators employed consist of crystalline quartz. They are cylindrically shaped. The resonance frequency at the fundamental is 78kHz. The best correlation between the shifts of resonance frequency and resonance bandwidth, on the one hand, and the state of the tissue, on the other, was found when analyzing ratios of the shifts in resonance frequency and resonance bandwidth. These ratios are independent of contact area. Taking data on the fundamental mode as well as the third overtone further improved the efficiency and precision of the technique. These results suggest that torsional resonators can serve as diagnostic tools in neurosurgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abrain 3aquartz1 aLanghoff, Arne1 aBode, Berthold1 aMpoukouvalas, Konstantinos1 aHeimann, Axel1 aKempski, Oliver1 aCharalampaki, Patra0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The major characteristics of the bioenergetic systems are then described and it is pointed out that especially the treatment of energised, directed chemical flow in divided space in cells is central to this activity. It is also the major theoretical problem of many other cellular activities. The development of bioenergetics until today, based on the theories of flows of electrons, protons and other chemical materials in structures, is then outlined. Great benefit has accrued from the knowledge of the structures which allow controlled flow, diffusion. In a speculative forward look at the theoretical biology of cells based on this outline the usefulness of further reductive analysis of extracted molecular units is considered as descriptions of mobility within structures of large molecules and membranes as well as in free space. Such structures are central to catalysed control and flow. The possibility of a more holistic approach is then examined. This will require markers of flow states and spatial structures. It is shown that as the flow system is one of a combined environment and organisms the study of metal ions in both has particular advantages. Consideration is given as to how this study can assist a broad understanding of the chemistry of the evolution of organisms. The changes of the metallome, strongly linked to the proteome, the genome and the environment, is a ready source of information concerning the manner in which changes in catalysts and controls of flow of organic chemicals have evolved in the divided space of cells and of cellular systems. The connection of the code changes to the environment via the metallome changes is then mooted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aevolution 3agenome 3ainformation sources 3ametal ions 3aorganic compounds 3aproteome 3aprotons 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOrganic Chemicalsxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aTime Factors0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 268, no. 1 p.146-159dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012800171300001600299520113100315592002801446650001201474650001101486650001401497650001901511650001401530650001101544650001301555650003101568650001601599650000901615700002501624700002301649700001901672773009601691856008401787852000901871655001201880IND60105926920221118113639.0141108e20110118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010592692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertin, Diego E.10aAnalysis of the product granulometry, temperature and mass flow of an industrial multichamber fluidized bed urea granulator  ap. 122-131.  aIn this work, a complete dynamic model of a continuous industrial fluidized bed granulator for urea production is presented. Three growth and three cooling chambers in series are simulated. Mass, energy and momentum balances are solved for all the fluidized beds together with the population balance equation (PBE). Since each granulator chamber can be modelled as a continuous stirred tank (CST), the multichamber granulator is represented by a series of CSTs. Applying the developed model, the open-loop behaviour of the product granulometry is particularly investigated. With this aim, and to further develop efficient control strategies, different step disturbances are assayed. Based on the results of the performed sensitivity study, it can be concluded that the log-normal distribution function gives an appropriate description of the PSD in each chamber, the granulometry response times control the dynamics of the complete granulation circuit, the seeds' PSD is the variable that most affect the outlet particle size distribution, and that mild recycle ratio values are adequate to stabilize the granulator operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aenergy 3aequations 3afluidized beds 3amass flow 3amodels 3amomentum 3aparticle size distribution 3atemperature 3aurea1 aCotabarren, Ivana M.1 aBucalá, Verónica1 aPiña, Juliana0 tPowder technology.g2011 Jan. 18, v. 206, no. 1-2 p.122-131dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013400173300001600307520130400323592002801627650004401655650000901699650001501708650001901723650001801742650002401760650001001784650001501794650001101809700002001820700003001840773011601870856008201986852000902068655001202077IND60100681720221119212215.0141105e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010068172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajimohammadi, Ailar10aTime-resolved and spatially-resolved infrared spectroscopic observation of seeded nucleation controlling geopolymer gel formation  ap. 384-392.  aThe effect of seeded nucleation on the formation and structural evolution of one-part (“just add water”) geopolymer gels is investigated. Gel-forming systems are seeded with each of three different oxide nanoparticles, and seeding is shown to have an important role in controlling the silica release rate from the solid geothermal silica precursor, and in the development of physical properties of the gels. Nucleation accelerates the chemical changes taking place during geopolymer formation. The nature of the seeds affects the structure of the growing gel by affecting the extent of phase separation, identified by the presence of a distinct silica-rich gel in addition to the main, more alumina-rich gel phase. Synchrotron radiation-based infrared microscopy (SR-FTIR) shows the effect of nucleation on the heterogeneous nanostructure and microstructure of geopolymer gels, and is combined with data obtained by time-resolved FTIR analysis to provide a more holistic view of the reaction processes at a level of detail that has not previously been available. While spatially averaged (ATR–FTIR) infrared results show similar spectra for seeded and unseeded samples which have been cured for more than 3weeks, SR-FTIR results show marked differences in gel structure as a result of seeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3agels 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aphysical properties 3aseeds 3aseparation 3asilica1 aProvis, John L.1 avan Deventer, Jannie S.J.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 May 15, v. 357, no. 2 p.384-392dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171300001600295500001500311520159400326592002801920650001301948650001201961650002501973650001501998653002402013700001802037700002102055773008502076856008402161852000902245655001202254IND60106077820221120103224.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010607782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanley, Kevin J.10aDispersion in particle velocity resulting from random motion through a spatially-varying fluid velocity field in a pipe  ap. 255-264.  a2019-12-04  aA macro-scale probabilistic model of dilute phase pneumatic transport is developed to analyse the dispersion in the velocity of conveyed particles and to predict their velocity statistics. Fluid drag force, proportional to the relative velocity between the particle and fluid, is taken to be the agent that causes particle motion in the axial direction. The basic premise of the approach is that dispersion in axial particle velocity is a result of subsidiary random motion in the radial direction through the fluid velocity field. Two causes are investigated for this radial motion; gravity and inter-particle collisions. As the local fluid velocity experienced by a particle thus continuously varies in an unpredictable fashion, then the associated drag force fluctuates as does the resulting particle velocity. The non-deterministic nature of the fluid velocity acting on the particle is captured by treating fluid velocity as a stochastic process whose description comes from combining knowledge of the flow field with the nature of the radial motion of the particle. This novel approach allows analytical expressions to be obtained for the mean and variance of particle velocity. The accuracy of these predictions was checked by numerical simulation and found to be good. The analysis demonstrates that dispersion in particle velocity is a function of the magnitude of dispersion in fluid velocity (a fluid property), on the inertial rate constant of the particle (a combined particle/fluid property) and the autoregressive parameter (a property reflecting the type of radial motion).  aPublisher supplied data 3avariance 3agravity 3aprobabilistic models 3aprediction 0amathematical models1 aCronin, Kevin1 aByrne, Edmond P.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Sept., v. 245 p.255-264dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2013.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010000160300001600260520075400276592002801030650000801058650001201066650001901078650001401097700001701111700001601128700001801144773007001162856008201232990002301314852000901337655001201346IND60102834720221121024154.0141106e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010283472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Hui10aFactors influencing the characterization of bubbles produced by coaxial gas–particle jet flow  ap. 723-730.  aThe effect of particle mass flow rate and annular channel thickness on the formation and characteristics of the bubbles is investigated experimentally by high-speed digital photography.

The experimental results demonstrate that the particle mass flow rate and the annular channel thickness are both crucial factors for the bubble-formation process. The bubble size, bubble growth rates and bubbling frequency are investigated by analyzing a large number of images. The radial growth rate of the bubble is still governed by the superficial air jet velocity. In addition, the radial velocity difference between the gas and particle phase is confirmed to be the main cause of bubbling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abubbles 3adigital images 3amass flow1 aLiu, Haifeng1 aLi, Weifeng1 aXu, Jianliang0 tFuel.g2013 June, v. 108 p.723-730dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.01.0783Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008700179300001300266520076000279592002801039650001601067650001101083650001101094650001201105650002701117650002401144650001201168650001001180650002401190700002801214700002301242700002501265700002301290700002801313773009801341856008601439990002301525852000901548655001201557IND60102413520221116142615.0141106e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010241352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasilchenko, Danila B.10aBimetallic poly- and oligo-nuclear complexes based on a rhodium(III) metalloligand  ap. 8-16.  aInteraction of trans-[Rh(i-Nic)₄Cl₂]³⁻ anions (i-Nic⁻ – isonicotinate anion) with Cuₐq ²⁺ and Coₐq ²⁺ cations in water has afforded complex salts Co₃[Rh(i-Nic)₄Cl₂]₂·17H₂O (1) and Cu₃[Rh(i-Nic)₄Cl₂]₂·14H₂O (2).

The country has been a pioneer in mangrove conservation and rehabilitation since the unfortunate Indian Ocean tsunami disaster incident in 2004. Still, most mangrove restoration efforts have failed primarily because of a poor understanding of environment–vegetation interactions in local mangrove settings. The current study examined the vegetation structure, and soil chemical properties of Vidattaltivu mangrove forest, a complex coastal ecosystem on the northern coast of Sri Lanka characterized by dry climatic conditions. We employed several statistical approaches, namely simple correlation, generalized linear models (GLM), principal component analysis (PCA), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), to understand soil–vegetationinteractions. Results indicated Vidattaltivu as a growing secondary mangrove forest, and soil salinity and nutrients showed to be the main drivers of the variability in mangrove vegetation structure and composition. The performance of most mangrove species (i.e., stand basal area and biomass) declined with increasing soil salinity, whereas Avicennia marina thrived at high salinities. Results of PCA and subsequent CCA suggested that mangrove soil and vegetation exist in a reciprocating multivariate system. Soil pH, salinity, organic matter, K, Mg, Ca, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Mn were identified as fundamental soil chemical properties that preserve and support mangrove vegetation. In return, tree density, tree height, stand basal area, tree biomass, and vegetation complexity sustained the soil as primary forest structural attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoasts 3amangrove forests 3amangrove soils 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic matter 3aprincipal component analysis 3asalinity 3asoil pH 3asoil salinity 3astand basal area 3atree height 3atrees 3atsunamis 3avegetation structure 3aIndian Ocean 3aSri Lanka 0aMangrove deforestation 0aMangrove restoration 0aOrganic matter decomposition 0aVegetation structure 0aSoil salinity 0aPlant nutrients1 aJayawardana, D.T.1 aGunathilake, B.M.1 aPupulewatte, P.G.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5551-00700 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 May, v. 44 p.101741-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1017413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245017000164520134700334592002801681650000901709650001101718650001701729650002901746650002201775650001001797650001901807650001601826653002801842653003201870653001601902653002301918653001801941700001401959700001301973700001601986773009002002856008502092852000902177655001202186IND60758418520221119151458.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075841852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1226762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhu10aOptimization on coordinate control strategy assisted by high-pressure extraction steam throttling to achieve flexible and efficient operation of thermal power plants  aOperational flexibility of thermal power plants is urgently needed to maintain balance between supply and demand in power grids with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy generation. A new coordinate control strategy based on dynamic simulations was proposed and evaluated in this study to enhance the operational flexibility of thermal power plants. The dynamic simulation model of the control object, a double-reheat coal-fired power plant, was developed and validated. The operational flexibility of the power plant was examined using the original control strategy, and results indicated that the reheat steam is seriously overheated when the power ramp rate increases. A new coordinated control strategy assisted by high-pressure extraction steam throttling was proposed to address the issue of reheat steam overtemperature and further increase the power ramp rate. The proposed control strategy obviously improved the control performance of thermal parameters, especially the reheat steam temperature. The change magnitude of reheat steam temperature decreases by 3.0 °C. Moreover, power ramp rate increases from 1.5% to 4.5% Pe0 min⁻¹, which significantly enhances the operational flexibility. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy is compared with previous ones from the aspects of the flexibility and efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aenergy 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3asimulation models 3asteam 3asupply balance 3atemperature 0aOperational flexibility 0aSteam extraction throttling 0aPower plant 0aDynamic simulation 0aDouble reheat1 aLiu, Ming1 aYan, Hui1 aYan, Junjie0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122676-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1226763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245012900201300001800330500001500348506007600363520095800439592002801397506003701425650001101462650002201473650000901495650001101504650003101515650002001546650002801566650001901594650000901613650001501622650002701637650001801664650001001682653001201692653001001704653000801714700001501722700002301737700001601760700002001776700001801796700001901814773010101833856007401934852000902008655001202017IND60117813320221207072926.0141126e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781332DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1132doi7 aPMC40792082pmcid7 a248916132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhong-Yin10aGenome-Wide Identification of Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA Genes and Their Potential Association with Domestication in Pigs  ap. 1387-1392.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThousands of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in the human and mouse genomes, some of which play important roles in fundamental biological processes. The pig is an important domesticated animal, however, pig lincRNAs remain poorly characterized and it is unknown if they were involved in the domestication of the pig. Here, we used available RNA-seq resources derived from 93 samples and expressed sequence tag data sets, and identified 6,621 lincRNA transcripts from 4,515 gene loci. Among the identified lincRNAs, some lincRNA genes exhibit synteny and sequence conservation, including linc-sscg2561, whose gene neighbor Dnmt3a is associated with emotional behaviors. Both linc-sscg2561 and Dnmt3a show differential expression in the frontal cortex between domesticated pigs and wild boars, suggesting a possible role in pig domestication. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of pig lincRNAs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acortex 3asequence analysis 3aloci 3ahumans 3agene expression regulation 3adata collection 3aexpressed sequence tags 3anon-coding RNA 3amice 3awild boars 3agermplasm conservation 3adomestication 3aswine 0alincRNA 0agenes 0apig1 aLi, Aimin,1 aAdeola, Adeniyi C.1 aLiu, Yan-Hu1 aIrwin, David M.1 aXie, Hai-Bing1 aZhang, Ya-Ping0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 June, v. 6, no. 6 p.1387-1392dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245016500175300001600340520152900356592002801885650001601913650002201929650002301951650001501974650001001989650001101999650001502010650001602025650002702041650001502068650001502083650002202098650001602120650001902136650001802155650001102173650000902184650001502193650001102208653000802219653000802227653000702235653000802242653000802250653000802258653000902266653000702275653000702282653003802289653002102327653002502348653005602373700002002429700002302449700002002472773010302492856009002595852000902685655001202694IND50070168020221119030051.0190318e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007016802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez, Besay10aAquafeed imprint on bogue (Boops boops) populations and the value of fatty acids as indicators of aquaculture-ecosystem interaction: Are we using them properly?  ap. 294-302.  aEscapes of farmed fish into the ecosystem have recently received a marked interest from scientists for their competition with wild populations or the risk of genetic contamination. Fatty acid profiles have been proposed as bio-indicators due to the inclusion of terrestrial oils in aquafeed ingredients. This study evaluated 1) the effect of wasted food on the fatty acid content of a farm-associated fish and 2) the suitability of fatty acid profiles as a bioindicator of aquaculture-ecosystem interactions, using the bogue (Boops boops) as a model. This species is an opportunistic fish usually associated with–or even found in–sea farms, and with a high natural occurrence along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results showed that fish farms had a direct effect on the condition index, muscle and whole lipid content of bogue inside or around the sea cage, and this effect disappeared completely at 3km from the cages. Despite the fact that aquafeeds also affected the bogue fatty acid profiles by increasing linoleic and oleic acids and reducing DHA, these profiles were very similar to those of bogue sampled close to a sewage outfall, denoting that these fatty acids are not exclusively influenced by aquaculture and therefore should not be considered as good biomarkers for escapees. However, bogues influenced by aquaculture were higher in linolenic acid than those found further than 3km from the farm or close to the sewage, suggesting this fatty acid as a better indicator of aquaculture influence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3acages 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afish farms 3afood waste 3aindicator species 3aingredients 3alinolenic acid 3alipid content 3amodels 3aoils 3ascientists 3asewage 0aALA 0aARA 0aCI 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aHSI 0aHUFA 0aLA 0aOA 0aAquaculture-ecosystem interaction 0aWasted aquafeeds 0aFatty acid indicator 0aBioindicator of aquaculture-environment interaction1 aMontero, Daniel1 aIzquierdo, Marisol1 aHaroun, Ricardo0 tAquaculture.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 414-415 p.294-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03892naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011100208300001800319520229200337592002802629650002902657650002602686650001102712650002302723650001702746650001602763650002202779650002402801650001702825650001402842650001202856650001302868651001102881653001702892653001302909653001502922653003502937653001002972700006202982700002203044700002003066700002203086700002603108700002403134700002203158773009903180856008603279852000903365655001203374IND60694904420221123031806.0200628e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069490442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlumb, Ian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4747-381X10aIncreasing non-susceptibility to antibiotics within carried pneumococcal serotypes — Alaska, 2008–2015  ap. 4273-4280.  aIn Alaska, while introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine led to declines in invasive pneumococcal disease, carriage prevalence remained stable because of replacement with non-vaccine serotypes. We assessed antibiotic non-susceptibility of carried pneumococci during serotype redistribution, determined the contributions of within-serotype shifts, and assessed factors that could explain changes in non-susceptibility.Each year from 2008 to 2015, at multiple sites in Alaska, we collected nasopharyngeal swabs and completed surveys for a convenience sample of participants. Pneumococcal serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for penicillin and erythromycin were performed. We described changes in non-susceptibility of isolates from 2008–2011 to 2012–2015, and assessed the contributions of serotype redistribution and within-serotype changes in non-susceptibility by comparing observed data to modeled data removing either factor. We used weighted logistic regression to assess whether reported risk factors could explain changes over time in non-susceptibility within serotypes.From 2008–2011 to 2012–2015, the overall proportion of isolates non-susceptible to penicillin or erythromycin increased by 3%, from 23% (n = 1,183) to 26% (n = 1,589; P < 0.05). However, a decrease of 3% would be expected if serotype redistribution occurred without within-serotype changes in non-susceptibility. Standardization by either factor produced hypothetical data significantly different to observed data. Within serotypes, the average annual increase in odds of non-susceptibility to penicillin or erythromycin was 1.08 (95% CI 1.05–1.11). Recent antibiotic exposure, urban residence and increased household size of participants predicted isolate non-susceptibility but did not explain the increase over time.An overall increase in non-susceptibility of carried pneumococcal isolates to penicillin or erythromycin resulted from increases in non-susceptibility within serotypes, which outweighed a protective effect of serotype redistribution. Characterization of emerging resistant clones within carried non-vaccine serotypes, including risk factors for colonization and disease, would support disease prevention efforts and inform vaccine strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclones 3adisease prevention 3aerythromycin 3apenicillins 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aserotypes 3asurveys 3avaccines 3aAlaska 0aPneumococcal 0aSerotype 0aResistance 0aPneumococcal conjugate vaccine 0aPCV131 aGounder, Prabhu P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8600-03481 aBruden, Dana J.T.1 aBulkow, Lisa R.1 aRudolph, Karen M.1 aSingleton, Rosalyn J.1 aHennessy, Thomas W.1 aBruce, Michael G.0 tVaccine.g2020 June 02, v. 38, no. 27 p.4273-4280dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245015400212520141500366592002801781650001201809650001601821650001401837650002201851650001201873650002001885650002401905650000901929650002201938650001001960650001601970650001401986653001902000653002002019653002902039653002302068653002302091700002102114700002202135700002702157700001802184700001602202700006702218700005802285700002102343773009002364856008502454852000902539655001202548IND60758418920221119151336.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075841892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1227002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlade, Olalekan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-973710aExperimental and numerical studies on production scheme to improve energy efficiency of bitumen production through insitu oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion  aEmulsification involving dispersion of bitumen droplets in a continuous aqueous phase (as oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion), is an efficient method of reducing the viscosity. The objective of this research is to harness the potential of insitu emulsification for production of bitumen to improve energy efficiency. Thus, O/W emulsion was prepared using poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) surfactant (with NaOH and ethanol additivities) at different ratios of bitumen: PVA solution viz. 70:30 (RX1), 55:45 (RX2), 40:60 (RX3). The data was incorporated in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to obtain emulsification reaction parameters at different temperatures (30–150 °C). Subsequently, numerical simulation considering insitu formation of O/W emulsion was performed at different injection temperatures (50, 100, and 150 °C). The results were compared with those of conventional steam injection at 215 °C. Significant viscosity reduction of bitumen was obtained from emulsification experiments. From numerical simulation, the proposed method resulted in higher oil: steam ratio (OSR) compared with steam injection method. Ultimately, with reference to steam injection (thermal efficiency, ΔEeff = 0.02 m³/GJ; net bitumen production = 692 m³), the most promising operation is the production from RX3, at 150 °C, with thermal efficiency, ΔEeff = 0.04 m³/GJ, and 649 m³ net bitumen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3aoils 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asteam 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 0aHigh viscosity 0aInsitu emulsion 0aPoly vinyl alcohol (PVA) 0aBitumen production 0aThermal efficiency1 aMahmoud, Mohamed1 aAl Shehri, Dhafer1 aMokheimer, Esmail M.A.1 aSasaki, Kyuro1 aOhashi, Ryo1 aKamal, Muhammad Shahzad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2359-836X1 aMuhammad, Isah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3420-79101 aAl-Nakhli, Ayman0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122700-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1227003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245008100201300001800282506007600300520191200376592002802288506003702316650001302353650003202366650001702398650001602415650003202431650001102463650001202474650002102486650001002507650001802517650001302535650002402548650001302572650001402585650003502599650003602634653003102670653001302701653001802714653001902732653001802751653001802769700002302787773010102810856007402911852000902985655001202994IND60117813720221207072943.0141126e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781372DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu1182doi7 aPMC40792062pmcid7 a249040132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoch, Graeme J.10aGlycoprotein Hormones and Their Receptors Emerged at the Origin of Metazoans  ap. 1466-1479.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cystine knot growth factor (CKGF) superfamily includes important secreted developmental regulators, including the families of transforming growth factor beta, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and the glycoprotein hormones (GPHs). The evolutionary origin of the GPHs and the related invertebrate bursicon hormone, and their characteristic receptors, contributes to an understanding of the endocrine system in metazoans. Using a sensitive search method with hidden Markov models, we identified homologs of the hormones and receptors, along with the closely related bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists in basal metazoans. In sponges and a comb jelly, cystine knot hormones (CKHs) with mixed features of GPHs, bursicon, and BMP antagonists were identified using primary sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Also, we identified potential receptors for these CKHs, leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs), in the same species. Cnidarians, such as the sea anemone, coral, and hydra, diverged later in metazoan evolution and appear to have duplicated and differentiated CKH-like peptides resulting in bursicon/GPH-like peptides and several BMP antagonists: Gremlin (Grem), sclerostin domain containing (SOSD), neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1), and Norrie disease protein. An expanded cnidarian LGR group also evolved, including receptors for GPH and bursicon. With the appearance of bilaterians, a separate GPH (thyrostimulin) along with bursicon and BMP antagonists were present. Synteny indicates that the GPHs, Grem, and SOSD have been maintained in a common gene neighborhood throughout much of metazoan evolution. The stable and highly conserved CKGFs are not identified in nonmetazoan organisms but are established with their receptors in the basal metazoans, becoming critical to growth, development, and regulation in all animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnthozoa 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aMarkov chain 3aantagonists 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acorals 3acystine 3aendocrine system 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahormones 3anerve growth factor 3apeptides 3aphylogeny 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3atransforming growth factor beta 0acystine knot growth factor 0abursicon 0athyrostimulin 0aBMP antagonist 0aLGR evolution 0aGPH evolution1 aSherwood, Nancy M.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 June, v. 6, no. 6 p.1466-1479dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011900167520140500286592002801691650001101719650001101730650001201741650001301753650001401766650001101780650001401791650001101805650000901816650001601825653003201841653003201873653001801905653004101923653002201964700001801986700001802004700001402022700001702036700001802053773009002071856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60758419020221119151452.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075841902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1227012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinning10aPerformance enhancement of equilibrium regeneration in a gasoline particulate filter based on field synergy theory  aThe optimization of exhaust parameters is conducive to improving the regenerative performance of the gasoline particulate filter(GPF) in the reaction equilibrium process. In this work, firstly, the regenerative model of the GPF is established to explore the effect of exhaust parameters on the index of the regenerative performance in the reaction equilibrium process. Secondly, based on the method of extreme difference analysis, a large number of parameters are optimized to intuitively study the variation law of the regenerative performance in the reaction equilibrium process. Finally, the multi-field synergy theory is used to analyze the field synergy effect after optimizing exhaust parameters. Research results show that when the exhaust mass flow, carbon loading amount, and m(NO₂)/m(NO) decrease, while the oxygen concentration increases, both the regenerative performance and the effect of the field synergy are greatly improved. Through the calculation and analysis, after the exhaust parameters are optimized, the maximum increment of the soot oxidation rate is 30.38%, and the maximum decrement of the temperature non-uniformity coefficient(CTU), pressure drop in the reaction equilibrium process, and local maximum pressure drop gradient(GMP) are 23.40%, 69.38%, and 70.35% respectively. In addition, the increasing range of the field synergy coefficient of the GPF is 2.64–3.52%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy 3afilters 3agasoline 3amass flow 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asoot 3atemperature 0aGasoline particulate filter 0aExtreme difference analysis 0aField synergy 0aEquilibrium regenerative performance 0aSoot purification1 aZuo, Qingsong1 aTang, Yuanyou1 aXie, Yong1 aShen, Zhuang1 aYang, Xiaomei0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122701-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1227013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04115naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245012500184300001600309520256200325592002802887650002302915650002502938650002002963650000902983650001402992650001203006650000903018650001003027650000903037650001203046650001403058650001303072650002403085650001903109650001603128650001603144650002103160650001703181650001903198653002303217653001103240653001703251653001803268653001803286700002503304700002203329700002003351773010303371856009003474852000903564655001203573IND50070168220221119025729.0190318e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007016822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMylonas, Constantinos C.10aReproduction of hatchery-produced meagre Argyrosomus regius in captivity I. Description of the annual reproductive cycle  ap. 309-317.  aThe aim of the present study was to monitor the reproductive cycle of a hatchery-produced meagre Argyrosomus regius broodstock. Four-year-old fish of a mean weight (±SD) of 5.1±1.1kg for females (n=7) and 4.6±0.7kg for males (n=6), were maintained under simulated natural photo-thermal regime and sampled between November 2010 and July 2011. Vitellogenesis began in March, when the first increase in oocyte diameter was observed. Fully vitellogenic oocytes of mean (±SEM) diameter between 561±23 and 621±9μm were observed between April and June. Two of the seven females spawned spontaneously in June, producing six major spawns of 390,000–940,000 eggs per day with fertilization success >97%. Vitellogenesis was associated with relatively low levels of testosterone (T) ranging between mean values of 0.036±0.01ngml−1 and 0.207±0.07ngml−1, and of 17β-estradiol (E2) ranging between mean values of 0.194±0.09ngml−1 and 0.473±0.12ngml−1. Spermiation also began in March, but only 33% of the fish produced significant amounts of milt to allow sperm quality evaluations. In May 100% of the fish were spermiating, and in July spermiation ceased almost completely. No significant changes were observed during the spermiation period (March–June) in sperm concentration (mean ranged between 18.9 and 31.5×109szoaml−1) or initial sperm motility (mean ranged between 44 and 80%). The mean duration of motility (mean ranged between 0.78 and 1.27min) was also stable during the reproductive season, with the exception of a significant decrease in May. Mean plasma T and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels in male meagre increased gradually during the year, reaching their spermiation season peaks in March (0.818ng11-KTml−1) or in May (0.263ngTml−1). The study demonstrated that gametogenesis proceeds normally in hatchery-produced meagre and under the influence of relatively low levels of sex steroid hormones. Although spontaneous spawning was observed for the first time in meagre maintained in captivity (2 of 7 females), the study demonstrated also that oocyte maturation is sporadic and inconsistent, and reliable spawning could be obtained using only exogenous hormones. Furthermore, it was shown that females failing to undergo oocyte maturation, maintain their vitellogenic oocytes in a viable condition without significant atresia for a period of at least 2months (April–June). These oocytes could potentially be induced to undergo maturation, ovulation and spawning at any time during this “post-vitellogenesis” period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgyrosomus regius 3aabnormal development 3acaptive animals 3aeggs 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afish 3amales 3amilt 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aspawning 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiation 3asteroid hormones 3atestosterone 3avitellogenesis 0aArgyrosomus regius 0aMeagre 0aReproduction 0aGametogenesis 0aSperm quality1 aMitrizakis, Nikolaos1 aPapadakē, Maria,1 aSigelaki, Irini0 tAquaculture.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 414-415 p.309-317dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168520164800255592002801903650002101931650002501952650001801977650002301995650001102018650002002029650002602049650003602075650001802111650002202129650001402151650001102165650002002176650002202196650001602218650001502234650001902249650001302268650001602281650001402297650001002311650002002321650001302341650002502354653001702379653002402396653001902420653001602439653001302455653001002468700001902478700001602497700002102513773012202534856008302656852000902739655001202748IND60634276220221118001207.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063427622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1010902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKataria, Sunita10aMagnetopriming regulates antioxidant defense system in soybean against salt stress  aThe field experiment was conducted to study the influence of magnetopriming with static magnetic field (SMF of 200 mT for 1 h) on growth, nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, antioxidative system and yield of soybean under salt stress. The results revealed the adverse effect of salinity on growth, photosynthesis, nitrogenase activity and yield. Salt stress significantly elevated the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbic acid (ASA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) in leaves of soybean seedlings emerged from unprimed seeds. However, α-tocopherol content was reduced with the increase concentration of NaCl but it was enhanced in leaves emerged from magnetoprimed seeds. On the other hand leaf area, specific leaf weight, photosynthesis, nitrogenase activity and ASA/DHA ratio were significantly increased whereas H2O2, ASA and antioxidant enzymes were reduced significantly by SMF pre-treatment; which ultimately improved the biomass accumulation, yield and harvest index of soybean under both the saline and non saline conditions. These results indicated that SMF pre-treatment compensated for the negative effects of salinity stress, consequently soybean plants do not have to deflect their metabolic energy in detoxification of ROS produced under salt stress. Thus application of magneto-priming could scavenge or alleviates the harmful effects of salinity stress at the field performance of soybean plants and it can be used in agriculture to better growth and increased yield under adverse abiotic stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abiomass production 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aharvest index 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amagnetic fields 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aAntioxidants 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aMagnetopriming 0aNitrogenase 0aSalinity 0aYield1 aBaghel, Lokesh1 aJain, Meeta1 aGuruprasad, K.N.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 18 p.101090-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1010903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010600165300001600271520125600287592002801543650001701571650001201588650001301600650001601613650001901629650000901648650001201657650001301669650001801682650002001700650001601720650001001736700002801746773011101774856008101885852000901966655001201975IND4385814320221116215453.0160903e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438581432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-006-0318-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeyrer, Michael10aInfluence of freezing and of frozen storage on the specific heat capacity of trout and herring fillet  ap. 349-353.  aEffects of freezing and frozen storage on the specific heat capacity difference of native (not heat denatured) and heat denatured fillet ([Formula: see text]) of trout and herring have been studied for the first time. Single and double freezing of fillet induced a clear reduction of the[Formula: see text] of up to 15 mJ g⁻¹ K⁻¹ at each freezing step. Frozen storage at −20 °C reduced the[Formula: see text] of herring fillet but not of trout fillet. This is in agreement with the earlier detected instability of myosin transition temperature of herring and the stability of myosin transition temperature of trout [1]. The [Formula: see text] is suggested as a new parameter for the evaluation of protein stability at freezing and frozen storage of fish. It has been shown, that a reversible endothermic effect between 2 and 22 °C in herring fillet is accompanied by a decrease of the storage modulus in the chopped fillet, which characterises the flexibility of the proteins. This mechanical change and the endothermic signal are missed in the chopped trout fillet at heating from 2 to 22 °C. This cold, reversible relaxation of fish proteins can be understood as a requirement for subsequent protein denaturation at frozen storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3afillets 3afreezing 3afrozen fish 3afrozen storage 3aheat 3aherring 3aproteins 3aspecific heat 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3atrout1 aRüsch gen.

Therefore, we set three simultaneous equations to determine the role of foreign direct investment inflow, technological innovations, natural resources, population density on biomass energy consumption, and ecological footprint. We applied a novel panel algorithm, cross-sectionally augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lags, and Driscoll & Kraay methods for 52 Belt & Road panel countries from 1992 to 2017, which provides a more robust analysis by controlling spatial dependency and heterogeneity. The empirical results depict that biomass energy consumption improves the environment of the Belt & Road region, as ecological footprint and biomass energy consumption yielded a negative relationship. However, FDI supports the ‘Pollution Haven’ hypothesis for the Belt & Road economies. The results further infer that the ecological footprint can be lowered in the economies by technological advancement. From the policy perspective, our findings suggest that policymakers in Belt & Road economies should devise comprehensive foreign investment and modern biomass energy policies aiming at cleaner industrial practices that ensure environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abioenergy 3aecological footprint 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3aforeign direct investment 3apopulation density 3atechnology 0aBiomass energy 0aEcological footprint 0aSTIRPAT Model 0aForeign direct inflow 0aTechnological innovation 0aBelt & road economies1 aZhaohui, Cui1 aHassan Shah, Wasi Ul1 aKamal, Muhammad Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3419-78791 aKhan, Anwar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7726-72460 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122703-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1227033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003800148245007600186520101500262592002801277650001901305650001501324650001001339650001301349650001201362650000701374650001301381650001101394653002301405653002701428653002201455653002301477653002701500700003701527700002701564773012201591856008301713852000901796655001201805IND60634276320221118001323.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063427632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Camila Fernanda Dias10aMaltose syrup residue as the substrate for Monascus pigments production  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effect of pH on the growth rate and production of pigments by Monascus ruber from maltose syrup residue as a substrate. The cultivations were carried out in solid and submerged media under different pH conditions. The highest radial growth rate occurred when the Monascus ruber was cultivated at pH 6.5 and the production of yellow pigments occurred at low pH values (2.0 and 2.5), whereas the production of orange pigments occurred at pH 3.0 and 3.5 and that of red pigments when the fungus was cultivated above pH 4.0. The results showed that the pH value had a significant influence on the radial growth rate and production of pigments, and especially on the profile of yellow, orange and red pigments when cultivated in a medium containing maltose syrup. Maltose syrup was shown to be a potential substrate for the production of pigments by Monascus ruber, potentiating the use of byproducts from the syrup processing industry to produce microbial pigments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus ruber 3abyproducts 3afungi 3aindustry 3amaltose 3apH 3apigments 3asyrups 0aRadial growth rate 0aSubmerged fermentation 0aThermal stability 0aMicrobial pigments 0aAgroindustrial residue1 ada Costa, Jaquelinne Pires Vital1 aVendruscolo, Francielo0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 18 p.101101-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245007500198300001800273506007600291520102400367592002801391506003701419650001201456650001601468650001001484650001301494650001201507650001401519650001001533650001301543650002501556650002201581650000901603650001301612650002201625650000901647650001401656650002601670653002301696653002301719653002501742653001701767653002201784700001601806700002201822700002201844700001801866700001601884700002101900700002001921773010001941856007402041852000902115655001202124IND60117810020221207071741.0141126e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781002DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0722doi7 aPMC40409852pmcid7 a247095642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasu, Makoto10aMammalian-Specific Sequences in Pou3f2 Contribute to Maternal Behavior  ap. 1145-1156.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVarious mutations have occurred during evolution among orthologs, genes in different species that diverged from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Here, we report the remarkable deterioration of a characteristic mammalian maternal behavior, pup retrieval, in nonmammalized mice, in which the transcription factor Pou3f2 was replaced with the Xenopus ortholog lacking all of the homopolymeric amino acid repeats of mammalian POU3F2. Most of the pups born to the nonmammalized mice died within days after birth, depending on the dam genotype alone. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreases in the rate-limiting enzymes of dopamine and serotonin synthesis in various brain structures. Similar results were obtained in knock-in mice in which all of the homopolymeric amino acid repeats of mammalian POU3F2 were removed. Pup retrieval behavior in mammals is thus strongly related to monoamine neurotransmitter levels via the acquisition of homopolymeric amino acid repeats during mammalian evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopus 3aamino acids 3abrain 3adopamine 3aenzymes 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenotype 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amaternal behavior 3amice 3amutation 3aneurotransmitters 3apups 3aserotonin 3atranscription factors 0anonmammalized mice 0aamino acid repeats 0atranscription factor 0aPou3f2/Brn-2 0amaternal behavior1 aYada, Saori1 aIgarashi, Atsushi1 aSutoo, Den’etsu1 aAkiyama, Kayo1 aIto, Meguru1 aYoshida, Nobuaki1 aUeda, Shintaroh0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1145-1156dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245013900184300001800323520089700341592002801238650003601266650002501302650002601327650001401353650001601367650001201383650002401395650001201419650005401431650002501485650006301510650001301573650010101586650000901687650002801696650001401724650004401738650002301782650005301805700002201858700002401880700001901904700001801923773009901941856004802040852000902088655001202097IND4473694420221116215421.0121003e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447369442DNAL7 a216671922pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-1040-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurairaj, Vijay10aInvestigation of the antigenic evolution of field isolates using the reverse genetics system of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV)  ap. 1717-1728.  aThe antigenic profiles of over 300 infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates were analyzed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies in a reverse genetics system. In addition, the sequences of a large portion of the neutralizing-antibody-inducing VP2 of IBDV were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences in combination with the antigenic profiles obtained using the monoclonal antibody panel, revealed a lack of correlation between antigenicity and isolate’s placement within the phylogenetic tree. In-depth analysis of amino acid exchanges revealed that changes within a certain region of the VP2 molecule resulted in differences in the antigenicity of the virus. This comprehensive analysis of VP2 sequences indicated a high selective pressure in the field that was likely due to vaccination programs, which increase the rate of evolution of the virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aamino acid sequences 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphylogeny 3avaccination 3aviruses 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aChickens 2aInfectious bursal disease virusxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aSequence Alignment 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology.1 aSellers, Holly S.1 aLinnemann, Erich G.1 aIcard, Alan H.1 aMundt, Egbert0 tArchives of virology.g2011 Oct., v. 156, no. 10 p.1717-1728dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1040-x  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012500202500002000327520254400347592002802891650002402919650001302943650000902956650002002965650001202985650002402997650001203021650001503033650002003048650001803068650002003086650001503106650002103121650001403142650002903156650001403185650001703199650000903216650002603225650002103251650002003272650002303292650002103315651001303336651001303349700007603362700005803438700006103496773010603557856007303663852000903736655001203745IND60708994120221119170524.0200902e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070899412DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez, Eliana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8610-177110aSpatial and temporal variation of forest net primary productivity components on contrasting soils in northwestern Amazon  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate is a strong determinant of tropical forest productivity; therefore, it is often assumed that Amazonian forest growing on the same local rainfall regime responds similarly to fluctuations in rainfall, independently of soil differences among them. We evaluated intra‐ and inter‐annual variation of net primary productivity (NPP) components, and forest dynamics during 2004–2012 yr in five forests on clay, clay‐loam, sandy‐clay‐loam, sandy‐loam and loamy‐sand soils, and the same local rainfall regime in northwestern Amazonia (Colombia). The questions were as follows: (1) Do NPP components and forest dynamics respond synchronously to temporal rainfall fluctuations? (2) Are the responses between above and belowground components and forest dynamics similar for different forest stands? A slight and complex synchronicity among different NPP components in their response to temporal rainfall fluctuations were found; few plots showed that aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem growth were susceptible to rainfall fluctuations, while belowground components (fine roots) showed correlation with one‐month lagged rainfall. Furthermore, despite that northwestern Amazonia is considered relatively aseasonal, litterfall showed high seasonality in the loam‐soil forest group, as well as the fine‐root mass, particularly during the 2005 drought. Litterfall correlation with rainfall of sandy‐loam terra‐firme forest was time lagged as well as fine‐root mass of the loamy‐sand forest. The correlation between mortality and rainfall was weak, except for the loamy‐sand forest (white‐sand forest, 77%). High mortality rates occurred in the non‐flooded forests for the censuses that included the dry years (2004–2005, 2005–2006). Interestingly, litterfall, AGB increment, and recruitment showed high correlation among forests, particularly within the loam‐soil forest group. Nonetheless, leaf area index (LAI) measured in the most contrasting forests (clay and loamy‐sand soil) was poorly correlated with rainfall, but highly correlated among them, which could be indicating a phenotypic response to the incident radiation in these sites; also, LAI did not reflect the differences in NPP components and their response to rainfall. Overall, the different temporal behavior of NPP components among forests in relation to rainfall fluctuations suggests the important role that soil exerts on the responses of plant species in each site, besides their effect on forest dynamics and community composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acensuses 3aclay 3aclay loam soils 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3adrought 3afine roots 3aforest dynamics 3aforest stands 3aleaf area index 3aloam soils 3aloamy sand soils 3amortality 3anet primary productivity 3aphenotype 3aplant litter 3arain 3asandy clay loam soils 3asandy loam soils 3astem elongation 3atemporal variation 3atropical forests 3aAmazonia 3aColombia1 aPeñuela‐Mora, María Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9611-13591 aMoreno, Flavio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4634-50421 aSierra, Carlos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0009-41690 tEcosphere.g2020 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.e03233-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012500153300001600278520097500294592002801269650002101297650002601318650001301344650002801357650001001385650001001395650002201405650001101427650001201438700001801450700001401468700001401482700001501496700001601511700001501527700001701542700001501559700001801574773012801592856007501720852000901795655001201804IND60767416220221120231324.0220216e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076741622DNAL7 a10.1039/d1bm01212f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuo, Yi10aMedical gloves modified by a one-minute spraying process with blood-repellent, antibacterial and wound-healing abilities  ap. 939-946.  aDuring clinical surgery, bleeding that occurs in the operative region is inevitable. Due to the blood adhesion on ordinary medical gloves, it reduces surgery quality to a certain extent and even prolongs operation time. Herein, we show that medical blood-repellent gloves (MBRG) can be obtained by spraying the blood-repellent mist spray (MS) on the surface of ordinary medical gloves, which are available for immediate use in around one minute. After the modification, MBRG not only have a significantly higher blood repellent rate than that of ordinary medical gloves, but also can effectively inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), and even promote the healing of infected wounds. MS is easy to prepare, low-toxic, and can be widely used on the surface of various medical gloves, such as rubber gloves, polyethylene film gloves, and nitrile gloves, which may have an impact on the development of future medical gloves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood 3amists 3apolyethylene film 3arubber 3asurgery1 aCheng, Xinyan1 aFang, Hua1 aZhang, Yi1 aWang, Bing1 aJia, Shuang1 aLi, Weihao1 aYang, Xuetao1 aZhang, Yan1 aWang, Xiaolei0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 4 p.939-946dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm01212f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015400167520184900321592002802170650002202198650002602220650001602246650001402262650002602276650001802302650001602320650001702336650002302353650001702376650001902393651001602412700002202428700001702450700001902467700002002486700002202506773012202528856008002650852000902730655001202739IND60707771020221116210559.0200821e20200803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070777102DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100811272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Hee  Sung10aAcceleration of Flower Bud Differentiation of Runner Plants in “Maehyang” Strawberries Using Nutrient Solution Resupply during the Nursery Period  aThe forced cultivation of strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) requires fast flower bud differentiation. Using temporary nutrient-withholding periods is a common management practice for inducing flower bud differentiation at strawberry nurseries in the Republic of Korea. After the temporary nutrient-withholding period, nutrient solution resupply can advance both flower bud growth and fruit yield. This study aims to determine the optimal nutrient solution resupply period with anatomical analysis in order to find a method for fast flower bud differentiation in the early harvest period. Here, the runner plants were divided into 5 groups, each receiving a treatment period of watering (W) and nutrient solution (N) (W40 + N0 (control), W30 + N10, W20 + N20, W10 + N30, and W0 + N40; each number represents the days of the treatment period). The nutrient solution treatments were supplied using a strawberry nutrient solution developed by Gyeongsangnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension. Rapid flower bud differentiation was found for W20 + N20 via anatomical analysis. When the temporary nutrient-withholding period was decreased, the T-N (total nitrogen), P, K, and S concentrations showed a tendency to increase. The C/N ratio showed a tendency to decrease when the nutrient solution resupply period was increased. The W20 + N20 group showed faster flower bud development than the other groups at 10 days before transplanting and on the day of transplanting (2.2 and 5.5), 6 days in a primary cluster budding ratio, and 16 days in flowering plants. No differences in fruit characteristics were observed for the different treatments. In conclusion, the W20 + N20 treatment, which maintains fast flowering, seems to be appropriate for nutrient solution resupply treatment for “Maehyang” strawberries during the nursery period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aflower buds 3aflowering 3afruit characteristics 3afruit growing 3afruit yield 3aharvest date 3anutrient solutions 3astrawberries 3atotal nitrogen 3aSouth Korea1 aJeong, Hyeon  Woo1 aLee, Hye  Ri1 aJo, Hyeon  Gyu1 aKim, Hyeon  Min1 aHwang, Seung  Jae0 tAgronomy.g2020 Aug. 03, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100811273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010700166300001600273520142500289592002801714650002301742650001201765650001201777650002001789650001101809650000901820650001901829650002501848650001301873650001601886650001001902650002201912650001801934650001601952650002501968700002801993773008902021856008602110990002302196852000902219655001202228IND60092026820221120072226.0141103e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Hui10aSensitivity analysis on daylighting and energy performance of perimeter offices with automated shading  ap. 303-314.  aThis paper presents a comprehensive global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of daylighting and energy performance for private offices with automated interior roller shades using an advanced integrated thermal and lighting simulation model. The purpose was to identify the more important factors with respect to building thermal and lighting energy performance so as to facilitate decision making in building design stage and simplify further investigation such as optimization analysis. Seven studied parameters were selected: window-to-floor ratio, shading transmittance, shading front and back reflectance, space aspect ratio, insulation thermal resistance and glazing type. The performance metrics include useful daylight illuminance (500–2000lux), annual lighting, heating and cooling demand per unit floor area and annual source energy consumption per unit floor area. The uncertainty analysis is based on the Monte Carlo method with Latin Hypercube Sampling, showing the possible ranges in these performance indices. The sensitivity analysis uses a variance-based method in the extended FAST implementation. Application of the analysis to perimeter private office spaces for the climate of Philadelphia showed the first order and total order effects of each studied parameter to determine the building parameters that have the most significant impact. Results are presented for different facade orientations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aclimate 3acooling 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ainsulating materials 3alighting 3areflectance 3ashade 3asimulation models 3atransmittance 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aTzempelikos, Athanasios0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Jan., v. 59 p.303-314dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.08.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008500201500002000286520101900306592002801325650002301353650001101376650001501387650001201402650001501414650001501429650001601444650001301460650002401473700005701497700006301554700006201617700006101679700005801740700005901798700005901857700005701916773010601973856007302079852000902152655001202161IND60708994320221119170628.0200902e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070899432DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZellmer, Amanda J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7989-026910aWhat can we learn from wildlife sightings during the COVID‐19 global shutdown?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring the worldwide shutdown in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, many reports emerged of urban wildlife sightings. While these images garnered public interest and declarations of wildlife reclaiming cities, it is unclear whether wildlife truly reoccupied urban areas or whether there were simply increased detections of urban wildlife during this time. Here, we detail key questions and needs for monitoring wildlife during the COVID‐19 shutdown and then link these with future needs and actions with the intent of improving conservation within urban ecosystems. We discuss the tools ecologists and conservation scientists can use to safely and effectively study urban wildlife during the shutdown. With a coordinated, multicity effort, researchers and community scientists can rigorously investigate the responses of wildlife to changes in human activities, which can help us address long‐standing questions in urban ecology, inspire conservation of wildlife, and inform the design of sustainable cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acities 3aecologists 3aecology 3amonitoring 3ascientists 3aurban areas 3awildlife 3awildlife management1 aWood, Eric M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2787-64511 aSurasinghe, Thilina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8758-072X1 aPutman, Breanna J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1079-55191 aPauly, Gregory B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2381-25761 aMagle, Seth B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0275-38851 aLewis, Jesse S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3071-52721 aKay, Cria A.

Its oleoresin was produced using ethanol reflux extraction method. In optimization study, the influence of process parameters on the extraction of oleoresin from dried gaharu particles was investigated. The parameters include particle sizes, raw material to solvent ratio and extraction duration. With the aid of regression analysis using response surface methodology (RSM), the results suggested that the optimal set of extraction condition to be consists of particle size of 0.5–1.0 mm (S3), raw material to ethanol ratio of 1:29.9 g/ml and extraction time of 4.97 h. Under this condition, the highest gaharu oleoresin yield was obtained, i.e. 7.63% (w/w) with total resin content of 6.90% (w/w). In brief, higher yield of oleoresin can be extracted from smaller particle size of dried gaharu in shorter extraction time and lower raw material to solvent ratio. In the comparison study, the optimized reflux extraction produced higher quality of gaharu oleoresin compared to reflux using WHO protocol, nevertherless just as comparable to the conventional Soxhlet extraction. Further investigation on the quality of extracts resulted to six chemical compounds determined in gaharu oleoresin using GC-MS. The outcomes of this study indicated an improvement of 62.97% of overall chemical compositions in gaharu oleoresin extract which includes 4-phenyl-2-butanone, β-guaiene, agarospirol, α-bisabolene epoxide, alloaromadendrene oxide and aromadenderence oxide compared to the conventional Soxhlet method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3achemical composition 3aethanol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aodors 3aparticle size 3araw materials 3aregression analysis 3aresinous wood 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 0aGaharu 0aOleoresin 0aOptimization 0aResponse surface methodology1 aIda Idayu Muhamad,1 aRamlan, Aziz1 aNor Farahiyah, Aman Nor1 aTaher, Zarani Mat1 aNor Rashidah, Ahmed1 aMohamad, Mohd Faizal0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 18 p.101066-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1010663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245010400208300001800312506007600330520098600406592002801392506003701420650001701457650001401474650001001488650001601498653001401514653002601528653002101554653002001575700001701595700002201612773010001634856007401734852000901808655001201817IND60117810420221207071733.0141126e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781042DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0812doi7 aPMC40409892pmcid7 a247602772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Hooff, Jolien J.E.10aSmall Homologous Blocks in Phytophthora Genomes Do Not Point to an Ancient Whole-Genome Duplication  ap. 1079-1085.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenomes of the plant-pathogenic genus Phytophthora are characterized by small duplicated blocks consisting of two consecutive genes (2HOM blocks) and by an elevated abundance of similarly aged gene duplicates. Both properties, in particular the presence of 2HOM blocks, have been attributed to a whole-genome duplication (WGD) at the last common ancestor of Phytophthora. However, large intraspecies synteny—compelling evidence for a WGD—has not been detected. Here, we revisited the WGD hypothesis by deducing the age of 2HOM blocks. Two independent timing methods reveal that the majority of 2HOM blocks arose after divergence of the Phytophthora lineages. In addition, a large proportion of the 2HOM block copies colocalize on the same scaffold. Therefore, the presence of 2HOM blocks does not support a WGD at the last common ancestor of Phytophthora. Thus, genome evolution of Phytophthora is likely driven by alternative mechanisms, such as bursts of transposon activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhytophthora 3aevolution 3agenes 3atransposons 0aoomycetes 0asegmental duplication 0agenome expansion 0apaleopolyploidy1 aSnel, Berend1 aSeidl, Michael F.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1079-1085dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01547naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245009200169300001600261520052000277592002800797650002300825650002500848650001400873650001100887653002000898653002300918653001700941653002200958653002700980773012501007856008001132852000901212655001201221IND60629621220221122030903.0190312e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062962122DNAL7 a10.2478/cszma-2018-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudeček, Jiří J.10aNorthern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) in the Beskydy Mountains according to Jan Prášek  ap. 175-179.  aIn the Beskydy Mountains (Lachia area, 49°25′/20°15′), Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) was caught of spring, probably before the school year 1902-03, probably in Nižní Lhoty in Silesia.

The study primarily indicates validation of a self-report through a five-scaled assessment of School Attachment based on the data collected from high school students (N = 1506) with equal distribution of regions (N = 6; prefectures) by reaching more than 1% of the total target population. The reliability of the entire scale was α = 0.737 with no mean difference between participant schools but with a mean difference of 1.55 in gender as secondary schools in Albania had more female students according to INSTAT. Data was gathered based on conclusive research design. Stratified and purposive sampling techniques were adopted. The research instrument was confirmed to have all the necessary psychometric values considered appropriate for the research.

A completely randomized design with five light treatments (0, 10–50, 320–550, 600–1150 and 3000–3500lx) and three replicates was used. The experiment lasted for 56days. The weight gain rate (WG, %), specific growth rate (SGRd) and survival rate were significantly higher (p≤0.05) in the 320–1150-lx treatments compared with the other treatments. Activities of acid phosphatase (ACP) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and content of nitric oxide (NO) were significantly higher at 600–1150lx, whereas the highest activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) was at 320–550lx (p≤0.05). Plasma cortisol concentration was significantly lower at 320–1150lx and significantly higher at 0lx and 3000–3500lx (p≤0.05). The content of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑PUFA) was significantly higher at 320–550lx than in the other treatments. However, total saturated fatty acids (∑SFA) were significantly higher at 10–50lx than at 320–1150lx (p≤0.05). The results showed that light intensity could significantly affect growth, immune response, plasma cortisol and fatty acid composition of juvenile E. coioides, with optimal light intensity being 320–1150lx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiochemical pathways 3acortisol 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3aimmune response 3alight intensity 3anitric oxide 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3aseawater 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain 0aLight intensity 0aEpinephelus coioides 0aPlasma cortisol 0aFatty acid composition 0aArtificial seawater1 aCheng, Yongzhou1 aLiu, Zhaopu1 aYan, Shaohua1 aLong, Xiaohua0 tAquaculture.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 414-415 p.135-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245014000184300001800324520094900342592002801291650001601319650001701335650002601352650002601378650000901404650001601413650001901429650002401448650000901472653001301481653001001494653002401504653002701528653002201555700002401577700001701601700001901618700002801637773013701665856005101802852000901853655001201862IND50076262120221120225028.0140410e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626212DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.7199752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanojkovic-Sebic, Aleksandra10aEvaluation of Mineral and Bacterial Fertilization Influence on the Number of Microorganisms from the Nitrogen Cycle in Soil under Maize  ap. 2777-2788.  aIn 2006, the influence of different rates of applied mineral fertilizers and their combinations with bacterial inoculants [nitrogen (N)–fixing Klebsiella planticola and Enterobacter spp.] on the number of microorganisms from the N cycle in a Cambisol and the yield of maize was evaluated in this study. The results obtained implied that high rates of mineral fertilizers brought about an increase in the number of fungi and a decrease in the number of Azotobacter spp., oligonitrophiles, ammonifiers, and nitrifiers in soil. Combined application of microbial inoculants and low rates of mineral fertilizers resulted in the greatest increase in the number of Azotobacter spp., oligonitrophiles, and ammonifiers in soil. The greatest number of soil nitrifiers, as well as the grain yield of maize studied, were determined in the variants where combinations of the microbial inoculants and low and high rates of mineral fertilizers were applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter 3aEnterobacter 3aRaoultella planticola 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acorn 3agrain yield 3amicroorganisms 3amineral fertilizers 3asoil 0aCambisol 0amaize 0amineral fertilizers 0aN-cycle microorganisms 0aN-fixing bacteria1 aDjukic, Dragutin A.1 aMandic, Leka1 aPivic, Radmila1 aStanojkovic, Aleksandar0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 43, no. 21 p.2777-2788dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.719975  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009100168520141700259592002801676650001001704650002301714650001901737650002501756650001501781650002401796650001301820650001401833650001101847650001201858650003301870650001101903650001501914650001601929650002601945650002501971650001501996650001302011650001302024650001002037650001702047700002802064700002902092700002502121700002002146700002302166773012202189856008002311852000902391655001202400IND60707771420221116210644.0200821e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070777142DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100811312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerritt, Luke  H.10aReduced Herbicide Antagonism of Grass Weed Control through Spray Application Technique  aDicamba and 2,4-D tolerance traits were introduced to soybean and cotton, allowing for over the top applications of these herbicides. Avoiding antagonism of glyphosate and clethodim by dicamba or 2,4-D is necessary to achieve optimum weed control. Three field studies were conducted in fallow fields with broadleaf signalgrass (Urochloa platyphylla) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum) pressure. A tractor-mounted dual boom sprayer was modified to spray one of three application methods: (1) two herbicides tanked-mixed (TMX); (2) two herbicides in separate tanks mixed in the boom line (MIL); and (3) two herbicides in separate tanks applied through separate booms simultaneously (SPB). One study compared the three application methods with sethoxydim applied with bentazon, the second compared clethodim applied with dicamba or 2,4-D, and the third compared glyphosate applied with dicamba or 2,4-D. In most cases over all three trials, there was a 7–15% increase in efficacy when using the SPB application method. Antagonism of all the herbicide combinations above was observed when applied using the TMX and MIL methods. In some cases, antagonism was avoided when using the SPB method. The separate boom application method increased efficacy, which allowed herbicides to be used more effectively, resulting in improved economic and environmental sustainability of herbicide applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aUrochloa platyphylla 3aantagonism 3aapplication methods 3abentazon 3aclethodim 3acotton 3adicamba 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afallow 3aglyphosate 3agrass weeds 3aherbicide application 3aherbicide resistance 3asethoxydim 3asoybeans 3asprayers 3atanks 3aweed control1 aFerguson, Jason  Connor1 aBrown-Johnson, Ashli  E.1 aReynolds, Daniel B.,1 aTseng, Te-ming,1 aLowe, John  Wesley0 tAgronomy.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100811313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245009100201300001800292506007600310520166900386592002802055506003702083650002802120650002502148650002502173650001602198650001402214650002102228650002002249650001602269650001002285650002902295650001102324650002702335650001202362650001302374650001402387653002002401653001202421653001202433653001202445653003902457653004002496700001902536700001802555700001702573700002202590700001902612773010002631856007402731852000902805655001202814IND60117810620221207071734.0141126e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781062DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0832doi7 aPMC40409912pmcid7 a247519792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGood, Robert T.14aThe Molecular Evolution of Cytochrome P450 Genes within and between Drosophila Species  ap. 1118-1134.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe map 114 gene gains and 74 gene losses in the P450 gene family across the phylogeny of 12 Drosophila species by examining the congruence of gene trees and species trees. Although the number of P450 genes varies from 74 to 94 in the species examined, we infer that there were at least 77 P450 genes in the ancestral Drosophila genome. One of the most striking observations in the data set is the elevated loss of P450 genes in the Drosophila sechellia lineage. The gain and loss events are not evenly distributed among the P450 genes—with 30 genes showing no gene gains or losses whereas others show as many as 20 copy number changes among the species examined. The P450 gene clades showing the fewest number of gene gain and loss events tend to be those evolving with the most purifying selection acting on the protein sequences, although there are exceptions, such as the rapid rate of amino acid replacement observed in the single copy phantom (Cyp306a1) gene. Within D. melanogaster, we observe gene copy number polymorphism in ten P450 genes including multiple cases of interparalog chimeras. Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) has been associated with deleterious mutations in humans, but here we provide a second possible example of an NAHR event in insect P450s being adaptive. Specifically, we find that a polymorphic Cyp12a4/Cyp12a5 chimera correlates with resistance to an insecticide. Although we observe such interparalog exchange in our within-species data sets, we have little evidence of it between species, raising the possibility that such events may occur more frequently than appreciated but are masked by subsequent sequence change.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDrosophila sechellia 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3achimerism 3acytochrome P-450 3adata collection 3agene dosage 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3ahumans 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3amutation 3aphylogeny 0acytochrome P450 0aCyp12a4 0aphantom 0aCyp6a20 0aDrosophila Genetic Reference Panel 0anonallelic homologous recombination1 aGramzow, Lydia1 aBattlay, Paul1 aSztal, Tamar1 aBatterham, Philip1 aRobin, Charles0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1118-1134dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166520200900279592002802288650003202316650002902348650001702377650001702394650001302411650002002424650001902444650001402463650003002477650001102507653002802518653002002546653003302566653003302599653003502632653000902667700002102676700002002697773009402717856008202811852000902893655001202902IND60731552520221117213118.0210820e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073155252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1069512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilla, Tommaso10aData from crosslinking and analysis of cDNAs (CRAC) of Nab3 in yeast cells expressing a circular ncRNA decoy  aPervasive transcription originating from the ubiquitous activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) generates a vast mass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that represent a potential harm to gene expression. In the compact genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main genomewide safeguard against pervasive ncRNAs is the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, composed of two RNA-binding proteins (Nrd1 and Nab3) and the helicase Sen1. The NNS complex directs transcription termination of ncRNA genes and promotes the rapid degradation of pervasive transcripts from yeast nuclei through its physical and functional coupling to the nuclear RNA exosome. We have recently shown that inhibition of the exosome in yeast cells leads to the accumulation of ncRNAs complexed with Nab3 and Nrd1, decreasing recycling of these termination factors to sites of transcription and inducing global termination defects at NNS targets. Consistent with the notion that ncRNAs out-titrate Nab3 and Nrd1 termination factors, we have shown that a similar genomewide termination impairment could be achieved by expressing a circular RNA decoy containing a Nab3 binding target [1]. In relation to this previous research article, here we expand our observations on the effect of the circular RNA decoy on NNS termination. We aimed at verifying that the Nab3 binding sequence present on the decoy is indeed efficiently sequestering Nab3 as intended by design, leading to the expected decrease of Nab3 binding on NNS targets. We employed the crosslinking and cDNA analysis protocol (CRAC) on yeast cells expressing the circular ncRNA decoy or a control construct. We present data from high-resolution genomewide RNA binding of Nab3 in three independent biological replicates of these S.cerevisiae cells, normalized by spiked-in S.pombe lysates. These data allow the useful assessment of the extent of co-transcriptional binding decrease of Nab3 by decoy ncRNA titration and will be valuable for further analyses of NNS targeting mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acircular RNA 3acrosslinking 3aexosomes 3agene expression 3anon-coding RNA 3atitration 3atranscription termination 3ayeasts 0aPervasive transcription 0aNon-coding RNAs 0aNrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex 0aCryptic unstable transcripts 0aYeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 0aCRAC1 aJaszczyszyn, Yan1 aLibri, Domenico0 tData in Brief.g2021 Apr., v. 35 p.106951-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.1069513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245014600175300001600321520153200337592002801869650002301897650002501920650001801945650000901963650002901972650001302001650002102014650001702035650001602052650001602068650002202084700002902106700002402135700003202159700002502191700002802216773009602244856008502340852000902425655001202434IND4468601720221116214805.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446860172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, SÃ³nia A.O.10aPhenolic composition and antioxidant activity of Eucalyptus grandis, E. urograndis (E. grandisÃE. urophylla) and E. maidenii bark extracts  ap. 120-127.  aThe phenolic composition of Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus urograndis (E. grandisÃE. urophylla) and Eucalyptus maidenii bark is reported for the first time. High performance liquid chromatographyâelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLCâESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MSâ¿) analysis of the methanol:water (50:50) extracts allowed to identify thirteen, twelve and twenty-four phenolic compounds in E. grandis, E. urograndis and E. maidenii bark extracts, respectively. Furthermore, ellagic acid-rhamnoside, dihydroxy-isopropylchromone-hexoside and dihydroxy-(methylpropyl)isopropylchromone-hexoside are referenced for the first time as constituents of Eucalyptus species. Epicatechin and quercetin-glucuronide are the major phenolic compounds in E. grandis and E. urograndis bark, followed by ellagic acid-rhamnoside and ellagic acid in E. grandis and by galloyl-bis-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose and gallic acid in E. urograndis. Catechin, chlorogenic acid and methyl-ellagic acid-pentose are the major compounds in E. maidenii bark. The phenolic content of the three extracts shows a positive correlation with their antioxidant activities, evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging, showing activity values between those of two commercial antioxidants, ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). These results, together with the phenolic composition, confirm the high potential of these species as source of biologically active phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abark 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acatechin 3achlorogenic acid 3aellagic acid 3aepicatechin 3agallic acid 3amass spectrometry1 aVillaverde, Juan JosÃ©1 aFreire, Carmen S.R.1 aDomingues, M.

They: are polymeric substances derived from 3-O-methyl gallate produced through transformation of SYAL via syringate; are not known compounds reported previously; have excitation/emission peaks at 365/498 nm, respectively; and have an average molecular weight of 7.2 kDa. Despite the fact that aromatic structure generally plays an important role in the planarity and rigidity of organic fluorescent substance, the spectroscopic analyses revealed that aromatic rings were not detected in the molecules. Their activity is particularly rare and the biotransforming capabilities will contribute to the development of new basic techniques for the effective utilization of lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aaromatic compounds 3abacteria 3achemical elements 3afluorescence 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3aseawater 3aspectral analysis 3atsunamis 3aJapan 0aNonaromatic Fluorescent substance 0aSyringaldehyde 0aLignin 0aPseudomonas sp.

The characteristics of this type of system have been studied by making temperature and air flow measurements in a test chamber over a range of operating parameters typical of office applications. Results from the displacement ventilation study are consistent with other studies and show that normalized temperature profiles are independent of internal heat gain. Linear temperature gradients in the lower part of the room were found, in all cases, to be driven by convection from the adjacent walls. Significant mixing, indicated by reduced temperature gradients, was evident in the upper part of the room in the chilled ceiling results at higher levels of heat gain. Visualization experiments, velocity measurements and related numerical studies indicated that with greater heat gains the plumes have sufficient momentum to drive flow across the ceiling surface and down the walls. The significance of forced, as opposed to natural convection, is also suggested by relatively low Richardson Number (Ri) values found near the ceiling. Furthermore, in cases with moderately high internal gains, comparison of the temperature gradients indicated that the effect of ceiling surface temperature on the degree of mixing and the magnitude of the temperature gradient were of secondary importance. These findings are in contrast to the view that it is natural convection at the ceiling that causes enhanced mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3amixing 3amomentum 3asurface temperature 3atemperature profiles1 aHaves, Philip0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Jan., v. 59 p.358-368dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010300213300001600316500001900332520184200351592002802193650002302221650001102244650002002255650001002275650002902285650002402314650001002338650001302348650001002361653002702371653002702398653001402425653003002439653002202469700002302491700002602514700006002540773015102600856008602751852000902837655001202846IND60736049020221122050457.0210601e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073604902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Connie R.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3921-860810aField evidence supporting monitoring of chemical information on pathways by male African elephants  ap. 193-206.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhen animals move along well-established pathways, sensory cues along the path may provide valuable information concerning other individuals that have used the same route. Yet the extent to which animals use pathways as sources of public social information is poorly understood. Here we quantified the responses of wild African savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, to olfactory information along natural elephant pathways, habitual routes that link predictable critical resources in the environment. By monitoring the behaviour of elephants travelling on pathways in a predominantly male study population, we found that elephants were highly olfactorily responsive to pathway substrate. Lone travellers were more responsive than elephants travelling in groups, suggesting elephants without social companions may be more dependent on olfactory cues on pathways during navigation. Furthermore, by experimentally presenting olfactory cues on pathways we found that male African elephants exhibited focused olfactory responses to urine cues of same-sex conspecifics for at least 48 h from time of deposition, and that urine from adult elephants was more likely to elicit vomeronasal system responses than subadult urine. African elephants may therefore potentially be able to discern the age and maturity of individuals they can expect to encounter in the environment from remote urine cues on pathways. We suggest elephant pathways act as a public information resource, assisting navigating elephants via the depositing of urine and dung by previous travellers on the route. These results could help inform elephant management, which may manipulate olfactory information on pathways in high human–wildlife conflict areas, or could use olfactory urine cues to improve the efficiency of corridors that link protected areas for elephants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxodonta africana 3aadults 3aanimal behavior 3afeces 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ainformation sources 3amales 3asavannas 3aurine 0achemical communication 0aconspecific assessment 0aolfaction 0apublic social information 0awildlife corridor1 aBrent, Lauren J.N.1 aMotsentwa, Thatayaone1 aCroft, Darren P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6869-50970 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 June, v. 176 p.193-206dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014000164300002000304520130100324592002801625650003701653650001601690650001201706650001101718650001901729650001701748650001901765650001901784650001201803650002001815650002101835650002601856700002101882700002501903700002401928700002001952700001801972700002001990700002102010700002602031700002002057700002202077773012902099856008202228852000902310655001202319IND60565900920180611000000.0170327e20151022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056590092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b068272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRimoldi, Luca10aImpregnation versus Bulk Synthesis: How the Synthetic Route Affects the Photocatalytic Efficiency of Nb/Ta:N Codoped TiO2 Nanomaterials  ap. 24104-24115.  aSelecting the proper doping strategy is essential to controlling the photocatalytic activity of TiO₂-based nanomaterials. In this work, we compare impregnation and bulk synthesis methods for feeding titania nanocrystals with either Nb or Ta as transition metal dopant and N as nonmetal codopant. The resulting photocatalytic efficiency was tested toward ethanol degradation under either UV or simulated solar irradiation. Microstructure, morphology, and electronic properties at various length scales were deeply investigated and compared with DFT simulations. Instead, under UV irradiation, impregnated samples performed better than bulk synthesis ones, with Ta-doped powders being more efficient than Nb-doped and undoped TiO₂. Under simulated solar irradiation, bulk synthesis Nb-doped materials were the most active ones, while all the impregnated samples were even less performing than the undoped TiO₂ reference. On the basis of XPS, EPR, DRS, and XRPD results, such differences were attributed to the bulk synthesis approach producing a more homogeneous distribution of guest dopants within the grains, in conjunction with a higher amount of intrinsic defects (such as O vacancies). Implications of these findings on the engineering of efficient titania photocatalysts are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aengineering 3aethanol 3agrains 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apowders 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aAmbrosi, Claudia1 aDi Liberto, Giovanni1 aLo Presti, Leonardo1 aCeotto, Michele1 aOliva, Cesare1 aMeroni, Daniela1 aCappelli, Serena1 aCappelletti, Giuseppe1 aSoliveri, Guido1 aArdizzone, Silvia0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 22, v. 119, no. 42 p.24104-24115dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b068273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010300168300001600271520081800287592002801105650002001133650001101153650001401164650001201178650002701190650001801217650001601235650001301251650001301264651001101277653001001288653001701298653002201315653000901337653002301346700002501369700002401394700002401418773011001442856007701552852000901629655001201638IND60629621620221122030908.0190219e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062962162DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2018-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhigunov, Anatoly V.10aFast and cheap identification of elite aspen clones in the North-West of Russia using ISSR markers  ap. 207-213.  aIn 2001–2006, several experimental aspen plantations were established in the North-West of Russia (Leningrad region). Three in vitro propagated elite aspen (Populus tremula L.) clones from the Kostroma Forest Research Station were used as the planting stock for plantations. The planting plans of some experimental plantations were lost, which made it impossible to identify the genetic lineages. 13-years old unknown aspen clones demonstrated prominent growth rates, and reliably overtook natural aspen coppice. ISSR markers were used for fast and cheap restoring of the missing planting plan of the experimental aspen plantation under study; as a result, progenies of three elite aspen clones were recognized. The best fast-growing and stem rot resistant aspen clones was identified and called “Kostroma”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremula 3aclones 3acoppicing 3aforests 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anursery stock 3aplantations 3aplanting 3astem rot 3aRussia 0aaspen 0aelite clones 0amolecular markers 0aISSR 0aclonal plantations1 aShabunin, Dmitrii A.1 aButenko, Olesia Yu.1 aLebedeva, Marina V.0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.207-213dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2018-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04799naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009300188300001600281520223300297592002802530650002002558650001202578650001602590650001602606650002402622650002902646650001802675650001902693650001102712650001902723650000902742650002802751650001902779650000902798650001202807650001002819650001502829650001302844650001002857650002502867650001602892650001702908650002102925650001202946650002402958650002302982650002803005650003603033650002403069650004103093650005503134650000903189650000903198650002103207650002903228650006903257650003603326650005503362650002203417650005303439650001603492650003303508650004303541650003703584650002403621650002503645700001803670700001303688700001603701700002303717700002103740700001603761773011103777856004803888852000903936655001203945IND4486926420221118012917.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448692642DNAL7 a222072182pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-011-9308-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Hala A. M.10aSelenium-Enriched Probiotics Improves Murine Male Fertility Compromised by High Fat Diet  ap. 251-260.  aA total of 75 male mice were allotted to five groups of 15 each in a completely randomized experimental design to study the effects of probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics on male fertility in hyperlipidemic status. The mice in group 1 were fed a normal basal diet and served as negative control. The mice in group 2 were fed a high fat diet and served as positive control. The mice in groups 3, 4, and 5 were fed the high fat diet supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics, respectively. The high fat diet was composed of 15% lard, 1% cholesterol, 0.3% cholic acid, and 83.7% basal diet. Over 90% of the selenium in the selenium-enriched probiotics was present in forms of organic selenium. After the mice were fed these diets for 75 days, serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and testosterone levels, plus sperm index (count, motility and abnormalities), penis length, and weight and histopathology of testes were measured. The results showed that in the mice fed the high fat diet were significant (P < 0.01) elevations of serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein, and decreases of high density lipoprotein. The high fat diet caused a decline in serumal testosterone level, reduced semen quality, and atrophy and degeneration of seminiferous tubules. No effects on penis length or relative weight of testis were observed. Supplementation of probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics to the high fat diet significantly alleviated (P < 0.05) the adverse effects of hyperlipidemia by reducing testicular tissue injury, increasing serumal testosterone level, and improving sperm indexes. It was concluded that hyperlipidemia had significant adverse effects on male fertility, which could be ameliorated at various degrees by feeding the diets supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics. Selenium-enriched probiotics or inorganic selenium supplementation gave better results than probiotics supplementation and may be used to improve animal and human male fertility compromised by hyperlipidemia or obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aatrophy 3acholesterol 3acholic acid 3aexperimental design 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3alard 3alow density lipoprotein 3amale fertility 3amice 3aobesity 3apenis 3aprobiotics 3aselenium 3asemen 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatozoa 3atestosterone 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimals 2aCandidaxphysiology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aDiet, High-Fatxadverse effects 2aDietary Supplements 2aFertilityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHyperlipidemiasxbloodxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPenisxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSperm Count 2aSperm Motilityxdrug effects 2aStreptococcus thermophilusxphysiology 2aTestisxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aTestosteronexblood 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aZhu, Yongxing1 aWu, Cong1 aLu, Chenhui1 aEzekwe, Michael O.1 aLiao, Shengfa F.1 aHaung, Kehe0 tBiological trace element research.g2012 June, v. 147, no. 1-3 p.251-260dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9308-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245008900178300001600267520145800283592002801741650002601769650002201795650001601817650001501833650002001848650002201868650002101890650001801911650001901929650002301948650002201971651001101993700002202004773010702026856004802133852000902181655001202190IND4475451020221116215716.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447545102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-012-0210-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLÃ³pez-MedellÃ­n, Xavier13aTheproductivity of mangroves in northwestern Mexico: a meta-analysis of current data  ap. 399-403.  aMangroves constitute highly productive ecosystems that export organic material to surrounding areas. They reach their northernmost distribution on the American Pacific coast in arid northwestern Mexico where they grow under sub-optimal conditions. Nevertheless, they maintain high litterfall rates with important ecological and economical implications. These mangroves are threatened by the regionâs accelerated development and population growth. In order to explore and describe large-scale patterns in the production of organic material and to assess their importance in the productivity of coastal ecosystems, we performed a meta-analysis of studies that measured mangrove litterfall in northwestern Mexico. We found that litterfall is strongly associated with latitude, and that evaporation was negatively correlated with it. Additionally, we found high correlation between the presence of Rhizophora mangle and productivity, while the presence of Laguncularia racemosa, showed a less pronounced trend. Despite the harsh conditions, mangroves produce high amounts of organic matter, which is perhaps the most important service of mangroves in these coasts. Their capacity to produce organic matter contrasts with that of their surrounding ecosystems. Substantial reductions in their surface will have consequences for the exchange of energy at the land-sea transition, which will be detrimental for biological communities and human populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3aRhizophora mangle 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aenergy transfer 3ahuman communities 3ahuman population 3ameta-analysis 3aorganic matter 3aorganic production 3apopulation growth 3aMexico1 aEzcurra, Exequiel0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2012 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.399-403dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-012-0210-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007000167300001800237520164600255592002801901650001701929650001601946650001501962650002001977650001801997650002202015650001302037650001202050650000902062650001802071650001602089650000802105650002502113650001502138650002802153650000902181650002502190650001002215653002802225653001502253653002502268700001902293700001902312773013702331856005102468852000902519655001202528IND50076262620221120225114.0140410e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626262DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.7199802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPikul, J.

The objectives of this study were to determine effects of crop rotation on corn yield, water use, and nitrogen (N) use. No-tillage (NT) crop rotations were started in 1997 on a Barnes clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Hapludoll) near Brookings, S.D. Rotations were continuous corn (CC), corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS), a 3-year rotation of corn–soybean–oat/pea (Avena sativa L. and Pisum sativum L.) hay (CSH), a 3-year rotation of corn–soybean–spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CSW), and a 5-year rotation of corn–soybean–oat/pea hay companion seeded with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)–alfalfa–alfalfa (CSHAA). Fertilizer N was applied to corn on all rotations at planting (16 kg N ha⁻¹) and side-dressed (64 kg N ha⁻¹). Average corn grain yields (1998–2007) were greatest under CSW (7.38 Mg ha⁻¹) and least under CC (4.66 Mg ha⁻¹). Yields were not different among CSH, CSW, and CSHAA rotations. Water-use efficiency of rotation was ordered as CSW > CSH > CSHAA > CS > CC. Nitrogen-use efficiency was greatest under CSW and least under CC. There were no differences in yield advantage (YA) among crop rotations during years with plentiful early-season rainfall (May 1–July 31). In years with low spring rainfall, YA was greatest under CSW (54%) and least under CSHAA (33%). Corn yields under extended rotations (CSH, CSW, and CSHAA) were greater than under CC and CS, but lack of rainfall may result in reduced yields under CSHAA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aGlycine max 3aHapludolls 3aMedicago sativa 3aPisum sativum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3agrain yield 3ahay 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3anutrient use efficiency 3arain 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 0aNitrogen-use efficiency 0ano-tillage 0awater-use efficiency1 aOsborne, S.

In this research, the age of the needles and the content of the examined components in the soil were taken into account. The research was conducted within the area of the forest at the University botanic garden in Košice (Slovakia). The little acidification of the soil that was found under the spruce crowns slightly changed with the depth (0.0–0.2 m, 0.2–0.4 m, 0.4–0.6 m). Under the stand of P. abies, a lower content of organic matter was demonstrated, than under the trees of P. omorika. The tested soil samples were low in nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium, and sufficiently rich in potassium and magnesium. The spruce needles were dominated by macroelements, and their concentrations varied depending on age and species. Both P. abies and P. omorika needles were acidic, with 1-year-old needles showing higher acidity. Low nitrogen content in the needles of the studied spruce was found, and the N:P ratio did not exceed 3.5. Statistically significant differences were found in the content of N, K, Ca, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Cd in 1-year-old needles and pH, N, P, Ca, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Cd in 2-yearold needles of spruces. The results also indicate that the bark of the studied spruce is acidic, with pH values of 4.70 (P. abies) and 4.15 (P. omorika). The P. abies bark accumulates higher amounts of Mg, Ca, Ni, Cu and Mn, and the P. omorika bark accumulates more N, P, K, Zn, Fe and Cd. The research indicates that both spruce species barks are suitable for comparative studies on bioindication of environment quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPicea omorika 3aacidification 3aacidity 3abark 3abotanical gardens 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acomparative study 3aconifer needles 3acopper 3aenvironmental quality 3aforests 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atrees 3azinc 3aSlovakia 0aaccumulation 0aneedle age class 0aN:P 0aK:Ca 0aspruce1 aMochnacký, S.q(Sergej),1 aSobisz, Zbigniew1 aPolláková, Nora1 aŠimanský, Vladimír0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.230-240dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2018-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008800160500002000248520189900268592002802167596002702195596002802222596003802250596006402288650001302352650002902365650002102394650001002415650002202425650001302447650001102460650002302471650001502494650001402509650001802523650001202541650001602553650001502569651002102584700002102605700003102626700002002657700002002677773010602697856007302803852000902876655001202885IND60708995020221119172218.0200902e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070899502DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDare, Griffin C.10aRun‐of‐river dams as a barrier to the movement of a stream‐dwelling amphibian  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman activities frequently create structures that alter the connectivity among habitats or act as barriers to the natural movement of animals. Movement allows individuals to access different habitats, connect life history stages, and maintain genetic diversity. Here, we evaluated whether run‐of‐river (RoR) hydropower projects, an emerging renewable energy source in British Columbia, interrupt the longitudinal connectivity among larval stream amphibians, by altering larval rearing densities, with possible repercussions on growth and survival. In three watersheds, we tested for differences in the average upstream and downstream density of larval coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), as well as changes to their longitudinal distribution upstream of the dams, as would be expected if RoR dams or their headponds act as barriers to the natural downstream drift of larvae. We found a 60% decrease in larval densities downstream compared to upstream of dams, consistent with RoR dams interrupting the natural pattern of downstream A. truei drift. Larval densities in the first 10 m above RoR headponds were 3 times higher compared to 100 m upstream, and when expressed in terms of relative abundance, we find a similar pattern, with between 2.5 and 3 times more larvae in the first 10 m above of the headpond than expected if larvae followed a uniform distribution. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that RoR dams alter the spatial connectivity of A. truei larvae, leading to an accumulation of larvae directly above the dam, with unknown consequences for larval growth and survival. Our findings suggest caution is warranted when interpreting before–after monitoring studies that are often used to evaluate the impact of dams, whereby we find that reductions in downstream densities could be due to interruptions of downstream movement as opposed to direct mortality.  aPublisher supplied data  cWilburforce Foundation  cSimon Fraser University  cGordon and Betty Moore Foundation  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aAscaphus 3aanthropogenic activities 3adams (hydrology) 3afrogs 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amonitoring 3amortality 3astocking rate 3astreams 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aBritish Columbia1 aMurray, Rylee G.1 aCourcelles, Danielle M.

From an economic and ecological point of view, flaws such as flattening or heartwood ratio are very important when buying material for production. 40 logs of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) have been selected from wood deposit, from typical wood delivery. The ratios of sapwood and heartwood have been quantified, as well as eccentricity and flattening, in order to determine the suitability of the selected material for processing into floorings. There are two existing methods of log processing: sawing and peripheral cutting. Sawing is the most common one and widely used, although peripheral cutting could be more effective, especially for production of base in multi-layer floorings. The total loss volume for the two methods of manipulation and processing have been calculated. First one is sawing in accordance to schematics used in the sawmill of one of the largest producers of multilayer floorings in Europe. Second one is peripheral cutting with three diameters of peeler roll. Total loss volume for sawing was 55.8 ± 10.5% and for peripheral cutting with peeler roll with biggest chosen diameter of 100 mm was 45.6 ± 9.5%. Therefore, in presented case, peripheral cutting is more efficient than sawing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3afloors 3aheartwood 3apeelers 3apurchasing 3asapwood 3asawing 3asawmills 3awood 3aEurope 0aeccentricity 0aflattening 0ataper coefficient 0aheartwood fraction 0amulti-layer floorings 0aScots pine L. 0aloss on sawing 0aloss on peripheral cutting1 aRębkowski, Bartłomiej1 aKoczan, Grzegorz1 aKrzosek, Sławomir0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.241-247dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2018-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245012000175300002000295520077600315592002801091650001101119650001201130650002101142650001701163650002601180650002201206650002301228700002601251700002001277773012901297856008201426852000901508655001201517IND60565901220221119224009.0170327e20151022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056590122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b070842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandanayaka, Atula S.

The OLEDs contained the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitting dopant (4s,6s)-2,4,5,6-tetra(9H-carbazol-9-yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN). OLED degradation proceeds mainly on the basis of excited-state instability of host molecules rather than processes related to 4CzIPN. Additionally, the electrochemical instability of radical cations and anions influences long-term OLED degradation. The formation of exciton quenchers and nonradiative carrier recombination centers acts to reduce OLED luminance. These findings highlight the need for new host material development to fabricate more stable TADF-OLEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry1 aMatsushima, Toshinori1 aAdachi, Chihaya0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 22, v. 119, no. 42 p.23845-23851dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b070843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245010500202300001800307506007600325520175100401592002802152506003702180650002602217650002602243650001302269650002002282650001402302650001002316650002202326650003402348650000902382650003702391650001102428650002502439650001402464650003502478650001502513653001302528653002802541653001402569653001302583700002102596700002302617700002502640700002302665700001902688700002102707700002102728773010002749856007402849852000902923655001202932IND60117811320221207063805.0141126e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781132DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0922doi7 aPMC40409992pmcid7 a247876192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Md Tauqeer10aDissecting Vancomycin-Intermediate Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus Using Genome-Wide Association  ap. 1174-1185.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) is currently defined as having minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4–8 µg/ml. VISA evolves through changes in multiple genetic loci with at least 16 candidate genes identified in clinical and in vitro-selected VISA strains. We report a whole-genome comparative analysis of 49 vancomycin-sensitive S. aureus and 26 VISA strains. Resistance to vancomycin was determined by broth microdilution, Etest, and population analysis profile-area under the curve (PAP-AUC). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 55,977 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in one or more strains found one highly significant association (P = 8.78E-08) between a nonsynonymous mutation at codon 481 (H481) of the rpoB gene and increased vancomycin MIC. Additionally, we used a database of public S. aureus genome sequences to identify rare mutations in candidate genes associated with VISA. On the basis of these data, we proposed a preliminary model called ECM+RMCG for the VISA phenotype as a benchmark for future efforts. The model predicted VISA based on the presence of a rare mutation in a set of candidate genes (walKR, vraSR, graSR, and agrA) and/or three previously experimentally verified mutations (including the rpoB H481 locus) with an accuracy of 81% and a sensitivity of 73%. Further, the level of resistance measured by both Etest and PAP-AUC regressed positively with the number of mutations present in a strain. This study demonstrated 1) the power of GWAS for identifying common genetic variants associated with antibiotic resistance in bacteria and 2) that rare mutations in candidate gene, identified using large genomic data sets, can also be associated with resistance phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aloci 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avancomycin 0agenomics 0awhole-genome sequencing 0aphylogeny 0abacteria1 aPetit, Robert A.1 aCrispell, Emily K.1 aThornton, Timothy A.1 aConneely, Karen N.1 aJiang, Yunxuan1 aSatola, Sarah W.1 aRead, Timothy D.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1174-1185dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245012900179300001800308500001500326520160800341592002801949650002601977650001902003650001202022650001502034650001102049650001302060650001602073650001902089650001202108650001002120650000902130650001502139650002602154650001402180650002902194650001202223650000902235650001302244650001402257651001002271653002602281653002602307653003202333653001202365653001802377653002702395653001102422653002502433653001002458700001702468773013702485856005102622852000902673655001202682IND50076262820221120215047.0140410e20121130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626282DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.7247472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Kuzhivilayil Susan10aOptimum Nutrient Rate and Nutritional Constraints in Tuber Crops Growing in Ultisol of India with Special Emphasis on Tannia  ap. 2924-2934.  a2019-12-05  aTuber crops are generally grown in marginal lands with low native soil fertility. In India, laterite soils (acidic Ultisols) are the major soils for tropical tuber crops and are poor in innate fertility. Among tropical tuber crops, some have adapted to poor soils, such as cassava, whereas others such as tannia (Xanthosoma sagittifolium L.) cannot establish well in these soils and may manifest nutritional disorders, which ultimately result in the complete devastation of the crop. Therefore, we investigated the effects from a preliminary rate trial (PRT) and nutrient-omission pot trial (NOPT) using maize as a test crop and a NOPT with tannia to determine the optimum nutrient rate and limiting nutrients, as well as nutritional problems affecting the growth and yield of tannia. Each experiment was laid out in a complete randomized design with three replications and was conducted for both garden and paddy soils. The PRT revealed that the optimum nutrient requirements for the soils were different, with garden soils requiring nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), boron (B), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) at 200, 60, 160, 70, 60, 50, 4, 8, and 0.8 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, and paddy soil requiring twice these rates. The NOPT indicated that in addition to N, P, K, B, and Mo in both garden and paddy soils, Ca and Zn in paddy soils and S in garden soils were the constraining nutrients. The NOPT carried out with tannia indicated that the main nutritional problem was subsoil acidity-induced multinutrient deficiencies involving K, Ca, and Mg.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet-related diseases 3atropical soils 3agardens 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3aUltisols 3apaddy soils 3asoil fertility 3acalcium 3aboron 3acorn 3amolybdenum 3anutrient requirements 3apotassium 3aXanthosoma sagittifolium 3acassava 3azinc 3anitrogen 3amagnesium 3aIndia 0anutritional disorders 0aoptimum nutrient rate 0anutrient-omission pot trial 0aAcidity 0alaterite soil 0apreliminary rate trial 0atannia 0aconstraint nutrients 0acrops1 aSuja, Girija0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Nov. 30, v. 43, no. 22 p.2924-2934dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.724747  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011400170300001600284520144100300592002801741650000801769650002001777650001101797650001901808650001101827650001201838650002001850650002201870650001801892650001501910650002501925650002201950650002401972650002001996651001502016700002102031700001902052773008902071856008602160990002302246852000902269655001202278IND60092027920221120072133.0141103e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Seongwon10aCooling energy consumption and reduction effect for residential buildings in South East Queensland, Australia  ap. 408-416.  aThis paper presents a bottom-up approach to quantify the regional cooling energy consumption in South East Queensland (SEQ), one of the fastest growing regions in the last decade in Australia. This study focuses on addressing the impact of climate change, economic and population growth. This study investigates the sensitivity of regional cooling energy consumption to several key parameters: air temperature, number of households, cooling-system penetration rate, energy efficiency of air conditioners and ceiling insulation. The results show that the four major cities (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay and Sunshine Coast) will constitute 73% of the total SEQ residential cooling energy in 2030 in comparison with their share of 77% in 2005. Due to the anticipated strong growth in the number of households, Ipswich and Scenic Rim will have an energy use increase of 145% and 124%, respectively, for the 25-year period. With a 1°C temperature rise between 2010 and 2030, the SEQ cooling energy consumption in 2030 will be 80% more than that in 2005, compared with 33% without temperature rise. We found from sensitivity analysis that installing ceiling insulation is more effective for reducing residential cooling energy than increasing the energy efficiency of cooling systems or decreasing the penetration rate of cooling systems. The results are useful for the decision makers to formulate future energy policies of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3acities 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3ahouseholds 3ainsulating materials 3apopulation growth 3aresidential housing 3asolar radiation 3aQueensland1 aWang, Chi-Hsiang1 aGrozev, George0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Jan., v. 59 p.408-416dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013500174520155700309592002801866650001901894650002501913650001801938650001301956650001901969650001301988650001402001650001502015650002002030650001902050650002202069650001102091650002002102650002102122650001502143650001202158650001902170650001202189650001302201650001602214650001902230650001102249653002402260653001802284653002302302653001402325653002502339700002702364700001702391773009902408856008702507852000902594655001202603IND60758417120221119151756.0220110e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075841712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1316672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Rouhollah10aMethyl jasmonate promotes salinity adaptation responses in two grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars differing in salt tolerance  aThe effects of foliar spray of methyl jasmonate (MJ; 0, 50 and 100 µM) on phytochemical changes and nutritional balance of two grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars [‘Sultana’ (as moderately salt-tolerant) and ‘Rishbaba’ (as a least salt-tolerant)] were evaluated under different saline conditions (NaCl; 0 and 75 mM). To explore optimum concentration of MJ treatment, grapevine plants were sprayed with MJ twice a day at 12-h intervals during the second week of salinity stress. The results showed that foliar spray of MJ especially at 100 µM was effective in alleviating deleterious effects of NaCl-induced salinity stress on both cultivars. The MJ at 50 and 100 µM significantly decreased ion leakage and production of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide, but increased photosynthetic pigments, soluble carbohydrate, proline, and total phenol and flavonoid contents, especially in ‘Sultana’ compared with ‘Rishbaba’. Moreover, application of 100 µM MJ was associated with enhanced the activities of catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, resulting in greater leaf cell biomembranes stability in vines under saline condition compared with control plants (no treatment). The MJ was also associated with decreased accumulation of sodium and chlorine in leaves, but increased leaf minerals and trace elements compared with control vines. These findings suggest that foliar application of MJ, especially at 100 µM, might be useful to reduce negative effects of salinity stress in vineyards and nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarbohydrates 3acatalase 3acell membranes 3achlorine 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3afoliar spraying 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amethyl jasmonate 3aperoxidase 3aphenols 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aJasmonic acid 0aLipid peroxidation 0aNutrients 0aSoluble carbohydrate1 aGavili-Kilaneh, Khaled1 aKhadivi, Ali0 tFood chemistry.g2022 May 01, v. 375 p.131667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1316673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245016100178506007600339520148100415592002801896506003701924650001701961650001601978650001601994650001102010650001202021650003302033650001902066650002602085650002602111653000802137653000802145653000902153653000802162653001002170653000802180653000702188653000802195653000702203653000902210653000902219653000902228653000802237653000802245653000902253653000702262653000702269653001602276653002502292653000902317653001902326653002902345653002402374700002502398700003002423700002702453700002902480700002602509700001902535700003102554773012102585856008502706852000902791655001202800IND60736049620221207085324.0220802e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073604962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2021.1484452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreslavski, Vladimir D.10aEffect of high-intensity light and UV-B on photosynthetic activity and the expression of certain light-responsive genes in A. thaliana phyA and phyB mutants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of high-intensity light (HIL, 4 and 24 h) and UV-B (1 h) on the net photosynthesis rate, activity of photosystem II (PSII), content of photosynthetic pigments, anthocyanin and UV-absorbing pigments as well as the expression of certain light-responsive genes (HY5,CAB1) chalcone synthase (CHS) and main antioxidants enzyme genes (APX1, GPX and GR) in the leaves of phyB and phyA mutant A. thaliana plants were studied. Both UV-B and 4 and 24 h HIL decreased the PSII maximum quantum yield (Fᵥ/Fₘ), PSII performance index (PIABS), photosynthesis and respiration rates in plants. Moreover, all stress treatments increased the dissipation of the absorbed energy (DI₀/RC) as well as the flux of absorbed energy per RC (ABS/RC). The maximal changes in photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were observed in the phyB mutant. The WT and the phyA mutant showed similar responses. In addition, the phyB mutant exhibited decreases in the expression of genes encoding enzyme CHS, the transcription factor HY5 and the antioxidant enzymes APX1 and GPX. One of the possible mechanisms protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from light excess or UV radiation is the elevated content of various pigments that can act as antioxidants or optical filters. We assume that the greater decrease in photosynthetic activity in the phyB mutant under HIL and UV-B conditions was due to the decreased content of carotenoids and UV-absorbing pigments in this mutant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3amutants 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphotosystem II 3atranscription factors 3aultraviolet radiation 0aAPX 0aCHS 0aCAB1 0aCRY 0aFv/Fm 0aGPX 0aGR 0aHY5 0aPA 0aPHYB 0aPSII 0arbcL 0aROS 0aTFs 0aUAPs 0aUV 0aWT 0aA. thaliana 0aHigh-intensity light 0aUV-B 0aPhotosynthesis 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aPhytochrome mutants1 aStrokina, Valeria V.1 aKhudyakova, Alexandra Yu.1 aShirshikova, Galina N.1 aKosobryukhov, Anatoly A.1 aPashkovskiy, Pavel P.1 aAlwasel, Saleh1 aAllakhverdiev, Suleyman I.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 1862, no. 8 p.148445-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2021.1484453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013900170300001400309520100200323592002801325650001501353650001901368650001001387650001201397650001801409650002001427650001101447650001201458650001701470650001001487650001501497650000901512650001101521650001501532651001201547700001901559700001901578700002501597773010501622856008601727852000901813655001201822IND60087522020221118175519.0141102e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008752202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeantă, Anca10aPalaeoenvironmental information from the palynology of an 800year old bat guano deposit from Măgurici Cave, NW Transylvania (Romania)  ap. 57-66.  aPollen analysis of a 270cm deep guano deposit from Măgurici Cave (NW Romania) was performed to understand the vegetation dynamics and the influence of deforestation and farming activities that unfolded in the Transylvania area over the past 800years. The study discusses the value of cave guano as a source of palaeoclimate data and tests if guano sequences record the same signals as other proxies (tree rings, speleothems, lakes or peat). The pollen record extracted from Măgurici Cave guano is consistent with the known vegetation history during the Late Subatlantic period, exhibiting two climate events: the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Human influence on vegetation is also revealed, especially in modern times, by the decrease of arboreal pollen, the increase of herbaceous taxa related to grazing and the occurrences of cereals. Cave bat guano is emphasized as a source of valuable palaeoclimate data, especially in areas where no conventional archives are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aanimal manures 3acaves 3aclimate 3adeforestation 3afarming systems 3agrains 3agrazing 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3apalynology 3apeat 3apollen 3avegetation 3aRomania1 aTanţău, Ioan1 aTamaș, Tudor,1 aJohnston, Vanessa E.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 174 p.57-66dElsevier B.V.x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245017800165300001600343520153700359592002801896650001001924650001901934650001801953650001201971650001901983650001102002650002102013650001302034650001802047650001902065650004302084650002102127650001602148653002402164653002102188700002602209700002002235773011002255856007702365852000902442655001202451IND60629622220221120184411.0190219e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062962222DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2018-00272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayamnoor, Vahide14aThe effect of coconut extract on callus growth and ultrasound waves on production of betulin and betulinic acid in in-vitro culture conditions of Betula pendula Roth species  ap. 261-268.  aTo determine the effect of coconut extract on callogenesis of Betula pendula, Roth stem barks were cultured in NT (Nagata and Takebe) basic culture media in two individual experiments: i) cultivation explant in different treatments of coconut extracts combined with 1 mg l⁻¹ 2, 4-D (2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and ii) callogenesis in NT media containing 1.5 mg l⁻¹ 2,4-D and 0.5 mg l⁻¹ BAP (6-Benzylaminopurine) and then cultivation under the first experiment treatments. The first experiment demonstrated that not all concentrations of coconut extracts lead to callus induction individually, but callus induction increased 84% in a culture containing 5% coconut extract plus 1 mg l⁻¹ 2, 4-D. Based on the results of the second experiment, this treatment also significantly increased the wet and dry weights of the produced calluses. The possibility of increasing the betulinic acid and betulin by ultrasound was also studied. Samples cultivated in the selected culture medium were exposed to ultrasound waves in two forms of 1) one exposure and 2) twice exposure (repetition with 24 hr interval) in steps of 20, 60, 100, and 160 sec, and one treatment as the control. Betulin and the betulinic acid amount were determined using HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography). The maximum betulinic acid and betulin were obtained in 100 sec in once exposure (2.3 mg g⁻¹ DW) and 160 sec in the twice exposure (0.75 mg g⁻¹ DW) to ultrasound.

While previous studies have mainly focused on the seedling stage, the mediation of drought stress by Si imposed at the vegetative and reproductive stages has been rarely investigated. A soil-column experiment was thus conducted under a rainproof shelter to quantify the effect s of Si application on the physiological and agronomic responses of maize to drought stress imposed at the 6-leaf (D-V6), 12-leaf (D-V12), and blister (D-R2) stages. The observed parameters included plant growth, photosynthesis, osmolytes, antioxidant activity, and grain yield. The results showed that drought stress strongly decreased the leaf area, leaf water content, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, and antioxidant activity (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)) and markedly increased lipid peroxidation. D-V6, D-V12, and D-R2 decreased grain yields by 12.9%, 28.9%, and 44.8%, respectively, compared to the well-watered treatment (CK). However, Si application markedly increased leaf area, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, osmolyte content, and enzymatic antioxidant activities (SOD, POD, and CAT), and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide radical accumulation, ultimately improving maize yields by 12.4%, 69.8%, and 80.8%, respectively, compared to the non-Si treated plants under drought stress at the V6, V12, and R2 stages. Furthermore, maize yields had a significant positive correlation with chlorophyll content and SOD and POD activity during the three stages. Our findings suggest that Si-induced changes in chlorophyll content and antioxidant activity might constitute important mechanisms for mitigating drought stress. In conclusion, this study provides physico-biochemical evidence for the beneficial role of Si in alleviating drought-induced yield reduction in maize, particularly during the late vegetative or early reproductive stages. Thus, Si application constitutes an effective approach for improving maize yield in rain-fed agricultural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3agrain yield 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aseedlings 3asilicon 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content 3awater stress1 aQin, Anzhen 1 aLiu, Zhandong 1 aDuan, Aiwang 1 aXiao, Junfu 1 aZhang, Jiyang 1 aLiu, Zugui 1 aZhao, Ben 1 aLiu, Zhanjun 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Aug. 05, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100811363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018800172300001200360520107100372592002801443650000901471650001001480650001101490650001701501650001001518650001501528651001801543700002201561773010101583856008601684852000901770655001201779IND60087522120221118175545.0141102e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008752212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrings, Michael10aFungal reproductive units enveloped in a hyphal mantle from the Lower Pennsylvanian of Great Britain, and their relevance to our understanding of Carboniferous fungal “sporocarps”  ap. 1-9.  aAn assemblage of distinctive fungal reproductive units occurs in a fragment of permineralized xylem from the Lower Coal Measures (Carboniferous) of Great Britain. Specimens are spherical to irregular in outline, 70–95μm in diameter, and consist of a central cavity surrounded by an investment of tightly interlaced hyphae. Clusters of specimens may additionally be enveloped in a confluent hyphal meshwork. This complement of features is quite similar to the morphology seen in mantled zygosporangia/zygospores of certain extant zygomycetous fungi. Closely associated with several of the reproductive units are single or paired smaller spherical to elongate structures, which we interpret as apposed gametangia. This discovery represents only the third record of zygomycetous fungi from the Carboniferous. Moreover, the reproductive units resemble certain Carboniferous microfossils termed fungal sporocarps in the genus Mycocarpon, and thus indirectly support the hypothesis that the systematic affinities of these sporocarps may lie with the zygomycetous fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amicrofossils 3axylem 3azygospores 3aGreat Britain1 aTaylor, Thomas N.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2012 May 1, v. 175 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245010400204300001800308506007600326520175500402592002802157506003702185650001202222650001502234650001602249650001102265650001502276650001402291650001802305650001402323650002002337650001602357650001302373650001502386650001102401650001002412650002102422650001202443650002102455650001102476650001602487653001402503653002402517653002002541653002102561653002602582653001502608653001902623700001802642700002202660700002302682700002602705773010002731856007402831852000902905655001202914IND60117811520221207050812.0141126e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011781152DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evu0972doi7 aPMC40410022pmcid7 a248142852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudry, Michael J.10aRepeated Evolution of Chimeric Fusion Genes in the β-Globin Gene Family of Laurasiatherian Mammals  ap. 1219-1233.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe evolutionary fate of chimeric fusion genes may be strongly influenced by their recombinational mode of origin and the nature of functional divergence between the parental genes. In the β-globin gene family of placental mammals, the two postnatally expressed δ- and β-globin genes (HBD and HBB, respectively) have a propensity for recombinational exchange via gene conversion and unequal crossing-over. In the latter case, there are good reasons to expect differences in retention rates for the reciprocal HBB/HBD and HBD/HBB fusion genes due to thalassemia pathologies associated with the HBD/HBB “Lepore” deletion mutant in humans. Here, we report a comparative genomic analysis of the mammalian β-globin gene cluster, which revealed that chimeric HBB/HBD fusion genes originated independently in four separate lineages of laurasiatherian mammals: Eulipotyphlans (shrews, moles, and hedgehogs), carnivores, microchiropteran bats, and cetaceans. In cases where an independently derived “anti-Lepore” duplication mutant has become fixed, the parental HBD and/or HBB genes have typically been inactivated or deleted, so that the newly created HBB/HBD fusion gene is primarily responsible for synthesizing the β-type subunits of adult and fetal hemoglobin (Hb). Contrary to conventional wisdom that the HBD gene is a vestigial relict that is typically inactivated or expressed at negligible levels, we show that HBD-like genes often encode a substantial fraction (20–100%) of β-chain Hbs in laurasiatherian taxa. Our results indicate that the ascendancy or resuscitation of genes with HBD-like coding sequence requires the secondary acquisition of HBB-like promoter sequence via unequal crossing-over or interparalog gene conversion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCetacea 3aChiroptera 3aErinaceidae 3aadults 3acarnivores 3achimerism 3acrossing over 3aevolution 3agene conversion 3agene fusion 3agenomics 3ahemoglobin 3ahumans 3amoles 3amultigene family 3amutants 3apromoter regions 3ashrews 3athalassemia 0aβ-globin 0aconcerted evolution 0agene conversion 0agene duplication 0agene family evolution 0ahemoglobin 0aLaurasiatheria1 aStorz, Jay F.1 aButts, Gary Tyler1 aCampbell, Kevin L.1 aHoffmann, Federico G.0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2014 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.1219-1233dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011000175300001400285500001500299520168000314592002801994650002802022650002302050650002702073650003002100650001302130650001902143650002802162650001102190650002502201650002302226650001402249650003502263653002002298653001702318653002402335653002402359653001002383653001702393653002002410653001802430700001802448700002302466700002302489700003302512700002402545700002402569773010102593856009002694852000902784655001202793IND50070166420221119030118.0190318e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007016642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermida, Miguel10aCompilation of mapping resources in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus): A new integrated consensus genetic map  ap. 19-25.  a2019-12-05  aThe turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a species of great relevance to European aquaculture and hence might benefit from enhanced genomic resources. The aim of this study was to integrate all previous turbot mapping resources to obtain a dense consensus genetic map. A total of 514 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and microsatellite markers from reported turbot genetic maps, were used for map construction. Among these markers, 487 (LOD score>3), including 39% expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked and 61% anonymous, were integrated in 24 linkage groups. The linkage map comprised a total length of 1414cM (1274.4cM framework) with 3.3cM (3.6cM framework) inter-marker distance, representing an estimated genomic coverage of ~90%. This map was used to refine quantitative trait loci (QTL) screening for sex, because of the relevance of this trait for the turbot industry, which confirmed not only the main sex-determining region at linkage group (LG) 5, but also the involvement of additional significant genetic factors at other linkage groups. Comparative mapping supported the macrosyntenic pattern previously observed when comparing turbot and model fish genomes and enabled identification of candidate genes related to sexual development and reproduction at LG5, such as DNAJC19 and Sox2. The available number of markers in the turbot map could be easily increased to 592 because of the established correspondence between linkage groups of the two main genetic maps, thus approaching 1 marker/Mb based on the turbot genome size. This map represents a useful tool for evolutionary studies and for supporting ongoing marker-assisted selection programs in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3asexual development 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amarker-assisted selection 3aindustry 3alinkage groups 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aturbot 3aScophthalmus maximus 3achromosome mapping 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aSex-association 0areproduction 0aComparative mapping 0aGenetic linkage map 0agenes 0aTeleost fish 0aGenetic markers 0aPsetta maxima1 aBouza, Carmen1 aFernández, Carlos1 aSciara, Andrés A.1 aRodríguez-Ramilo, Silvia T.1 aFernández, Jesús,1 aMartínez, Paulino,0 tAquaculture.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 414-415 p.19-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009900169520069300268592002800961650002300989650002401012650001001036650002401046650002501070650001301095650001001108650001301118651001001131653001301141653001401154653002701168653001301195653001001208700002201218700001901240700001701259773010601276856008501382852000901467655001201476IND60736049820221122050558.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073604982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1091362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAditya, Vikram10aScale of the issue: Mapping the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on pangolin trade across India  aRecent studies have linked COVID-19 induced restrictions to an increase in wildlife crime, with severe yet unknown implications for severely threatened taxa like pangolins.

Therefore, the appropriate evolution routes of residential buildings need balancing their carbon emission and value creation, which is realized in this paper by creating a new concept of life-cycle carbon efficiency and its relative methodology. First, the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a residential building is defined as the ratio of its life-cycle value to carbon emission, and the life-cycle of a residential building is divided into five stages, including construction materials preparation, building construction, building operation, building demolition, and construction & demolition wastes disposal. Second, the life-cycle carbon emission of a residential building is estimated through calculating the carbon emission at each stage based on its consumed energy and resources. Third, the product of the service life span of a residential building (in year), its building area (m²) and its storey height (m) is recommended to represent its life-cycle value, since this product is a physical measure and more useful to develop action plans to improve its performance. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified in estimating the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a five-storey brick-concrete residential building in Nanjing city (China) at its design phase. Possible measures to enhance the estimated carbon efficiency are further put forward, such as prolonging the service life span, enhancing 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) principles of cement and rolled steel, saving electricity and natural gas at the stage of building operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuilding construction 3acarbon 3acement 3aconstruction materials 3adurability 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3alongevity 3anatural gas 3aplanning 3arecycling 3aresidential housing 3asteel 3awastes 3aChina1 aChen, H.X.1 aHui, Eddie C.M.1 aZhang, J.B.1 aLi, Q.M.0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Jan., v. 59 p.448-455dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003400148245009100182520126200273592002801535650002201563650001801585650001701603650001501620650001201635650004101647650001601688650002601704650001401730650002601744650001701770650002801787650001301815650001001828650001401838650001101852650001001863650002301873653002201896653002901918653001801947653001701965653001001982700003101992700003002023773012202053856008302175852000902258655001202267IND60634274520221118001122.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063427452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1010702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadana Raja Vadivu, Ganapathy10aPutative volatiles in coelomic fluid of earthworm regulate the growth of Vigna radiata  aCoelomic Fluid (CF) possesses enzymes, nutrients and small molecules that could be essential for plant growth.

We measured root, shoot and seedling lengths, vigor index and germination percentage of V. radiata pre- and post-treatment of CF and analyzed the data using statistical package. Further, the cold CF was analyzed using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify putative volatile compounds. On comparing different treatments, plant growth parameters were significantly higher for cold CF (1:10) treatment than other treatments as evidenced by the increase in root, shoot and seedling length, vigour index and germination percentage, which were significantly lower in other treatments (warm and normal). We identified as many as 9 different volatile compounds, which were already reported as plant growth regulators or possess antifungal, antioxidant, antimicrobial and pesticidal properties. Our results suggest that growth enhancement is due to the significant roles of various volatile compounds along with available nutrients, proteins and enzymes in CF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEudrilus eugeniae 3aVigna radiata 3aantioxidants 3aearthworms 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agermination 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3apesticidal properties 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3aproteins 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3avigor 3avolatile compounds 0aEudrilus eugeniae 0aEarthworm coelomic fluid 0aVigna radiata 0aPlant growth 0aGC-MS1 aBalaji, Senthamarai Kannan1 aPalanichelvam, Karuppaiah0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 18 p.101070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1010703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015400172300001800326500001900344520169500363592002802058596007502086650002802161650002002189650001502209650001502224650001202239650001302251650001102264650001402275650001702289650001302306650000902319650001302328650002102341650001002362650001202372650001502384700003202399700002902431700003302460700003202493700002402525700003602549700002702585700002602612700003302638700002902671700003202700773013002732856008302862852000902945655001202954IND60702386520221119013549.0201220e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06758-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Breno Cayeiro10aBiological parameters for Rhipicephalus microplus in the field and laboratory and estimation of its annual number of generations in a tropical region  ap. 2421-2430.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study aimed to evaluate biological parameters of Rhipicephalus microplus in the non-parasitic phase in both field and laboratory conditions. It also aimed to assess correlations between duration (in days) of these parameters and climatic variables (humidity, rainfall, and soil temperature) and to estimate the annual number of generations of R. microplus in a tropical region. The non-parasitic phase of R. microplus in field and laboratory conditions was evaluated throughout the course of two years. A pasture was infested with engorged female of R. microplus, and biological parameters, including female pre-oviposition, female oviposition, egg mass incubation, larval pre-hatching phase, larval maturation, and larval longevity, were evaluated concomitantly with the collection of data on climatic conditions. The same parameters were also evaluated in a climatized chamber in the laboratory. The total duration of the non-parasitic phase in the field was longer in the dry season (1st and 4th life-cycle repetitions) than in the rainy season (2nd, 3rd, and 5th repetitions). Tick biological parameters for the non-parasitic phase in the laboratory were similar to those obtained in the field during the rainy season. The evaluated biological parameters were influenced mainly by environmental and ground-level temperatures, which modified egg mass incubation, larval pre-hatching, and larval longevity periods and, consequently, the total duration of the non-parasitic phase of the tick. The annual number of generations for the tick was estimated at five per year, which is alarming because it represents an increase, and so new studies into strategic control are needed.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/14820-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3adata collection 3adry season 3aegg masses 3afemales 3ahumidity 3alarvae 3alongevity 3aparasitology 3apastures 3arain 3aresearch 3asoil temperature 3aticks 3atropics 3awet season1 ade Lima Mendes, Ana Flávia1 aMaciel, Willian Giquelin1 ados Santos, Isabella Barbosa1 aGomes, Lucas Vinicius Costa1 aFelippelli, Gustavo1 aTeixeira, Weslen Fabricio Pires1 aFerreira, Lorena Lopes1 aSoares, Vando Edésio1 aLopes, Welber Daniel Zanetti1 aCosta, Alvimar José da,1 ade Oliveira, Gilson Pereira0 tParasitology research.g2020 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.2421-2430dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06758-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011100167500001900278520107700297592002801374650002901402650000901431650002501440650002201465650001701487650001901504650002301523650001101546650001601557700001901573700001701592700002401609700001801633773011901651856007701770852000901847655001201856IND60735102720221120164424.0210423e20210412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073510272DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100408382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelada, Kirolos  D.10aProcess Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis of Large-Scale Bioproduction of Sweet Protein Thaumatin II  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere are currently worldwide efforts to reduce sugar intake due to the various adverse health effects linked with the overconsumption of sugars. Artificial sweeteners have been used as an alternative to nutritive sugars in numerous applications; however, their long-term effects on human health remain controversial. This led to a shift in consumer preference towards non-caloric sweeteners from natural sources. Thaumatins are a class of intensely sweet proteins found in arils of the fruits of the West-African plant Thaumatococcus daniellii. Thaumatins’ current production method through aqueous extraction from this plant and uncertainty of the harvest from tropical rainforests limits its supply while the demand is increasing. Despite successful recombinant expression of the protein in several organisms, no large-scale bioproduction facilities exist. We present preliminary process design, process simulation, and economic analysis for a large-scale (50 metric tons/year) production of a thaumatin II variant using several different molecular farming platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThaumatococcus daniellii 3aaril 3aconsumer preferences 3aeconomic analysis 3ahuman health 3aprocess design 3aprotein sweeteners 3asugars 3auncertainty1 aTusé, Daniel 1 aGleba, Yuri 1 aMcDonald, Karen A.,1 aNandi, Somen 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 12, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100408383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04211naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015900165300001400324520251700338592002802855650002202883650002102905650002302926650002302949650002002972650001202992650002003004650001603024650001103040650002103051650002603072650002103098650001103119650002403130650000903154650000903163650001503172650001103187650002503198650001003223651001403233653002903247653002503276653001503301653002303316653002803339700001903367700001603386700001303402700001603415773011003431856008303541852000903624655001203633IND60526283220221120131448.0190403e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeake, A.S.13aAn alternative approach to whole-farm deficit irrigation analysis: Evaluating the risk-efficiency of wheat irrigation strategies in sub-tropical Australia  ap. 61-76.  aUncertainty exists as to the optimum whole-farm irrigation strategy for wheat growing in subtropical Australia under water-limited conditions. While deficit irrigation has been shown to have greater economic water productivity (EWP) in such circumstances in other regions, there are limitations to the cost/revenue function approach traditionally used to evaluate EWP, including inapplicability across environments. These limitations can however be overcome with the use of a validated cropping systems model.The APSIM farming systems model was therefore used to determine whether growing larger areas of deficit irrigated wheat is more profitable than full irrigation of a smaller area in sub-tropical Australia, under water limited conditions. Optimal irrigation strategies were not only profitable but also those considered risk-efficient, i.e. closest to a 1:2 ‘line of indifference’ that identifies the two unit increase in risk (measured as standard deviation) acceptable to farmers in return for a unit increase in profit. The value of stored soil water was assessed by simulating rainfed crop production on unirrigated land, and/or assigning an economic value to stored soil water remaining at the end of the season.The results demonstrated that deficit irrigation of larger areas of wheat was generally more profitable and risk-efficient than smaller areas of full irrigation. When precipitation or stored soil water at sowing was increased, the most risk-efficient strategies were those that spread water across a larger area at a reduced frequency of irrigation. However in a low rainfall environment when water was expensive and soil water had the same economic value as irrigation water, fully irrigating a smaller area was the most profitable and risk-efficient option. The importance of evaluating farm-management strategies using EWP (i.e. incorporating gross margins) instead of crop water productivity (grain yield per unit of water use) was evident, as re-ranking of farm-management strategies occurred between these alternative methods of calculating whole-farm WP. Accounting for the intrinsic value of stored soil water and precipitation was fundamental to understanding the benefit of deficit irrigation strategies in water limited situations, as the larger crop area sown in conjunction with deficit irrigation strategies accessed much larger absolute volumes of soil water and precipitation. Future evaluations of deficit irrigation strategies should account for such considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acropping systems 3adeficit irrigation 3aeconomic valuation 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3agrain yield 3aincome 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3amodels 3aprofits and margins 3arain 3arisk 3asoil water 3asowing 3astatistical analysis 3awheat 3aAustralia 0aSupplementary irrigation 0aWater use efficiency 0aSoil water 0aPartial irrigation 0aSupplemental irrigation1 aCarberry, P.S.1 aRaine, S.R.1 aGett, V.1 aSmith, R.J.0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 May, v. 169 p.61-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013900159500001900298520125600317592002801573650001401601650001701615650001101632650001501643650001401658650001701672650001601689650001201705650001301717650001301730650001001743650001401753650003001767700001801797700001901815700002301834700001901857700002101876700002101897700002001918700002001938700001801958700002401976700001802000700001902018700002202037700002202059773011902081856007702200852000902277655001202286IND60729297020221117223158.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072929702DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapez, Jan 10aSpindle Cell Hemangioma and Atypically Localized Juxtaglomerular Cell Tumor in a Patient with Hereditary BRIP1 Mutation: A Case Report  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSpindle cell hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor typically occurring in the dermis or subcutis of distal extremities as red–brown lesions that can grow in both size and number over time. They can be very painful and potentially disabling. A family history of cancer or previous history may be relevant and must be taken into consideration. Juxtaglomerular cell tumor (reninoma) is an extremely rare cause of secondary hypertension diagnosed mostly among adolescents and young adults. Excessive renin secretion results in secondary hyperaldosteronism. Subsequent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, together with high blood pressure, are clues for clinical diagnosis. Histological examination of the excised tumor leads to a definitive diagnosis. Reninoma is found in subcapsular localization, in most cases as a solitary mass, in imaging studies of kidneys. Exceptionally, it can be located in another part of a kidney. Both spindle cell hemangioma and reninoma are extremely rare tumors in children and adolescents. Herein, the authors present a case report of a patient with hereditary BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) mutation, spindle cell hemangioma, and secondary hypertension caused by atypically localized reninoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalosis 3acase studies 3adermis 3ahemangioma 3ahistology 3ahypertension 3ahypokalemia 3akidneys 3amutation 3apatients 3arenin 3asecretion 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aStarha, Jiri 1 aZerhau, Pavel 1 aPavlovska, Denisa 1 aJezova, Marta 1 aJurencak, Tomas 1 aSlaba, Katerina 1 aSterba, Martin 1 aKerekes, Arpad 1 aMerta, Tomas 1 aHaluskova, Terezia 1 aPalova, Hana 1 aSlaby, Ondrej 1 aSterba, Jaroslav 1 aJabandziev, Petr 0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009700161300001800258520140900276592002801685650002301713650002101736650002301757650002501780650001601805650001501821650002201836650001101858650001401869650001001883650002201893650002201915650002101937650002401958650005201982650001402034650002202048653002602070653001202096653002002108653001802128653001802146653002402164700001702188700001702205700001702222700002102239700001702260773008002277856008102357852000902438655001202447IND50059594320221118025725.0160511e20121019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005959432DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-012-0103-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Quan10aMolecular cloning and expression analysis of a new WD40 repeat protein gene in upland cotton  ap. 1112-1118.  aA new member of the WD repeat protein family, named GhWD40, was cloned from a near-isogenic line for glands in cotton. It has 2629 bp cDNA and a complete opening reading frame (ORF) of 1239 bp, containing the initial code (ATG) and terminal code (TAG); there is a 1061 bp non-coding sequence at the 5′-end, and a 329 bp non-coding sequence at the 3′-end, including the poly(A) sequence (accession number: JN714279). The predicted protein of the complete ORF comprised 412 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.88. Protein domain scanning showed that the novel protein has five wd40 motifs and belongs to the WD40 family. From a search for GhWD40 cDNA and amino acid sequences in the database, it has 77% sequence identity and was 90% sequence positive with the WD-40 repeat protein from Trifolium pratense (accession number BAE71307.1), and 80% sequence identity and 89% sequence positivity with the ribosome biogenesis protein bop1 from Ricinus communis (accession number XP 002529002.1). We propose that GhWD40 may play the same role as bop1. In addition, expression of GhWD40 in near-isogenic lines 11 and 3 (with and without glands, respectively) was studied by quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction, and the level in near-isogenic line 11 was higher than that in near-isogenic line 3, suggesting that GhWD40 may be related to gland formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aRicinus communis 3aTrifolium pratense 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiogenesis 3acomplementary DNA 3acotton 3adatabases 3agenes 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomes 3asequence analysis 0aGossypium hirsutum L. 0acloning 0agene expression 0apigment gland 0aupland cotton 0aWD40 repeat protein1 aCai, Yingfan1 aZhu, Xiaoyan1 aHe, Xiaohong1 aJiang, Huaizhong1 aHe, Guanghua0 tBiologia.g2012 Oct. 19, v. 67, no. 6 p.1112-1118dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0103-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245014400214300001800358500001900376520143500395592002801830596004101858650001501899650001301914650001001927650001201937650001601949650002601965650001001991650001402001650001902015650001602034650001602050650000902066650001002075650001202085650001002097650001202107650001702119650001402136650001302150651001102163700002202174700002302196700002302219700002402242700002602266700002602292700002102318773013002339856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60702386720221119013440.0201220e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06756-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Francisco C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2034-412110aMolecular and pathological investigations of Plasmodium parasites infecting striped forest whiptail lizards (Kentropyx calcarata) in Brazil  ap. 2631-2640.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe genus Plasmodium (Plasmodiidae) ranks among the most widespread intracellular protozoan parasites affecting a wide range of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Little information is available about lizard malaria parasites in South America, and the pathological features of the resulting parasitoses remain unknown or poorly understood. To partially fill in these gaps, we conducted blood smear analysis, molecular detection, and phylogenetic and pathological investigations in lizards inhabiting an Atlantic Forest fragment in Paraiba, Brazil. From 104 striped forest whiptails (Kentropyx calcarata) screened for the presence of haemosporidian parasites, 67 (64.4%) were positive. Four of five Amazon lava lizards (Strobilurus torquatus) we collected from this same area were also positive. A total of 27 forest whiptails were infected with a new genetic lineage of Plasmodium kentropyxi and other Plasmodium lineages were also detected. Histopathological analysis in infected forest whiptails revealed systemic intraerythrocytic Plasmodium stages, mainly gametocytes, in the liver, lung, and heart. Also, the liver of infected lizards had mild to moderate levels of Kupffer cell and melanomacrophage hypertrophy/hyperplasia with sinusoid leukocytosis. Overall, our findings suggest that an endemic Plasmodium species causes histological alterations that are not related to major pathological processes in striped forest whiptails.  aPublisher supplied data  a1717498cNational Science Foundation 3aPlasmodium 3aProtozoa 3ablood 3aforests 3agametocytes 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aheart 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3alava 3aliver 3alizards 3alungs 3amalaria 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aBrazil1 aAlves, Luiz G.

The results of the simulation have been used to optimize the system for the minimum cost per cubic meter of the desalinated water. The performance of the hybrid wind/solar powered RO system has been analyzed under Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, weather data for a typical year. The performance has been evaluated under a constant RO load of 1kW for 12h/day and 24h/day. The simulation results revealed that the optimum system that powers a 1-kW RO system for 12h/day that yields a minimum levelized cost of energy comprises 2 wind turbines, 40 PVs modules and 6 batteries and the levelized cost of energy of such system is found to be 0.624$/kWh. On the other hand, for a load of 1-kW for 24h/day, the optimum system consists of 6 wind turbines, 66 PVs modules and 16 batteries with a minimum levelized cost of energy 0.672$/kWh. Depending on the salinity of the raw water, the energy consumption for desalination ranges between 8 and 20kWh/m³. This means that the cost of using the proposed optimum hybrid wind/solar system for water desalination will range between $3.693/m³ and $3. 812/m³ which is less than the range reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3adesalination 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3areverse osmosis 3asalinity 3asolar energy 3awind 3awind turbines 3aSaudi Arabia1 aSahin, Ahmet Z.1 aAl-Sharafi, Abdullah1 aAli, Ahmad I.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Nov., v. 75 p.86-97dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014600164300001800310520109100328592002801419650001801447650002101465650002801486650001401514650001401528650001601542700002201558700002101580700002301601700002301624700002201647700002401669700002001693700002401713773009901737856007301836852000901909655001201918IND60135866620221123025951.0150522e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013586662DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.128182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Maud.

While each stressor alone has been studied in detail, their combined effects on the outcome of ecological interactions are poorly understood. We measured predation rates and predator selectivity of two closely related species of damselfish exposed to a predatory dottyback. We found temperature and CO₂interacted synergistically on overall predation rate, but antagonistically on predator selectivity. Notably, elevated CO₂or temperature alone reversed predator selectivity, but the interaction between the two stressors cancelled selectivity. Routine metabolic rates of the two prey showed strong species differences in tolerance to CO₂and not temperature, but these differences did not correlate with recorded mortality. This highlights the difficulty of linking species‐level physiological tolerance to resulting ecological outcomes. This study is the first to document both synergistic and antagonistic effects of elevated CO₂and temperature on a crucial ecological process like predator–prey dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3afish communities 3ainterspecific variation 3amortality 3apredation 3atemperature1 aMunday, Philip L.1 aRummer, Jodie L.1 aMcCormick, Mark I.1 aCorkill, Katherine1 aWatson, Sue‐Ann1 aAllan, Bridie J.

Root hair length and density (RHL/D) increase phosphorus acquisition by expanding the soil volume subject to phosphorus depletion through diffusion. We hypothesized that shallow BRGA and large RHL/D are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition, meaning that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. To evaluate this hypothesis, phosphorus acquisition in the field in Mozambique was compared among recombinant inbred lines of common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) having four distinct root phenotypes: long root hairs and shallow basal roots, long root hairs and deep basal roots, short root hairs and shallow basal roots, and short root hairs and deep basal roots. The results revealed substantial synergism between BRGA and RHL/D. Compared with short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes, long root hairs increased shoot biomass under phosphorus stress by 89%, while shallow roots increased shoot biomass by 58%. Genotypes with both long root hairs and shallow roots had 298% greater biomass accumulation than short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes. Therefore, the utility of shallow basal roots and long root hairs for phosphorus acquisition in combination is twice as large as their additive effects. We conclude that the anatomical phene of long, dense root hairs and the architectural phene of shallower basal root growth are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition. Phene synergism may be common in plant biology and can have substantial importance for plant fitness, as shown here.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeans 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 3asynergism1 aPostma, Johannes Auke1 aLynch, Jonathan P.,0 tPlant physiology.g2015 Apr., v. 167, no. 4 p.1430-1439dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.15.001453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017400165300001600339520121400355592002801569650001701597650001601614650002601630650002901656650001501685650002401700650002101724650000901745650001801754650002901772700001501801700001801816773010501834856004801939852000901987655001201996IND50065279220221121022022.0130427e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006527922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-013-0046-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Joo Hyun10aSimple and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry methods for quantification of tadalafil in rat plasma: application to pharmacokinetic study in rats  ap. 457-463.  aA simple and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated in rat plasma for quantification of tadalafil, a novel therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction. Tadalafil and acebutolol (internal standard) were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse phase C₁₈ column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1 % formic acid and acetonitrile (45:55, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The protonated analyte was quantitated by multiple reaction monitoring with a Waters Quattro micro™ API mass spectrometer. The calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 2–2000 ng/mL, and the lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/mL with a precision (CV %) of 10.9 %. Acceptable intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were obtained at 3 concentration levels (3, 200, and 1500 ng/mL). Tadalafil was found to be stable in a battery of studies, including bench top, freeze–thaw, and autosampler conditions. The validated method was successfully used to determine tadalafil concentration in rat plasma samples after oral administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aformic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aOh, Ju-Hee1 aYi, Yŏng-ju,0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2013 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.457-463dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-013-0046-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014500167520170600312592002802018650001502046650002002061650001702081650001302098650002202111650002902133650003102162650001102193650001802204650001502222650001602237650003702253650001402290650002002304650001002324653001802334653002402352653003702376653005002413653002102463700001502484700001702499700001602516700001602532700001702548700001602565700001702581773010502598856008502703852000902788655001202797IND60679627220221120185612.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067962722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1054322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Meiqing10aInsights into biomonitoring of human exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with hair analysis: A case study in e-waste recycling area  aIn this study, 96 pairs of hair and urine samples were collected from e-waste (EW) dismantling workers of an industrial park, as well as residents living in surrounding areas. The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hydroxylated PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) were analyzed . The results show that concentrations of Σ₁₅PAHs ranged from 6.24 to 692 ng/g dry weight (dw) and Σ₁₂OH-PAHs from undetected to 187 ng/g dw in hair external (hair-Ex), and ranged from 31.7 to 738 ng/g dw and 21.6 to 1887 ng/g dw in hair internal (hair-In). There was no significant difference in exposure levels between EW dismantling workers and residents of the surrounding area. For the parent PAHs, the concentrations of Σ₁₅PAHs of hair-In were comparable with those of hair-Ex for all populations except for the child residents. On the contrary, for the OH-PAHs, the concentrations of Σ₁₂OH-PAHs of hair-In were 9–37 times higher than those of hair-Ex for populations. Moreover, the congener profiles of OH-PAHs of hair-In were different from those of hair-Ex, but similar to that of urine. Particularly, 3-OH-Bap, which is a carcinogenic metabolite, was only detected in the hair-In. These results indicate that OH-PAHs in hair-In, just like in urine, are mainly derived from endogenous metabolism and could be considered as reliable biomarkers for PAHs exposure. However, there was almost no significant correlations between hair-In and urine for OH-PAHs. This indicates that more attention should be paid to OH-PAHs when conducting PAHs exposure risk assessment using hair, which will help to obtain more reliable and comprehensive information on health risk assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenicity 3acase studies 3achildren 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arecycling 3arisk assessment 3aurine 0aHair analysis 0aHuman biomonitoring 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aHydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aE-waste exposure1 aTang, Jian1 aMa, Shengtao1 aYu, Yingxin1 aLi, Guiying1 aFan, Ruifang1 aMai, Bixian1 aAn, Taicheng0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.105432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1054323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008900160300001800249520157500267592002801842650001201870650001101882650001901893650001201912650001501924650002001939650001401959650001101973650001101984650001901995650001402014650001602028650001902044650001002063650002102073650001202094651001102106700001802117700002202135700002502157773009902182856007302281852000902354655001202363IND60135866920221123025918.0150522e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013586692DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.128202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarvin, David C.10aNo evidence that elevated CO2 gives tropical lianas an advantage over tropical trees  ap. 2055-2069.  aRecent studies indicate that lianas are increasing in size and abundance relative to trees in neotropical forests. As a result, forest dynamics and carbon balance may be altered through liana‐induced suppression of tree growth and increases in tree mortality. Increasing atmospheric CO₂is hypothesized to be responsible for the increase in neotropical lianas, yet no study has directly compared the relative response of tropical lianas and trees to elevated CO₂. We explicitly tested whether tropical lianas had a larger response to elevated CO₂than co‐occurring tropical trees and whether seasonal drought alters the response of either growth form. In two experiments conducted in central Panama, one spanning both wet and dry seasons and one restricted to the dry season, we grew liana (n = 12) and tree (n = 10) species in open‐top growth chambers maintained at ambient or twice‐ambient CO₂levels. Seedlings of eight individuals (four lianas, four trees) were grown in the ground in each chamber for at least 3 months during each season. We found that both liana and tree seedlings had a significant and positive response to elevated CO₂(in biomass, leaf area, leaf mass per area, and photosynthesis), but that the relative response to elevated CO₂for all variables was not significantly greater for lianas than trees regardless of the season. The lack of differences in the relative response between growth forms does not support the hypothesis that elevated CO₂is responsible for increasing liana size and abundance across the neotropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adrought 3adry season 3agrowth chambers 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alianas 3aphotosynthesis 3aseedlings 3atree growth 3atree mortality 3atrees 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aPanama1 aWinter, Klaus1 aBurnham, Robyn J.1 aSchnitzer, Stefan A.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.2055-2069dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.128203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245018800209300001800397500001900415520113900434592002801573596007001601650001201671650001701683650001201700650003401712650001801746650001001764650001901774650002001793650001701813650002001830650001701850650001701867650001301884650001701897650001201914651002801926700002101954773013001975856008302105852000902188655001202197IND60702387220221119013808.0201220e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070238722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06764-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirozhkova, Daria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4214-632910aOpisthorchis felineus genes differentially expressed under praziquantel shed light on the nature of tegument disruption and indicate the adaptive role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase  ap. 2695-2702.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOpisthorchis felineus is a trematode flatworm that parasitises mammals, including humans, and is mainly spread throughout Eastern Europe and Western Siberia. The main drug used in treatment of opisthorchiasis and other trematode and cestode infestations is praziquantel (PZQ). We provide a possible explanation of PZQ-mediated tegument disruption. The idea is that the nature of tegument disruption is related to failure of surface renovation due to insufficiency of microtubule transport of vesicles. This insufficiency arises from microtubule destabilisation, which in the medium term leads to the decrease in tubulins alpha, beta and dynein mRNA amounts and deficiency of the corresponding proteins. We also found the upregulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene, and we concluded that its protein product helped to overcome the effect of praziquantel and might be a promising target for combined anthelmintic therapy with PZQ. We concluded that function of saposin-like protein 2 (SAP2) is unlikely associated with membrane fusion, and SAP2 is probably able to bind some type of hydrophobic compounds including praziquantel.  aPublisher supplied data  a0324-2019-0041-C-01cSiberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences 3aCestoda 3aOpisthorchis 3aSiberia 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3adynein ATPase 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane fusion 3amicrotubules 3aopisthorchiasis 3aparasitology 3apraziquantel 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3atubulin 3aEastern European region1 aKatokhin, Alexey0 tParasitology research.g2020 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.2695-2702dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06764-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010700165300001800272520071300290592002801003653002401031653002301055653001401078653001401092700001601106700001901122700001701141700001801158700001801176700001701194773012401211856008501335852000901420655001201429IND60126622820221121114747.0151107e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012662282DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-93.5.14852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, L.

We investigated the effect of biochar incorporation alone (B) and in association with mineral (BMin), digestate (BDig) and slurry (BSlu) fertilization, compared to the respective controls without biochar (C, Min, Dig and Slu), in a silage maize–Italian ryegrass rotation, on yield, soil fertility parameters and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions. Two types of biochar in three doses (0.2, 0.45, 0.9%) were tested in two cropping seasons. Biochar did not significantly affect maize yield; however, BDig tended to increase silage yield and the ear component compared to Dig, while BMin tended to reduce maize N uptake compared to Min. Biochar incorporation significantly increased soil organic C (+31%) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (+13%) in all the fertilization treatments; BMin and BDig also showed an increase compared to biochar alone (B). Emission of N₂O was mainly driven by fertilization, digestate exhibiting the highest emissions. Biochar addition decreased the cumulative N₂O emissions consistently in all the fertilization treatments, though not significantly. The association of biochar with organic fertilizers, in particular digestate, appears promising in increasing the fertilizer efficiency and reducing N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aagriculture 3abiochar 3acarbon sinks 3acation exchange capacity 3acorn 3aforage 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient retention 3asilage 3aslurries 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon1 aBertora, Chiara 1 aValagussa, Massimo 1 aBorrelli, Lamberto 1 aCabassi, Giovanni 1 aTosca, Alberto 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 June 26, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120709253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001600281520099700297592002801294650002801322650002501350650002001375650001801395650002201413650000901435650001101444650002001455650001501475650001301490653001501503653001101518653001701529653001901546700001601565700001401581700001201595700001801607700001901625700001401644700001301658700001601671700001801687700001801705700001801723773010601741856008701847852000901934655001201943IND60597554720221119192142.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059755472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Yu-Yan10aEffect of iron salt type and dosing mode on Fenton-based pretreatment of rice straw for enzymatic hydrolysis  ap. 394-398.  aFenton-based processes with four different iron salts in two different dosing modes were used to pretreat rice straw (RS) samples to increase their enzymatic digestibility. The composition analysis shows that the RS sample pretreated by the dosing mode of iron salt adding into H₂O₂ has a much lower hemicellulose content than that pretreated by the dosing mode of H₂O₂ adding into iron salt, and the RS sample pretreated by the chloride salt-based Fenton process has a much lower lignin content and a slightly lower hemicellulose content than that pretreated by the sulphate salt-based Fenton process. The higher concentration of reducing sugar observed on the RS sample with lower lignin and hemicellulose contents justifies that the Fenton-based process could enhance the enzymic hydrolysis of RS by removing hemicellulose and lignin and increasing its accessibility to cellulase. FeCl₃·6H₂O adding into H₂O₂ is the most efficient Fenton-based process for RS pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aferric chloride 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3alignin 3areducing sugars 3arice straw 3asulfates 0aRice straw 0aFenton 0aPretreatment 0aReducing sugar1 aZhou, Si-Li1 aDai, Xiao1 aWu, Han1 aXiong, Zi-Yao1 aQin, Yuan-Hang1 aMa, Jiayu1 aYang, Li1 aWu, Zai-Kun1 aWang, Tie-Lin1 aWang, Wei-Guo1 aWang, Cun-Wen0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Oct., v. 265 p.394-398dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245009700174300001800271520067700289592002800966650002400994650001001018650001101028650001201039700001801051773010801069856008801177990002301265852000901288655001201297IND60096175520221118014808.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Sakshi10aFractal and EMD based removal of baseline wander and powerline interference from ECG signals  ap. 1889-1899.  aThis paper presents novel methods for baseline wander removal and powerline interference removal from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Baseline wander and clean ECG have been modeled as 1st and 2nd-order fractional Brownian motion (fBm) processes, respectively. This fractal modeling is utilized to propose projection operator based approach for baseline wander removal. Powerline interference is removed by using a hybrid approach of empirical mode decomposition method (EMD) and wavelet analysis.

Assessing marine plastic pollution directly is challenging, and an alternative is to use seabirds as bioindicators. Our analyses of long time-series (26-years) revealed substantial variation in the amount, characteristics and origin of marine debris (mainly macroplastics and mesoplastics, and excluding fishing gear) associated with seabirds at South Georgia, and, for two species, long-term increases in incidence since 1994. Annual debris recovery rates (items per capita) were 14 × higher in wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, and 6 × higher in grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma and giant petrels Macronectes spp., than in black-browed albatrosses T. melanophris, partly related to differences in egestion (regurgitation), which clears items from the proventriculus. Although some debris types were common in all species, wandering albatrosses and giant petrels ingested higher proportions that were food-related or generic wrapping, gloves, clear or mixed colour, and packaged in South America. This was highly likely to originate from vessels, including the large South American fishing fleets with which they overlap. Debris associated with the two smaller albatrosses was more commonly shorter, rigid (miscellaneous plastic and bottle/tube caps), and packaged in East Asia. Grey-headed albatrosses are exposed to large and increasing amounts of user plastics transported from coastal South America in the Subantarctic Current, or discarded from vessels and circulating in the South Atlantic Gyre, whereas the lower debris ingestion by black-browed albatrosses suggests that plastic pollution in Antarctic waters remains relatively low. Current plastic loads in our study species seem unlikely to have an impact at the population level, but the results nevertheless affirm that marine plastics are a major, trans-boundary animal-welfare and environmental issue that needs to be addressed by much-improved waste-management practices and compliance-monitoring both on land and on vessels in the south Atlantic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiomedea exulans 3aProcellariidae 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abottles 3acolor 3agloves 3aingestion 3amarine debris 3aplastics 3aproventriculus 3aseabirds 3atime series analysis 3awaste management 3awater pollution 3awildlife 3aAntarctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aEast Asia 3aSouth America 3aSouth Georgia and South Sandwich Islands 0aBiomonitoring 0aFisheries impacts 0aMarine debris 0aPlastics 0aPollution 0aSeabirds1 aWaluda, Claire M.0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.105443-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1054433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245012600201300001400327506007600341520009400417520152900511592002802040506003702068650001102105650001602116650001602132650002602148700002102174700002102195700002002216700002402236700001702260700001902277700002102296700002202317700002002339700002102359700001802380700002502398773011002423856007702533852000902610655001202619IND60172092720221207144753.0150602e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017209272DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2543752doi7 aPMC44240092pmcid7 a257617152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Mami10aMultiomics in Grape Berry Skin Revealed Specific Induction of the Stilbene Synthetic Pathway by Ultraviolet-C Irradiation  ap. 47-59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrape berry skin shows a specific induction of the resveratrol synthetic pathway by UV-C.  aGrape ( Vitis vinifera ) accumulates various polyphenolic compounds, which protect against environmental stresses, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light and pathogens. In this study, we looked at the transcriptome and metabolome in grape berry skin after UV-C irradiation, which demonstrated the effectiveness of omics approaches to clarify important traits of grape. We performed transcriptome analysis using a genome-wide microarray, which revealed 238 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold by UV-C light. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms showed that genes encoding stilbene synthase, a key enzyme for resveratrol synthesis, were enriched in the up-regulated genes. We performed metabolome analysis using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and 2,012 metabolite peaks, including unidentified peaks, were detected. Principal component analysis using the peaks showed that only one metabolite peak, identified as resveratrol, was highly induced by UV-C light. We updated the metabolic pathway map of grape in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and in the KaPPA-View 4 KEGG system, then projected the transcriptome and metabolome data on a metabolic pathway map. The map showed specific induction of the resveratrol synthetic pathway by UV-C light. Our results showed that multiomics is a powerful tool to elucidate the accumulation mechanisms of secondary metabolites, and updated systems, such as KEGG and KaPPA-View 4 KEGG for grape, can support such studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agrapes 3airradiation 3aresveratrol 3aultraviolet radiation1 aNakabayashi, Ryo1 aOgata, Yoshiyuki1 aSakurai, Nozomu1 aTokimatsu, Toshiaki1 aGoto, Susumu1 aSuzuki, Makoto1 aJasinski, Michal1 aMartinoia, Enrico1 aOtagaki, Shungo1 aMatsumoto, Shogo1 aSaito, Kazuki1 aShiratake, Katsuhiro0 tPlant physiology.g2015 May, v. 168, no. 1 p.47-59dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2543753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245011000162520120300272592002801475650002001503650001901523650001601542650002901558650003101587650001301618650001201631650001101643650000901654650001401663650003001677650000901707650001901716651001001735653004001745653001501785653001301800653002001813653002001833700001501853700001801868700001501886700001501901700001901916700001701935700001901952700001601971700001601987773010502003856008502108852000902193655001202202IND60679627520221120185719.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067962752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1054362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cui10aPolychlorinated naphthalenes in human milk: Health risk assessment to nursing infants and source analysis  aPolychlorinated naphthalenes are teratogenic environmental contaminants. Mother milk is the most important food for nursing infants. The World Health Organization actively promotes breastfeeding for its immunological, psychological, and economic advantages. We firstly measured concentrations of polychlorinated naphthalenes in human milk from 19 provinces in China and estimated their potential health risks to nursing infants and their possible sources. Concentrations ranged from 211.07 to 2497.43 pg/g lipid. The high prevalence of highly toxic hexachlorinated naphthalenes (Hexa-CN66/67) in human milk samples indicated a higher health risk in the sampling areas. Cancer risk posed to nursing infants was not significant, but potential non-carcinogenic adverse health effects were suggested and should be emphasized in some sampling areas. Unintentional emission of polychlorinated naphthalenes from industries that employ thermal processes appears to be the main source for PCNs in human milk in most sampling areas. Correlation analysis also suggested PCNs as impurities in polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures as a previously unrecognized source of polychlorinated naphthalenes in human milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3achlorinated naphthalenes 3ahealth effects assessments 3aindustry 3ainfants 3alipids 3amilk 3apollution 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 3ateratogenicity 3aChina 0aPolychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) 0aHuman milk 0aExposure 0aRisk assessment 0aSource analysis1 aZhang, Lei1 aLi, Jingguang1 aMin, Yihao1 aYang, Lili1 aZheng, Minghui1 aWu, Yongning1 aYang, Yuanping1 aQin, Linjun1 aLiu, Guorui0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.105436-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1054363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016500168300001800333520183100351592002802182653002602210653003102236653001802267653003102285653003102316653002002347700002402367700002302391700002202414773014202436856008502578961001202663852000902675655001202684IND60126623020221120060736.0151107e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012662302DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-93.5.14982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetty, Gail M.10aResponse of Reticulitermes spp. (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) in Northern California to Baiting with Hexaflumuron with Sentricon Termite Colony Elimination System  ap. 1498-1507.  aColonies of Reticulitermes spp. were baited with prototype and commercial Sentricon stations (Dow AgroSciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN) to test the efficacy of hexaflumuron in different concentrations and bait matrices and to document reinvasion of the foraging territories vacated by eliminated colonies. Seven colonies of Reticulitermes spp. from two sites were characterized with cuticular hydrocarbon analyses and mark-release-recapture and agonistic behavioral studies. Three colonies were observed as controls and four colonies were baited. When a connection between the bait station and the monitoring station could not be confirmed by mark-release-recapture studies, the results of the baiting were equivocal. The monitoring stations of a colony at our wildland site were devoid of termites 406 d after baiting with one Sentricon station, but became reoccupied with the same species of termites ≈≈6 mo after baiting. A colony at the residential site was baited with 0.5% hexaflumuron in the Recurit II bait matrix; 60 d later termites were absent from all monitoring stations. These monitoring stations remained unoccupied for ≥≥18 mo. Foraging Reticulitermes spp. appeared in three of the seven monitoring stations 18, 24, and 36 mo after baiting, respectively. Using cuticular hydrocarbon analyses and agonistic behavior studies, we determined that the Reticulitermes spp. occupying these monitoring stations were from three different colonies; none were members of the original colony destroyed by baiting. Another colony at the residential site was baited using a noncommercial, experimental bait; 52 d later termites were absent from all monitoring stations. The monitoring stations remained unoccupied for ≥≥9 mo. A different Reticulitermes sp. colony invaded one monitoring station 9 mo after baiting.  aPublisher supplied data 0asubterranean termites 0achitin synthesis inhibitor 0atermite baits 0atermite colony elimination 0atermite colony suppression 0atermite control1 aHaverty, Michael I.1 aCopren, Kirsten A.1 aLewis, Vernard R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2000 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.1498-1507dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-93.5.14983Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245014800164520110100312592002801413650001601441650002001457650001101477650001401488650002401502650001201526650001101538650004101549650001601590700001901606700001701625700001601642700001501658773013301673856008401806852000901890655001201899IND60783913920221121001637.0220726e20220627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078391392DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120709272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qiuju 10aRapid Identification of HSA Genetically Modified Goats by Combining Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) with Lateral Flow Dipstick (LFD)  aGenetically modified (GM) animals have attracted considerable attention and faced challenges. Human serum albumin (HSA) GM goats have been used to produce goat milk with serum albumin from humans, which has shown great potential in the market. Establishing an accurate method to distinguish goats with a genome modified by HSA has become necessary. Here, we established a platform to detect HSA GM goats by combining the advantages of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow dipstick (LFD) strategies. The whole detection process could be completed within 1 h, obtaining a direct result that could be visualized by a characteristic red band after a quick amplification under a constant temperature of 42 °C in the RPA experiments. Moreover, the GM goats could be identified with a detection limit of 0.1 ng using our method. Therefore, this study provided a rapid and convenient RPA-LFD method for the immediate detection of HSA GM goats. This will be useful for the identification of HSA GM goats, which may be used to distinguish the mixture of GM mutton and normal mutton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adetection limit 3agenome 3agoat milk 3ahuman serum albumin 3amarkets 3amutton 3arecombinase polymerase amplification 3atemperature1 aGuan, Kaifeng 1 aZhou, Xiang 1 aZhou, Yang 1 aLiu, Bang 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 June 27, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120709273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245012800205300001300333506007600346520015700422520171500579592002802294506003702322650001402359650002302373650002402396700002402420700002202444700001702466700002302483700002502506773010902531856007702640852000902717655001202726IND60172093220221207144743.0150602e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017209322DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2546642doi7 aPMC44240112pmcid7 a257868282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOehme, Daniel P.10aUnique Aspects of the Structure and Dynamics of Elementary Iβ Cellulose Microfibrils Revealed by Computational Simulations  ap. 3-17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWith a reinterpretation of experimental data, computational dynamics studies suggest elementary cellulose microfibrils contain between 18 and 24 chains.  aThe question of how many chains an elementary cellulose microfibril contains is critical to understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of cellulose biosynthesis and regulation. Given the hexagonal nature of the cellulose synthase rosette, it is assumed that the number of chains must be a multiple of six. We present molecular dynamics simulations on three different models of Iβ cellulose microfibrils, 18, 24, and 36 chains, to investigate their structure and dynamics in a hydrated environment. The 36-chain model stays in a conformational space that is very similar to the initial crystalline phase, while the 18- and 24-chain models sample a conformational space different from the crystalline structure yet similar to conformations observed in recent high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Major differences in the conformations sampled between the different models result from changes to the tilt of chains in different layers, specifically a second stage of tilt, increased rotation about the O2-C2 dihedral, and a greater sampling of non-TG exocyclic conformations, particularly the GG conformation in center layers and GT conformation in solvent-exposed exocyclic groups. With a reinterpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance data, specifically for contributions made to the C6 peak, data from the simulations suggest that the 18- and 24-chain structures are more viable models for an elementary cellulose microfibril, which also correlates with recent scattering and diffraction experimental data. These data inform biochemical and molecular studies that must explain how a six-particle cellulose synthase complex rosette synthesizes microfibrils likely comprised of either 18 or 24 chains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3acomputer simulation1 aDownton, Matthew T.1 aDoblin, Monika S.1 aWagner, John1 aGidley, Michael J.1 aBacic, A.q(Antony),0 tPlant physiology.g2015 May, v. 168, no. 1 p.3-17dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2546643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011800169300001800287520159100305592002801896653003001924653001701954653001501971653001601986653001402002700002002016700002302036773014202059856008502201852000902286655001202295IND60126623120221120082343.0151107e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012662312DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-93.5.15082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jian-Zhou10aInheritance and Synergism of Resistance to Imidacloprid in the Colorado Potato Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 1508-1514.  aColorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), adults and larvae collected from Long Island, NY, were 100.8 and 13.2 times more resistant to imidacloprid, respectively, compared with a susceptible strain. This high level of resistance appeared in only the third field season of imidacloprid use. Analysis of probit lines from F₁ reciprocal crosses indicated that resistance to imidacloprid in adults was inherited autosomaly as an incompletely recessive factor. The degree of dominance of the resistance was −−0.23 and −−0.10, respectively, 3 and 7 d after treatment (incompletely recessive). The χχ² analysis of response ratio statistics from F₁ ×× susceptible back crosses compared with a monogenic model suggested that more than one locus is responsible for resistance to imidacloprid. Synergism studies with piperonyl butoxide suggested that mixed-function oxidase mediated detoxification is responsible for the resistance to imidacloprid in adults. Synergism studies with S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) indicated that esterase mediated detoxification may be an additional resistance factor. Mixed-function oxidase mediated detoxification is probably also one of the mechanisms of resistance to imidacloprid in larvae. Because the synergists used did not completely eliminate resistance in the resistant strain, there may be additional mechanisms involved. Refugia and crop rotation decrease the frequency of homozygous resistant genotypes and may be effective resistance management strategies, because of the recessive nature of the resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 0aimidacloprid 0aresistance 0ainheritance 0asynergism1 aBishop, Beth A.1 aGrafius, Edward J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2000 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.1508-1514dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-93.5.15083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245005900197300001600256500001100272520111300283592002801396650001601424650001101440650001401451650001701465650001301482650001101495650001701506773013001523856007401653852000901727655001201736IND60788540920221119030911.0220815e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078854092DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.106342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLord, Linda M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5216-792410aFluid Needs in the Older Adult Receiving Tube Feedings  ap. 360-368.  aREVIEW  aFluid imbalance can occur quickly in older adults and in others who cannot express thirst or are in a setting where fluid status is not closely monitored. In tube‐fed individuals receiving inadequate calories, severe malnutrition may occur in weeks to months, but improper water intake may lead to critical fluid imbalances in a matter of days. Simplistic equations frequently used to determine fluid needs in adults include milliliters per kilogram of body weight and milliliters per energy (kilocalories) consumed or per energy (kilocalories) need and variations of the Holliday‐Segar formula. None of these fluid‐requirement equations have been validated through evidenced‐based science, and research investigations have revealed that they can grossly overestimate or underestimate fluid needs in the older adult. Clinicians need guidance to better estimate initial fluid needs for the older adult receiving tube feedings and to provide proper close monitoring afterward to avert preventable fluid imbalance–related hospital readmissions, morbidities, and mortalities in this patient population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3aenergy 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3apatients 3athirst 3atube feeding0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2021 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.360-368dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.106343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245013600212300001600348506007600364520015400440520128200594592002801876506003701904650002401941650000901965650001601974650002201990700003302012700002202045700002302067700002102090700001902111700003502130773011202165856007702277852000902354655001202363IND60172093520221207144744.0150602e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017209352DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2546722doi7 aPMC44240122pmcid7 a258187012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejada-Jiménez, Manuel10aMedicago truncatula Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein1 Is Required for Iron Uptake by Rhizobia-Infected Nodule Cells  ap. 258-272.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn Nramp-type transporter provides the cytosolic iron that is transferred to bacteroids for synthesis of ferroproteins involved in nitrogen fixation.  aIron is critical for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) as a key component of multiple ferroproteins involved in this biological process. In the model legume Medicago truncatula , iron is delivered by the vasculature to the infection/maturation zone (zone II) of the nodule, where it is released to the apoplast. From there, plasma membrane iron transporters move it into rhizobia-containing cells, where iron is used as the cofactor of multiple plant and rhizobial proteins (e.g. plant leghemoglobin and bacterial nitrogenase). MtNramp1 ( Medtr3g088460 ) is the M. truncatula Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein family member, with the highest expression levels in roots and nodules. Immunolocalization studies indicate that MtNramp1 is mainly targeted to the plasma membrane. A loss-of-function nramp1 mutant exhibited reduced growth compared with the wild type under symbiotic conditions, but not when fertilized with mineral nitrogen. Nitrogenase activity was low in the mutant, whereas exogenous iron and expression of wild-type MtNramp1 in mutant nodules increased nitrogen fixation to normal levels. These data are consistent with a model in which MtNramp1 is the main transporter responsible for apoplastic iron uptake by rhizobia-infected cells in zone II.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMedicago truncatula 3airon 3amacrophages 3anitrogen fixation1 aCastro-Rodréíguez, Rosario1 aKryvoruchko, Igor1 aLucas, M.

Ser.)—A Transcriptome Assembly and a High-Density Genetic Linkage Map  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla) is an important ornamental crop that has been cultivated for more than 300 years. Despite the economic importance, genetic studies for hydrangea have been limited by the lack of genetic resources. Genetic linkage maps and subsequent trait mapping are essential tools to identify and make markers available for marker-assisted breeding. A transcriptomic study was performed on two important cultivars, Veitchii and Endless Summer, to discover simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and an F₁ population based on the cross ‘Veitchii’ × ‘Endless Summer’ was established for genetic linkage map construction. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was performed on the mapping population along with SSR genotyping. From an analysis of 42,682 putative transcripts, 8780 SSRs were identified and 1535 were validated in the mapping parents. A total of 267 polymorphic SSRs were selected for linkage map construction. The GBS yielded 3923 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mapping population, resulting in a total of 4190 markers that were used to generate maps for each parent and a consensus map. The consensus linkage map contained 1767 positioned markers (146 SSRs and 1621 SNPs), spanned 1383.4 centiMorgans (cM), and was comprised of 18 linkage groups, with an average mapping interval of 0.8 cM. The transcriptome information and large-scale marker development in this study greatly expanded the genetic resources that are available for hydrangea. The high-density genetic linkage maps presented here will serve as an important foundation for quantitative trait loci mapping, map-based gene cloning, and marker-assisted selection of H. macrophylla.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrangea macrophylla 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3agenomics 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aresource management 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aHulse-Kemp, Amanda  M.1 aWadl, Phillip  A.1 aSmith, Zach 1 aMockaitis, Keithanne 1 aStaton, Margaret  E.1 aRinehart, Timothy  A.1 aAlexander, Lisa  W.0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 7, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae70200253Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009400164300001400258520147800272592002801750650001101778650001701789650001901806650002301825650001601848650002501864650002101889650001501910650001101925650002201936650001801958650002101976650002001997650001602017650001502033653002902048653002102077653001102098653003402109653002202143700001502165700001702180700001902197700001602216773011102232856008302343852000902426655001202435IND60526284320221120092904.0190403e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Ai-Di10aSimulation modeling for water governance in basins based on surface water and groundwater  ap. 22-29.  aAccelerating future water shortages in the world require a development of operational water governance models as illustrated by the case studies. Conversion process and its coupling simulation of surface water and groundwater are the foundation of water resources development, utilization, and scientific evaluation. In order to simulate the impact of climate change on the water cycle in basins, the quasi-distributed watershed Surface Water (SW) model was coupled with the fully-distributed Ground Water (GW) model in the simulation. The Hydrologic Response Units (HRU) in the SW model were exchanged with cells in the GW model. By using the HRU–CELL conversion interface, the distributed groundwater recharge rate (RCH) and the groundwater evapotranspiration (EVT) calculated by the SW model were imported into the RCH and EVT modules of the GW model. The application of groundwater simulation in the Heihe River basin demonstrated that the correlation coefficient between the simulation results and the measured values was 0.89, the deterministic coefficient of the simulation results was 0.86. Under future predictions the discharge from the Heihe River will decrease in the first 20 years (2020–2039). In the later 20 years (2040–2059) the discharge will increase. The simulation groundwater along with the recharge value showed the same change trend of the measured groundwater level. The coupled SW–GW model was capable of predicting the future water cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic cycle 3aprediction 3arivers 3asimulation models 3asurface water 3awater management 3awater shortages 3awater table 3awatersheds 0aWater resources modeling 0aWater governance 0aBasins 0aSurface water and groundwater 0aHeihe River basin1 aDang, Jian1 aSong, Jin-Xi1 aChen, Xun Hong1 aMao, Hai-Ru0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Aug., v. 174 p.22-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245014000177300001800317520177200335592002802107650001302135650002402148650001302172650001002185650001602195650001502211650002302226650003302249650002402282700002802306700002002334700001702354700001402371773010802385856008802493990002302581852000902604655001202613IND60096175920221119093148.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009617592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasario-Junior, O.10aEffect of aerobic conditioning on ventricular activation: A principal components analysis approach to high-resolution electrocardiogram  ap. 1920-1926.  aBACKGROUND: The athlete's heart represents a reversible structural and functional adaptations of myocardial tissue developed through physical conditioning. Surface electrocardiogram (ECG) has the capability to detect myocardial hypertrophy but has limited performance in monitoring physical conditioning-induced myocardial remodeling. The aim of this study was to develop an ECG-derived test for detecting incipient myocardial hypertrophy in well-conditioned athletes based on a principal components (PC) analysis. METHODS: Two groups of study composed of 14 sedentary healthy volunteers (Control group) and 14 professional long distance runners (Athlete group) had their maximal metabolic equivalents (MET) estimated (mean±SD: Control group: 9±2 METs vs. Athlete group: 20±1 METs, p<0.05). All participants had their high-resolution ECG (HRECG) recorded, and a 120ms segment starting at the QRS complex onset and ending in the ST segment was extracted to build a data matrix for PC analysis. The Mahalanobis distance was evaluated by a logistic regression model to determine the optimal separation threshold between groups. HRECG was also analyzed using the classical time domain approach. The comparison of areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c-statistic) in 10,000 bootstrap re-samplings measured how well each method detected physical conditioning (α<0.05). RESULTS: Average bootstrap c-statistic for PC analysis and time domain approaches were 0.98 and 0.79 (p<0.05), respectively. PC analysis and maximal oxygen consumption exhibited comparable performances to distinguish between groups. DISCUSSION: The PC analysis method applied to HRECG signals appropriately discriminates well-conditioned athletes from healthy, sedentary subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3aelectrocardiography 3aexercise 3aheart 3ahypertrophy 3amonitoring 3aoxygen consumption 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis1 aBenchimol-Barbosa, P.R.1 aTrevizani, G.A.1 aMarocolo, M.1 aNadal, J.0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1920-1926dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011700172300001200289520142000301592002801721650001201749650002501761650002601786650001601812650001901828650001601847650002601863650000901889650001501898650001901913650002401932650001601956651001001972653001201982653002001994653001702014653001402031653002302045653002002068700002202088700002102110700002502131700002002156700002602176700006002202700002202262700001802284700005502302700002202357700001602379773010302395856008702498852000902585655001202594IND60597555220221118125005.0200210e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059755522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunda, Sushmita10aDynamics of soil organic carbon mineralization and C fractions in paddy soil on application of rice husk biochar  ap. 1-9.  aBiochar plays a pivotal role in carbon storage-fractionation-mineralization process in soil. However, uncertainty still remains about the influence of biochar on these inter-related processes that links to C cycling in soil. A three years field experiment was initiated in 2013 at ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, India, to study the deviation in C mineralization and C fractions caused by the application of six doses of rice husk derived biochar (RHB), ranging from 0.5 t ha⁻¹ to 10.0 t ha⁻¹. The results showed an increase in cumulative CO₂-C emission with increasing RHB rates. However, the model-fitted mineralization rates (dC/dt) did not show significant difference between treated and control soils at the end of incubation period in a laboratory study. In addition, microbial quotient and % C from RHB utilized showed a decreasing trend with increasing rates of RHB application, establishing the carbon sequestration potential of RHB. The highest rate (10.0 t ha⁻¹) of RHB application accumulated maximum total organic C (3.26%) and a larger share of non-labile C (63.8%) among the treatments. An increase in rice grain yield (1–24%, depending on rate of RHB application) was observed with increasing rates of RHB which further established that RHB application not only enhanced C storage but also enhanced the productivity of rice by enhancing the soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3amineralization 3apaddy soils 3aresearch institutions 3arice 3arice hulls 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3auncertainty 3aIndia 0aBiochar 0aMineralizable C 0aSoil C pools 0aRice soil 0aLabile C fractions 0aC sequestration1 aBhaduri, Debarati1 aMohanty, Sangita1 aChatterjee, Dibyendu1 aTripathi, Rahul1 aMoshtaghzadeh, Majid,1 aUpēndra Kumār,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9246-39201 aBhattacharyya, P.1 aKumar, Anjani1 aAdak, Totan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5971-10081 aJangde, Hemant K.1 aNayak, A.K.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Aug., v. 115 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014300166500001900309520152000328592002801848650002001876650002401896650001401920650002001934650001801954650002101972650001801993650001602011650001302027650001302040650001302053651001002066700001902076700002002095700001702115700001502132773012602147856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60729298320221117223207.0210228e20210206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072929832DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae70200262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yaping 10aFruit Morphology Measurements of Jujube Cultivar ‘Lingwu Changzao’ (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. cv.

Lingwuchangzao), a cultivar of Ziziphus in the Rhamnaceae family, is a traditional jujube cultivar in Ningxia, China. For ‘Lingwu Changzao’, morphological traits are prominent in characterizing fruit yield, quality, and consumer acceptance. However, morphological measurements for ‘Lingwu Changzao’ cultivation are limited. Therefore, the objective of this study is to measure the growing patterns of selected morphological traits during ‘Lingwu Changzao’ fruit development. Eight morphological traits, including four fruit traits (fruit length, diameter, weight, and flesh (mesocarp) thickness), three stone traits (stone length, diameter, and weight), and fruit firmness (also known as fruit hardness), were measured over a 3-mo (months) period, covering a completed fruit development period. Results indicate that the growing patterns of fruit traits coincide with double ‘S’ growth curves, which mainly present the growth of ‘Lingwu Changzao’ fruit. Increases of stone traits terminated in the early fruit growth period, while fruit traits continuously increased till the end of the 3-mo period. That implies a high fruit-stone ratio, i.e., a desirable quality attribute for ‘Lingwu Changzao’ as fresh-eating fruits. The results presented in this study can serve as one part of the standard dataset for jujube fruit cultivation in China, and it can also support decisions in plant breeding and field managements for ‘Lingwu Changzao’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aconsumer acceptance 3acultivars 3adata collection 3afruit growing 3afruit morphology 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3afruiting 3ahardness 3amesocarp 3aChina1 aZhang, Dapeng 1 aWang, Zhuangji 1 aSong, Lihua 1 aCao, Bing 0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Feb. 06, v. 7, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae70200263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013200166300001400298500001500312520145600327592002801783650002201811650002101833650001701854650002301871650001001894650001201904650002101916650001501937650000901952650001601961650004101977650002102018650001202039650002202051651001002073653002102083653001502104653001802119653002202137653001602159653001802175700001702193700001802210700002002228700001702248773011102265856008302376852000902459655001202468IND60526284520221120092922.0190403e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052628452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Junfeng10aInfluence of water management on the water cycle in a small watershed irrigation system based on a distributed hydrologic model  ap. 52-60.  a2019-12-06  aBased on the hydrological characteristics of a rice-based irrigation system in Southern China, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was modified in order to develop the Rice Irrigation System-Soil and Water Assessment Tool (RIS-SWAT). The irrigation water movement, water balance module, and rice yield calculations of the paddy field were improved within the SWAT model. In addition, the seepage of the irrigation canal and the pond’s effect on the irrigation modules were added to the RIS-SWAT. The impact of water management on the water cycle of the small watershed irrigation system (SWIS) was evaluated by conducting a scenario analysis with RIS-SWAT. The results indicated that an increase in the maximum water ponding depth of a paddy field could decrease irrigation water and rainfall loss. The canal water supply was reduced by 20%, resulting in an increase in irrigation water productivity without a reduction in the rice yield. The temporal and spatial distributions of the irrigation water in different subbasins did not significantly affect the water cycle within the SWIS. Furthermore, when the canal water supply was reduced by 20–40% and the pond water supply was increased, the rice yield was not affected. Thus, the water productivity of irrigation systems could be improved through the implementation of water management policies and practices that reduce field outflows and reuse the return flows captured by ponds.  aPublisher supplied data 3airrigation canals 3airrigation water 3awater supply 3airrigation systems 3aponds 3aseepage 3awater management 3awatersheds 3arain 3agrain yield 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3ahydrologic cycle 3apaddies 3aissues and policy 3aChina 0aWater management 0aSWAT model 0aWater balance 0aIrrigation system 0aPaddy field 0awater balance1 aCui, Yuanlai1 aCai, Xueliang1 aBrown, Larry C.1 aShang, Yuhui0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Aug., v. 174 p.52-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245012900165500001900294520117000313592002801483650001601511650001801527650001701545650001401562650002301576650001301599650001701612650001801629650001401647650001901661650001901680700002501699700002501724700001901749700002401768700002601792700003601818700002301854773011901877856007701996852000902073655001202082IND60735104120221122110706.0210423e20210414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073510412DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100408522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonifacie, Aline 10aNew Insights into the Chemical Reactivity of Dry-Cured Fermented Sausages: Focus on Nitrosation, Nitrosylation and Oxidation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitrite and nitrate are added to cured meat for their bacteriological, technological and sensorial properties. However, they are suspected to be involved in the formation of nitroso compounds (NOCs), such as potentially mutagenic nitrosamines, nitrosylheme and nitrosothiols. Controlling the sanitary and sensorial qualities of cured meat products by reducing these additives requires elucidating the mechanisms involved in the formation of NOCs. To this end, we studied the dose-response relationship of added sodium nitrite and/or sodium nitrate (0/0, 80/80, 0/200, and 120/120 ppm) on the formation of NOCs in dry cured fermented sausages. The results showed a basal heme iron nitrosylation in the absence of NaNO₂/NaNO₃ due to starter cultures. This reaction was promoted by the addition of NaNO₂/NaNO₃ in the other conditions. Reducing the dose to 80/80 ppm still limits lipid oxidation without the formation of non-volatile nitrosamines. Conversely, the addition of NO₂/NO₃ slightly increases protein oxidation through higher carbonyl content. The use of 80/80 ppm could be a means of reducing these additives in dry-cured fermented meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acured meats 3adose response 3afermentation 3aheme iron 3alipid peroxidation 3amutagens 3anitrosamines 3anitrosylation 3aoxidation 3asodium nitrate 3asodium nitrite1 aGatellier, Philippe 1 aPromeyrat, Aurélie 1 aNassy, Gilles 1 aPicgirard, Laurent 1 aScislowski, Valérie 1 aSanté-Lhoutellier, Véronique 1 aThéron, Laetitia 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 14, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100408523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009400170300001600264520175900280592002802039650002002067650001102087650001502098650000902113650002202122650001502144650001202159650001602171650001402187700001402201773009702215856008602312852000902398655001202407IND60096677220221120203306.0141104e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009667722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChampagne, C.10aPerformance analysis of a miniature free piston expander for waste heat energy harvesting  ap. 883-892.  aInitial experimental analysis of a small-scale Free Piston Expander (FPE) is presented. In final form, the FPE will be a MEMS-based device capable of operation from low temperature waste heat sources. Currently, a millimeter scale device is constructed and tested to yield insight into critical operational parameters for use in later design and testing. Operating conditions are examined to increase operational performance. Piston stroke length and repeatability are considered. Optimized variables include piston length and mass, FPE shape and size, input pressure, and lubrication. Construction of this testbed device is via concentric copper tubing, allowing an effective baseline study of these determining parameters. Results show that, while thick lubricants seal well in static configurations, piston motion is decreased in dynamic testing, indicating leakage. By contrast, reduced viscosity lubricants prove ineffective as sealing agents during static conditions, however, yield increased piston motion in dynamic testing with little leakage around critical piston sealing surfaces. The trends established by the study of varying viscosity lubricants hold true for pistons of increasing mass and length as well. A mixture of isopropanol and water performed well in these tests, and represented a low viscosity sealing fluid, which was used in later repeatability tests. Repeatability tests were performed in a closed dynamic environment on FPE designs with multiple cross sectional shapes and areas. Results from these tests show that circular FPE’s are more precise than square FPE’s. The final closed system tests yield a pressure–volume curve indicative of an engine cycle as a first look at thermodynamic cycle operation from the FPE.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic testing 3aenergy 3aharvesting 3aheat 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alubricants 3apistons 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aWeiss, L.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Dec., v. 76 p.883-892dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007100174300001400245520084500259592002801104650001201132650001801144650001601162650003401178650002201212651001801234653001101252653001201263653001501275653001301290653001501303653001301318700002501331773009101356856008401447852000901531655001201540IND50087058520221118011235.0150325e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008705852DNAL7 a10.1080/0269249X.2012.7352052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStepanek, Joshua G.10aSeveral new species of Amphora and Halamphora from the western USA  ap. 61-76.  aAmphora Ehrenberg ex Kützing sensu lato incorporates a large and diverse group of diatoms.

Life-saving interventions (LSIs) were chosen as an endpoint because performance of LSIs is a critical aspect of trauma patient care. Noise was modeled and simulated by modifying original R–R interval (RRI) sequences via decimation, concatenation, and division of RRIs, as well as R-wave detection using the electrocardiogram.

These kinds of supply chain networks include a direct and reverse supply chain. In this paper, a multi-objective closed-loop supply chain network consisting of multi-level, multi-period, and multi-products is proposed under the set of parameter uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model. The model assumes a shortage and a remaining inventory at the end of each period. The first objective function is to minimize the total costs of the network. The second one is to maximize the on-time delivery of the products purchased from suppliers to factories. The third objective is to maximize the quality according to the quality of the products produced in the forward supply chain and those that can be recovered in the reverse supply chain. Another point worth noting in this manuscript is selecting the best supplier. Because choosing the best supplier is one of the most critical decisions that purchasing managers have to make in a supply chain. It is based on different criteria, such as price, quality, customer service, and delivery, discussed in this article. Uncertainty is also considered in the model, and a scenario-based robust optimization approach is used to cope with it. Due to the problem’s multi-objective nature, four exact methods, namely LP-metric, sequential linear goal programming (SLGP), TH approach, and simple additive weighting are used to solve the objective functions. Finally, the most effective method for solving various numerical examples is selected as the best method by the least deviations compared to the other methods; in this paper, the SLGP method is chosen. To illustrate the response to a problem in more detail, some of the SLGP method outputs are presented. The results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Thus, it can be used in a variety of industries whose products are recycled and where the quality of products and the choice of appropriate suppliers are of great importance.  aPublisher supplied data  a93042256cIran National Science Foundation 3acustomer service 3aenvironment 3ainventories 3amodels 3aparameter uncertainty 3aprices 3asupply chain 3asupply chain management1 aBahrami, Farzad1 aShishebori, Davood1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7737-65651 aArdakani, Majid Alimohammadi0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.10768-10802dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01883-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011100169500001900280520169400299592002801993650002602021650002002047650001702067650001602084651001002100653002002110653002502130653003302155653002502188653003002213700001702243700001502260700001502275700001702290700001902307700001802326700001702344773010802361856008802469852000902557655001202566IND60730113220221119110459.0210506e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073011322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1034602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenhuo10aTemperature signals complicate tree-ring precipitation reconstructions on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTree-ring width chronologies are a critically important material to reconstruct past precipitation variability on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NTP). However, temperature signals are often encoded in these chronologies, which complicate the precipitation reconstructions and should be carefully assessed. Here, a dataset of 487 Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom.) tree-ring width series from 16 sites on the NTP were collected to investigate the influence of different temperature signals on the precipitation reconstructions. Correlation analysis showed that all tree-ring series recorded similar precipitation information, but had positive (p ≤ 0.05, Group1), weak (p > 0.05, Group2), and negative (p ≤ 0.05, Group3) correlations with temperature, respectively. In view of this, all tree-ring series were divided into three groups to develop chronologies to reconstruct local precipitation. During the calibration period of 1957–2011 CE, the Group1 reconstruction had the fastest uptrend, which almost overlapped the observed precipitation; the Group2 reconstruction showed a slower uptrend, whereas the Group3 reconstruction lacked an uptrend. As a result, we get different results when the reconstructions were used to assess the current precipitation status over the past millennium. The Group1 (Group2) reconstructions showed that the recent 20 (10) years were the highest precipitation period over the past millennium, whereas the Group3 reconstruction did not capture this phenomenon. Therefore, we caution that the temperature effects should be evaluated carefully before tree-ring width chronologies being employed to study past precipitation variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus przewalskii 3adata collection 3agrowth rings 3atemperature 3aChina 0aTree-ring width 0aTempertature signals 0aPrecipitation reconstruction 0aLow-frequency trends 0aClimate signal separation1 aGou, Xiaohua1 aLi, Jinbao1 aHuo, Yuxia1 aYang, Meixue1 aZhang, Junzhou1 aZhang, Weiguo1 aYin, Dingcai0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2021 May, v. 200 p.103460-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1034603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010000169300001400269520137800283592002801661650000801689650001301697650002601710650001201736650001801748650001101766650001101777650002501788650001901813700001401832700002501846773008701871856008601958990002302044852000902067655001202076IND60092024520221120072152.0141103e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009202452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinho, N.10aEvaluation of errors on the CFD computation of air flow and heat transfer around the human body  ap. 58-69.  aA detailed computer aided design model representing a female human body was created from a 3-D scan of a full scale thermal manikin.

The use of: a mixed turbulence model between k–ɛ, for zones away from solid surfaces, and k−ω, for zones close to solid surfaces; values of the dimensionless y⁺ parameter inferior to 5 jointly with a low-Reynolds method to model the flow in the near-wall region of the human surface and inlet non-uniform boundary profiles for temperature, velocity and turbulence intensity, leaded to good agreement with experimental results, with a global mean relative error of the order of 7%, with a standard deviation of 4%, in terms of convective and radiative heat flux between the human body and the thermal environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3acomputer-aided design 3afemales 3aheat transfer 3ahumans 3amodels 3atemperature profiles 3aturbulent flow1 aLopes, A.1 aGameiro da Silva, M.0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 Dec., v. 58 p.58-69dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.06.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008800170300001600258520180500274592002802079650002002107650004302127650001202170650001402182650001902196650002202215650001102237650002302248650001502271650001502286650001402301650001102315650001002326651001802336653001702354653001902371653001702390700002202407700001802429773012102447856008302568961001302651852000902664655001202673IND60561473320221122040738.0190412e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056147332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2017.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobins, Joseph G.10aEffects of Selection for Seedling Vigor on the Genetic Variation in Leymus cinereus  ap. 504-508.  aBasin wildrye (Leymus cinereus [Scribn. & Merr. Á. Löve]) is a perennial grass native to western regions of North America. Despite its importance for rangelands, stand establishment of basin wildrye is difficult due to its poor seedling vigor. We undertook to increase the seedling vigor of the basin wildrye cultivar “Trailhead” by using selection for emergence from deep seeding depth. We carried out two cycles of selection in two select populations and included two random populations, in which no direct selection occurred. We characterized the indirection effect of the selection on biomass, seed production, and stand percentage in these populations under field conditions. We used amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers to identify regions of the genome associated with the selection by identifying allele frequency changes between the base population and the select and random populations. The second cycle select population and the first cycle random population possessed the highest total emergence from deep seeding (60% and 59%, respectively) compared with the base population (26%). The field evaluations showed no differences in genetic variation among the base, select, and random populations for biomass, seed production, and stand percentage. On the basis of the analysis of the AFLP markers, diversity increased slightly among the random populations and decreased slightly among the select populations. In the select populations, band frequencies increased for aggcac403, actcag185, and aggcac208. The band frequencies of aggctg212 and actctc66 decreased in both random and selected cycles. The results indicate that targeted selection for trait improvement in this native grass can be successfully completed with minimal effect on population genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeymus cinereus 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abiomass 3acultivars 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aindigenous species 3aperennials 3arangelands 3aseedlings 3asowing 3avigor 3aNorth America 0agenetic gain 0aplant breeding 0arevegetation1 aBushman, B.

Moreover, climate impacts over eastern Amazonia have been strongly related to pasture and soybean expansion. This study carries out a remote-sensing, spatial-temporal approach to analyze inter- and intra-annual patterns in evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (PPT) over pasture and soybean areas in the Xingu River Basin during a 13-year period. We used ET estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and PPT estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite. Our results showed that the annual average ET in the pasture was ~20% lower than the annual average in soybean areas. We show that PPT is notably higher in the northern part of the Xingu River Basin than the drier southern part. ET, on the other hand, appears to be strongly linked to land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns in the Xingu River Basin. Lower annual ET averages occur in southern areas where dominant LULC is savanna, pasture, and soybean, while more intense ET is observed over primary forests (northern portion of the basin). The primary finding of our study is related to the fact that the seasonality patterns of ET can be strongly linked to LULC in the Xingu River Basin. Further studies should focus on the relationship between ET, gross primary productivity, and water-use efficiency in order to better understand the coupling between water and carbon cycling over this expanding Amazonian agricultural frontier.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aevapotranspiration 3agross primary productivity 3aland use and land cover maps 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apastures 3aprimary forests 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asavannas 3asoybeans 3awater use efficiency 3awatersheds 3aAmazonia1 aChen, Jing  M.1 aMataveli, Guilherme  A.

Multiple trophic pathways stabilize food webs by providing complementary diet resources for consumers but the consequences of urbanization on estuarine food webs are relatively unknown. In estuarine creeks across an urban-to-suburban gradient, we demonstrate trophic decoupling of benthic and pelagic pathways, trophic niche contraction, and increasing human health risk arising with the same factors that are associated with ecological degradation. This suggests an urban estuarine paradox—human activities often create larger volumes of deep water habitat, yet human activities also render much of this area unproductive with measurable opportunity costs to food webs. Our findings emphasize the shared consequences of environmental degradation for the ecological integrity of urban estuaries and the health of urban communities that rely on estuaries for sustenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aestuaries 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3arisk 3aurbanization1 aHarris, Lora1 aReilly, Erin1 aFireman, Alexandra1 aSchott, Eric1 aHeyes, Andrew0 tAmbio.g2022 Apr., v. 51, no. 4 p.888-900dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01610-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011500184300001800299520209400317592002802411650002102439650000902460650001602469650001602485650001002501650001002511650001002521650001502531650001602546650002302562650001102585653001002596653001602606653002602622653002002648700001202668700001902680700001802699700001602717700002302733773011402756856008202870852000902952655001202961IND60530131020221119141054.0190804e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053013102DNAL7 a269154022pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311160001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, X.12aA kinetic study of the natural induction of liver steatosis in Greylag Landaise geese: the role of hyperphagia  ap. 1288-1295.  aWe have previously demonstrated that a sharp rise in feed intake (hyperphagia) and spontaneous liver steatosis could be experimentally induced in domestic Greylag geese by combining a short photoperiod and a sequence of feed restriction followed by ad libitum corn feeding during the fall and the winter. In this previous work, however, individual feed intake could not be recorded. The present study aimed at evaluating the relationship between level and pattern of hyperphagia and liver weight with an individual control of feed intake in individually housed (IH) geese, while comparing the performances with group housed (GH) geese. A total of 300 male geese of 19 weeks of age, were provided with corn ad libitum after an initial feed restriction period. From 21 to 23 weeks of age, the daylight duration was progressively reduced from 10 to 7 h and kept as such until the end of the experiment (week 36). In all, 30 GH and 30 IH geese were slaughtered at 19, 27, 30, 32 and 36 weeks of age. Feed intake was measured per group in GH geese and individually in IH geese. During the 1ˢᵗ week of corn feeding, the average feed intake rose up to 600 g/goose per day in GH geese but not in IH geese where the feed intake rose gradually from 300 to 400 g/day. The liver weight increased from 93 g (week 19) to 497 g (week 32; P<0.05) in GH birds. In IH birds, liver weights were, on average, much lower (ranging from 220 to 268 g) than in GH birds (P<0.05). In GH and IH bird, the variability in the individual response to corn feeding was very high (liver weight cᵥ ranging from 63% to 83% depending on slaughter age). A close correlation between corn consumption and liver weight was evidenced in IH birds at each slaughter age (R ² ranging from 0.62 to 0.79), except at 36 weeks of age where this correlation was weak (R ²=0.14). The variability in the extent of liver steatosis is very high and our results in IH birds clearly point out the major role of hyperphagia, mainly at the beginning of the ad libitum corn feeding period, on the development of spontaneous liver steatosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage at slaughter 3acorn 3afatty liver 3afeed intake 3ageese 3aliver 3amales 3aovereating 3aphotoperiod 3arestricted feeding 3awinter 0ageese 0ahyperphagia 0aspontaneous fattening 0aliver steatosis1 aGuy, G.1 aLaverze, J.

We hypothesised that variations in the amount of particulate organic matter (POM) can explain the C accumulation and also affects the C bound to mineral surfaces in soil under various vegetation. METHODS: Soil samples were collected under three vegetation types of a 45-year-old experiment focused on initial soil development. Aggregate and density fractionations were combined to analyse C accumulation in large and small macro- and microaggregates as well as in free and occluded POM and mineral factions. RESULTS: Deciduous forest soil accumulated the highest C content in the 0–5 cm layer (43 g C kg⁻¹), whereas values in coniferous forest and arable soils were lower (30 and 12 g C kg⁻¹, respectively). The highest portion of C in arable soil was accumulated in the mineral fraction (80 %), whereas 50–60 % of the C in forest soils were in POM. More C was associated with minerals in deciduous forest soil (16 g C kg⁻¹soil) than under coniferous forest and arable land (8–10 g C kg⁻¹soil). CONCLUSIONS: Particulate organic matter explains most of the differences in organic C accumulation in soils developed during 45 years under the three vegetation types on identical parent material. The C content of the mineral soil fraction was controlled by plant cover and contributed the most to differences in C accumulation in soils developed under similar vegetation type (forest).  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3acarbon 3aconiferous forests 3acropland 3adeciduous forests 3aforest soils 3aloess 3amicroaggregates 3amineral content 3amineral soils 3aminerals 3aorganic matter 3aplant communities 3asoil sampling1 aRyzhova, Irina1 aDorodnikov, Maxim1 aKuzyakov, Yakov0 tPlant and soil.g2015 Feb., v. 387, no. 1-2 p.265-275dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2299-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011600173300001800289520171500307592002802022650001702050650001102067650002202078650002002100650001202120650001102132650000902143650001102152650001702163650002402180650002102204650001402225700002202239700001902261700001902280700001902299700005902318773011802377856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60624607220221119063854.0181204e20181106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062460722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorentini, Filippo14aThe Extreme Structural Plasticity in the CYP153 Subfamily of P450s Directs Development of Designer Hydroxylases  ap. 6701-6714.  aCYP153s are bacterial class I P450 enzymes traditionally described as alkane hydroxylases with a high terminal regioselectivity. They have been more recently shown to also catalyze hydroxylations at nonactivated carbon atoms of small heterocycles. The aim of our work was to perform an extensive characterization of this subfamily in order to deliver a toolbox of CYP153 enzymes for further development as biocatalysts. Through the screening of recently sequenced bacterial genomes, 20 CYP153s were selected, comprising 17 single monooxygenase domains and three multidomain variants, where the monooxygenase domain is naturally fused to its redox partners in a single polypeptide chain. The 20 novel variants were heterologously expressed, and their activity was screened toward octane and small heterocycles. A more extended substrate characterization was then performed on three representative candidates, and their crystal structures were unveiled and compared with those of the known CYP153A7 and CYP153A33. The tested enzymes displayed a wide range of activities, ranging from Ω and Ω-1 hydroxylations of lauric acid to indigo-generating indole modification. The comparative analysis highlighted a conserved architecture and amino acid composition of the catalytic core close to the heme, while showing a huge degree of structural plasticity and flexibility in those regions hosting the substrate recognition sites. Although dealing with this type of conformational variability adds a layer of complexity and difficulty to structure-based protein engineering, such diversity in substrate acceptance and recognition promotes the investigated CYP153s as a prime choice for tailoring designer hydroxylases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3acarbon 3acrystal structure 3adodecanoic acid 3aenzymes 3agenome 3aheme 3aoctane 3apolypeptides 3aprotein engineering 3aregioselectivity 3ascreening1 aHatzl, Anna-Maria1 aSchmidt, Sandy1 aSavino, Simone1 aGlieder, Anton1 aMattevi, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9523-71280 tBiochemistry.g2018 Nov. 06, v. 57, no. 48 p.6701-6714dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b010523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245014700176520127700323592002801600653002301628653002001651653001701671653001601688700002901704773009801733856008401831852000901915655001201924IND60682474220221121031655.0200320e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068247422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e002922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatouke, Moise Matouke10aAssessment of heavy metals contamination and human health risk in Clarias gariepinus [Burchell, 1822] collected from Jabi Lake, Abuja, Nigeria  aDischarge of pollutants in the ecosystem is a great concern for freshwater bodies because of the health risk that can befall those who depend on fisheries products for survival. Five metals (Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Cd) in forty (40) frequently consumed fish (Clarias gariepinus) collected from Jabi Lake, Abuja, Nigeria were measured using Atomic Absorption spectrometry (AAS). Non carcinogenic (hazard quotient HQ and hazard index HI) and carcinogenic (cancer risk CR) effects of these metals on human were evaluated. Results showed that Cu < Cd < Cr < Fe < Pb, with Pb higher than permissible levels. The estimated daily ingestion was 0.158, 0.067, 0.620, 1.3 and 0.09 mg/day for Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Cd, respectively. The HI revealed no adverse health risk with HI < 1 suggesting non carcinogenic effect and non significant to adults and children. However, the carcinogenic risk (CR) was elevated (above 10⁻¹) than acceptable values implying that adults and children that consumed C. gariepinus may be affected. In view of the public health risks associated with the metals listed throughout this study, it is necessary for the government to give special attention to Jabi Lake in order to monitor and prevent the discharge of carcinogenic metals in this Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 0aClarias gariepinus 0aBioaccumulation 0aCarcinogenic 0aHealth risk1 aAbdullahi, Karimatu Lami0 tScientific African.g2020 Mar., v. 7 p.e00292-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27277x2468-22767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e002923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245013700190300001600327520168500343592002802028650002402056650002402080650001302104650002502117650001002142650002202152650002702174650001502201650003302216650001002249650001502259650001302274650001402287650002502301650001302326650001302339651001102352653002402363653002402387653000902411653000902420653000802429653002202437653001102459653002202470653001002492700002902502700002502531700002902556700002802585700002502613773013902638856008202777852000902859655001202868IND60516190720221122162238.0190726e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051619072DNAL7 a248710932pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853140003882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzman-Valencia, S.10aContrasting effects of geographical separation on the genetic population structure of sympatric species of mites in avocado orchards  ap. 610-621.  aOligonychus punicae and Oligonychus perseae (Acari: Tetranychidae) are the most important mite species affecting avocado orchards in Mexico. Here we used nucleotide sequence data from segments of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes to assess the phylogenetic relationships between both sympatric mite species and, using only ITS sequence data, examine genetic variation and population structure in both species, to test the hypothesis that, although both species co-occur, their genetic population structures are different in both Michoacan state (main producer) and Mexico state. Phylogenetic analysis showed a clear separation between both species using ITS and COI sequence information. Haplotype network analysis done on 24 samples of O. punicae revealed low genetic diversity with only three haplotypes found but a significant geographical population structure confirmed by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) analyses. In addition, a Mantel test revealed that geographical isolation was a factor responsible for the genetic differentiation. In contrast, analyses of 22 samples of O. perseae revealed high genetic diversity with 15 haplotypes found but no geographical structure confirmed by the AMOVA, K2P and Mantel test analyses. We have suggested that geographical separation is one of the most important factors driving genetic variation, but that it affected each species differently. The role of the ecology of these species on our results, and the importance of our findings in the development of monitoring and control strategies are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOligonychus perseae 3aOligonychus punicae 3aavocados 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical isolation 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amites 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3asympatry 3avariance 3aMexico 0aOligonychus punicae 0aOligonychus perseae 0aITS1 0aITS2 0aCOI 0agenetic variation 0aMexico 0aHaplotype network 0aAMOVA1 aSantillán-Galicia, M.T.1 aGuzmán-Franco, A.W.1 aGonzález-Hernández, H.1 aCarrillo-Benítez, M.G.1 aSuárez-Espinoza, J.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2014 Oct., v. 104, no. 5 p.610-621dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853140003883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001400312520164000326592002801966650001501994650001602009650002002025650002402045650002702069650002602096650001202122650001902134650001302153650002502166650000902191650002202200650002002222650001002242650001402252650000902266653000902275653000902284653003702293653002402330653001302354653001902367700001602386700001802402700001902420700001502439700002602454700001402480700001702494773010402511856008202615852000902697655001202706IND60573029620221118193528.0190403e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057302962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Danying10a15N tracer-based analysis of genotypic differences in the uptake and partitioning of N applied at different growth stages in transplanted rice  ap. 27-36.  aNitrogen (N) fertilizer split-application is the most widely adopted N management in rice production. To investigate the genotypic differences in the uptake of fertilizer-N applied at different growth stages and in the partitioning of accumulated N in transplanted rice, a two-year field experiment using a split–split plot design with two N rates (105 and 210kgha−1) and three 15N-labelled fertilizer application treatments was conducted in three rice varieties with different fertilizer-N recovery efficiencies (FNREs). The FNRE of total fertilizer was measured, and the FNREs of basal, tillering and panicle fertilizations were analyzed by applying 15N-labelled urea as basal, tillering or panicle fertilizer. Although the panicle-FNRE (32%-68%) was greater than the FNREs of both basal and tillering fertilizers (10%–36% and 13%–42%, respectively), the FNRE of total fertilizer was significantly and positively correlated with both basal and tillering-FNREs (p<0.01). The high-FNRE varieties absorbed more basal fertilizer-N compared with the low-FNRE variety and had significantly greater basal-FNRE and percentages of basal fertilizer-N in the stems at heading and in the panicles at maturity. Early and quick tillering emergence was observed in the high-FNRE varieties, and there was a significant positive relationship between basal-FNRE and tillering rate. The above results indicate that the difference in basal fertilizer-N absorption plays an important role in the genotypic difference in FNRE, and high-FNRE varieties might be selected from the varieties characterized by fast tillering in the early growth stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acorrelation 3acrop production 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aheading 3ainflorescences 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3asplit application 3astable isotopes 3astems 3atillering 3aurea 0aFNRE 0aRice 0aFertilizer-N recovery efficiency 0aN split-application 0aN uptake 0aN partitioning1 aXu, Chunmei1 aYan, Jinxiang1 aZhang, Xiaoguo1 aChen, Song1 aChauhan, Bhagirath S.1 aWang, Lei1 aZhang, Xiufu0 tField crops research.g2017 Sept., v. 211 p.27-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245010800151300001600259520211600275592002802391650001302419650001402432650001602446650000802462650001202470650001102482650003002493650001402523650001702537650001302554650003302567650001102600650002002611650001902631650001002650650001502660650001502675700001102690700001102701700001902712700001102731773011602742856007402858852000902932655001202941IND60477883920221118212135.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047788392DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.123052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, X.10aThree‐dimensional pore structure and carbon distribution of macroaggregates in biochar‐amended soil  ap. 109-120.  aIncorporation of biochar improves the physical properties of soil that are needed for plant growth; in particular, it stabilizes soil's aggregate structure. There has been little research, however, on the effects of biochar on three‐dimensional (3‐D) soil structure and carbon distribution within aggregates. To investigate the effects we amended two soil types (Ultisol and Vertisol) with three types of biochar (at the rate of 40 g biochar kg⁻¹ soil). We separated the macroaggregates (5–7 cm in diameter) into two sets to study the distributions of intra‐aggregate pores and carbon. Synchrotron‐based X‐ray micro‐computed tomography (SR‐mCT) indicated that application of woodchip biochar (WCB) and waste‐water sludge biochar (WSB) increased significantly the porosities of macroaggregates, whereas straw biochar (SB) was less effective. The increased porosity of macroaggregates in the biochar‐amended soil is attributed to both the original porosity in the biochar and newly formed pores resulting from the interaction between the soil and the biochar. The addition of straw biochar has no obvious effect on the spatial distribution of pores in macroaggregates of either soil, whereas WCB and WSB changed the directional pore distribution of the Vertisol macroaggregates considerably. In the WCB‐ and WSB‐amended Ultisol, the number of pores increased in the outer parts of the macroaggregates, thereby greatly improving the exchange of air, water and nutrients with the adjacent soil matrix. Carbon mapping of the macroaggregates showed that the application of SB did not greatly increase the carbon content of macroaggregates compared with the control. The addition of WSB to the Ultisol markedly increased the carbon concentration of macroaggregates. The heat‐map analysis indicated that the effects of biochar on pore structure and carbon content depend on the type of biochar and soil. The combination of SR‐mCT and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been shown to be powerful for quantifying the pore characteristics and carbon distribution in soil macroaggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUltisols 3aVertisols 3aX-radiation 3aair 3abiochar 3acarbon 3amicro-computed tomography 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asludge 3asoil aggregates 3asoil structure 3astraw 3awastewater 3awood chips1 aWu, C.1 aFu, Y.1 aBrookes, P.

AIM: In this study, we clarify the effect of short-term drought treatment on the spatial variation of soil CO₂efflux in a forest, and to interpret the changes in soil CO₂efflux caused by root activities. METHODS: Experimental plots (15 m radius) were established around six emergent trees and a drought treatment was conducted for three of the six plots. Soil CO₂efflux was measured along with environmental factors and root biomass, respiration and production in each plot. RESULTS: Soil CO₂efflux at 0.5 m of the emergent trees was nearly three times higher than at 5 and 10 m away from the trees. Root respiration and biomass had no correlation with the spatial variation. Soil water content decreased by nearly 30 % during the drought treatment, although soil CO₂efflux was unchanged between drought and control plots. CONCLUSIONS: Our result suggests a strong spatial variation exists in soil CO₂efflux around emergent trees, but short-term severe drought has little effect on it.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest ecosystems 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aKume, Tomonori1 aYoshifuji, Natsuko1 aKho, Lip Khoon1 aNakagawa, Michiko1 aNakashizuka, Tohru0 tPlant and soil.g2015 Feb., v. 387, no. 1-2 p.337-349dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2303-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245014900182520103500331592002801366650001601394650002601410650001101436650001101447650002101458650001901479650001301498650001401511650001101525650001501536651000901551653002101560653001401581653001601595653001601611700003601627700002101663700002801684700001801712700003701730700003301767700003401800700002201834700001501856700002401871773010601895856008802001852000902089655001202098IND60752225620221116193421.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075222562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuellar-Martinez, Tomasa10aParalytic shellfish toxins in Peruvian scallops associated with blooms of Alexandrium ostenfeldii (Paulsen) Balech & Tangen in Paracas Bay, Peru  aIn recent years, dense Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms have been reported in different coastal areas. In this study, we report for the first time the occurrence of A. ostenfeldii blooms associated with the detection of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in the Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) from Paracas Bay. Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms occurred at the end of summer and early fall, after the increase of riverine input and under stratified conditions following a decrease in wind velocity. The highest abundances occurred during warm sea surface temperatures (18–27 °C). High PST concentrations that exceed the maximum permissible level (800 μg STX eq. kg⁻¹) occurred even under low A. ostenfeldii abundances (20 × 10³ cells l⁻¹). Our results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of A. ostenfeldii in coastal systems influenced by riverine inputs and upwelling and can be used to improve monitoring programs and allow the implementation of mitigation measures along the Peruvian coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3aArgopecten purpuratus 3aautumn 3acoasts 3amarine pollution 3ariparian areas 3ascallops 3ashellfish 3asummer 3awind speed 3aPeru 0aHumboldt current 0aUpwelling 0aPhycotoxins 0aAquaculture1 aHuanca Ochoa, Aurora del Rocío1 aSánchez, Sonia,1 aAguirre Velarde, Arturo1 aCorrea, David1 aEgoavil Gallardo, Kilder Antonio1 aLuján Monja, Henry Fernando1 aIpanaqué Zapata, Juan Manuel1 aColas, François,1 aTam, Jorge1 aGutiérrez, Dimitri0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.112988-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1129883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245005400170300001600224520157300240592002801813650001301841650002401854650000901878650001201887650001001899650001801909650001301927650002101940650002201961651001601983700002801999700002102027773009402048856008102142852000902223655001202232IND4399210120221118105553.0151024e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439921012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9101-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGondwe, Mangaliso J.10aPlanktonic nitrogen fixation in Lake Malawi/Nyasa  ap. 251-267.  aNitrogen (N₂) fixation has been identified as possibly an important source of “new” nitrogen (N) to the epilimnion of Lake Malawi but studies in 1999–2000 and 2002 (September–December) estimated that the contribution of N₂-fixation by heterocystous Anabaena filaments to the N budget of the lake’s epilimnion is only 3–4% of total N input. N₂-fixation rates in Lake Malawi, as estimated by the acetylene reduction assay were higher during the stratified season (September–March) than during the rest of the year. Planktonic N₂-fixation in Lake Malawi can be monitored by measuring heterocyst biovolume concentrations because a significant correlation (r ² = 0.945, P < 0.0001) was observed between the two parameters. Heterocyst density cannot be used to estimate N₂-fixation because heterocyst sizes in the lake change continuously as at least two Anabaena species with different heterocyst dimensions are present. During September–October 2002, a species similar to A. maxima, contained larger heterocysts (16.34 ± 2.46 and 13.25 ± 1.89 μm in cross and apical section dimensions, respectively). In November–December of 2002, A. discoidea dominated and had smaller sized heterocysts (8.92 ± 1.13 and 7.25 ± 0.95 μm in cross and apical section dimensions). Since planktonic N₂-fixation is higher near shore than offshore, its contribution to the N budget in the littoral zone where high densities of grazing benthic fish occur may be more critical to maintaining the high rates of benthic algal productivity observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aacetylene reduction 3afish 3agrazing 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3aLake Malawi1 aGuildford, Stephanie J.1 aHecky, Robert E.0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Jan., v. 596, no. 1 p.251-267dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9101-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012900167300001600296520104600312592002801358650001901386650001801405650002501423650001501448650001301463650001401476650001301490650001001503650002001513650001901533650002001552650002501572650001301597650002401610650000901634650003501643653000901678653000701687653000801694653000801702653000701710653000901717653000901726653000701735653000801742653001101750653001001761653000701771653000801778653000701786653000801793653001201801653000901813653002001822653001601842653002601858700001301884700001701897700001801914700001301932700005501945700001502000700002002015773008802035856008302123852000902206655001202215IND60611053420221119042859.0181015e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061105342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jiankun10aAssociation of IL18 genetic polymorphisms with increased risk of Biliary atresia susceptibility in Southern Chinese children  ap. 228-231.  aBiliary atresia (BA) has complex genetic etiology, characterized by different levels of hepatic fibrosis after the Kasai procedure and immune responses to the bile duct. As an activator of the two most important inflammatory cells in Biliary atresia (T cells and NK cells), IL-18 is significantly increased in BA patients. This study aims to investigate the association of Interleukin 18(IL-18) with the susceptibility to BA. We examined the association of three polymorphisms (rs549908, rs187238 and rs1946518 in IL-18) and BA susceptibility in a Southern Chinese population composed of 506 cases and 1473 controls. SNP rs187238 and rs1946518 were identified as associated with BA. Interestingly, we also observed that the intragenic synergistic epistasis between SNPs rs187238 and rs1946518 boosting the risk to BA by logistic regression and Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. This study provides for the first time a direct evidence to support IL-18 as a susceptibility gene for the disease in southern Chinese children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aT-lymphocytes 3aabnormal development 3abile ducts 3achildren 3aepistasis 3aetiology 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-18 3aliver cirrhosis 3anatural killer cells 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aADD3 0aBA 0aCEU 0aCHB 0aCV 0aGPC1 0aGWAS 0aGZ 0aHWE 0aIFN-γ 0aIL-18 0aLD 0aMDR 0aOR 0aSNP 0aXPNPEP1 0aIL18 0aBiliary atresia 0aAssociation 0aGenetic polymorphisms1 aWen, Zhe1 aZhao, Jinglu1 aLiang, Qifeng1 aLiu, Tao1 aXia, Huimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0103-16721 aZhang, Yan1 aZhang, RuiZhong0 tGene.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 677 p.228-231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009400160300001600254500002000270520244200290592002802732650001002760650001802770650001102788650001402799650002702813650001302840650001002853650002302863650001802886650002202904650001302926650001002939650002202949650001202971651001502983700002202998700001703020700002003037700002303057773013003080856007303210852000903283655001203292IND60587624220221121182021.0180102e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762422DNAL7 a10.1890/11-1660.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Gregory M.10aGeographic variation in marine invasions among large estuaries: effects of ships and time  ap. 311-320.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCoastal regions exhibit strong geographic patterns of nonnative species richness. Most invasions in marine ecosystems are known from bays and estuaries, where ship‐mediated transfers (on hulls or in ballasted materials) have been a dominant vector of species introductions. Conspicuous spatial differences in nonnative species richness exist among bays, but the quantitative relationship between invasion magnitude and shipping activity across sites is largely unexplored. Using data on marine invasions (for invertebrates and algae) and commercial shipping across 16 large bays in the United States, we estimated (1) geographic variation in nonnative species richness attributed to ships, controlling for effects of salinity and other vectors, (2) changes through time in geographic variation of these ship‐mediated invasions, and (3) effects of commercial ship traffic and ballast water discharge magnitude on nonnative species richness. For all nonnative species together (regardless of vector, salinity, or time period), species richness differed among U.S. coasts, being significantly greater for Pacific Coast bays than Atlantic or Gulf Coast bays. This difference also existed when considering only species attributed to shipping (or ballast water), controlling for time and salinity. Variation in nonnative species richness among Pacific Coast bays was strongly affected by these same criteria. San Francisco Bay, California, had over 200 documented nonnative species, more than twice that reported for other bays, but many species were associated with other (non‐shipping) vectors or the extensive low‐salinity habitats (unavailable in some bays). When considering only ship‐ or ballast‐mediated introductions in high‐salinity waters, the rate of newly detected invasions in San Francisco Bay has converged increasingly through time on that for other Pacific Coast bays, appearing no different since 1982. Considering all 16 bays together, there was no relationship between either (1) number of ship arrivals (from foreign ports) and number of introductions attributed to ships since 1982 or (2) volume of foreign ballast water discharge and number of species attributed to ballast water since 1982. These shipping measures are likely poor proxies for propagule supply, although they are sometimes used as such, highlighting a fundamental gap in data needed to evaluate invasion dynamics and management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aballast water 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3ageographical variation 3ahabitats 3ahulls 3aintroduced species 3ainvertebrates 3amarine ecosystems 3asalinity 3aships 3aspecies diversity 3atraffic 3aCalifornia1 aFofonoff, Paul W.1 aAshton, Gail1 aMinton, Mark S.1 aMiller, A.

Thermostability of enzymes can be improved by the optimization of unstable residues via protein engineering. In this study, computational modeling instead of random mutagenesis was used to optimize unstable residues of Bacillus circulans xylanase (Bcx). The thermal fluctuations of unstable residues known as important to the thermal unfolding of Bcx were investigated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 300K and 330K to identify promising residues. The N52 site in unstable regions showed the highest thermal fluctuations. Subsequently, computational design was conducted to predict the optimal sequences of unstable residues. Five optimal single mutants were predicted by the computational design, and the N52Y mutation showed the thermostabilization effect. The N52 residue is conserved in Bacillus species xylanases and the structure analysis revealed that the N52Y mutation introduced more hydrophobic clusters for thermostability, as well as a more favorable aromatic stacking environment for substrate binding. We confirm that flexible residues at high temperature in unstable regions can be promising targets to improve thermostability of enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus circulans 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3ableaching 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprotein engineering 3apulp 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3axylanases1 aPack, Seung Pil1 aKim, Yŏng-hwan,1 aYoo, Young Je0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.56-65dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009000162300001600252520138900268592002801657650002801685650002301713650001901736650002401755650001201779650001301791650001501804650001501819650001501834650002301849650001401872650002301886650001701909651001101926700002001937700001601957700002001973773009201993856008102085852000902166655001202175IND60120130320221118154503.0150126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012013032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2304-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwe, G.

This study was conducted to evaluate the temporal processes of soil water status of a sugarcane field under residue management during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons in southern Brazil. METHODS: Soil water storage (SWS) and matric potential (Ψ) were monitored in the 0–10 and 10–20 and 40–60 cm layers using time domain reflectometer sensors and tensiometers while precipitation (P) and potential crop evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using rainguage and daily weather data. RESULTS: There was significant temporal variation of soil water status with soil depths. SWS was lower while matric potential was higher in no mulch treatment than in mulched treatment in both growing seasons. SWS cross-correlated with other variables, however, results were not the same for the different soil depths and treatments. Classical regression of SWS from combinations of log (Ψ), ET and P gave satisfactory results, however state-time analysis was better with higher R²values and incorporated errors. CONCLUSIONS: State-time analysis, combined with state-space could be a useful tool for good predictions of soil water status. Residue mulching influenced soil water status, thus proved to be a sustainable soil management practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3ameteorological data 3amulches 3amulching 3aprediction 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3asugarcane 3atemporal variation 3atensiometers 3aBrazil1 aReichert, J.

In teleost, due to the genome duplication event, there are two co-orthologs sox9a and sox9b. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was performed to disrupt the function of either sox9a or sox9b. All sox9a mutants (sox9aΔ10 and sox9aΔ67) and sox9b mutants (sox9bΔ11 and sox9bΔ20) lost HMG domain and Q/S domain, however, only sox9a mutant larvae had mis-shaped pectoral fins and lacked the scapulocoracoid cartilage. sox9b mutant larvae showed normal cartilages similar to wild type larvae. The results suggested that sox9a, not sox9b was required for cartilage development in zebrafish, which was different from the sox9b-mutant phenotype induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) treatment, gamma radiation treatment or morpholino injection. This study confirmed that ancestral sox9 gene functions partitioned between the two paralogs in zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aDanio rerio 3aN-ethyl-N-nitrosourea 3aaquaculture 3acartilage 3agamma radiation 3agenes 3amutants 3aphenotype 3avertebrates 0asox9a 0asox9b 0aCartilage development 0aZebrafish1 aHe, Yan1 aGui, Jian-Fang1 aMei, Jie0 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2021 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.254-259dElsevier B.V.aShanghai Ocean UniversitywJournal:23559x2468-550X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2019.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168300001600256520219700272592002802469650002402497650000902521650001202530650001402542650001102556650001702567650002402584650001802608650002502626653000702651653000902658653000702667653001002674653000902684653001302693653000702706653000702713653000802720653000702728653001002735653002302745653002202768653004102790653002602831653001602857700001802873700001602891700001902907773010302926856008403029852000903113655001203122IND60609241020221120131535.0180822e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060924102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Changwoo10aAssociation between ambient particulate matter and disorders of vestibular function  ap. 242-248.  aExposure to environmental chemicals has been suggested to alter the physiologic state of the inner and middle ear. However, it is unknown if particulate matter exposure is associated with acute vestibular dysfunction.To estimate the effects of particulate matter exposure on the number of hospital visits related to three major diseases of vestibular dysfunction, Meniere's disease (MD), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and vestibular neuronitis (VN).Our study subject is from Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort, which is dynamic cohort consist of 1 million participants representing the Korean population. Among total cohort participants, we used the hospital visit data of 210,000 individuals who resided in Seoul from 2007 to 2010. Time series analysis using the Poisson generalized additive model and case-crossover analysis using conditional logistic regression were used to investigate the association between daily particulate matter levels (PM2.5, particulate matter <2.5μg/m³; PM10, particulate matter <10μg/m³; PM10-2.5, PM10- PM2.5) and number of MD, BPPV, and VN hospital visits.Time series analysis showed that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10 and PM10-2.5 on lag day 1 was associated with an increased risk of MD hospital visits [relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), PM10: 1.09 (1.02–1.15); PM10-2.5: 1.06 (1.02–1.10)]. In addition, elderly individuals (≥60 years old) showed an increased risk of MD hospital visits after particulate matter exposure when compared to younger individuals. An IQR increase in particulate matter on lag day 1 was associated with a marginally significant increase in VN hospital visits [RR (95%CI), PM2.5: 1.11 (0.98–1.25); PM10: 1.07 (0.99–1.15); PM10-2.5: 1.04 (0.99–1.09)]. However, no association between particulate matter exposure and BPPV hospital visits was noted. Case-crossover analyses showed similar results to the time-series analysis across all three diseases.MD hospital visits were associated with ambient particulate matter exposure. Elderly individuals, in particular, were more susceptible to particulate matter exposure than younger individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3aears 3aelderly 3ahospitals 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3arelative risk 3atime series analysis 0aMD 0aBPPV 0aVN 0aPM2.5 0aPM10 0aPM10-2.5 0aRR 0aCI 0aIQR 0aOR 0aHSV-1 0aParticulate matter 0aMeniere's disease 0aBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo 0aVestibular neuronitis 0aTime series1 aLim, Youn-Hee1 aJung, Kweon1 aHong, Yun-Chul0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 May, v. 155 p.242-248dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100004000145245010800185300002000293520163000313592002801943650001501971650002901986650001302015650001202028650001902040650002302059650002902082650001002111650000902121650003102130650002602161650001902187650001802206650001502224650001502239650001102254650002402265650001902289650002102308650002202329650001902351700006002370700007602430773014202506856007902648852000902727655001202736IND60624607620190313000000.0181204e20181024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062460762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b015242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Suely Patrı́cia Costa14aThe Positive Fate of Biochar Addition to Soil in the Degradation of PHBV-Silver Nanoparticle Composites  ap. 13845-13853.  aThe environmental contamination of soils by polymeric and nanomaterials is an increasing global concern. Polymeric composites containing silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are collectively one of the most important products of nanotechnology due to their remarkable antimicrobial activity. Biochars are a promising resource for environmental technologies for remediation of soils considering their high inorganic and organic pollutant adsorption capacity and microbial soil consortium stimulation. In this work we report, for the first time, the use of biochar material as a tool to accelerate the degradation of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) and PHBV composites containing AgNP in a tropical soil system, under laboratory conditions. This positive effect is associated with microbial community improvement, which increased the degradation rate of the polymeric materials, as confirmed by integrated techniques for advanced materials characterization. The addition of 5–10% of sugarcane bagasse biochar into soil has increased the degradation of these polymeric materials 2 to 3 times after 30 days of soil incubation. However, the presence of silver nanoparticles in the PHBV significantly reduced the degradability potential of this nanocomposite by the soil microbial community. These results provide evidence that AgNP or Ag⁺ ions caused a decline in the total number of bacteria and fungi, which diminished the polymer degradation rate in soil. Finally, this work highlights the great potential of biochar resources for application in soil remediation technologies, such as polymeric (nano)material biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abiochar 3abiodegradation 3acomposite polymers 3aenvironmental technology 3afungi 3aions 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicrobial communities 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apollutants 3asilver 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pollution 3asoil remediation 3asugarcane bagasse 3atropical soils1 aStrauss, Mathias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0296-09561 aMartinez, Diego Stéfani Teodoro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0086-30550 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 24, v. 52, no. 23 p.13845-13853dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b015243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245019300156300001600349520186100365592002802226650002602254650002102280650001302301650002502314650002502339650001702364650001602381650002102397650001302418650001502431650002102446650001802467650002002485650001602505650001502521650001302536650002302549650001502572650001402587650001802601650001002619650001302629650002002642650001202662650002002674650001702694650001502711650002902726650002502755650001602780700001702796700001702813700001702830700001302847700003302860700001702893773009702910856007303007852000903080655001203089IND60477884320221118212133.0160106e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047788432DNAL7 a10.1111/are.125012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiying10aEffect of a dairy‐yeast prebiotic (GroBiotic®‐A) on growth performance, body composition, antioxidant capacity and immune functions of juvenile starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus)  ap. 398-408.  aAn 8‐week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a dairy‐yeast prebiotic (Grobiotic®‐A) on growth performance, body composition, antioxidant capacity and immune functions of juvenile starry flounder, Platichtahys stellatus. Three triplicates of starry flounder (average initial weight of 15.05 ± 0.04 g) were fed one of six diets formulated to supplement dairy‐yeast prebiotic at 0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, 1.2%, 1.6% or 2.0% respectively. Results showed that weight gain, daily feed intake, protein efficiency rate and condition factor increased significantly (P < 0.05) whereas feed conversion ratio decreased significantly with the increasing level of the dairy‐yeast prebiotic supplement. Crude lipid content in dorsal muscle and liver decreased significantly (P < 0.05). No significant differences occurred in moisture and crude protein content of dorsal muscle and liver with the increasing level of the dairy‐yeast prebiotic supplement. Compared with fish feed the basal diet, the activity of catalase and total antioxidant capability in serum and liver, as well as total superoxide dismutase in serum all significantly increased with high level of the prebiotic, while the malondialdehyde content in serum and liver decreased significantly. In serum, the activity of alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, complement and the content of nitric oxide were significantly increased at higher level of prebiotic supplementation while no significant differences were found in total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin to globulin ratio, haemoglobin, acid phosphatase and myeloperoxidase. Based on weight gain response using the quadratic regression, combine the antioxidant and immune indices, the optimum dietary dairy‐yeast prebiotic level for juvenile starry flounder was estimated to be 1.33% under these experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatichthys stellatus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abody composition 3acatalase 3acomplement 3acondition factor 3acrude protein 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afish feeds 3aflounder 3agrowth performance 3ahemoglobin 3ajuveniles 3alipid content 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscles 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aprebiotics 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain1 aZhang, Derui1 aSun, Yongzhi1 aWang, Shixin1 aLi, Peng1 aGatlin, Delbert M., IIIcIII1 aZhang, Limin0 tAquaculture research.g2016 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.398-408dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.125013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009800166300001600264520084900280592002801129650001101157650001701168650002201185650001301207653002001220653002401240653002401264653002401288653002301312700001301335700001701348700001401365700002301379700001701402700001701419700001401436773012501450856008301575852000901658655001201667IND60736314620221122223605.0210820e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073631462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jinfeng10aMesoscopic Ti2Nb10O29 cages comprised of nanorod units as high-rate lithium-ion battery anode  ap. 111-117.  aBenefiting from large tunnel structure, zero strain feature, and excellent pseudocapacitive performance, Ti₂Nb₁₀O₂₉ was considered as a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

The mesoscopic structure could effectively shorten the ion diffusion pathway, and the big central electrolyte reservoir relieves the concentration polarization of electrolyte. Moreover, the perforated pore feature guarantees competent contact between electrolyte and framework. As the anode of LIBs, the mesoscopic Ti₂Nb₁₀O₂₉ cages deliver high reversible capacity (302.5 mAh/g) and rate capability (134.3 mAh/g at 30 A/g).

There are limited fossil data that can be used in divergence time estimations. Therefore, reliable morphological characterization and taxonomical identification of fossil fungi are extremely important. Most fossils of Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes are from the early Cenozoic (66–23 Mya), with fewer from the late Mesozoic (174–145 Mya). However, it is hard to distinguish some fossil descriptions as photographs and illustrations are unclear; thus, the validity of using these fossils in calibrations of molecular clocks is problematic. This study brings scattered paleobiological data on selected fossil Ascomycota, using descriptions, fossil images and illustrations, coupled with recent age estimations, and taxonomic and phylogenetic affinity of extant species. As an integrated approach, this study summarizes a historical fossil outline with a reliable minimum age for 16 calibrating points viz. crown of Aigialus, Anzia, Aspergillus, Asterina, Calicium chlorosporum–C. nobile, Capnodiales, Chaenotheca, Colletotrichum, Diaporthales, Meliola, Ophiocordyceps, Microthyriales, Microthyrium, Muyocopron, Pezizomycotina and Stigmatomyces.

On the other hand, field labs have been generally less used as a way of teaching landscape ecology concepts. OBJECTIVES: We show that field labs with an inquiry-based approach, where students are involved in the investigation, are feasible for training students in landscape ecology. We evaluated how common field labs are in landscape ecology courses, and also their contribution for student learning. METHODS: We evaluated whether field labs are used in landscape ecology courses by scanning available syllabi. We also used outcomes from a course offered in Brazil to show how field labs can be integrated into landscape ecology courses. RESULTS: Only 18.2 % of the 44 syllabi we found had field labs. The case study developed in Brazil showed that field labs allowed students to develop important skills, including the ability to design field studies, choose appropriate scales of analysis, detect ecological patterns, and judge multiple hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Field labs are still uncommon in landscape ecology courses, but they can be a useful tool to teach landscape ecology concepts and to help students developing the necessary skills to do research. We offer recommendations regarding how to incorporate field labs in landscape ecology courses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3afield experimentation 3alandscape ecology 3alearning 3astudents 3aBrazil1 aPrevedello, Jayme Augusto1 aScarpa, Daniela Lopes1 aMetzger, Jean Paul0 tLandscape ecology.g2016 June, v. 31, no. 5 p.929-937dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-016-0338-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016400175520169200339592002802031650001502059650001302074650001002087650002302097653002102120653003102141653003202172653002902204653000902233653001102242700002102253700006702274773009702341856008502438852000902523655001202532IND60778698420221123004126.0220621e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077869842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Dinesh Kumar10aEfficient k-means clustering and greedy selection-based reduction of nodal search space for optimization of sensor placement in the water distribution networks  aMonitoring of water distribution network (WDN) requires placement of sensors at strategic locations to detect maximum contamination events at the earliest. The multi-objective optimization (MOO) of sensor placement is a complicated problem owing to its combinatorial nature, interconnected and large WDN sizes, and temporal flows producing complex outcomes for a given set of contamination events. In this study, a new method is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by condensing the nodal search space. This method first segregates the nodes based on intrusion events detected, using k-means clustering, followed by selecting nodes from each group based on the improvement observed in the objectives, namely, contamination event detection, expected detection time, and affected population. The selected nodes formed the decision variable space for the MOO study. The developed strategy was tested on two benchmark networks: BWSN Network1 and C-town network, and its performance is compared with the traditional method in terms of hypervolume contribution rate (CR) indicator and the number of Pareto points. The optimal subset of nodes generated twice the number of Pareto points than the complete set of nodes set for placing 20 sensors and had 10% more than CR indicator than the traditional method. For the placement of 5 sensors, the proposed solutions were better at the higher detection likelihood values, which is required to achieve maximum detection. The proposed sensor placement algorithm can be easily scaled to large WDNs. It is expected to provide a better optimal sensor placement solution irrespective of network size as compared to the traditional approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aresearch 3awater 3awater distribution 0aSensor placement 0aWater distribution network 0aMultiobjective optimization 0aOptimal sensor placement 0aBWSN 0aC-town1 aKotecha, Prakash1 aSubbiah, Senthilmurugan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8439-35150 tWater research.g2022 July 15, v. 220 p.118666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013400172520121800306592002801524653003401552653001601586653001201602653001701614653001501631653002601646700001901672700001901691700001501710700002001725700001501745773012101760856008801881852000901969655001201978IND60676109820221121012732.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067610982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.1039502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiangyu10aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alter carbohydrate distribution and amino acid accumulation in Medicago truncatula under lead stress  aThis study aims to understand the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation on the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolites in Medicago truncatula plants under lead (Pb) stress. Root morphology, nutrient, photosynthesis, sucrose cleaving enzymes, the transcription levels of sucrose transporters, and metabolite profiling were evaluated via a two-factor (AM inoculation and Pb stress) pot experiment. AM inoculation alleviated the damage caused by Pb to photosynthesis and increased phosphorus uptake. AM inoculation decreased the shoot sucrose content but increased root sucrose content. The transcription of MtSUT1-1 and MtSUT4-1 in roots was upregulated by AM inoculation, which indicates that AM plant has a higher ability of sucrose transport. Both Pb stress and AM inoculation stimulated the activity of acid invertase and sucrose synthetase in roots. In shoots, minor amino acids such as cysteine were increased by AM inoculation. Sucrose content was negatively related to asparagine content. Therefore, AM inoculation may alleviate Pb toxicity by promoting the transport of sucrose from shoot to root, promoting the cleaving of sucrose in roots, and increasing minor amino acids accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungus 0aHeavy metal 0aSucrose 0aCarbohydrate 0aAmino acid 0aMetabolites profiling1 aZhang, Huijuan1 aZhang, Yongxin1 aLiu, Yaqin1 aZhang, Haoqiang1 aTang, Ming0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 Mar., v. 171 p.103950-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.1039503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245006600134300001600200506002800216520124900244592002801493506003701521650002001558650001501578650001401593650001901607650001101626650001501637653001301652653002101665653002101686653001901707653002201726773013701748852000901885655001201894IND60774983120221207083124.0190504e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077498312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskandari, Farzad14aThe modeling of body\'s immune system using Bayesian Networks  ap. 205-220.  aResource is Open Access  aIn this paper, the urinary infection, that is a common symptom of the decline of the immune system, is discussed based on the well-known algorithms in machine learning, such as Bayesian networks in both Markov and tree structures. A large scale sampling has been executed to evaluate the performance of Bayesian network algorithm. A number of 4052 samples wereobtained from the database of the Takestan Department of Health, a center affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences. According to the goals of the study and using the expert opinion of the laboratory and urologist, 15 variables were selected. The database included both urine analysis and culture tests. The results indicated 99.7% accuracy of the diagnosis for the training data, (75% of total data), and 99.8% accuracy of the diagnosis for testing data (25% of total data). Based on the Bayesian network model, the important covariates influencing the Urinary infection have been proved to be the increase of bacteria and the decrease of white blood cells in different age groups. The results of this study can be used in the context of machine learning and intelligent systems for rapid diagnosis of the disease and the treatment of people suspected of suffering from it.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3aexpert opinion 3amodels 3aurinalysis 0abacteria 0amachine learning 0amarkov algorithm 0atree algorithm 0awhite blood cells0 tYāftah/hā-yi nuvīn dar ̒ulūm-i zīstī.g2018 Sept., v. 5, no. 2 p.205-220dKharazmi UniversitywJournal:27935x2476-71157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245006300212300001600275520211400291592002802405650002002433650001002453650001202463650001002475650003302485650001602518650001302534650002702547651001602574700005502590700002602645700002002671700001802691773011502709856008202824852000902906655001202915IND60648183820221121112529.0190627e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064818382DNAL7 a10.1007/s13225-019-00428-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofstetter, Valérie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9289-452814aThe unbearable lightness of sequenced-based identification  ap. 243-284.  aUsing the basic GenBank local alignment search tool program (BLAST) to identify fungi collected in a recently protected beech forest at Montricher (Switzerland), the number of ITS sequences associated to the wrong taxon name appears to be around 30%, even higher than previously estimated. Such results rely on the in-depth re-examination of BLAST results for the most interesting species that were collected, viz. first records for Switzerland, rare or patrimonial species and problematic species (when BLAST top scores were equally high for different species), all belonging to Agaricomycotina. This paper dissects for the first time a number of sequence-based identifications, thereby showing in every detail—particularly to the user community of taxonomic information—why sequence-based identification in the context of a fungal inventory can easily go wrong. Our first conclusion is that in-depth examination of BLAST results is too time consuming to be considered as a routine approach for future inventories: we spent two months on verification of approx. 20 identifications. Apart from the fact that poor taxon coverage in public depositories remains the principal impediment for successful species identification, it can be deplored that even very recent fungal sequence deposits in GenBank involve an uncomfortably high number of misidentifications or errors with associated metadata. While checking the original publications associated with top score sequences for the few examples that were here re-examined, a positive consequence is that we uncovered over 80 type sequences that were not annotated as types in GenBank. Advantages and pitfalls of sequence-based identification are discussed, particularly in the light of undertaking fungal inventories. Recommendations are made to avoid or reduce some of the major problems with sequence-based identification. Nevertheless, the prospects for a more reliable sequence-based identification of fungi remain quite dim, unless authors are ready to check and update the metadata associated with previously deposited sequences in their publications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricomycotina 3aFagus 3aforests 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainventories 3ametadata 3aspecies identification 3aSwitzerland1 aBuyck, Bart1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6824-52801 aEyssartier, Guillaume1 aSchnee, Sylvain1 aGindro, Katia0 tFungal diversity.g2019 May, v. 96, no. 1 p.243-284dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000079x1560-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-019-00428-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245013100177300001800308500001100326520079000337592002801127596005401155596005301209650001501262650001901277650002801296650001201324650001101336650001201347650001401359650001201373650001201385700003301397700002401430700002701454773011501481856008001596852000901676655001201685IND60786866820221121225527.0220806e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078686682DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.130302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhamidimarri, Poorna Manasa10aMannose 6‐phosphate‐dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting in hydra: a biochemical, immunological and structural elucidation  ap. 1366-1377.  aLETTER  aMannose 6‐phosphate (M6P)‐dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting to endosome/lysosome complex is poorly understood among lower invertebrates. So far, only a M6P‐independent lysosomal enzyme sorting protein, named LERP, has been described in Drosophila. Here, we have identified mannose 6‐phosphate receptor (MPR) homologues in Hydra vulgaris, a basal Cnidarian, at genome level and further purified a cation‐dependent MPR‐like protein from hydra using affinity chromatography. Structural comparisons of hydra MPRs with mammalian MPRs confirm that the residues important for interacting with the M6P ligand are conserved. Based on our results, we report for the first time the occurrence of MPR‐related proteins and M6P‐dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting in H. vulgaris.  aPublisher supplied data  aUGC‐SAP‐DRS‐1cUniversity Grants Commission  aDST‐FISTcDepartment of Science and Technology 3aDrosophila 3aHydra vulgaris 3aaffinity chromatography 3aenzymes 3agenome 3aligands 3alysosomes 3amammals 3amannose1 aKrishnapati, Lakshmi Surekha1 aGhaskadbi, Surendra1 aNadimpalli, Siva Kumar0 tFEBS letters.g2018 Apr., v. 592, no. 8 p.1366-1377dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.130303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003000112245007900142300001400221506002800235520275900263592002803022506003703050650002003087650000903107650001103116650002303127650001403150650002003164650001403184700001903198700003903217700002503256700002703281700003503308773012003343852000903463655001203472IND60774983220221207083027.0141014e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077498322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Roselene Maria10aAssessment of turbidity as a quick tool to quantify the sediment transport  ap. 32-36.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><strong>AVALIAÇÃO DA TURBIDEZ COMO FERRAMENTA RÁPIDA PARA QUANTIFICAR O TRANSPORTE DE SEDIMENTOS</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Erosões em vertentes ou em margens de rios são consequências da ação de vários mecanismos capazes de romper o equilíbrio do sistema natural. Entre os mecanismos naturais, a ação dos eventos pluviométricos sobre diferentes usos do solo merece destaque, pois dependendo de sua intensidade e duração, podem gerar altas taxas erosivas e, consequentemente, ocasionar o transporte de uma grande quantidade sedimentos pelos canais fluviais. Conhecer a dinâmica do transporte de sedimentos em bacias hidrográficas é de extrema importância, pois auxilia ogestor na tomada de decisão quanto à necessidade de buscar novas formas de manejo do solo. No presente trabalho foram realizadas a determinação da descarga sólida pela determinação da concentração de sedimentos e por meio da correlação entre os parâmetros concentração de sólidos e turbidez nas águas do ribeirão Maringá-PR a fim de avaliar a capacidade do transporte de sedimentos.

Among the natural mechanisms, the action of rainfall events on different land uses is noteworthy, as depending on their intensity and duration, these events can generate high erosion rates and hence cause a large amount of sediment transported through fluvial channels. Knowing the dynamics of sediment transport in river basins is extremely important, because it helps decision-making regarding the need to seek new forms of soil management. In this work, solid discharge was calculated by determining the suspended solids concentration and by the correlation between the sediment concentration parameters and turbidity in the waters of Maringá Stream-PR, in order to evaluate sediment transport capacity. It was observed that the use of the correlation leads to significant errors in determining solid discharge; nevertheless, it can be an important tool given its practicality, lower cost and quick outcome.</p> <p>Keywords: waterflow, sediment, discharge.</p><p> </p><p><strong><strong style="text-align: justify;">DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.14583/2318-7670.v02n01a06">http://dx.doi.org/10.14583/2318-7670.v02n01a06</a></strong></strong></p></div>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adecision making 3arain 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asoil management 3aturbidity1 aFreire, Rosane1 aWelliton Leandro de Oliveira Boina1 aCossich, Eneide Sala1 aSoares, Paulo Fernando1 aTavares, Célia Regina Granhen0 tNativa.g2014 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.32-36dUniversidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT)wJournal:27088x2318-76707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245017400159300001800333520055900351592002800910650001600938650001300954650002300967650002300990650002301013650003101036650002301067650003601090650001601126650002201142700001301164700001401177700001901191700001401210700001401224773011901238856008101357852000901438655001201447IND60557953320221122051428.0161104e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055795332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b015962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Hong10aN-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalytic [4 + 2] Cyclization of 3-Alkylenyloxindoles with Enals: γ-Carbon Activation for Enantioselective Assembly of Spirocarbocyclic Oxindoles  ap. 8888-8899.  aThe ubiquitous structure of all-carbospirocyclic oxindoles makes the development of new methods for their enantioselective and stereoselective synthesis a significant ongoing challenge.

A specific and sensitive approach was established for the detection of Acintobacter baumannii via DNA based bio-assay. In this study, gold nano-star was synthesized and used for bio-conjugation with pDNA toward the detection of target sequences. Synthesized probe (5ʹ TTG TGA ACT ATT TAC GTC AGC ATG C3ʹ) of Acinetobacter baumannii was found with excellent sensitivity. After the hybridization of pDNA with cDNA, target DNA (5ʹ GCA TGC TGA CGT AAA TAG TTC ACA A 3ʹ) was easily measured. According to ultra-sensitivity of the engineered optical DNA-based bio-assay, it is potentially applied in the bacterial detection of the environmental and clinical specimens. Here, the selection of engineered biosensor in the presence of two mismatch sequences was investigated. The results indicated an acceptable choice for DNA-based assays. The low limit of quantification (LLOQ) of genosensor was obtained as 1 fM. The present study is a very important diagnostic examination to recognize Acinetobacter baumannii, which can be a best alternative to the traditional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3abiosensors 3achemical bonding 3acomplementary DNA 3agold 3amicrobial detection 3ananogold 3anucleic acid hybridization 0aAcinetobacter baumannii 0aBio-assay 0aMicroorganism 0aBacteria monitoring 0aGold nanoparticle1 aMobed, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8939-36881 aHasanzadeh, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4918-12391 aSaadati, Arezoo1 aHassanpour, Soodabeh1 aMokhtarzadeh, Ahad0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2020 Feb., v. 133 p.109466-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01693naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245009300159300001800252520065300270592002800923650001200951650001100963650002300974650002300997650002301020650001101043650002201054650001501076700001601091700001601107700001101123773011901134856008101253852000901334655001201343IND60557953420221122051441.0161104e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055795342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b015992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Jun10aCatalytic Asymmetric Addition of Alkyl and Aryl Alkynes to N-(Diphenylphosphinoyl)imines  ap. 8900-8905.  aA 3,3′-di(1-diphenylmethylpiperazinyl)methyl H₈BINOL compound, (S)-11, was prepared from the Mannich-type reaction of (S)-H₈BINOL with paraformaldehyde and 1-(diphenylmethyl)piperazine.

Mn overload may cause motor and psychiatric disturbances and may arise from an impaired or not fully developed excretion system, transporter malfunction and/or exposure to excessive levels of Mn. Therefore, deciphering processes regulating neuronal Mn homeostasis is essential to understand the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity. In the present study, we selected two small molecules (with opposing effects on Mn transport) from a previous high throughput screen of 40,167 to test their effects on Mn toxicity parameters in vivo using Caenorhabditis elegans. We pre-exposed worms to VU0063088 and VU0026921 for 30 min followed by co-exposure for 1 h with Mn and evaluated Mn accumulation, dopaminergic (DAergic) degeneration and worm survival. Control worms were exposed to vehicle (DMSO) and saline only. In pdat-1::GFP worms, with GFP labeled DAergic neurons, we observed a decrease of Mn-induced DAergic degeneration in the presence of both small molecules. This effect was also observed in an smf-2 knockout strain. SMF-2 is a regulator of Mn transport in the worms and this strain accumulates higher Mn levels. We did not observe improved survival in the presence of small molecules. Our results suggest that both VU0063088 and VU0026921 may modulate Mn levels in the worms through a mechanism that does not require SMF-2 and induce protection against Mn neurotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01 ES10563cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aR01 ES07331cNational institute of environmental health sciences  aR01 ES020852cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3adietary minerals 3aexcretion 3ahomeostasis 3amanganese 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity1 aHorning, Kyle J.1 aBornhorst, Julia1 aSchwerdtle, Tanja1 aBowman, Aaron B.1 aAschner, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2619-16560 tBiological trace element research.g2019 Mar., v. 188, no. 1 p.127-134dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-018-1531-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164520197700291592002802268650001502296650002102311650000702332650001302339650002002352650002002372650001002392650001802402653003302420653003702453653001202490653002302502700001802525700001502543700001402558700001802572700001802590700001802608773009702626856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60778698920221121020412.0220621e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077869892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Xin10aUltrafiltration significantly increased the scaling potential of municipal secondary effluent on reverse osmosis membranes  aUltrafiltration (UF) was often used as pretreatment in front of reverse osmosis (RO) unit because of its high rejection efficiency of microbes and particles. However, in some cases UF pretreatment might show adverse effects on the RO membrane flux. In this study, the effects of UF pretreatment on secondary effluent water quality and its RO membrane fouling characteristics were explored. There was almost no change of water quality after UF with different molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes (100, 30 and 10 kDa), including total dissolved solid (TDS), alkalinity, conductivity, ion concentrations, etc., while pH increased a little and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) declined by about 1 mg/L. On the contrary, the RO membrane flux of UF permeates presented clear decline in comparison to the secondary effluent. The membrane fouling velocity and steady-state flux of secondary effluent was 0.052 and 0.656, while fouling velocity increased (0.077, 0.071, 0.067) and steady-state flux decreased significantly (0.397, 0.416, 0.448) after 100, 30, 10 kDa UF membrane pretreatment. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed many crystals on the fouled membrane surfaces, which turned out to be CaCO₃ by Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis and precipitation calculation. After the addition of UF retentates to UF permeates, scaling was prevented and crystals on the RO membrane almost disappeared, which implied the anti-scaling effect of the UF retentates with low concentration. According to anti-scaling performance experiments, the anti-scaling performance of 100 k, 30 k, 10 k retentates was 2.7%, 4.0% and 7.3%, respectively. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) and fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) results showed that these retentates retained by different MWCO membranes were similar and composed of protein-like substances and soluble microbial products.

Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between CEC and clay and organic matter and to estimate both the CEC of the clay and organic matter and their contribution to the CEC of the soils. The data were partitioned by major soil horizon, geomorphic province, soil orders of Soil Taxonomy, and great soil group and were analyzed to determine both the ability of the partitioning of the data to improve the regression and to define groups having distinct relationships between CEC and clay and organic matter. Multiple regression indicated that 59 percent of the variation in the CEC of all the data could be explained by variation in clay and organic matter contents, with the clay having a CEC of 35 and the organic matter 217 milliequivalents per 100 grams. Partitioning the data by geomorphic province or by soil order proved superior in defining groups of soils with distinct clay and organic matter CEC. Poor correlations were obtained between CEC and clay and organic matter for soils of the Piedmont province or of the Alfisol order, indicating either other sources of CEC or variability in the clay mineralogy, organic matter composition, or both in these classes of data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNew Jersey1 aMOTTO, HARRY L.0 tSoil science.g1982 May, v. 133, no. 5 p.281-288dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820729c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01819naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001600264520070300280592002800983650001201011650002001023650002601043650002501069650001101094650001501105653002401120653001001144653000901154653002001163700002501183700002801208700002201236773012701258856005101385852000901436655001201445IND50076489920221117232041.0140410e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007648992DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2011.6299732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilan, Chiara10aComparison and Possible Use of In Silico Tools for Carcinogenicity Within REACH Legislation  ap. 300-323.  aSeven in silico models have been used to assess the prediction accuracy of chemical compound carcinogenicity.

However, microbiota assembly mechanisms underlying CyanoHABs remain elusive. Especially, cyanopeptides, as a group of bioactive secondary metabolites of cyanobacteria, could affect microbiota assembly and ecosystem function. Here, the trajectory of cyanopeptides was followed and linked to microbiota during Microcystis-dominated CyanoHABs in Lake Taihu, China. The most abundant cyanopeptide classes detected included microginin, spumigin, microcystin, nodularin and cyanopeptolin with total MC-LR-equivalent concentrations between 0.23 and 2051.54 ppb, of which cyanotoxins beyond microcystins (e.g., cyanostatin B and nodularin_R) far exceeded reported organismal IC₅₀ and negatively correlated with microbiota diversity, exerting potential collective eco-toxicities stronger than microcystins alone. The microbial communities were differentiated by size fraction and sampling date throughout CyanoHABs, and surprisingly, their variances were better explained by cyanopeptides (19-38%) than nutrients (0-16%). Cyanopeptides restriction (e.g., inhibition) and degradation were first quantitatively verified as the deterministic drivers governing community assembly, with stochastic processes being associated with the interplay between cyanopeptide dynamics and lake microbiota. This study presents an emerging paradigm in which cyanopeptides restriction and degradation co-mediate lake water microbiota assembly, unveiling new insights into the ecotoxicological significance of CyanoHABs to freshwater ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aclimate change 3aecological function 3aecotoxicology 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amicrocystins 3amicroorganisms 3anodularin 3apoisonous algae 3aresearch 3asecondary metabolites 0aCyanobacterial harmful algal blooms 0aCyanopeptides 0aMicrobial community assembly 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aEutrophication 0aTaihu1 aZhao, Ze1 aZhang, Lu1 aJu, Feng0 tWater research.g2022 July 15, v. 220 p.118674-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007100169300001400240520094800254592002801202650003801230650001601268650001201284650001701296650002301313650002701336650002301363650001101386650002101397650001501418650000901433650001601442650002001458653001501478653002501493653001201518653001601530653001901546700001801565700001401583700001601597700001501613700001701628700001701645773009801662856008701760852000901847655001201856IND60610904020221120070103.0190402e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061090402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jinchuan10aInsights into molecular structure and digestion rate of oat starch  ap. 25-30.  aThe in vitro digestibility of oat starch and its relationship with starch molecular structure was investigated. The in vitro digestion results showed that the first-order kinetic constant (k) of oat starches (OS-1 and OS-2) was lower than that of rice starch. The size of amylose chains, amylose content and degree of branching (DB) of amylopectin in oat starch were significantly higher than the corresponding parameters in rice starch. The larger molecular size of oat starch may account for its lower digestion rate. The fine structure of amylopectin showed that oat starch had less chains of DP 6–12 and DP>36, which may explain the small difference in digestion rate between oat and rice starch. The biosynthesis model from oat amylopectin fine structure data suggested a lower starch branching enzyme (SBE) activity and/or a higher starch synthase (SS) activity, which may decrease the DB of oat starch and increase its digestion rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abiosynthesis 3achemical structure 3ain vitro digestibility 3ain vitro digestion 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aoat starch 3aoats 3arice starch 3astarch synthase 0aOat starch 0aStarch digestibility 0aAmylose 0aAmylopectin 0aFine structure1 aKuang, Qirong1 aWang, Kai1 aZhou, Sumei1 aWang, Shuo1 aLiu, Xingxun1 aWang, Shujun0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 220 p.25-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.1913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245014300214300001800357506007600375520145200451592002801903506003701931650002301968650002301991650001502014650002102029650002002050650002102070650001502091650001302106650001202119650000902131650001302140650002002153650003302173650001102206650002002217650003702237700002802274700002902302700003302331700003002364700003202394700002602426700002902452700002302481700003202504700005902536773013202595856008202727852000902809655001202818IND60685511020221207144157.0200304e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068551102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04168-92doi7 aPMC70545252pmcid7 a321806302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Brito, Aila Riany10aDevelopment of amperometric biosensor in modified carbon paste with enzymatic preparation based on lactase immobilized on carbon nanotubes  ap. 1342-1350.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe variety of products derived from milk, without or with lactose, encourages the development of more effective analytical techniques that can be applied to the quality control of both the production line and the final products. Thus, in this work an efficient and minimally invasive method for the detection of lactose was proposed, using a biosensor containing the enzyme lactase (LAC) immobilised on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that, when reacting with lactose, emit an electrochemical signal. This biosensor was connected to a potentiostat, and its electrochemical cell was composed of the following three electrodes: reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), auxiliary electrode (platinum wire), and working electrode (biosensor) on which graphite (carbon) paste (CP), CNTs, and LAC were deposited. The transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used in the characterisation of the composite morphology, indicating excellent interactions between the CNTs and LAC. The sensitivity of the CP/LAC/CNT biosensor was determined as 5.67 μA cm⁻².mmol⁻¹ L and detection limits around 100 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹ (electrode area = 0.12 cm²) and an increase in the stability of the system was observed with the introduction of CNTs because, with about 12 h of use, there was no variation in the signal (current). The results indicate that the association between the CNTs and LAC favoured the electrochemical system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalytical methods 3abeta-galactosidase 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3alactose 3amilk 3aplatinum 3aquality control 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 ados Santos Reis, Nadabe1 aOliveira, Polyany Cabral1 aRezende, Denilde Vilas Bôas1 aMonteiro, Gabriel Pereira1 aSoares, Glêydison Amarante1 ade Jesus, Rodrigo Sá1 aSantos, Antônio Santana1 aSalay, Luiz Carlos1 ade Oliveira, Julieta Rangel1 aFranco, Marcelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7827-789X0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.1342-1350dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04168-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002200185245014800207300001800355520185900373592002802232650002202260650002002282650001502302650002002317650001202337650003502349650001502384650002002399650001502419650001102434650000902445650001102454650002202465650001502487650001302502650001402515650001402529651001302543700002302556700002002579700002302599700001702622700002102639773011702660856008102777852000902858655001202867IND60519306620221119151354.0160426e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051930662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0321-22doi7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0321-22chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Jessica M.10aCollaborative scenario modeling reveals potential advantages of blending strategies to achieve conservation goals in a working forest landscape  ap. 1093-1115.  aCONTEXT: Broad-scale land conservation and management often involve applying multiple strategies in a single landscape. However, the potential outcomes of such arrangements remain difficult to evaluate given the interactions of ecosystem dynamics, resource extraction, and natural disturbances. The costs and potential risks of implementing these strategies make robust evaluation critical. OBJECTIVES: We used collaborative scenario modeling to compare the potential outcomes of alternative management strategies in the Two Hearted River watershed in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to answer key questions: Which management strategies best achieve conservation goals of maintaining landscape spatial heterogeneity and conserving mature forests and wetlands? And how does an increase in wildfire and windthrow disturbances influence these outcomes? METHODS: Scenarios were modeled using the VDDT/TELSA state-and-transition modeling suite, and resulting land cover maps were analyzed using ArcGIS, FRAGSTATS, and R statistical software. RESULTS: Results indicate that blending conservation strategies, such as single-ownership forest reserves and working forest conservation easements in targeted areas of the landscape, may better achieve these goals than applying a single strategy across the same area. However, strategies that best achieve these conservation goals may increase the sensitivity of the landscape to changes in wildfire and windthrow disturbance regimes. CONCLUSIONS: These results inform decision-making about which conservation strategy or combination of strategies to apply in specific locations on the landscape to achieve optimum conservation outcomes, how to best utilize scarce financial resources, and how to reduce the financial and ecological risks associated with the application of innovative strategies in an uncertain future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aland cover 3aland management 3alandscapes 3amodels 3arisk 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3awildfires 3awindthrow 3aMichigan1 aSilbernagel, Janet1 aNixon, Kristina1 aSwearingen, Amanda1 aSwaty, Randy1 aMiller, Nicholas0 tLandscape ecology.g2016 June, v. 31, no. 5 p.1093-1115dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40712x0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0321-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014500171300001800316520176600334592002802100650000802128650001802136650001802154650002402172650001502196650001602211650002802227650001602255650002302271650001602294650002302310650003502333650001802368650001902386650001002405650001302415650002602428650001402454650002102468700001802489700002202507700002802529700001802557700002102575773011002596856008102706852000902787655001202796IND60555568520221117221216.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055556852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-016-0798-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasas-Monroy, Oscar10aComparison of three techniques to evaluate the number of viable phytoplankton cells in ballast water after ultraviolet irradiation treatment  ap. 2821-2830.  aThe unintentional release of aquatic nonindigenous species (NIS) via ballast water has long been recognized as a primary vector of biological invasions. To reduce the risk of ballast-mediated invasions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will direct ships to meet standards regarding the maximum number of viable organisms discharged in ballast water, with most ships expected to install ballast water management systems (BWMSs). Currently, filtration + ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is utilized as a common BWMS. There are issues, however, with enumerating viable phytoplankton after treatment at the low UV doses used onboard ships because the physiological effect occurs at the DNA level—organisms are reproductively sterilized but may remain alive for hours or days after treatment. The objective of this study is to examine three techniques to measure the number of viable phytoplankton cells following filtration + UV treatment: pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry, epifluorescence microscopy using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) stain, and the serial dilution culture most probable number (MPN) method. PAM and staining techniques demonstrated similar patterns of phytoplankton reduction after UV irradiation. After 14 days, the MPN method confirmed viability of treated samples in enriched culture medium incubations and may be used to indicate potential recovery of damaged cells (i.e., “re-growth”). All cells that survived treatment and showed detectable growth after 14 days of incubation were smaller than 10 µm, as determined by microscopy. Combinations of direct and/or indirect measurements and culture-based methods might be the best solution to improve detection strategies and eliminate nonindigenous species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aballast water 3aculture media 3aecological invasion 3afiltration 3afluorescein 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorometry 3aintroduced species 3airradiation 3amanagement systems 3amost probable number technique 3aphytoplankton 3arisk reduction 3aships 3astaining 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability 3awater management1 aChan, Po-Shun1 aLinley, R.

However, lack of a structural comparison between aIF1 and eIF1 has limited our understanding of the structural (dis)similarities. Herein, we have determined the three‐dimensional crystal structure of an open reading frame PH1771.1 encoding aIF1 in Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Results reveal that although aIF1 has low sequence similarity with eIF1, high structural homology exists between the two proteins. Nonetheless, notable critical differences between aIF1 and eIF1 could still be perceived at the β₁–β₂ basic loop, the acidic loop and the solvent‐exposed surface. These differences might lead to a slightly divergent mode of action of aIF1 during archaeal translation initiation.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/302/NE/TBP/2012cDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of India 3aPyrococcus horikoshii 3aRNA 3acrystal structure 3amechanism of action 3asequence homology1 aKanaujia, Shankar Prasad0 tFEBS letters.g2018 May, v. 592, no. 9 p.1602-1610dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.130443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002800169245010100197300001200298520067700310592002800987650000901015650001001024650001201034650001201046650000901058650000901067650001701076651000901093700002201102773010101124856011701225852000901342655001201351IND60131420120221122071316.0151127e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013142012DNAL7 a10.1676/0043-5643(2001)113[0001:ANZTAT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALONSO, JOSÉÉ ALVAREZ12aA new zimmerius tyrannulet (aves: tyrannidae) from white sand forests of northern amazonian peru  ap. 1-9.  aZimmerius villarejoi (Mishana Tyrannulet) is the second novel species to be described in recent years from poorly drained, white sand varillal forest near Iquitos, Depto.

Although well differentiated, close parallels in plumage and bill color suggest that Z. villarejoi may be most closely related to the poorly known and considerably larger Z. cinereicapillus (Red-billed Tyrannulet), with which it appears to be elevationally parapatric or allopatric.

Adult male A. transitella were irradiated in two separate experiments at 100–300 Gy and 50–175 Gy. Mating frequency, fecundity, and fertility of normal females crossed with irradiated parental males was compared with the mating of nonirradiated moths. Mating frequency was 100% for females crossed with nonirradiated control males. At male treatment doses of ≥150 Gy the percentage of females found unmated increased, while multiple-mated females decreased. Female fecundity was not affected while fertility was affected in a dose-dependent relationship to exposure of parental males to x-ray irradiation. Embryonic development of eggs to the prehatch stage and egg eclosion did not occur at radiation doses ≥125 Gy. Emergence of F1 adults was low and occurred only for progeny of parental males exposed to doses ≤100 Gy, with no emergence at ≥125 Gy. Though fecundity appeared similar for control and irradiated F1 females, no F2 eggs hatched for the test exposures of 50–100 Gy. Based on our results, a dose of ≥125 Gy had efficacy in inducing both primary parental sterility in treated male moths and inherited sterility in F1 male and female moths. Results suggest that A. transitella might be considered a candidate for the sterile insect technique using adults irradiated at these relatively low x-ray exposure doses. 3aAmyelois transitella 3aX-radiation 3aadults 3adose response 3aeclosion 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3afemales 3airradiation 3amale fertility 3amales 3amating frequency 3amoths 3aprogeny 3asterile insect technique1 aOvchinnikova, Inna1 aJackson, Eric S.1 aHaff, Ronald P.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 Oct., v. 108, no. 5 p.2200-2212wJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/616743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov2013Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2200.full_.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245005100169300001600220520103900236592002801275650002401303650001201327650001701339650000901356650002201365650001301387650001901400650001701419650001401436650001301450650003101463650002701494650001201521653002101533653001101554653002901565653002601594653001301620700001301633773010001646856008701746852000901833655001201842IND60610904120221120074715.0190402e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061090412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongxing10aPhysicochemical properties of kiwifruit starch  ap. 129-136.  aThree varieties of golden kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) (Gold3, Gold9 and Hort16A) were collected at the commercial harvesting time, and physicochemical properties of starches from core and outer pericarp were studied. Starch contents (dry weight basis) in outer pericarp and core tissues ranged from 38.6 to 51.8% and 34.6 to 40.7%, respectively. All the kiwifruit starches showed B-type polymorph. Compared to the outer pericarp starches, amylose content and enzyme susceptibility of core starches were higher, and the degree of crystallinity, granule size and gelatinization parameters of core starches were somewhat lower. This suggests different biosynthetic properties between these two starches. The enthalpy changes of gelatinization of outer pericarp starches were high (∼21J/g). Rheological properties of outer pericarp starches were compared with normal maize and potato starches showed high yield stress of flow properties.

One hundred four (13 x 8) samples were drawn at 12− x 12-m grid nodes in each of four depths of a Fine Loamy Typic/Natric Haplustalf. Each sample was a composite of four samples drawn within 1-m area (support) around grid nodes. The coefficient of variation (CV) in different layers varied from 78 to 91 for SAR, 60 to 130 for CaCO3 and 29 to 43% for CO3 + HCO3 ions. Geostatistical analysis of soil heterogeneity revealed that the spatially dependent stochastic component was generally predominant over the nugget effect. Structured variation was modeled into isotropic, positive, and definite spherical functions. In the upper layers, the spatially dependent component (C1) explained most of the variability in SAR and pHs. However, beyond the 60− to 90-cm depth, the unstructured or nugget component also became significant. Distribution of CaCO3 in the 0− to 30-cm depth, however, was almost a random phenomenon. However, below 30-cm depths its distribution was also a spatial stochastic process. For CO3 + HCO3 ions, spatial dependence and nugget variances were almost in equal proportions. Range, i.e., the scale of autorelationship was almost the same in different depths and for most of the properties studied. There was a linear relationship (two-parameter fit) between variance and mean oyer all the depths. Hence, scaled variograms were computed accordingly, and an intrinsic function of variability for the super region of four depths was arrived at. Cross-variability among depths was established by treating them as simultaneous intrinsic random fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3asodic soils 3asoil structure 3asoil analysis 3aphysicochemical properties 3amodels 3avariance 3aautocorrelation 3aIndia1 aSHARMA, K.

Five abundant cyanobacteria were isolated from the rice fields of BDP and maintained in vitro. The characterized isolates resembled Leptolyngbya sp. (isolate LBK), Nostoc spp. (isolates NOC and NOK) and Westiellopsis spp. (isolates WEC and WEK) based on polyphasic taxonomy. All the five isolates were assessed for biotransformation potential of As vis-à-vis adaptability and survivality under different levels of arsenite compared to control set of experiments. Adaptive changes of cyanobacterial photosynthetic pigments in terms of autofluorescence emission along with nitrogenase activity and exopolysaccharide production were measured for all isolates. The inorganic As absorption in terms of bioconcentration factor (BCF) in dry biomass was found to be highest in NOC (0.201–0.220), followed by NOK (0.147–0.150), WEK (0.071–0.074), WEC (0.051) and LBK (0.014) when exposed in presence of higher (200–400 μM) to lower (100 μM) arsenite concentrations respectively for 7 days. The transformation of arsenite to relatively less toxic arsenate was detected in varying efficiency in all the studied isolates. When treated with 100–400 μM arsenite, 9.58–78.4 % arsenate was detected in growth medium whereas 33–100 % in dry biomass of cyanobacterial isolates. The cyanobacterial isolates of this study could be potentially applied to reduce bioavailability of As in rice fields of South Asia based on further field trials, thereby ultimately rendering rice grains safe for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptolyngbya 3aNostoc 3aabsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioavailability 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3aculture media 3aexopolysaccharides 3afield experimentation 3ahealth hazards 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3anitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria 3anitrogenase 3apaddies 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3arice 3astaple foods 3ataxonomy 3atoxicity 3aSouth Asia1 aBhadury, Punyasloke0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2016 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.2777-2792dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-016-0820-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009200207300001600299520130800315592002801623596008901651650003001740650002301770650003501793650002001828650001201848650000901860650002001869650001901889650001701908773012301925856008202048852000902130655001202139IND60630854620221121163413.0190514e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063085462DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-018-1584-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoi, Katsuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4067-858010aInvestigating the Essentiality and Requirements of Iron from the Ancient to the Present  ap. 140-147.  aThis review discusses the development of studies that evaluated the essentiality and requirements of iron from the ancient to the present. The therapeutic effects of iron compounds were recognized by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The earliest recognition of the essentiality of iron was stated by Paracelsus, a distinguished physician alchemist, in the sixteenth century. Iron was included in the earliest nutritional standard prepared for the Royal Army by E. A. Parkes, the first professor of hygiene. The League of Nations Health Organisation determined average iron requirements based on literature review. In the first US Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the RDA of iron was determined from the results of iron balance studies. In the current Dietary Reference Intakes, iron requirements were determined based on the factorial method with the aid of Monte Carlo simulation for combining basal and menstrual iron losses. Population data analysis is a recently developed alternative that does not use the pre-estimated iron absorption rate and requires the prevalence of inadequacy instead. Population data analysis uses the convolution integral for combining basal and menstrual iron losses to ensure the required accuracy. This review also provides new estimates of hair and nail iron losses.  aPublisher supplied data  a17K00877cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI for Scientific Research 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aMonte Carlo method 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3abalance studies 3ahygiene 3airon 3airon absorption 3airon compounds 3atherapeutics0 tBiological trace element research.g2019 Mar., v. 188, no. 1 p.140-147dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-018-1584-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245010900189300001400298520093400312592002801246650001401274650001801288650001701306650001001323650002301333650001201356650001301368650001001381650001901391650002001410650001201430651001401442700001601456773010301472856011701575852000901692655001201701IND60131420320221122062151.0151127e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013142032DNAL7 a10.1676/0043-5643(2001)113[0017:MPAHOT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Robert J.,10aMorphology, plumage, and habitat of the newly described cinnabar hawk-owl from north sulawesi, indonesia  ap. 17-22.  aThe Cinnabar Hawk-Owl (Ninox ios) is a species recently described from a single specimen collected in 1985 from Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. A second bird was trapped on 14 November 1999 in a mist net set in primary forest at 1420 m in Gunung Ambang Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi. Compared to the type specimen it had generally similar plumage and was larger. This second owl was captured on the boundary between an open area of marshland surrounded by hill forest dominated by pioneer species such as Macaranga hispida and Piper aduncum. Both trapped birds, and a recent sight record from Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi, suggest that N. ios is restricted primarily to high elevation forest on Sulawesi. Although the species is currently known from only three sites, the paucity of ornithological research on Sulawesi suggests N. ios may eventually prove to be more widespread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaranga 3aPiper aduncum 3aStrigiformes 3abirds 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahills 3anational parks 3apioneer species 3aplumage 3aIndonesia1 aRiley, Jon,0 tWilson bulletin.g2001 Mar., v. 113, no. 1 p.17-22dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F0043-5643%282001%29113%5B0017%3AMPAHOT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245005200213300001400265520128700279592002801566650001201594650001601606650002001622650001001642650001001652650001201662650002301674650001301697650001101710650001601721650000901737650001401746650002301760650002301783650001601806650001601822650001501838650002001853650001501873650001301888650000901901773012101910856008202031852000902113655001202122IND60630854720221121131430.0190514e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063085472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-018-1583-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaffney-Stomberg, Erin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0241-228214aThe Impact of Trace Minerals on Bone Metabolism  ap. 26-34.  aBone is a metabolically active tissue that responds to alterations in dietary intake and nutritional status. It is ~ 35% protein, mostly collagen which provides an organic scaffolding for bone mineral. The mineral is the remaining ~ 65% of bone tissue and composed mostly of calcium and phosphate in a form that is structurally similar to mineral within the apatite group. The skeletal tissue is constantly undergoing turnover through resorption by osteoclasts coupled with formation by osteoblasts. In this regard, the overall bone balance is determined by the relative contribution of each of these processes. In addition to macro minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium which have well-known roles in bone health, trace elements such as boron, iron, zinc, copper, and selenium also impact bone metabolism. Effects of trace elements on skeletal metabolism and tissue properties may be indirect through regulation of macro mineral metabolism, or direct by affecting osteoblast or osteoclast proliferation or activity, or finally through incorporation into the bone mineral matrix. This review focuses on the skeletal impact of the following trace elements: boron, iron, zinc, copper, and selenium, and overviews the state of the evidence for each of these minerals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abone health 3abone metabolism 3abones 3aboron 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3acopper 3afood intake 3airon 3amagnesium 3amineral metabolism 3anutritional status 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aphosphorus 3aprotein content 3aresorption 3aselenium 3azinc0 tBiological trace element research.g2019 Mar., v. 188, no. 1 p.26-34dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-018-1583-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010000167300001800267520053100285592002800816650001500844650001300859650002900872650003600901650001200937650001100949650001300960650002200973700002400995700002301019700001901042700001901061773011901080856008101199852000901280655001201289IND60557954220221117191232.0161104e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055795422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b016272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhtsuki, Akimichi10aNickel/N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura Type Cross-Coupling of Aryl Carbamates  ap. 9409-9414.  aThe utility of N-heterocyclic carbene ligands in nickel-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl esters and carbamates is investigated.

It causes damage to the thyroid gland of varying severity. As a result of lesions with radioactive iodine, pathological changes develop in the thyroid gland, which can affect the productive indicators and reproduction of farm animals. Physiological changes are also diagnosed in animals that do not receive a sufficient amount of iodine compound with food or water. This can lead to pathology of the thyroid gland. Studies of the pathology of the thyroid gland should be carried out on the basis of structural modeling methods and data obtained experimentally. Analysis of the comparison of pathological effects allows to systematize information and use it in scientific and practical purposes. Depending on the intensity and duration of external and internal radiation exposure in farm animals acute or chronic radiation diseases can be diagnosed. Farm animals with or without signs of radiation disease of mild severity are left in farms and used for its intended purpose. Long-term effects of radiation can be manifested as temporary or permanent sterility, metabolic and endocrine status disorders, immunodeficiency, increased sensitivity to infectious diseases, the emergence of tumors. Monitoring of the radiological situation on the territory of the livestock complex is of particular importance, as its products are transported to different regions. Livestock products must meet regulatory requirements. Timely and full implementation of general and specific rules in the field of radiation safety is aimed at ensuring the safety of animals and preserving the quality of animal products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afarms 3aimmunosuppression 3aiodine 3alivestock 3anuclear power 3aradiation safety 3athyroid gland 0athyroid gland 0aradiating pathology 0afarm animals 0amodeling0 tVestnik Rossijskogo universiteta družby narodov.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.303-316dPeoples’ Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)wJournal:27840x2312-79887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2312-797X-2018-13-4-303-3163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013000173300001600303520069900319592002801018650005001046650001401096650002001110650002301130650002201153650001401175650002601189650001501215650001201230650003701242653001601279653002601295653001201321653002301333653002101356700001901377700002301396700002601419773012701445856005101572852000901623655001201632IND50076490520221117232029.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007649052DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2012.6814862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenigni, Romualdo,10aAssessment and Validation of US EPA's OncoLogic® Expert System and Analysis of Its Modulating Factors for Structural Alerts  ap. 152-173.  aOncoLogic® is a software program able to screen chemical compounds for toxicological effects.

To better understand the strength of the SAR science in OncoLogic®, we investigated the influence of a select group of modulating factors on the predictions by the structural alerts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abioassays 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical compounds 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aenvironmental science 3aprediction 3arodents 3astructure-activity relationships 0acarcinogens 0apredictive toxicology 0apotency 0astructure-activity 0astructural alert1 aBOSSA, CECILIA1 aALIVERNINI, SILVIA1 aCOLAFRANCESCHI, MAURO0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 30, no. 2 p.152-173dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10590501.2012.681486  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013000167300001800297500001100315520090200326592002801228596009201256596009401348596007401442596005601516650002201572650002701594650001201621650001901633650001701652650001101669650001601680650002801696650001701724700001801741700001701759700002601776700002401802700002101826773011401847856008001961852000902041655001202050IND60786868020221121061555.0220806e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078686802DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.130382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Kell K.10aPseudomonas aeruginosa rhamnolipid induces fibrillation of human α‐synuclein and modulates its effect on biofilm formation  ap. 1484-1496.  aLETTER  aThe Parkinson's disease‐associated protein α‐synuclein (αSN) is natively unfolded but its structure can be modulated by membranes and surfactants. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) produces and secretes the biosurfactant rhamnolipid (RL) which modulates bacterial biofilm. Here, we show that monomeric RL enhances the ability of αSN to permeabilize membranes, while micellar RL rapidly induces protein β‐sheet structure with a worm‐like fibrillary appearance, which cannot seed RL‐free fibrillation but transforms into linear fibrils faster than αSN fibrillating on its own. Exposure to αSN reduces the degree of biofilm formation by PA unless RL is present. Our data suggest that RL interactions with αSN may affect both αSN aggregation and cell toxicity, potentially implicating microbiomic metabolites in the origin and propagation of Parkinson's disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a12‐126186cDanish Council for Independent Research|Technology and Production Sciences  a6111‐00241BcDanish Council for Independent Research|Technology and Production Sciences  a12‐127028cDanish Council for Independent Research|Natural Sciences  cParkinson Foreningen (the Danish Parkinson Society) 3aParkinson disease 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiofilm 3abiosurfactants 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aopportunistic pathogens 3arhamnolipids1 aVad, Brian S.1 aKjaer, Lars,1 aTolker‐Nielsen, Tim1 aChristiansen, Gunna1 aOtzen, Daniel E.0 tFEBS letters.g2018 May, v. 592, no. 9 p.1484-1496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.130383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245017700176300001600353520115200369592002801521650001401549650002501563650002401588650001301612650001001625650001401635650001301649650001501662650001801677650002501695650002501720650002301745650002001768650001701788650002301805650002501828650001301853653001301866653002401879653001701903653001301920700001701933773010001950856008702050852000902137655001202146IND60610904420221120054736.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061090442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonuk Takma, Dilara10aImpact of preharvest and postharvest alginate treatments enriched with vanillin on postharvest decay, biochemical properties, quality and sensory attributes of table grapes  ap. 187-195.  aAlginate solution enriched with vanillin as a bioactive compound was investigated for improving preharvest and postharvest quality and safety of table grapes. Alginate treatments with or without vanillin as preharvest spray and postharvest coating were implemented on table grapes of Alphonse Lavalleé and Razaki cultivars. Fungal decay, biochemical properties, quality and sensory attributes were evaluated at day of preharvest treatment, at harvesting and during 35days of storage at 4±2°C. Alginate treatments with or without vanillin were effective in preventing weight and firmness losses. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and color of grapes coated with alginate coatings with or without vanillin showed minor changes compared to control grapes. Alginate coating incorporating vanillin provided significant reduction (1.73log CFU/g) in yeast-mold growth. Moreover, the coatings maintained greater total phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to others during postharvest storage. In terms of sensory attributes, appearance was ranked as the highest for alginate coating without vanillin due to glossiness of alginate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acoatings 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aharvesting 3amolds (fungi) 3apostharvest diseases 3apreharvest treatment 3asensory properties 3astorage quality 3atable grapes 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3avanillin 0aAlginate 0aPostharvest quality 0aTable grapes 0aVanillin1 aKorel, Figen0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.187-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.1953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009300210300001800303520197400321592002802295650001402323650002002337650001902357650002702376650001002403650001802413650002002431650002302451650001102474650002502485650001602510650001302526651001202539651001202551651001202563651001202575651001602587651001002603651002802613653007202641700002202713700002502735700001802760700002102778700001902799700001602818700005402834700005702888700001602945700001702961700001702978700002002995700001803015700005203033700002703085773009903112856008603211852000903297655001203306IND60753336620221119060516.0211029e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075333662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerberk, J.D.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2148-593510aImpact analysis of rotavirus vaccination in various geographic regions in Western Europe  ap. 6671-6681.  aUniversal mass vaccination (UMV) against rotavirus has been implemented in many but not all European countries. This study investigated the impact of UMV on rotavirus incidence trends by comparing European countries with UMV: Belgium, England/Wales and Germany versus countries without UMV: Denmark and the Netherlands.For this observational retrospective cohort study, time series data (2001–2016) on rotavirus detections, meteorological factors and population demographics were collected. For each country, several meteorological and population factors were investigated as possible predictors of rotavirus incidence. The final set of predictors were incorporated in negative binomial models accounting for seasonality and serial autocorrelation, and time-varying incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for each age group and country separately. The overall vaccination impact two years after vaccine implementation was estimated by pooling the results using a random effects meta-analyses. Independent t-tests were used to compare annual epidemics in the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination era to explore any changes in the timing of rotavirus epidemics.The population size and several meteorological factors were predictors for the rotavirus epidemiology. Overall, we estimated a 42% (95%-CI 23;56%) reduction in rotavirus incidence attributable to UMV. Strongest reductions were observed for age-groups 0-, 1- and 2-years (IRR 0.47, 0.48 and 0.63, respectively). No herd effect induced by UMV in neighbouring countries was observed. In all UMV countries, the start and/or stop and corresponding peak of the rotavirus season was delayed by 4–7 weeks.The introduction of rotavirus UMV resulted in an overall reduction of 42% in rotavirus incidence in Western European countries two years after vaccine introduction and caused a change in seasonal pattern. No herd effect induced by UMV neighbouring countries was observed for Denmark and the Netherlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aautocorrelation 3acohort studies 3ademographic statistics 3aherds 3ameta-analysis 3apopulation size 3aseasonal variation 3at-test 3atime series analysis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aBelgium 3aDenmark 3aEngland 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aWales 3aWestern European region 0aGastroenteritis Rotavirus Vaccines Children Diarrhoea Europe Impact1 avan Dongen, J.A.P1 avan de Kassteele, J.1 aAndrews, N.J.1 avan Gaalen, R.D.1 aHahné, S.J.M.1 aVennema, H.1 aRamsay, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7156-76401 aBraeckman, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2458-383X1 aLadhani, S.1 aThomas, S.L.1 aWalker, J.L.1 ade Melker, H.E.1 aFischer, T.K.1 aKoch, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8478-85811 aBruijning-Verhagen, P.0 tVaccine.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 39, no. 45 p.6671-6681dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014100163520159200304592002801896650001901924650001501943650001701958650002401975650002601999650002602025650001802051650001502069650002102084650001802105650001302123650001302136650001002149653001802159653004102177653001502218653003802233653001302271700001902284700001502303700001702318700001702335700001802352700001702370773009702387856008502484852000902569655001202578IND60778699720221122072611.0220621e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077869972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aResponses of anaerobic hydrogen-producing granules to acute microplastics exposure during biological hydrogen production from wastewater  aAnaerobic hydrogen-producing granule (AHPG) has been successfully applied in hydrogen production from wastewater. While various types of microplastics in large amounts are readily detected in both municipal and industrial wastewaters, however, to date the response of AHPG to multiple coexisting microplastics in wastewater is unknown yet. Herein, this study provided a first insight into the acute exposure-response relationship between multiple coexisting microplastics and the AHPG during biological hydrogen production from wastewater. Fluorescence tagging found that many microplastics accumulated and covered on the surface of the whole granule. Morphology and particle size of microplastics-bearing AHPG were characterized by microscopic observation, showing that the shock load of microplastics in the wastewater at the studied concentrations (40 and 80 mg/L) made the granule loose and even break down with the decreased particle size. The visualization of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure revealed that microplastics decreased EPS production by 8.8–16.7%. Microbial community analysis demonstrated that the acute exposure of microplastics did not drive the change in the microbial community diversity and composition. However, toxic leachates and upgraded oxidative stress induced by microplastics increased cell death up to 14.7% and decreased hydrogen production by 18.7%, when the AHPG exposed to 80 mg/L of microplastics. This work gained a new insight into the response of anaerobic microorganisms to coexisting microplastics in the real environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3acell death 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen production 3aindustrial wastewater 3amicrobial communities 3amicroplastics 3amicroscopy 3aoxidative stress 3aparticle size 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3awater 0aMicroplastics 0aAnaerobic hydrogen-producing granule 0aWastewater 0aExtracellular polymeric substance 0aToxicity1 aZhang, Yu-Ting1 aWang, Chen1 aGuo, Wenshan1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aChen, Xueming1 aNi, Bing-Jie0 tWater research.g2022 July 15, v. 220 p.118680-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1186803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245010200137300001300239506002800252520115600280592002801436506003701464650001201501650002801513650002201541650001001563650001601573650001901589650002301608650001401631650001101645650001801656650001601674650001501690653001601705653002301721653002701744653001601771700001501787773017901802852000901981655001201990IND60774984620221207081411.0080825e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077498462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁGOSTON-SZABÓ,  E.10aChanges in sediment and sediment interstitial water characteristics in Lake Fertő/Neusiedler See  ap. 3-17.  aResource is Open Access  aChanges in the C, S, N, P concentrations, organic matter content and electron transport system activity (ETS) of the sediment and in the NO2-, NO3-, PO43- SO42-, NH4+ concentrations of water and sediment interstitial water were studied in the Hungarian part of Lake Fertõ/Neusiedler See during the vegetation period. Sediment samples were collected in healthy and die-back reed stands and in the open water area from the 0-5 cm sediment layers. Organic matter content, C, N, S, P concentrations and ETS-activity were significantly higher in the sediment of the degraded reed stand. Higher electrical conductivity and SO42- concentration were found in the second part of the vegetation period, when the water level was lower. The seasonal variation in PO43- and NO3- concentrations of the surface water showed an antagonistic pattern. Higher PO43-and NH4+ concentrations were measured in the sediment interstitial water in summer, when the temperature and the decrease in SO42- concentration, which indicate the SO42- reduction processes, were greater. The higher ETS-activity values in September were probably due to the decaying mass of macrophytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adieback 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aorganic matter 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3avegetation 0aLake Fertő 0aion concentrations 0aorganic matter content 0amacrophytes1 aDINKA,  M.0 tOpuscula zoologica Instituti Zoosystematici et Oecologici Universitatis Budapestinensis.g2006 Dec., v. 35 p.3-17dEötvös Loránd UniversitywJournal:28187x2063-15887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014300166300001600309520164900325592002801974650002802002650002102030650002302051650001502074650001302089650001802102650000702120650001302127650002502140650001502165650002702180650001402207650001002221650002002231650001902251650002302270650001302293650001902306650002402325650001202349650002302361650001202384651001302396700001802409700002502427700001702452773009202469856008102561852000902642655001202651IND60519307220221119151549.0160426e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051930722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-015-9419-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano, J. M.10aMonitoring of soil organic carbon over 10 years in a Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system: potential evaluation for differential management  ap. 274-295.  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in determining the susceptibility to land degradation. The recommended procedure for the recovery of the characteristic poor soils of the Southern region of Portugal is the installation of grazed permanent pastures and increase of soil fertility. The objectives of this study were: (i) to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of soil nutrients at four points in time over a 10-year period in a perennial pastureland; (ii) to test new tools for survey of the spatial variability of soil nutrients; (iii) to evaluate the potential for differential organic management. A 6 ha permanent bio-diverse pasture field, grazed by sheep and improved by annual application of super phosphate fertilizer, was installed on a shallow soil in Mediterranean conditions. Spatial variability and temporal stability of topsoil macronutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium), SOC and pH were measured. The results indicate that SOC and pH have great potential for implementing differential management. In the case of SOC, the management classes map shows that over 80 % of the area has temporal stability, while more than 50 % of the area has low levels of SOC (<10 g kg⁻¹), justifying the potential for differential application of C-rich organic soil amendments. The geospatial measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECₐ) and NDVI index showed significant correlation between these parameters and soil properties, revealing the potential of these tools for producing detailed soil maps, decisive for understanding the changes in soil properties under sustainable management systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aland degradation 3amanagement systems 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aorganic soils 3apH 3apastures 3apermanent grasslands 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium 3asheep 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil map 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3atopsoil 3aPortugal1 aShahidian, S.1 ada Silva, J.

Dietary quality is an important factor to prevent many disorders. This study sought to determine any association between AGEs and diet quality.The participants were 90 healthy adults, aged higher than 20 years. Dietary intake of individuals was collected using two 24-h dietary recalls and quality of diets were determined by dietary quality index-International (DQI-I). Serum levels of pentosidine and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) were examined by ELISA.Total DQI-I score was 62.3 ± 1.3. Variety, adequacy, moderation, and the overall balance of diet scores in the study participants were 16.5 ± 0.4, 25.8 ± 0.5, 17.7 ± 0.9, and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively. Participants with higher age (>40 years), higher education level, moderate calorie intake and married had significantly greater DQI-I score. Diet quality was positively associated with participants' education level (r = 0.28, p = 0.008). DQI-I score negatively correlated with serum levels of CML and pentosidine (r = −0.42, P < 0.001 and r = −0.35, P < 0.001, respectively).Dietary modification may be beneficial for controlling AGE accumulation in the body and subsequently in reduction of chronic diseases risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadvanced glycation end products 3ablood serum 3achronic diseases 3adiet recall 3aeducational status 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afoods 3aglycation 3ahigher education 3ahumans 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3apentosidine 3arisk reduction 3atobacco 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aDiet 0aDietary quality 0aFood 0aAGEs 0aCML 0aDQI-I 0aBMI 0aWC 0aWHR1 aAlizadeh, Mohammad1 aKheirouri, Sorayya0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Apr., v. 36 p.111-115dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245010200210300001600312506007600328520176200404592002802166506003702194650000802231650001202239650001302251650002102264650002402285650001402309650001602323650001602339650001102355650001402366650001402380650001502394650002202409650002502431650001802456650001602474650000902490650001002499700001902509700002202528700001802550700002902568700002002597700002402617700001902641700001902660700002002679700001902699700001702718773010402735856008502839852000902924655001202933IND60609238320221207120251.0181207e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060923832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.0042doi7 aPMC55544592pmcid7 a286929282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShih, Yu-Hsuan10aAssociations between prenatal arsenic exposure with adverse pregnancy outcome and child mortality  ap. 456-461.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChronic arsenic exposure is a public health concern in many parts of the world, with elevated concentrations in groundwater posing a threat to millions of people. Arsenic is associated with various cancers and an array of chronic diseases; however, the relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes and child mortality is less established.We evaluated associations between individual-level prenatal arsenic exposure with adverse pregnancy outcomes and child mortality in a pregnancy study among 498 women nested in a larger population-based cohort in rural Bangladesh.Creatinine-adjusted urinary total arsenic concentration, a comprehensive measure of exposure from water, food, and air sources, reflective of the prenatal period was available for participants. Self-reported pregnancy outcomes (livebirth, stillbirth, spontaneous/elective abortion) were ascertained. Generalized estimating equations, accounting for multiple pregnancies of participants, were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Vital status of livebirths was subsequently ascertained through November 2015. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals in relation to child mortality.We observed a significant association between prenatal arsenic exposure and the risk of stillbirth (greater than median; adjusted OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.04, 6.01). We also observed elevated risk of child mortality (greater than median; adjusted HR = 1.92; 95% CI = 0.78, 4.68) in relation to prenatal arsenic exposure.Prospective studies should continue to evaluate prenatal and early life health effects of arsenic exposure and arsenic remediation strategies for women of child-bearing age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aarsenic 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3aconfidence interval 3aequations 3afetal death 3agroundwater 3amodels 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy outcome 3aprenatal development 3apublic health 3aremediation 3arisk 3awomen1 aIslam, Tariqul1 aHore, Samar Kumar1 aSarwar, Golam1 aShahriar, Mohammad Hasan1 aYunus, Mohammad1 aGraziano, Joseph H.1 aHarjes, Judith1 aBaron, John A.1 aParvez, Faruque1 aAhsan, Habibul1 aArgos, Maria0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 Oct., v. 158 p.456-461dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00921naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245005800161300001600219520010600235592002800341650002300369650002300392650001300415700002100428773012500449856007200574852000900646655001200655IND60657496320221120061207.0190816e20040407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749632DNAL7 a10.1039/b316498e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDueno, Eric Efrain10aIntramolecular inclusion in novel octaester cavitands  ap. 954-955.  aNovel octaester cavitands show intramolecular inclusion of ester moieties within the cavitand cavity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3amoieties1 aBisht, Kirpal S.0 tChemical communications.g2004 Apr. 7, , no. 8 p.954-955dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b316498e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012400212300001600336520138500352592002801737650001301765650001701778650003701795650002101832650001001853650002201863650001101885650001601896653001901912653003701931653001301968653000801981653000801989653000701997653001002004653001102014700005402025700001902079700002202098700001902120700002402139773016002163856008502323852000902408655001202417IND60682471120221120045704.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068247112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagayama, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9040-765010aBone mineral density in male weight-classified athletes is higher than that in male endurance-athletes and non-athletes  ap. 106-110.  aWeight-bearing physical activity and intense mechanical stimuli affect the bone through the endocrine system; hence, bone-loading sports affect bone mineral density. We hypothesized that weight-classified athletes, such as those practicing wrestling and judo, have relatively high bone mineral density because these activities have a higher impact on the entire body during daily training compared to low- or non-impact activities. We aimed to investigate the bone mineral density of weight-classified athletes (participating in wrestling and judo) to compare the parameters with those of endurance-athletes and non-athletes.Thirty-three college athletes (aged 18–22 years) were divided into three groups, wrestlers, judoka, and endurance-athletes, according to their sports history. Eight non-athletes participated as controls. Bone mineral density was determined by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.Mean whole-body bone mineral density of wrestlers and judoka was higher than that of endurance-athletes and non-athletes (P < 0.01). The bone mineral density of athletes competing in wrestling and judo was higher than that of non-athletes when adjusted for body mass.The present study demonstrated that weight-classified athletes have significantly higher bone mineral density compared to endurance- and non-athletes, despite rapid weight loss before competitions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3abone density 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aendocrine system 3amales 3aphysical activity 3asports 3aweight loss 0aWeight-cycling 0aDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 0aAthletes 0aBMD 0aDXA 0aSD 0aANOVA 0aANCOVA1 aKondo, Emi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9145-05491 aTanabe, Yōko,1 aOhnishi, Takahiro1 aYamada, Yosuke1 aTakahashi, Hideyuki0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Apr., v. 36 p.106-110dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03913naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009400167300001500261520261600276592002802892650001902920650001202939650001202951650001302963650001502976650001402991650001903005650001503024650002103039650001503060650001003075650001303085650001503098650001403113650002203127650002203149650001603171650001803187650001303205651001203218700002303230700002203253773009903275856004803374852000903422655001203431IND50062250920221120071741.0130321e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006225092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-011-9556-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWachnicka, Anna10aResponse of diatom assemblages to 130 years of environmental change in Florida Bay (USA)  ap. 83-101.  aCoastal ecosystems around the world are constantly changing in response to interacting shifts in climate and land and water use by expanding human populations. The development of agricultural and urban areas in South Florida significantly modified its hydrologic regime and influenced rates of environmental change in wetlands and adjacent estuaries. This study describes changes in diatom species composition through time from four sediment cores collected across Florida Bay, for the purposes of detecting periods of major shifts in assemblage structure and identifying major drivers of those changes. We examined the magnitude of diatom assemblage change in consecutive 2-cm samples of the ²¹⁰Pb-dated cores, producing a record of the past ~130 years. Average assemblage dissimilarity among successive core samples was ~30%, while larger inter-sample and persistent differences suggest perturbations or directional shifts. The earliest significant compositional changes occurred in the late 1800s at Russell Bank, Bob Allen Bank and Ninemile Bank in the central and southwestern Bay, and in the early 1900s at Trout Cove in the northeast. These changes coincided with the initial westward redirection of water from Lake Okeechobee between 1881 and 1894, construction of several canals between 1910 and 1915, and building the Florida Overseas Railroad between 1906 and 1916. Later significant assemblage restructurings occurred in the northeastern and central Bay in the late 1950s, early 1960s and early 1970s, and in the southwestern Bay in the 1980s. These changes coincide with climate cycles driving increased hurricane frequency in the 1960s, followed by a prolonged dry period in the 1970s to late 1980s that exacerbated the effects of drainage operations in the Everglades interior. Changes in the diatom assemblage structure at Trout Cove and Ninemile Bank in the 1980s correspond to documented eutrophication and a large seagrass die-off. A gradual decrease in the abundance of freshwater to brackish water taxa in the cores over ~130 years implies that freshwater deliveries to Florida Bay were much greater prior to major developments on the mainland. Salinity, which was quantitatively reconstructed at these sites, had the greatest effect on diatom communities in Florida Bay, but other factors—often short-lived, natural and anthropogenic in nature—also played important roles in that process. Studying the changes in subfossil diatom communities over time revealed important environmental information that would have been undetected if reconstructing only one water quality variable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3aclimate 3adie-off 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3ahuman population 3ahurricanes 3alakes 3asalinity 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aFlorida1 aCollins, Laurel S.1 aGaiser, Evelyn E.0 tJournal of paleolimnology.g2013 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.83-101dSpringer-Verlagx0921-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9556-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001400264520200500278592002802283650002002311650001902331650002002350650001902370650001602389650002102405650001702426650001002443650002202453650001902475650001602494650001302510650001902523650001702542650002302559650001002582650002202592650002002614650002402634650000902658653003102667653001002698653002002708653001602728700001702744700001202761700002002773700002102793700001202814700001902826700001902845700002302864700001602887700002602903700002002929773011702949856008403066852000903150655001203159IND60609238520221121004137.0180822e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060923852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2016.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Liqiong10aEffects of environmental noise exposure on DNA methylation in the brain and metabolic health  ap. 73-82.  aEnvironmental noise exposure is associated with adverse effects on human health including hearing loss, heart disease, and changes in stress-related hormone levels. Alteration in DNA methylation in response to environmental exposures is a well-known phenomenon and it is implicated in many human diseases. Understanding how environmental noise exposures affect DNA methylation patterns may help to elucidate the link between noise and adverse effects on health. In this pilot study we examined the effects of environmental noise exposure on DNA methylation of genes related to brain function and investigated whether these changes are related with metabolic health. We exposed four groups of male Wistar rats to moderate intensity noise (70–75dB with 20–4000Hz) at night for three days as short-term exposure, and for three weeks as long-term exposure. Noise exposure was limited to 45dB during the daytime. Control groups were exposed to only 45dB, day and night. We measured DNA methylation in the Bdnf, Comt, Crhr1, Mc2r, and Snca genes in tissue from four brain regions of the rats (hippocampus, frontal lobe, medulla oblongata, and inferior colliculus). Further, we measured blood pressure and body weight after long-term noise exposure. We found that environmental noise exposure is associated with gene-specific DNA methylation changes in specific regions of the brain. Changes in DNA methylation are significantly associated with changes in body weight (between Bdnf DNA methylation and Δ body weight: r=0.59, p=0.018; and between LINE-1 ORF DNA methylation and Δ body weight: =−0.80, p=0.0004). We also observed that noise exposure decreased blood pressure (p=0.038 for SBP, p=0.017 for DBP and p 0. 017 for MAP) and decreased body weight (β=−26g, p=0.008). In conclusion, environmental noise exposures can induce changes in DNA methylation in the brain, which may be associated with adverse effects upon metabolic health through modulation of response to stress-related hormones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aacute exposure 3aadverse effects 3ablood pressure 3abody weight 3achronic exposure 3afrontal lobe 3agenes 3ahearing disorders 3aheart diseases 3ahippocampus 3ahormones 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman health 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amedulla oblongata 3anoise pollution 3aopen reading frames 3arats 0aEnvironmental noise stress 0aBrain 0aDNA methylation 0aEpigenetics1 aLi, Peng-hui1 aLi, Hua1 aColicino, Elena1 aColicino, Silvia1 aWen, Yi1 aZhang, Ruiping1 aFeng, Xiaotian1 aBarrow, Timothy M.1 aCayir, Akin1 aBaccarelli, Andrea A.1 aByun, Hyang-Min0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 Feb., v. 153 p.73-82dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001200251520124600263592002801509650000801537650002001545650001001565650001901575650001001594650002901604650001301633650001401646650002601660650002201686700002101708773011101729856008101840852000901921655001201930IND60120127320221118034447.0150216e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012012732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-015-0210-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldo, Amy R.10aGene targeting and editing in crop plants: a new era of precision opportunities  ap. 210.  aWith increasing global food demands in the face of challenging biotic and abiotic pressures on crop production, there is a vital need for good crop improvement strategies. Gene editing and gene targeting using designer nucleases are relatively new, sophisticated approaches that can be used for crop improvement. Designer nucleases are molecules that can be engineered to cleave virtually any endogenous DNA target sequence, making this technology inherently more powerful over current, essentially random mutation strategies. These molecules can also be used to promote targeted DNA insertions and homologous recombination. Further modifications of these molecules can convert them into designer transcription factors that can activate or suppress a gene of choice. Four designer nuclease platforms are currently available: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and the more recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 system. All four of these systems have been shown to function in crop plants and have been used for site-specific gene targeting and gene editing. Herein, we describe the basis of each designer nuclease platform, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each, and give examples of their application in crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acrop production 3acrops 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3amutation 3anucleases 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aAyliffe, Michael0 tMolecular breeding.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.210-210dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-015-0210-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014300162300001600305520145100321592002801772650001801800650001501818650001601833650002001849650003101869650001001900650001201910650001801922650001101940650001201951650001101963650002101974650002301995650002702018650001402045650003002059650001202089650001202101650002902113700001902142700001802161773012202179856007402301852000902375655001202384IND60639871220221120191931.0190503e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063987122DNAL7 a10.1039/c6fo01473a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynés, Bàrbara10aGene expression modulation of lipid and central energetic metabolism related genes by high-fat diet intake in the main homeostatic tissues  ap. 629-650.  aIt is generally assumed that high-fat (HF) diets induce characteristic gene expression regulation, which may cause metabolic alterations associated with an increased risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and other health alterations. However, an integrative analysis of the effects in different tissues is lacking, thus preventing new strategies to prevent or counteract permanent consequences. This review particularly focuses on lipid metabolism gene expression modulation in key homeostatic tissues in response to HF diet intake. The effects of HF diets on gene expression are mediated by insulin, leptin and nutrients such as fatty acids (FA) and glucose that alter insulin signalling. As a general trend, HF diet feeding induces the expression of catabolism related genes and reduces the expression of lipogenic related genes in the main homeostatic tissues. However, the effects of HF diets on gene expression depend on the amount and composition of fat, and there are specific effects in different animal models. From another angle, delayed effects associated with long-lasting changes caused by metabolic imprinting are of increasing interest. Finally, when considering the need for biomarkers of early metabolic effects, it is noticeable that many transcriptional adaptations that occur in tissues are reflected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which offers the possibility of using these minimally invasive samples in human studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aleptin 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolic syndrome 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anutrients 3anutrition risk assessment 3aobesity 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPalou, Mariona1 aPalou, Andreu0 tFood & function.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 8, no. 2 p.629-650dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6fo01473a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010800172300001800280500001500298520092600313592002801239650001401267650000901281650001301290650002101303650002101324650002401345650001101369650001201380650003001392650001501422650001601437650001101453650001001464650002301474650000901497650001101506650001401517650001301531650000701544650001101551653002101562653001001583653001701593653001501610700001701625700001801642700001901660773011601679856008601795852000901881655001201890IND60088018720221122000317.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008801872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.11.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao-ming,10aExpression of an exoinulinase gene from Aspergillus ficuum in Escherichia coli and its characterization  ap. 1984-1990.  a2019-12-06  aAn exoinulinase gene from Aspergillus ficuum JNSP5-06 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Two exons of the exoinulinase gene were amplified separately, joined together by an overlap PCR, and expressed in E. coli. The molecular weight of the recombinant exoinulinase was estimated to be 63kDa. The Km and Vmax values for inulin were (7.1±0.2)mM and (1000.0±0.1)μmol/(minmgprotein), respectively.

In tropical reef ecosystems, grazing by herbivorous fishes can prevent coral–macroalgal phase shifts that commonly signal loss of resilience. However, knowledge of grazing characteristics that most promote resilience is typically experimental, localized, and sparse, which limits broad management applications. Applying sound ecological theory to broad‐scale data may provide an alternative basis for ecosystem management. We explore the idea that resilience is positively related to the diversity within and among functional groups of organisms. Specifically, we infer the relative vulnerability of different subregions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to phase shifts based on functional characteristics of the local herbivorous fish communities. Reef slopes on 92 reefs set in three zones of the continental shelf in eight latitudinal sectors of the GBR were surveyed on multiple occasions between 1995 and 2009. Spatial variation in fish community structure was high and driven primarily by shelf position. Measures of functional diversity, functional redundancy, and abundance were generally higher offshore and lower inshore. Two turbid inshore subregions were considered most vulnerable based on very low measures of herbivore function, and this was supported by the occurrence of phase shifts within one of three subregions. Eleven reefs that resisted phase shifts after major coral mortality included some with very low measures of herbivore function. The fact that phase shifts did not necessarily occur when large herbivores were scarce indicates that other environmental factors compensated to preserve resilience. Estimates of vulnerability based solely on herbivore function may thus prove conservative, but caution is appropriate, since compensatory factors are largely unknown and could be eroded unwittingly by anthropogenic stresses. Our data suggest that managing the threat of phase shifts in coral reef ecosystems successfully will require spatially explicit strategies that consider both the functional characteristics of local herbivore communities and environmental factors that may raise or lower resilience thresholds. A strong positive correlation between water clarity and the species richness and abundance of herbivorous fishes suggests that management of water quality is of generic importance to ensure the ecosystem services of this important group of herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acommunity structure 3acontinental shelf 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish communities 3afunctional diversity 3afunctional properties 3agrazing 3aherbivorous fish 3amoieties 3amortality 3aspecies diversity 3awater quality 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aEmslie, Michael1 aMacNeil, M.

In particular, several studies have provided evidence that TCDD decreases resistance to numerous viruses. Indeed, in vivo and in vitro investigations showed that the presence of TCDD is able to interfere with the replication of both human and animal viruses, such as influenza A viruses, coxsackie virus B3, immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex II, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Moreover, TCDD could induce an exacerbation of latent infection produced by HIV-1, CMV or Epstein-Barr virus. In this review, we first describe the general effects of TCDD exposure on mammalian cells, then we focus on its influence on the viral infections. Overall, the available data support the concept that TCDD exposure may act as an additional risk factor in promoting of viral diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3acarrier state 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aimmunosuppression 3aInfluenza A virus 3aCytomegalovirus 3arisk factors 3aanimal viruses 3aviruses 3aimmune response 3atoxicity 3aherpes simplex 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 0aHuman herpesvirus 4 0aTCDD 0a2 0aBHV-1 0aNK cells 0aHSV-II 0aCB3 0aMDBK cells 0aViruses 0aCMV 0abICP0 0aAhR 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aHIV-11 aSantamaria, Rita1 aIrace, Carlo1 aDe Martino, Luisa1 aIovane, Giuseppe0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 Feb., v. 153 p.27-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01109naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012200158300001600280520019900296592002800495650002300523650001700546650002200563700002300585700001500608773012600623856007300749852000900822655001200831IND60657496620221120061223.0190816e20040325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749662DNAL7 a10.1039/b316554j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmstrong, Alan10aAminative rearrangement of 2-alkoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrans: a novel stereocontrolled route to substituted pyrrolidines  ap. 812-813.  aAziridination of 2-alkoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrans leads to rearrangement and stereocontrolled formation of 5-alkoxypyrrolidines which may be reduced to pyrrolidines or allylated stereoselectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3apyrrolidines 3astereoselectivity1 aCumming, Graham R.1 aPike, Kurt0 tChemical communications.g2004 Mar. 25, , no. 7 p.812-813dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b316554j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010300172300001600275520171300291592002802004650001502032650002402047650001902071650001602090650002602106650001302132650000902145650002202154650002402176650001202200650001902212650002202231650002202253650001402275650001302289650001402302651001102316651002802327653001802355653001402373653002502387653001502412653001802427653001702445653002502462700002302487700002202510700001802532700002102550700001802571700002802589700001702617773011702634856008502751852000902836655001202845IND60573027220221120230301.0190403e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057302722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernard, Marianne10aDeer browsing promotes Norway spruce at the expense of silver fir in the forest regeneration phase  ap. 269-277.  aDeer populations have dramatically increased over the last decades in Western Europe and their browsing has affected forest vegetation, especially plant community composition. High deer browsing pressure may threaten forest ecosystems and needs to be assessed over the long run. However, few studies to date have addressed the long-term impact of deer on forest regeneration.During one regeneration phase, we assessed the impact of deer (Cervus elaphus L. and Capreolus capreolus L.) browsing on mixed silver fir (Abies alba Mill.)/Norway spruce (Picea abies L. H. Karst.) stands in the Vosges Mountains in North-eastern France. For both tree species, we measured seedling and sapling density, height and diameter in 28 paired fenced – unfenced plots distributed over two sites that had been fenced 27years ago, for 10 and 23years respectively.We demonstrated that the presence of deer decreased the density, height and diameter of silver fir saplings, while it increased the height of Norway spruce saplings. We also noticed that the effect of fencing was very different depending on fencing duration, and that even 10years of fencing led to changes that were still visible 17years later.Our results confirm that deer browsing has a long-term impact on the regeneration of silver fir. Furthermore, they suggest that deer browsing may cause a species substitution, with Norway spruce gradually replacing silver fir. Such a trend would have an impact on the ecological and economical value of these forests. How browsing impacts the forest’s ability to adapt to global warming should also be considered, since browsing might impede the implementation of management policies designed to address this issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCervus elaphus 3aPicea abies 3abotanical composition 3abrowsing 3adeer 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aissues and policy 3along term effects 3amountains 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3aFrance 3aWestern European region 0aDeer browsing 0aEnclosure 0aLong-term experiment 0aSilver fir 0aNorway spruce 0aRegeneration 0aSpecies substitution1 aBoulanger, Vincent1 aDupouey, Jean-Luc1 aLaurent, Lisa1 aMontpied, Pierre1 aMorin, Xavier1 aPicard, Jean-François,1 aSaïd, Sonia0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 400 p.269-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011900204520102700323592002801350650002801378650001801406650002201424650002301446650001901469650001301488650001901501650003201520650002101552650001501573653003101588653001401619653002001633653001201653653002301665700001801688700002001706773012201726856008101848852000901929655001201938IND60752223320221119165324.0211206e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075222332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1125402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSallan, Selen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9806-693714aThe effects of nitrite, sodium ascorbate and starter culture on volatile compounds of a semi-dry fermented sausage  aThis study investigated the effects of nitrite level (0, 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg), sodium ascorbate (with or without) and starter culture (Lactobacillus plantarum GM77 + Staphlyococcus xylosus GM92 or without starter culture) on the volatile compounds of heat-treated sucuk, a type of semi-dry fermented sausage.

Starter culture addition reduced the hexanal level. The starter culture also resulted in a decrease in diallyl disulfide in heat-treated sucuk. The use of sodium ascorbate lowered the 2- pentyl-furan, butanoic acid and propanoic acid level.

To understand various and unusual telomere formation in insects, we have studied the characteristic features of a putative insect telomerase that has not been previously described. Using a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), we first detected the telomerase activity in crickets, cockroaches and two Lepidopteran insects. The telomerase from crickets and cockroaches required dATP, dGTP and dTTP but not dCTP as a substrate and sequence analyses of the products of TRAP revealed that the (TTAGG)n repeats are synthesized by telomerase. The cockroach telomerase was detected both in somatic (fat body, muscle and neural tissues) and germ line (testis) cells, suggesting that expression of this enzyme is not regulated in a tissueâspecific manner at an adult stage. While we detected high levels of telomerase activity in crickets and cockroaches, we could not detect activity in all tissues and cell cultures of the silkworm, Bombyx mori and in two Drosophila and one Sarcophaga cell lines. This supports the theory that Dipteran insects maintain their telomeres without telomerase.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aOrthoptera 3agerm cells 3atelomeres 3amuscles 3acell culture 3asilkworms 3afat body 3aadults 3aBombyx mori 3atelomerase 3atestes 3aSarcophaga 3aDrosophila 3aBlattodea 0aBlattaria1 aFujiwara, Haruhiko0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 May, v. 267, no. 10 p.3025-3031dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2000.01323.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245012100201300002000322500001900342520127800361592002801639650002201667650001501689650001301704650001601717650001801733650000701751650001801758650001501776650002001791650001701811650001501828700006501843700006601908773014201974856007902116852000902195655001202204IND60707319920210804000000.0200819e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070731992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c029592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gongde1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7725-169810aRole of Carbonate in Thermodynamic Relationships Describing Pollutant Reduction Kinetics by Iron Oxide-Bound Fe²⁺  ap. 10109-10117.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe reduction of environmental pollutants by Fe²⁺ bound to iron oxides is an important process that determines pollutant toxicities and mobilities. Recently, we showed that pollutant reduction rates depend on the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction in a linear free energy relationship that was a function of the solution pH value and the reduction potential, EH, of the interfacial Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ redox couple. In this work, we studied how carbonate affected the free energy relationship by examining the effect that carbonate has on nitrobenzene reduction rates by Fe²⁺ bound to goethite (α-FeOOH). Carbonate slowed nitrobenzene reduction rates by inducing goethite particle aggregation, as evidenced by surface charge and particle size measurements. We observed no evidence for carbonate affecting Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ reduction potentials or the mechanism of nitrobenzene reduction. The linear free energy relationship accurately described the data collected in the presence of carbonate when we accounted for the effect it had on the reactive surface area of goethite. The findings from this work provide a framework for determining why common groundwater constituents affect the EH-dependence of reaction rates involving oxide-bound Fe²⁺ as a reductant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acarbonates 3agoethite 3agroundwater 3anitrobenzenes 3apH 3aparticle size 3apollutants 3areducing agents 3asurface area 3atechnology1 aHofstetter, Thomas B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1906-367X1 aGorski, Christopher A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5363-29040 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 July 15, v. 54, no. 16 p.10109-10117dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c029593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014600178300001600324520137600340592002801716650001801744650001301762650001801775650001801793650000901811650001401820650001401834650001801848651001101866653001301877653001701890653001201907653002001919653002201939653001001961653001001971653001601981653001301997700002002010773011702030856008502147852000902232655001202241IND60573027420221120230256.0190403e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057302742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPréfontaine, Gabrielle10aVariation in stand density, black spruce individual growth and plant community following 20years of drainage in post-harvest boreal peatlands  ap. 321-331.  aDrainage can help restore hydrological conditions conducive to the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) seedlings on logged forested peatlands. The impact of drainage was assessed by analysing the variation in stand density at stump height, black spruce seedling annual diameter growth and composition of plant communities on 20 of the oldest operationally drained sites in Quebec’s James Bay region. These sites, each consisting of a drained, post-harvest area and a corresponding undrained, post-harvest control area, were classified into five ecosites based on soil characteristics and plant communities. The ecosites studied varied from those with rich mineral soils covered with a shallow organic layer to very poor, deep, organic soils. Results showed that the growth response of black spruce seedlings following drainage was strongly dependent on the ecosite. Ecosites RE37 and rich RE39 showed a substantial and steady growth response of black spruce to drainage over time. Therefore, drainage caused a significant increase in stand density and growth rate of black spruce seedlings in moderately rich ecosites. In the other ecosites studied, the peat layer was either too thick (poor RE39 and very poor RE39) or too shallow (RE26) for black spruce stand densities and individual stems growth to increase with drainage, compared to those of the control areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3adrainage 3amineral soils 3aorganic soils 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aseedlings 3astand density 3aQuebec 0aDrainage 0aBlack spruce 0aEcosite 0aLogged peatland 0aPeatland forestry 0aAlder 0aBirch 0aCompetition 0aSphagnum1 aJutras, Sylvain0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 400 p.321-331dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245005000178300001800228520089300246592002801139650001101167650001101178650001201189650001001201650001601211650001101227651001101238653001901249653001001268653001001278653001101288653002301299700002701322700002301349700002401372773011601396856008601512852000901598655001201607IND60088019020221120203421.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008801902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.11.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Jener David G.10aAqueous extraction of pectin from sisal waste  ap. 1997-2001.  aIn this work, sisal waste was used as a source of pectin. Sisal is known worldwide as a source of hard fibres, and Brazil is the largest producer of sisal, producing more than 246,000tonnes. However, the process of removing the fibres of the sisal leaf generates 95% waste. This study investigated the effect of the liquid/solid ratio (%), time (min), and temperature (°C) on the yield of the pectin obtained from sisal waste by attractive environmentally friendly process. A statistical Box–Behnken design was applied to determine the important effects and interactions of these independent variables on the yield of pectin, the dependent variable. Significant models were obtained. The yield of the extracted pectin ranged from 4.61 to 19.2%. The conditions that produced the highest yield (19.2%) were a temperature of 85°C, extraction time of 60min and a liquid/solid ratio of 2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aleaves 3amodels 3apectins 3asisal 3atemperature 3awastes 3aBrazil 0aAgave sisalana 0aSisal 0aWaste 0aPectin 0aAqueous extraction1 aEspeleta, Alexandre F.1 aBranco, Alexsandro1 ade Assis, Sandra A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 92, no. 2 p.1997-2001dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.11.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010500152300001800257520023400275592002800509650001200537650002300549650002700572650002300599650002700622650001400649650002100663700001900684700001800703700001800721773013400739856007400873852000900947655001200956IND60659943020221123000833.0190823e20130829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065994302DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc44711a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Tao10aRegioselective palladium-catalyzed intramolecular oxidative aminofluorination of unactivated alkenes  ap. 8707-8709.  aA novel Pd-catalyzed regioselective intramolecular aminofluorination of unactivated alkenes has been developed, which is an efficient method for the synthesis of a variety of monofluoromethylated nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aheterocyclic compounds 3apalladium 3aregioselectivity1 aCheng, Jiashun1 aChen, Pinhong1 aLiu, Guosheng0 tChemical communications.g2013 Aug. 29, v. 49, no. 77 p.8707-8709dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc44711a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005500171520147100226592002801697650001201725650001501737650001901752650002001771650001501791650001201806650002401818650001701842653002701859653001701886653001401903653002101917653004001938700002601978700002702004773009702031856008402128852000902212655001202221IND60682471920221120083956.0200405e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068247192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cliser.2020.1001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStegmaier, Peter10aReflexive climate service infrastructure relations  aExploring existing climate knowledge infrastructures as the important backbone of service endeavours, the authors analysed how climate knowledge infrastructures are organised, how (far) they take into account the ‘end user’, and how processes of data infrastructure governance function. Following these themes, we first catalogued and mapped relationships of organisations involved in the climate data infrastructure value chain and conducted interviews with representatives of some of the mapped organisations in order to corroborate the literature research and obtain additional insights. We suggest viewing climate service infrastructure in the four dimensions of instrumentation, information, communication, and service infrastructures. We argue that success or failure of climate services will be determined, firstly, by the ability to view and practically embed users as integral partners in the co-construction of climate services rather than treating them as ‘external factors’ (cross-boundary reflexivity). Secondly, we argue that it will be crucial for the growth of the climate service market, and therefore wider societal resilience to pay more attention to communication and service infrastructures intersecting. This may take in multiple ways with instrumentation and information infrastructures (infrastructural reflexivity) in the sense of a “value network” (not simply a value chain) given all the fluidity of the service infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3agovernance 3ainfrastructure 3ainstrumentation 3ainterviews 3amarkets 3ameteorological data 3asupply chain 0aService infrastructure 0aClimate data 0aKnowledge 0aClimate services 0aInteractive infrastructure approach1 aHamaker-Taylor, Robin1 aJiménez Alonso, Elisa0 tClimate services.g2020 Jan., v. 17 p.100151-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23241x2405-88077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2020.1001513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012200162300001400284500002000298520210900318592002802427650002602455650002602481650002402507650002302531650002302554650001502577650001102592650001002603650001302613650002002626650001602646650002202662700002102684773012802705856007302833852000902906655001202915IND60587622020221120092104.0180102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762202DNAL7 a10.1890/11-2029.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Ashley B.10aFloral diversity increases beneficial arthropod richness and decreases variability in arthropod community composition  ap. 86-95.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDeclines in species diversity resulting from anthropogenic alterations of the environment heighten the need to develop management strategies that conserve species and ecosystem services. This study examined how native plant species and their diversity influence the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods, a functionally important group that provides ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest suppression. Beneficial arthropods were sampled in replicated study plots containing native perennials planted in one‐, two‐, and seven‐species mixtures. We found plant diversity had a positive impact on arthropod richness but not on arthropod abundance. An analysis of arthropod community composition revealed that each flower species attracted a different assemblage of beneficial arthropods. In addition, the full seven‐species mixture also attracted a distinct arthropod community compared to single‐species monocultures. Using a multivariate approach, we determined whether arthropod assemblages in two‐ and seven‐species plots were additive and could be predicted based on assemblages from their component single‐species plots. On average, assemblages in diverse plots were nonadditive when compared to assemblages predicted using single‐species plots. Arthropod assemblages in two‐species plots most closely resembled those of only one of the flower species in the mixture. However, the arthropod assemblages in seven‐species plots, although statistically deviating from the expectation of an additive model, more closely resembled predicted communities compared to the assemblages found in two‐species plots, suggesting that variability in arthropod community composition decreased as planting diversity increased. Our study demonstrates that careful selection of plants in managed landscapes can augment beneficial arthropod richness and support a more predictable arthropod community, suggesting that planning and design efforts could shape arthropod assemblages in natural as well as managed landscapes to meet targeted conservation or management goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropod communities 3abeneficial arthropods 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem services 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apests 3aplanning 3aplants (botany) 3apollination 3aspecies diversity1 aGratton, Claudio0 tEcological applications.g2013 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.86-95dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2029.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245010800170300001600278500002000294520241000314592002802724650001202752650002402764650002202788650002602810650001202836650001002848650001302858650002002871650002002891650002102911650001702932650001202949650002202961650001802983650001503001650001403016650001503030650002503045650002303070651001103093700002403104700002803128700001903156773013003175856007303305852000903378655001203387IND60587622120221120102457.0180102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762212DNAL7 a10.1890/12-0068.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaquette, Sébastien Rioux10aSeasonal patterns in Tree Swallow prey (Diptera) abundance are affected by agricultural intensification  ap. 122-133.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn many parts of the world, farmland bird species are declining at faster rates than other birds. For aerial insectivores, this decline has been related to a parallel reduction in the abundance of their invertebrate prey in agricultural landscapes. While the effects of agricultural intensification (AI) on arthropod communities at the landscape level have been substantially studied in recent years, seasonal variation in these impacts has not been investigated. To assess the contention that intensive cultures negatively impact food resources for aerial insectivorous birds, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of Diptera, the main food resource for breeding Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), across a gradient of AI in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Linear mixed models computed from a data set of 5000 samples comprising >150 000 dipterans collected over three years (2006–2008) suggest that both Diptera abundance and biomass varied greatly during swallow breeding season, following a quadratic curve. Globally, AI had a negative effect on Diptera abundance (but not biomass), but year‐by‐year analyses showed that in one of three years (2008), dipterans were more abundant in agro‐intensive landscapes. Analyses also revealed a significant interaction between the moment in the season and AI: In early June, Diptera abundances were similar regardless of the landscape, but differences increased as the season progressed, with highly intensive landscapes harboring fewer prey, possibly creating an “ecological trap” for aerial insectivores. While global trends in our results are in agreement with expectations (negative impact of AI on insect abundance), strong discrepancies in 2008 highlight the difficulty of predicting the abundance of insect communities. Our study indicates that predicting the effects of AI may prove more challenging than generally assumed, even when large data sets are collected, and that temporal variation within a season is important to take into consideration. While further work is required to assess the direct impacts of these seasonal trends in Diptera abundance on bird breeding success and post‐fledging survival, management strategies in agricultural landscapes may need to consider the phenology of breeding birds and their dipteran prey in order to mitigate the potentially negative effects of AI late in the breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aTachycineta bicolor 3aagricultural land 3aarthropod communities 3abiomass 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adata collection 3aecological traps 3ainsectivores 3ainsects 3aintensive farming 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3aphenology 3aprediction 3areproductive success 3aseasonal variation 3aQuebec1 aGarant, D.q(Dany),1 aPelletier, F.q(Fanie),1 aBélisle, Marc0 tEcological applications.g2013 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.122-133dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-0068.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017500160300001600335520177600351592002802127650001302155650002502168650000902193650001202202650001402214650002002228650001202248650001902260650001702279650002102296650002102317650002502338650001202363700002202375700002302397700002702420700001802447773012202465856007402587852000902661655001202670IND60639871820221120191948.0190503e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063987182DNAL7 a10.1039/c6fo01495j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFardet, Anthony14aThe degree of processing of foods which are most widely consumed by the French elderly population is associated with satiety and glycemic potentials and nutrient profiles  ap. 651-658.  aFood processing impacts both food structure and nutritional density. The effect of food structure on satiety and glycemic potentials is well recognized. However, the association between processing, satiety and glycemic potentials and nutrient profiles has not been much studied, especially in the diets of the elderly. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring relations between the level of food processing, consumption and nutrient profiles and satiety and glycemic potentials among 6686 French elderly people (≥65 years). Dietary assessment was realized through a web-based 24 h dietary record tool. Among a total of 2688 foods, 280 generic foods were aggregated based on a consumption threshold of at least 5% by the population. The satiety potential was calculated using the Fullness Factor equation, and the glycemic potential using the glycemic index and the glucose glycemic equivalent. Foods and dishes were ranked according to an adapted international NOVA classification as raw/minimally-processed (G1), processed (G2) and ultra-processed (G3). ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the more food is processed, the lower its satiety potential and nutrient density and the higher its glycemic impact, especially when comparing G1 and G3. Besides, the foods consumed in the greatest quantity daily tend to be the most satiating, and ultra-processed foods were among the less frequently consumed both in terms of percentage and daily quantity (around two-fold difference between minimally- and ultra-processed foods). In conclusion, because it is partly related to health food potential, the degree of processing, especially for ultra-processed products, should be taken into consideration more when evaluating consumption profiles of different populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanalysis of variance 3adiet 3aelderly 3aequations 3afood processing 3aglucose 3aglycemic index 3ahealth foods 3anutrient content 3anutrient density 3anutrition assessment 3asatiety1 aMéjean, Caroline1 aLabouré, Hélène1 aAndreeva, Valentina A.1 aFeron, Gilles0 tFood & function.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 8, no. 2 p.651-658dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6fo01495j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003500166245014600201300001600347520166100363592002802024650002502052650001502077650002002092650001502112650002002127650002002147650001002167650001702177650001602194650001202210650001402222650002602236650001202262650001402274650002202288650002102310650001602331650001402347650001402361650002102375650001702396650002602413700003102439700003002470700002202500773009802522856008102620852000902701655001202710IND60120128120221118034344.0150126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012012812DNAL7 a255376472pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-014-0277-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedroza-García, José Antonio10aArabidopsis thaliana thymidine kinase 1a is ubiquitously expressed during development and contributes to confer tolerance to genotoxic stress  ap. 303-315.  aThymidine kinase catalyzes the first step in the nucleotide salvage pathway by transferring a phosphate group to a thymidine molecule. In mammals thymidine kinase supplies deoxyribonucleotides for DNA replication and DNA repair, and the expression of the gene is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Although this gene is phylogenetically conserved in many taxa, its physiological function in plants remains unknown. The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has two thymidine kinase genes (AtTK1a and AtTK1b) and microarray data suggest they might have redundant roles. In this study we analyzed the TK1a function by evaluating its expression pattern during development and in response to genotoxic stress. We also studied its role in DNA repair by the characterization of a mutant that contained the T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of the TK1a gene. We found that TK1a is expressed in most tissues during plant development and it was differentially induced by ultraviolet-C radiation because TK1b expression was unaffected. In the mutant, the T-DNA insertion caused a 40 % rise in transcript levels and enzyme activity in Arabidopsis seedlings compared to wild-type plants. This elevation was enough to confer tolerance to ultraviolet-C irradiation in dark conditions, as determined by root growth, and meristem length and structure. TK1a overexpression also provided tolerance to genotoxins that induce double-strand break. Our results suggest that thymidine kinase contributes to several DNA repair pathways by providing deoxythymidine triphosphate that serve as precursors for DNA repair and to balance deoxyribonucleotides pools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3acell cycle 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3airradiation 3amammals 3ameristems 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3apromoter regions 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3athymidine 3athymidine kinase 3atransfer DNA 3aultraviolet radiation1 aNájera-Martínez, Manuela1 ade la Paz Sanchez, María1 aPlasencia, Javier0 tPlant molecular biology.g2015 Feb., v. 87, no. 3 p.303-315dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-014-0277-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024003600132040001800168100002200186245015300208300001600361520152700377592002801904650002201932650005201954650001002006650001902016650002402035650002202059650001002081650001902091650001202110650004302122650007502165650006602240650003702306650007402343650003202417650001002449650004802459651001802507700002002525700002402545700002002569700002102589700002102610773013202631852000902763856008302772856011202855961001302967655001202980IND4365035820221118084610.0181016e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436503582DNAL7 a10113/409252hdl7 a154603172pmid7 a10.1177/1040638704016005012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicht, Jürgen A.10aReal–Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays for the Detection and Differentiation of North American Swine Influenza Viruses  ap. 367-373.  aSwine influenza is an acute respiratory disease of swine caused by type A influenza viruses. Before 1998, mainly “classical” H1N1 swine influenza viruses (SIVs) were isolated from swine in the United States. Since then, antigenically distinct reassortant H3 and H1 SIVs have been identified as causative agents of respiratory disease in pigs on US farms. Improvement in SIV diagnostics is needed in light of the recently observed rapid evolution of H1 and H3 SIVs and their zoonotic potential. To address this need, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the detection of SIVs were developed. A highly sensitive matrix (M) gene–based RT-PCR assay that is able to detect both the H1 and H3 subtypes of SIVs, with a sensitivity per reaction of approximately 2 copies of in vitro–generated M-specific negative-sense RNA molecules and approximately 0.05 TCID₅₀ in lung lavage of experimentally SIV-infected pigs, was established. This RT-PCR assay can be performed within a few hours and showed a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 85% when compared with virus isolation. In addition, H1-, H3-, N1-, and N2-specific primer and probe sets were designed for use in the differentiation of different SIV subtypes. The hemagglutinin (H)- and neuraminidase (N)-specific primer and probe sets were less sensitive than the M-specific assay, although they were found to be specific for their respective viral genes and able to distinguish between their respective SIV subtypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aviral proteins 3amicrobial detection 3adisease diagnosis 3aswine 3aswine diseases 2aAnimals 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxvirology 2aInfluenza A virusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aRNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aViral Matrix Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 0aUnited States1 aLager, Kelly M.1 aClouser, Deborah F.1 aSpackman, Erica1 aSuarez, David L.1 aYoon, Kyoung-Jin0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 16, no. 5 p.367-373dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638704016005013Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/409253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04021naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007600167300001600243520167000259592002801929650002001957650001501977650001501992650001702007650002102024650001502045650001102060650001802071650002502089650001602114650001602130650002002146650003102166650001002197650002002207650001602227650001202243650001802255650001502273650002302288650001202311650001402323650001402337650001402351650004302365650001802408650002202426650001702448650002902465653001402494653000702508653000702515653001102522653001002533653000802543653000902551653000802560653000802568653000902576653000902585653000902594653001102603653001102614653001602625653002002641653000802661653000902669700002302678700001602701700001202717700001702729700001802746700001402764700001802778700001702796700001802813700001902831700001702850700001502867700002102882773008802903856008302991852000903074655001203083IND60611051620221119043125.0210610e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061105162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Gui-Min10aDNA methylation status of CRABP2 promoter down-regulates its expression  ap. 243-248.  aAs an important epigenetic modification DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methylation transferases (DNMTs) and occurs mainly in CpG islands. DNA methylation plays an important role in regulates gene expression, cell differentiation, genetic imprinting and tumor therapy. Retinoic acid-binding proteins (RAC) is vital for the absorption, transport, metabolism and maintenance of homeostasis of retinoic acid, which in turn regulates the differentiation and proliferation of cells by regulating the transcription of many target genes, therefore, these proteins influence differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes and muscle fibroblasts. Thus, cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) may be a candidate gene which affects beef quality, yield and fat deposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and the methylation pattern on the differentially methylated region (DMR) of the promoter of CRABP2. The DNA methylation pattern was tested by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP), the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to analysis the expression of CRABP2 gene. The results showed that the DNA methylation level was higher in purebred cattle breed than that in hybrid cattle breeds which was negative correlation with the expression of the gen. These results indicate that the methylation status of the CRABP2 DMR can regulate mRNA expression. What's more, there are different methylation and expression patterns in different breeds and tissues which may influence the phenotype, and the results may be a useful parameter to investigate the function of CRABP2 in muscle and fat developmental in Chinese cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aabsorption 3aadipocytes 3abeef quality 3abinding proteins 3abisulfites 3acattle 3acattle breeds 3acell differentiation 3aepigenetics 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3ahomeostasis 3ahybrids 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amethyltransferases 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3apurebreds 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretinoic acid 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0a3′-UTRs 0aAB 0abp 0aCRABP2 0aANOVA 0aBSP 0acDNA 0aCpG 0aDMR 0aqPCR 0aQUMA 0aSPSS 0aCattle 0aCRABP2 0aCpG islands 0aDNA methylation 0aBSP 0aqPCR1 aSong, Cheng-Chuang1 aLi, Li-Juan1 aHe, Hua1 aShi, Shu-Yue1 aLei, Chu-Zhao1 aZheng, Li1 aPeng, Shu-Jun1 aTian, Yi-Ran1 aDang, Rui-Hua1 aLan, Xian-Yong1 aQi, Xing-Lei1 aChen, Hong1 aHuang, Yong-Zhen0 tGene.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 676 p.243-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011300158300001600271500002000287520220500307592002802512650001502540650001102555650002002566650001802586650002202604650002902626650001702655650001102672650002602683650001302709650002302722650001602745650001202761650002402773650001102797650002402808650001302832650002402845650001702869650001902886650001502905651001302920651001102933700002102944700001702965700002702982700001803009700001903027700001803046700002403064700002103088773013003109856007303239852000903312655001203321IND60587622320221122071926.0180102e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058762232DNAL7 a10.1890/11-1800.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Robert10aModeling spatial decisions with graph theory: logging roads and forest fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon  ap. 239-254.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article addresses the spatial decision‐making of loggers and implications for forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks, typically abandoned upon removal of hardwoods. Logging road networks provide access to land, and the settlers who take advantage of them clear fields and pastures that accentuate their spatial signatures. In shaping agricultural activities, these networks organize emergent patterns of forest fragmentation, even though the loggers move elsewhere. The goal of the article is to explicate how loggers shape their road networks, in order to theoretically explain an important type of forest fragmentation found in the Amazon basin, particularly in Brazil. This is accomplished by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision‐making of loggers, and by implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks. The economic behavior of loggers is conceptualized as a profit maximization problem, and translated into spatial decision‐making by establishing a formal correspondence between mathematical graphs and road networks. New computational approaches, adapted from operations research, are used to construct graphs and simulate spatial decision‐making as a function of discount rates, land tenure, and topographic constraints. The algorithms employed bracket a range of behavioral settings appropriate for areas of terras devolutas, public lands that have not been set aside for environmental protection, indigenous peoples, or colonization. The simulation target sites are located in or near so‐called Terra do Meio, once a major logging frontier in the lower Amazon Basin. Simulation networks are compared to empirical ones identified by remote sensing and then used to draw inferences about factors influencing the spatial behavior of loggers. Results overall suggest that Amazonia's logging road networks induce more fragmentation than necessary to access fixed quantities of wood. The paper concludes by considering implications of the approach and findings for Brazil's move to a system of concession logging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3adecision making 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic behavior 3aenvironmental protection 3aforest roads 3agraphs 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahardwood 3aindigenous peoples 3aland tenure 3alogging 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3aoperations research 3apastures 3aprofit maximization 3apublic lands 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aArima, Eugênio,1 aMessina, Joe1 aSoares-Filho, Britaldo1 aPerz, Stephen1 aVergara, Dante1 aSales, Marcio1 aPereira, Ritaumaria1 aCastro, Williams0 tEcological applications.g2013 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.239-254dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1800.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245007800176520062200254592002800876650002500904650001700929650001600946650001000962650001400972650001900986650001601005650003001021650001901051650002001070651001201090653001201102653002301114653001701137653001501154700002101169700001701190700001701207700001701224700001801241700001501259700001701274700001601291700001801307700001601325773013401341856008401475852000901559655001201568IND60682472320221120072942.0201025e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068247232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2020.1003772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado Rivera, J.E.10aBovine neosporosis in dairy cattle from the southern highlands of Ecuador  aThe aim of this study was to describe bovine neosporosis in dairy cattle from the Sierra region, Ecuador.

We tested whether the addition of CWH could reverse those effects. We added CWH to Camp Lake, a lake with CWH abundances similar to developed lakes, following 2Â years of study of the fish populations in the reference and treatment basins. Both basins were monitored for 4Â years following the manipulation. Specifically, we tested for changes in the population dynamics (densities, size-structure, growth), diet, and behavior (habitat use) of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). CWH addition had no discernible effect on fish population dynamics. Diet and behavioral responses were more pronounced in the treatment basin. Prey diversity and availability increased. Piscivory increased, with decreased reliance upon terrestrial prey, for largemouth bass. Habitat use was positively correlated with CWH branching complexity and abundance. Our study suggests that negative effects observed in fish populations through CWH reductions cannot be reversed in the short-term by adding CWH. We recommend that regulations governing the LRD process be protective of CWH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepomis macrochirus 3aMicropterus salmoides 3abasins 3abass 3acoarse woody debris 3acorrelation 3adiet 3ahabitats 3alakes 3apopulation dynamics1 aCarpenter, Stephen R.1 aGaeta, Jereme W.1 aKitchell, James F.1 aAhrenstorff, Tyler D.0 tAquatic sciences.g2012 Apr., v. 74, no. 2 p.255-266dSpringer-Verlagx1015-16217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0219-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009100163520183000254592002802084650001802112650002002130650001102150650002102161650002202182650001202204650001202216650002002228650001202248650001902260650002202279650001202301650001702313650001302330651001002343653001802353653002402371653002602395653002902421653001502450653003102465700001602496700002002512773009802532856008502630852000902715655001202724IND60679960320221118044036.0200217e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067996032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.1021382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ran10aMigration and inequality in rental housing: Affordability stress in the Chinese cities  aHousing affordability is a widely accepted notion used to assess the housing poverty problem in the Global North and South. China is experiencing an unprecedented urban revolution, with two-thirds of its 250 million migrants now being sheltered in the private rental housing sector of the receiving cities. The discriminatory hukou and an exclusive public housing system with appalling living conditions for migrant housing have been a huge challenge in contemporary China. In this paper, we aim to examine the state of housing affordability inequality in the current rental market for all of China and provide policy recommendations for a more accessible and equitable migrant housing provision system. On the basis of China's Migrant Dynamics Monitoring Survey (MDMS) conducted in 2011 and 2016, this paper analyzes the dynamic spatial inequalities of the rent affordability stress (rent-to-income ratio) among migrants from 2011 to 2016 across China's prefecture-level cities and above. We use CV, Gini and Theil indices to investigate the interregional, interprovincial and inter-prefectural inequalities of migrant rent stress, and then adopt spatial autocorrelation to examine the regional variance for these urban units. Our study reveals the convergence of rent stress inequality at different geographical scales and an increasingly apparent north-south divide in housing affordability inequality in the rental market accessible to the migrant workers of China. The agglomeration of the high rent-stress migrants in the “local buzz” in China is found, too, which is closely associated with policy and economic factors, as well as being embedded in the hierarchical structure of the Chinese urban administrative system and the contrasting urbanization paths of the north and south, and of the rustbelt and sunbelt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aautocorrelation 3acities 3aeconomic factors 3aissues and policy 3aleasing 3amarkets 3amigrant workers 3apoverty 3apublic housing 3asocial inequality 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3avariance 3aChina 0aRental stress 0aRegional inequality 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aSpatial regression model 0aLocal buzz 0aChina's internal migration1 aLi, Tingzhu1 aGreene, Richard0 tApplied geography.g2020 Feb., v. 115 p.102138-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.1021383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014400169300001600313520173800329592002802067650001602095650002102111650003002132650003102162650002102193650001102214650001902225650001402244650002902258650001402287653001902301653001702320653001902337653001802356653003002374700001702404700002002421700001802441700002302459700002502482773012602507856008302633852000902716655001202725IND60736312620221122205810.0220214e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073631262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamal, Rutuparna10aEnhanced energy storage performance and theoretical studies of 3D cuboidal manganese diselenides embedded with multiwalled carbon nanotubes  ap. 500-510.  aThe burst of energy produced from the sustainable energy sources need to be harnessed by energy storage systems. Development of novel and advanced energy storage devices such as supercapacitors discover an enormous future ahead. Recently, hybrid supercapacitors (electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors) trend to be used as energy storage interfaces for their improved efficacy in energy density without altering the power density. In the ongoing workplan, transition metal selenides MnSe₂ and its hybrid with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesized by a simplistic hydrothermal protocol. Certainly, cubic phases of MnSe₂-MWCNT(MS/CNT) manifested superior electrochemical performance in both symmetric and asymmetric full cell configurations in contrast to prestine MnSe₂(MS). The asymmetric MS/CNT cell achieved an excellent charge storage capability with an high energy density of 39.45 Wh kg⁻¹ at a power density of 2.25 kW kg⁻¹ maintaining an energy density of 14.5 Wh kg⁻¹ at a high power density of 4.5 kWh kg⁻¹ and also revealed long term stability over 5000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles (capacitance retention of 95.2%). Furthermore, the preferable growth along (200) direction in the presence of MWCNTs favoured in enriching the supercapacitive property of MS. The quantum capacitance of MnSe₂surfaces and MS/CNT heterostructure has been estimated using density functional theory simulation to confirm the experimental outcomes. Theoretical investigation simultaneously exposed the contribution of (200) plane of MnSe₂ and MWCNTs cultured in enhanced DOS (density of states) near the Fermi level that remarkably promoted the energy storage efficiency of MS/CNT.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3amanganese 3arenewable energy sources 3aselenides 0aSupercapacitor 0aHydrothermal 0aEnergy density 0aPower density 0aDensity functional theory1 aBhat, Mahima1 aKapse, Samadhan1 aThapa, Ranjit1 aLate, Dattatray J.1 aSekhar Rout, Chandra0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 598 p.500-510dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008100163300001800244520220700262592002802469650002302497650001302520650002002533650002002553650001502573650000902588650000902597650001102606650001002617650001202627650001602639650002802655650001402683650001102697650001102708650002902719650002602748650001302774700002802787700002102815773011602836856007302952852000903025655001203034IND60477882320221118212523.0160106e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047788232DNAL7 a10.1890/06-1649.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuchanek, Thomas H.10aIs clear lake methylmercury distribution decoupled from bulk mercury loading  ap. A107-A127.  aClear Lake is the site of the abandoned Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine, active periodically from 1873 to 1957, resulting in ∼100 Mg of mercury (Hg) being deposited into the lake's ecosystem. Concentrations of total (primarily inorganic) Hg (TotHg) in Clear Lake are some of the highest reported worldwide for sediments (up to 4.4 × 10⁵ ng/g [ppb dry mass]) and water (up to 4 × 10⁻¹ μg/L [= ppb]). However, the ratio of methylmercury (MeHg) to TotHg at Clear Lake indicates that the methylation process is mostly decoupled from bulk inorganic Hg loading, with Hg in lower trophic level biota significantly less than anticipated compared with other Hg‐contaminated sites worldwide. This may be due to several factors, including: (1) reduced bioavailability of Hg derived from the mine (i.e., cinnabar, metacinnabar, and corderoite), (2) the alkaline nature of the lake water, (3) the shallow depth of the lake, which prevents stratification and subsequent methylation in a stratified hypolimnion, and (4) possible dilution of MeHg by a highly productive system. However, while bulk inorganic Hg loading to the lake may not contribute significantly to the bioaccumulation of Hg, acid mine drainage (AMD) from the mine likely promotes Hg methylation by sulfate‐reducing and iron‐reducing bacteria, making AMD a vehicle for the production of highly bioavailable Hg. If Clear Lake were deeper, less productive, or less alkaline, biota would likely contain much more MeHg than they do presently. Comparisons of MeHg:TotHg ratios in sediments, water, and biota from sites worldwide suggest that the highest production of MeHg may be found at sites influenced by chloralkali plants, followed by sites influenced by gold and silver mines, with the lowest production of MeHg observed at cinnabar and metacinnabar Hg mines. These data also suggest that the total maximum daily load (TMDL) process for Hg at Clear Lake, as currently implemented to reduce contamination in fishes for the protection of wildlife and humans, may be flawed because the metric used to implement Hg load reduction (i.e., TotHg) is not directly proportional to the critical form of Hg that is being bioaccumulated (i.e., MeHg).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3abacteria 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3aecosystems 3afish 3agold 3ahumans 3alakes 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3asediments 3asilver 3asulfur 3atotal maximum daily load 3atrophic relationships 3awildlife1 aEagles-Smith, Collin A.1 aHarner, E.

The VP2 genes of the isolates shared 98.9%–100% identity with the reference sequences. The substitution of residue V300A in VP2 protein differentiates the isolates from the reference MEVs, and A300 is a characteristic of FPV. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of VP2 genes indicated that the six isolates were clustered into the same branch of all the reference FPVs. The NS1 genes of the isolates shared 98.2%–100% identity with the reference sequences. The NS1 genes of the six isolates and the three reference FPVs formed one unique evolutionary branch. To clarify the pathogenicity of the isolates, animal experiments were performed on healthy mink, using MEV-SD1. As a result, the morbidity of the inoculated animals was 100% and the mortality was as high as 38.9%. It was implied that the FPV infection caused a high morbidity and mortality in mink and the inoculation dose had an effect on pathogenicity of MEV-SD1 in mink.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3agenes 3amink 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aChina 0aFeline panleukopenia virus 0aMink 0aAnimal experiment1 aYong-feng, Zhao1 aJian-li, Wang1 aXue-hua, Wei1 aKai, Cui1 aChuan-yi, Liu1 aShou-yu, Guo1 aJiang, Shijin1 aZhi-jing, Xie0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 June, v. 205 p.92-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016000163300001600323520137400339592002801713650002801741650001701769650000901786650002701795650002601822650001301848650001901861650001501880650002501895650001401920700002101934700002101955700003401976700002102010700002702031773009202058856008102150852000902231655001202240IND60120128520221118034438.0150126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012012852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2281-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Wenni14aThe effect of natural seed coatings of Capsella bursa-pastoris L.

Major impacts could be enhancing seed-soil contact and improving water retention, which we quantify in this study. METHODS: Myxospermous or demucilaged seeds of Capsella bursa-pastoris L. Medik. (shepherd’s purse) were added to a test sandy clay loam at seed : soil densities of 5 and 10 % [w/w]. The soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity were assessed. Soil rheology was also assessed using extracted mucilage only amendment at 0.5 and 1 % [w/w]. RESULTS: Shepherd’s purse seeds increased soil water retention and reduced soil hydraulic conductivity for myxospermous and demucilaged seeds. Soil rheological properties (complex shear modulus, viscosity and yield stress) increased in response to seed mucilage addition, and became more pronounced as soil dried. The mucilage had greatest impact on the yield stress compared to the other rheology parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The densities of myxospermous and non-myxospermous seeds, and mucilage tested here reflect that may be found naturally in soil seedbanks. The findings provide the first evidence that the soil seedbank provided from a wild arable species may regulate the soil water retention and enhance soil stability, and that this capacity is greater for myxospermous seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsella bursa-pastoris 3aburied seeds 3aclay 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodulus of elasticity 3arheology 3aseed dressings 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aviscosity1 aHallett, Paul D.1 aJeng, Dong-Sheng1 aSquire, G.

The persistent biting behaviour of tabanids not only causes disturbance, but is also responsible for transmitting diseases, such as bovine besnoitiosis. The purpose of this study was to better identify the level of tabanid annoyance on cattle by means of insect trapping and direct observation of cows. Tabanids were active during the entire daily observation period (10:00–16:00), except for Haematopota sp., which were less active in the morning. The tabanids collected in Nzi traps were generally representative of those that landed on cattle, except for Haematopota sp., as Nzi traps were not very effective for these species. The preferred feeding sites for most species appeared to be cow's legs or udder. Leg stamping was the defensive reaction most related to a tabanid alighting on a host. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the parameters associated with tabanid landings on hosts were related to weather and altitude, but not to landscape structure. Increased landings were mostly associated with the higher temperatures and lower wind speeds at midday, but some differences were observed between species. The results indicate that cattle-protection measures should be taken during the peak of tabanid abundance when climatic conditions favour intense biting activity. Nzi traps set close to livestock were very effective to catch tabanids and could help in reducing the annoyance caused by horse flies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematopota 3aaltitude 3aclimatic factors 3acows 3ahosts 3ainsects 3alegs 3amodels 3apastures 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrapping 3atraps 3audders 3awind speed 3aFrance 0aTabanidae 0abiting behaviour 0adefensive behaviour 0ahorse flies 0aNzi trap 0aweather1 aPuech, L.1 aManon, S.1 aHertzog, Lionel R.1 aJay-Robert, P.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2014 Aug., v. 104, no. 4 p.471-479dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853140001703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013900174300001600313520171600329592002802045650002102073650002202094650001602116650001602132650001102148650001202159650000902171650001802180650001902198650001202217650002502229650002002254650001902274650002002293650002202313651001802335700002202353700002002375773010802395856005502503852000902558655001202567IND4467901020221118105618.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446790102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2011.00828.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVendramini, J.M.B10aEffects of incorporating cowpea in a subtropical grass pasture on forage production and quality and the performance of cows and calves  ap. 129-135.  aThe increasing cost of N fertilizer has stimulated an interest in sourcing protein from warmâseason legumes among beef cattle producers in the tropical/subtropical areas of the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of two strategies of incorporating cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] into bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum FlÃ¼gge) pastures on the herbage characteristics and performance of grazing cowâcalf pairs. The study was conducted in Ona, Florida, USA, from May to August in 2007 and 2008. Experimental units were 1Â·0âha. Treatments were bahiagrass pasture alone (control), 50:50 bahiagrassâcowpea pasture (cowpea), bahiagrass pasture with a cowpea creep grazing area (0Â·1âha, creep grazing) and bahiagrass pasture with a creepâfed concentrate [(creep feeding; 10âgâkgâ1 body weight (BW)]. The cowpea pastures had lower herbage mass [HM, 1Â·8 vs. 3Â·7âtâhaâ1] and herbage allowance [HA, 0Â·8 vs. 1Â·4âkgâDMâkgâ1 live weight (LW)] compared with the other treatments. Cowpea had greater CP (CP, 160âgâkgâ1) and in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM), (600âgâkgâ1) than bahiagrass (110 and 490âgâkgâ1 respectively); however, cowpea HM was only 0Â·9 tâhaâ1 in May and 0Â·7âtâhaâ1 in June, but it did not persist in July and August. Calves receiving the creep feeding treatments had greater average daily gain (0Â·8 vs. 0Â·7âkgâdâ1) than calves in other treatments. Further research is necessary to exploit the superior nutritive value of cowpea in grazing systems in the southâeastern USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaspalum notatum 3aVigna unguiculata 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acalves 3acowpeas 3acows 3acreep feeding 3aforage grasses 3agrazing 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3aprotein sources 3atropical pastures 3aUnited States1 aArthington, J.

Flame propagation rate and after-glow time decreased appreciably, but smoke emission was enhanced. These results are be lieved to stem from the fact that decomposing alum not only generates noncombustible gases, which dilute the concentration of volatile combustible gaseous pyrolysates, but also leaves an aluminium oxide residue that forms a heat conducting coating around the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3aflame retardants 3afabrics 3acellulosic fibers 3athermal properties 0aflame retardant finishes1 aEboatu, A.N.1 aKaliel, M.1 aAbdulrahman, F.W.0 tTextile research journal.g1990 Oct., v. 60, no. 10 p.557-560dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517590060010013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01244naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015400164300001400318500002200332520015000354592002800504650002900532650001800561650002500579700001500604700001600619700001700635700001800652773016900670856008200839852000900921655001200930IND60654059920221121222632.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05583-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Minsoo10aCorrection to: Operator decision support system for integrated wastewater management including wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies  ap. 22102.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original corresponding authorship was transferred from Changwon Kim to Yejin Kim by Changwon Kim’s request.

To assess the impact of STPs on occurrence and toxicity of STP-associated contaminants in receiving waterways, a novel passive sampler modified from polar organic chemical integrative sampler (m-POCIS) was deployed at the inlet and outlet of a STP and several upstream and downstream sites along a river receiving STP effluent in Guangzhou, China. Eighty-seven contaminants were analyzed in m-POCIS extracts, along with toxicity evaluation using zebrafish embryos. Polycyclic musks were the predominant contaminants in both STP and urban waterways, and antibiotics and current-use pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoids, fiproles) were also ubiquitous. The m-POCIS extracts from downstream sites caused significant deformity in embryos, yet the toxicity could not be explained by the measured contaminants, implying the presence of nontarget stressors. Sewage treatment process substantially reduced embryo deformity, chemical oxygen demand, and contamination levels of some contaminants; however, concentrations of neonicotinoids and fiproles increased after STP treatment, possibly due to the release of chemicals from perturbed sludge. Source identification showed that most of the contaminants found in urban waterways were originated from nonpoint runoff, while cosmetics factories and hospitals were likely point sources for musks and antibiotics, respectively. Although the observed embryo toxicity could not be well explained by target contaminants, the present study showed a promising future of using passive samplers to evaluate chemical occurrence and aquatic toxicity concurrently. Zebrafish embryo toxicity significantly decreased after sewage treatment, but higher toxicity was observed for downstream samples, demonstrating that urban runoff may produce detrimental effects to aquatic life, particularly in rainy season. These results highlight the relevance of monitoring nonpoint source pollution along with boosting municipal sewage treatment infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3achemical oxygen demand 3acosmetics 3aembryotoxicity 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3anonpoint source pollution 3arivers 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3aurban runoff 3awet season 3aChina 0aPolar organic chemical integrative sampler 0aSewage treatment plant (STP) 0aZebrafish embryo toxicity tests 0aOrganic contaminants1 aYan, Qiankun1 aXiong, Jingjing1 aLi, Huizhen1 aMa, Xue1 aYau, Ching,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4006-83390 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 292 p.118307-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1183073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01526naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016400173500002200337520028000359592002800639650001700667650000900684650001600693650002200709650002600731650001200757650000900769700002300778700002000801700003200821700001900853700002300872700006000895773010300955856008501058852000901143655001201152IND60582581720221118003143.0190410s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058258172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Waqas-ud-Din10aRETRACTION: Soil and foliar silicon application enhances maize grain yield, its proximate composition, and antioxidant mechanisms under saline field conditions  aPre-press version  aThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

Here, two groups of mineralization experiments were carried out respectively to investigate the mechanism of the microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) using Arthrobacter sp. MF-2 strain and its EPS. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the mineral species and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphologies of the precipitates. Besides, focused ion beam (FIB) was used to prepare calcified bacterial slice for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Meanwhile, the temporal change of bacterial density, pH value, conductivity, weight of precipitates, Ca²⁺ concentration and EPS content were also recorded. The results of this paper showed EPS could serve as the stabilizer of unstable phases and the scaffold for the accumulation of nanoparticles.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant Nos: 41673083 and 41172308], Open Project of the State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, CAS [grant No: SKLLQG1309], the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [grant No: 2019M661859] and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (grant No: STEP 2019QZKK0707).

However, in this study, the effects of temperatures (37, 42, 47, and 55 °C) on the biomethane potential of corn stover were conducted with batch experiments, and the highest biomethane potential was at 42 °C. It was inferred that the change of feed materials, e.g., pretreatment caused by acidification (pH 6.0) during the lag time (4 days), was the main driver for higher biomethane potential. The natural pretreatment stimulated by a slight digestive temperature increase to 42 °C can enhance the biomethane potential of corn stover without adding extra acid. Meanwhile, metabolic pathways of methanogens changed from acetoclastic to mixotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Based on these results, the transition temperature (42 °C) from mesophilic to thermophilic micro-organisms could be a promising option for corn stover anaerobic digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acorn stover 3aenvironment 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apH 3atemperature 0aMethane yield 0aBiodegradability 0aEnergy1 aGong, Hui1 aXu, Ying,1 aCai, Chen1 aYu, Hua,1 aLi, Lei1 aDai, Lingling1 aDai, Xiaohu0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 759 p.143549-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1435493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245005700207300001800264520267000282592002802952650001402980650001202994650002203006650002003028650001403048650003203062650002503094650001903119650001803138651001803156700002303174773015403197856008103351852000903432655001203441IND60654060320221120093703.0190722e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065406032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-018-1575-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Andrea L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6426-971710aEnvironmental impact of evolving coffee technologies  ap. 1396-1408.  aPURPOSE: Coffee is a ubiquitous beverage in the USA today, accounting for 19% of the world’s coffee consumption. Although coffee consumption in itself is not new, the technology for brewing coffee and its corresponding environmental impact has been evolving rapidly in recent years, particularly with the widespread adoption of the single-serve coffee pod. This work utilizes a midpoint life cycle assessment with multiple environmental impact categories, to assess the environmental impact of a conventional (drip filter) brewing system, compared to a novel (single-serve coffee pod) brewing system, from cradle to grave. METHODS: This work analyzes the impact of consumer habits (such as leaving the novel system in standby mode) and phantom electricity consumption on the environmental impact of the system, in addition to the brewing systems themselves. The TRACI (Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts) suite is utilized to define the impact categories for the analysis, providing a holistic view. The SimaPro software tool is utilized along with multiple databases to enable the analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The question as to which coffee brewing system has the lowest environmental impact is a function of the phase, boundaries, and impact categories considered. The conventional brewing system has a lower environmental impact, with respect to raw materials and manufacturing. However, when only brewing is considered, the novel system has a lower environmental impact, suggesting that tradeoffs may occur. When the overall brewing system is considered throughout its lifetime, the system with the greatest environmental impact is not only a function of the technology, but also human behavior. The conventional system has a greater environmental impact than the novel system across some of the impact categories when phantom electricity usage is considered. However, when standby electricity consumption is considered, the novel system has the greater environmental impact due to the increased electricity consumption. Meaning that it is not only the technological aspects of the system that influence its environmental impact, but also how the technology is used. CONCLUSIONS: A major conclusion of this work is that although the technology utilized to brew the coffee is relevant to the environmental impact, the human usage of the technology is also equally relevant, although it is not often the focus of literature in this area. In order to truly understand and quantify the environmental impact of brewing coffee across multiple technologies, more information about coffee consumption habits is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abrewing 3acomputer software 3acradle-to-grave 3adatabases 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman behavior 3araw materials 3aUnited States1 aHalvorsen, Heather0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2019 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.1396-1408dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-018-1575-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013100173500001900304520214200323592002802465650000802493650001402501650001602515650002002531650002102551650001702572650001402589650001702603650002002620650001502640650001302655650001502668650001202683650001602695650001202711653002302723653002402746653002002770653003602790653003002826653002802856700002602884700002502910700002202935700002702957700002302984700002003007700002203027700001703049700002203066700001903088700002103107773011903128856008803247852000903335655001203344IND60717303020221119200017.0210201e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071730302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1435532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prashant13aAn overview of methods of fine and ultrafine particle collection for physicochemical characterisation and toxicity assessments  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParticulate matter (PM) is a crucial health risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The smaller size fractions, ≤2.5 μm (PM₂.₅; fine particles) and ≤0.1 μm (PM₀.₁; ultrafine particles), show the highest bioactivity but acquiring sufficient mass for in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies is challenging. We review the suitability of available instrumentation to collect the PM mass required for these assessments. Five different microenvironments representing the diverse exposure conditions in urban environments are considered in order to establish the typical PM concentrations present. The highest concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₀.₁ were found near traffic (i.e. roadsides and traffic intersections), followed by indoor environments, parks and behind roadside vegetation. We identify key factors to consider when selecting sampling instrumentation. These include PM concentration on-site (low concentrations increase sampling time), nature of sampling sites (e.g. indoors; noise and space will be an issue), equipment handling and power supply. Physicochemical characterisation requires micro- to milli-gram quantities of PM and it may increase according to the processing methods (e.g. digestion or sonication). Toxicological assessments of PM involve numerous mechanisms (e.g. inflammatory processes and oxidative stress) requiring significant amounts of PM to obtain accurate results. Optimising air sampling techniques are therefore important for the appropriate collection medium/filter which have innate physical properties and the potential to interact with samples. An evaluation of methods and instrumentation used for airborne virus collection concludes that samplers operating cyclone sampling techniques (using centrifugal forces) are effective in collecting airborne viruses. We highlight that predictive modelling can help to identify pollution hotspots in an urban environment for the efficient collection of PM mass. This review provides guidance to prepare and plan efficient sampling campaigns to collect sufficient PM mass for various purposes in a reasonable timeframe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adigestion 3aenvironment 3ainstrumentation 3aoxidative stress 3aparticulates 3apollution 3arisk factors 3aroadside plants 3asonication 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aviruses 0aParticulate matter 0aUltrafine particles 0aMass collection 0aPhysicochemical characteristics 0aToxicological assessments 0aArtificial intelligence1 aKalaiarasan, Gopinath1 aPorter, Alexandra E.1 aPinna, Alessandra1 aKłosowski, Michał M.1 aDemokritou, Philip1 aChung, Kian Fan1 aPain, Christopher1 aArvind, D.K.1 aArcucci, Rossella1 aAdcock, Ian M.1 aDilliway, Claire0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 756 p.143553-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1435533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008600184300001600270520141100286592002801697650002601725650003901751650001201790650001001802650000901812650002001821650001601841650001101857700001601868700001401884700001801898700001701916700001701933700001201950700001701962773012601979856008202105852000902187655001202196IND60516732920221121130030.0190727e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051673292DNAL7 a218102832pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X110004472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei-na10aWorm morphology of Schistosoma japonicum using confocal laser scanning microscopy  ap. 317-322.  aMale and female Schistosoma japonicum worms have dissimilar appearances in their final host. In this study, a morphometric and morphological assessment of whole worms derived from unisexual and mixed infections in mice was conducted using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Worms from mixed infections showed significant morphological changes between 15 and 25 days post-infection (PI). On the fifteenth day PI, 33% of males had formed the conspicuous gynecophoric canal, but only 8% of them had testicular lobes containing a few germinative cells; 13% of females had incipient ovaries with a few immature ovarian cells inside. On the twentieth day PI, the testicular lobes contained more germinative cells in all male worms, while female worms presented vitelline glands. On the twenty-fifth day PI, more germinative cells were observed in the male testicular lobes, and differentiated cells were present in the female ovaries. All worms had fully developed reproductive organs from 30 days PI onwards. Morphometric analysis showed significant differences between mixed and unisexual infections at 35 days PI. Ovaries of worms from unisexual infections contained cells in one stage of maturation and vitelline glands had undifferentiated cells. Our study of S. japonicum provides a detailed comparison of different morphological traits from worms of mixed and unisexual infections throughout development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afemales 3amales 3amice 3amixed infection 3amorphometry 3atestes1 aZhang, Peng1 aLiu, Miao1 aRen, Cui-ping1 aJia, Xue-mei1 aHuang, Da-ke1 aGui, Li1 aShen, Ji-jia0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.317-322dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X110004473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245009900212300001400311506007600325520124100401592002801642506003701670650000801707650002801715650001201743650001201755653000801767653001001775653000801785653001101793653001101804653001001815653001201825653000701837653000901844653000901853653001001862653001801872653002001890653001501910653004201925700003301967773009002000856008402090852000902174655001202183IND60553856220221207115257.0180904e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055385622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.0272doi7 aPMC49815082pmcid7 a271308892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLau, Matthew W.L.10aIn vitro evolution of coenzyme-independent variants from the glmS ribozyme structural scaffold  ap. 76-81.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUniquely among known natural ribozymes that cleave RNA sequence-specifically, the glmS ribozyme-riboswitch employs a small molecule, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) as a catalytic cofactor. In vitro selection was employed to search for coenzyme-independent variants of this ribozyme. In addition to shedding light on the catalytic mechanism of the ribozyme, such variants could resemble the evolutionary ancestors of the modern, GlcN6P-regulated ribozyme-riboswitch. A mutant pool was constructed such that the secondary structure elements, which define the triply-pseudoknotted global fold of the ribozyme, was preserved. A stringent selection scheme that relies on thiol-mercury affinity chromatography for separating active and inactive sequences ultimately yielded a triple mutant with a cleavage rate exceeding 3min⁻¹ that only requires divalent cations for activity. Mutational analysis demonstrated that a point reversion of the variant toward the wild-type sequence was sufficient to partially restore GlcN6P-dependence, suggesting that coenzyme dependence can be readily be acquired by RNAs that adopt the glmS ribozyme fold. The methods employed to perform this selection experiment are described in detail in this review.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aaffinity chromatography 3acations 3amutants 0aAPM 0adNTPs 0aDTT 0aGlcN6P 0aglmSWT 0a6SGMP 0aglmSAAA 0ant 0aNTPs 0aPAGE 0aSELEX 0aCatalytic RNA 0aDivalent cation 0aRiboswitch 0aMercury-thiol affinity chromatography1 aFerré-D’Amaré, Adrian R.0 tMethods.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 106 p.76-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010900174300001400283520196500297592002802262650002002290650001902310650001102329650002502340650001302365650002602378650001902404650002802423650001102451650001802462650001102480650001402491650001902505650001502524650001102539651001402550653002002564653002102584653001302605653001302618653002302631653003102654653002202685700001302707700002102720700002002741700001702761700002002778700001802798700002202816773012202838856008802960852000903048655001203057IND60569089220221120193348.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056908922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnelly, Alison10aInterspecific and interannual variation in the duration of spring phenophases in a northern mixed forest  ap. 55-67.  aA wide range of intra- and interspecific variation occurs in spring leaf phenology as a result of biotic factors such as, life strategy, ecological niche and genetic adaptation, and abiotic factors such as environmental condition. Whereas knowing when the start of bud-burst occurs is necessary for determining the beginning of the growing season, and the subsequent start of carbon uptake, the duration of phenophases is equally important (to estimate the rate of carbon uptake, for example), but rarely reported. Here, we investigate variation in the timing and duration of 3 key phenophase categories (bud-open, leaf-out, full-leaf unfolded) from a range of 8 broadleaf and 2 conifer species in a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA over a 5-year period. As expected, the start of each phenophase category varied across species and years and an earlier start to one phenophase did not necessarily result in an earlier start to subsequent phenophases nor did it mean a faster or slower progression. Ecological niche was not always a useful predictor of the timing or duration of the spring phenology season. The spring phenology season from bud-burst to full leaf open for the entire forest community took an average of 13days ranging from 12 to 18days across species. Bud-open and leaf-out lasted an average of 4days whereas, full-leaf unfolding lasted 5 and again there were variations among species. Full leaf unfolded for A. incana lasted significantly (p<0.001) longer than other species. Variation in the duration of the spring phenology season among years closely tracked local seasonal air-temperature based on growing degree hours (GDH). These results could be used to help determine the relationship between phenology and the potential for carbon storage in early spring in a mixed forest and highlight the value of direct field observation data at species level, the detail of which cannot, at present, be captured by satellite remote sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abiotic factors 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aconifers 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaves 3amixed forests 3aniches 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspring 3aWisconsin 0aDeciduous trees 0aConiferous trees 0aBud-open 0aLeaf-out 0aFull leaf unfolded 0aSpring phenophase duration 0aLocal temperature1 aYu, Rong1 aCaffarra, Amelia1 aHanes, Jonathan1 aLiang, Liang1 aDesai, Ankur R.1 aLiu, Lingling1 aSchwartz, Mark D.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 243 p.55-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017000172300001200342520258800354592002802942596004602970650002103016650001503037650001203052650000903064650002603073650001803099650001003117650002703127650001903154650001503173650001703188650001403205651001103219700002203230700002103252700002303273700002303296700002203319700002203341773013903363856008203502852000903584655001203593IND60617833620221120103055.0181206e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061783362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-018-2592-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirville, Melanie O.10aLow familiarity and similar ‘group strength’ between opponents increase the intensity of intergroup interactions in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei)  ap. 178.  aIntergroup interactions in social animals can vary from hostile to affiliative and may be influenced by factors such as competitive ability, resource values and existing intergroup relationships. Despite the potential for intergroup interactions to affect individual fitness and group stability, few studies have comprehensively tested how social, demographic and ecological factors may simultaneously influence intergroup interactions. Using 13 years of continuous data on intergroup interactions (n = 464), group composition, range use and diet, we investigated the factors that influenced the initiation and escalation of intergroup interactions in a fully habituated subpopulation of mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. The majority of interactions were non-physically agonistic (57%), while peaceful exchanges and physical aggression were less common (18% and 25% of interactions respectively). Solitary males and young dominant silverbacks were the most likely to initiate an interaction, presumably because these males have the highest incentive to attract mates. Aggressive interactions between a group and a solitary male involved a high number of participating group members, reflecting the incentive to avoid injury and infanticide associated with solitary male encounters. Aggression between social groups escalated when groups were similarly sized, perhaps because these groups have similar competitive abilities. Peaceful intergroup interactions most commonly involved opponents that contained familiar and related individuals, suggesting that the short dispersal distance of gorillas may facilitate kin-selected intergroup tolerance. Variation and plasticity in gorilla behaviour during intergroup interactions are therefore dependent on the opponent’s familiarity and threat level. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Intergroup interactions can vary from aggressive physical disputes to tolerant intermingling among extra-group individuals. Competition for access to limiting resources can often influence the occurrence of aggressive intergroup competition, but may not be sufficient to describe peaceful mingling between groups in social species. We found that although the main driver of intergroup interactions may be mating competition between males, interactions between familiar social groups were significantly more peaceful than interactions involving unfamiliar groups. These findings suggest that maintaining social and kin relationships with neighbouring groups may act as a strategy for reducing conflict in group-structured social species.  aPublisher supplied data  a10301036cUniversity of Western Australia 3aGorilla beringei 3aaggression 3aanimals 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3akin selection 3amales 3amating competitiveness 3anational parks 3aplasticity 3asocial class 3avolcanoes 3aRwanda1 aRidley, Amanda R.1 aSamedi, J.

The macrocyclic lactone (ML) class of drugs has been used to prevent heartworm infection. There is confirmed ML resistance in D. immitis and thus there is an urgent need to find new anthelmintics that could prevent and/or control the disease. Targeting ion channels of D. immitis for drug design has obvious advantages. These channels, present in the nematode nervous system, control movement, feeding, mating and respond to environmental cues which are necessary for survival of the parasite. Any new drug that targets these ion channels is likely to have a motility phenotype and should act to clear the worms from the host. Many of the successful anthelmintics in the past have targeted these ion channels and receptors. Knowledge about genetic variability of the ion channel and receptor genes should be useful information for drug design as receptor polymorphism may affect responses to a drug. Such information may also be useful for anticipation of possible resistance development. A total of 224 ion channel genes/subunits have been identified in the genome of D. immitis. Whole genome sequencing data of parasites from eight different geographical locations, four from ML-susceptible populations and the other four from ML-loss of efficacy (LOE) populations, were used for polymorphism analysis. We identified 1762 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites (1508 intronic and 126 exonic) in these 224 ion channel genes/subunits with an overall polymorphic rate of 0.18%. Of the SNPs found in the exon regions, 129 of them caused a non-synonymous type of polymorphism. Fourteen of the exonic SNPs caused a change in predicted secondary structure. A few of the SNPs identified may have an effect on gene expression, function of the protein and resistance selection processes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDirofilaria immitis 0aIon channels 0aMacrocyclic lactones 0aLoss of efficacy 0aNeuromuscular system 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aDrug targets1 aBourguinat, Catherine1 aKeller, Kathy1 aCarreton, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6509-910X1 aPeregrine, Andrew1 aPrichard, Roger K.0 tInternational Journal for Parasitology: Drugs and Drug Resistance.g2016 Dec., v. 6 p.343-355dElsevier Ltdx2211-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245012400171300001600295520121200311592002801523650001501551650001101566650001001577650001001587650002001597650001401617650001101631650001501642650001701657650002201674651001801696651001101714700002401725700003601749773011701785856007801902852000901980655001201989IND60466681520221120215008.0151127e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046668152DNAL7 a10.3398/064.075.02112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar-Aguilar, Rogelio10aHelminth Communities of Cyprinodon atrorus in the Natural Protected Area of Cuatro Ciénegas, Coahuila, Northern Mexico  ap. 226-231.  aThe helminth fauna of the bolson pupfish Cyprinodon atrorus (Osteichthyes: Cyprinodontidae) consisted of 7 helminth taxa collected from 7 localities of Cuatro Ciénegas, a natural area protected by the Mexican government in Coahuila, northern Mexico. The helminth community is described at the infracommunity and component community levels. The acanthoeephalan Atactorhynchus duranguensis was the most prevalent and abundant species. The remaining species were rare and found at low mean abundance values. The observed species richness, individual parasite abundance, and diversity were low at both component community and infracommunity levels. These findings are similar to those found in other freshwater fish species in the Nearctic part of Mexico; however, our study shows that the number of larval forms, in terms of species richness and abundance, is very low in comparison with previous studies in the area. Isolation of the Cuatro Ciénegas basin from the Bravo River (= Grande River) basins is suggested as the main factor determining the depauperate helminth assemblage. The low number of individual larval stages in this fish species is probably due to the lack of piscivorous birds in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinodon 3abasins 3abirds 3afauna 3afreshwater fish 3ahelminths 3alarvae 3apiscivores 3arare species 3aspecies diversity 3aArctic region 3aMexico1 aLagunas-Calvo, Omar1 aPérez-Ponce de León, Gerardo,0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2015 Aug., v. 75, no. 2 p.226-231dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F064.075.02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245007500131300001400206520070100220592002800921650001600949650002500965650001500990650001301005650001201018650001501030653001401045653002701059653002301086700001401109700001601123700001801139700001701157700001601174700001701190773014401207852000901351655001201360IND60709629420221121234230.0200908e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070962942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, G Vijay10aStability analysis for seed yield in blackgram (Vigna mungo L.

Wilczek  ap. 248-256.  aPost-germination plant growth depends on the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, spatiotemporal pH changes and Ca+2 homeostasis, whose potential integration has been studied during Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek root growth. The dissipation of proton (H+) gradients across plasma membrane (PM) by CCCP (protonophore) and the inhibition of PM H+-ATPase by sodium orthovanadate repressed SOD (superoxide dismutase; EC 1.15.1.1) activity as revealed by spectrophotometric and native PAGE assay results. Similar results derived from treatment with DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) and Tiron (O2ˉ scavenger) denote a functional synchronization of SOD, PM H+-ATPase and NOX, as the latter two enzymes are substrate sources for SOD (H+ and O2ˉ, respectively) and are involved in a feed-forward loop. After SOD inactivation, a decline in apoplastic H2O2 content was observed in each treatment group, emerging as a possible cause of the diminution of class III peroxidase (Prx; EC 1.11.1.7), which utilizes H2O2 as a substrate. In agreement with the pivotal role of Ca+2 in PM H+-ATPase and NOX activation, Ca+2 homeostasis antagonists, i.e., LaCl3 (Ca+2 channel inhibitor), EGTA (Ca+2 chelator) and LiCl (endosomal Ca+2 release blocker), inhibited both SOD and Prx. Finally, a drastic reduction in apoplastic OH (hydroxyl radical) concentrations (induced by each treatment, leading to Prx inhibition) was observed via fluorometric analysis. A consequential inhibition of root growth observed under each treatment denotes the importance of the orchestrated functioning of PM H+-ATPase, NOX, Cu-Zn SOD and Prx during root growth. A working model demonstrating postulated enzymatic synchronization with an intervening role of Ca+2 is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aVigna radiata 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3achelating agents 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3afluorometry 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alithium chloride 3ametabolism 3amodels 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aplasma membrane 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotons 3aroot growth 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCCCP 0aDEDTC 0aDMTU 0aDPI 0aDTT 0aEDTA 0aEGTA 0aNBT 0aPVP 0aROS 0aTiron 0aXTT 0aCalcium (Ca+2) 0aClass III peroxidase 0aNADPH oxidase 0aPlasma membrane H+-ATPase 0aRoot growth 0aSuperoxide dismutase1 aKar, Rup Kumar0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Jan., v. 232 p.248-256dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010700174300001400281520125900295592002801554650001101582650002401593650002601617650002201643650002201665650001101687650001701698650002001715650002501735650002601760653000701786653000801793653001701801653001401818653000801832700002001840700002001860773012201880856008802002852000902090655001202099IND60569089520221120143503.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056908952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParisi, Alfio V.10aLong-term UV dosimeter based on polyvinyl chloride for plant damage effective UV exposure measurements  ap. 68-73.  aResearch on the influence of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on terrestrial plants and on its link with other influencing environmental factors requires information on UV exposures, both for a horizontal plane and specific portions of a plant, above and under the canopy. In this research, one set of UV dosimeters based on unstabilized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were employed to measure the unweighted UVB (UVB) and the biologically effective UV radiation for plant damage (UVBEplant) incident on the leaves of a plant for a month, without having to change the dosimeters. The exposures were compared to the cumulative exposure concurrently measured with six sets of unstabilized polyphenylene oxide (PPO) dosimeters that required changing every four to six days. The difference in exposures between the two types of dosimeters was on average within 11%. The PVC dosimeter is the first reported polymer film dosimeter with a useable range of a month for measuring the plant damaging UV and the UVB exposures to specific parts of a plant. The exposure period of a month for the PVC dosimeter is an extension by a factor of four over the useable range of dosimeters previously reported in the literature for evaluation of the exposure of plants to UV radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acumulative exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3aexposure duration 3afilms (materials) 3aleaves 3aplant damage 3aplants (botany) 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV 0aUVB 0aPlant damage 0aDosimeter 0aPVC1 aAmar, Abdurazaq1 aIgoe, Damien P.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 243 p.68-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005500190245009000245300001400335506007600349520146100425592002801886506003701914650001401951650001801965650001801983650001502001650001902016650001602035650001402051650001602065650001502081650001702096650002602113650001402139650001702153650001802170650001602188651001302204651000902217653003102226653002602257653003502283653002902318653001202347700002002359700001602379700002302395700003002418773009202448856008302540852000902623655001202632IND60524768420221207092944.0170713e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052476842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2016.06.0132doi7 aPMC49326232pmcid7 a274088142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Sujay1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5024-726110aMetagenomic analysis of microbial community of an Amazonian geothermal spring in Peru  ap. 63-66.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAguas Calientes (AC) is an isolated geothermal spring located deep into the Amazon rainforest (7°21′12″ S, 75°00′54″ W) of Peru. This geothermal spring is slightly acidic (pH5.0–7.0) in nature, with temperatures varying from 45 to 90°C and continually fed by plant litter, resulting in a relatively high degree of total organic content (TOC). Pooled water sample was analyzed at 16S rRNA V3–V4 hypervariable region by amplicon metagenome sequencing on Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 2,976,534 paired ends reads were generated which were assigned into 5434 numbers of OTUs. All the resulting 16S rRNA fragments were then classified into 58 bacterial phyla and 2 archaeal phyla. Proteobacteria (88.06%) was found to be the highest represented phyla followed by Thermi (6.43%), Firmicutes (3.41%) and Aquificae (1.10%), respectively. Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were the only 2 archaeal phyla detected in this study with low abundance. Metagenomic sequences were deposited to SRA database which is available at NCBI with accession number SRX1809286. Functional categorization of the assigned OTUs was performed using PICRUSt tool. In COG analysis “Amino acid transport and metabolism” (8.5%) was found to be the highest represented category whereas among predicted KEGG pathways “Metabolism” (50.6%) was the most abundant. This is the first report of a high resolution microbial phylogenetic profile of an Amazonian hot spring.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAquificae 3aCrenarchaeota 3aEuryarchaeota 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aamino acids 3adatabases 3ahot springs 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3aphylogeny 3aplant litter 3aribosomal RNA 3atemperature 3aAmazonia 3aPeru 0aPeruvian Amazon rainforest 0aGeothermal/hot spring 0aIllumina metagenome sequencing 0a16S rRNA based phylogeny 0aPICRUSt1 aCortez, Yolanda1 aVera, Nadia1 aVillena, Gretty K.1 aGutiérrez-Correa, Marcel0 tGenomics data.g2016 Sept., v. 9 p.63-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23221x2213-59607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gdata.2016.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001600293520169100309592002802000650002102028650001902049650002502068650001202093650002602105650001502131650002002146650002602166650001702192650001902209650001102228650002302239650002102262650001502283650002302298700001902321773008902340856008102429852000902510655001202519IND60081212920221120194507.0151024e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008121292DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9434-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagle, Pradeep10aConfounding Effects of Soil Moisture on the Relationship Between Ecosystem Respiration and Soil Temperature in Switchgrass  ap. 789-798.  aUnderstanding the response of ecosystem respiration (ER) to major environmental drivers is critical for estimating carbon sequestration and large-scale modeling research. Temperature effect on ER is modified by other environmental factors, mainly soil moisture, and such information is lacking for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) ecosystems. The objective of this study was to examine seasonal variation in ER and its relationship with soil temperature (T ₛ) and moisture in a switchgrass field. ER from the nighttime net ecosystem CO₂ exchange measurements by eddy covariance system during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons was analyzed. Nighttime ER ranged from about 2 (early growing season) to as high as 13 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (peak growing period) and showed a clear seasonality, with low rates during warm (>30 °C) and dry periods (<0.20 m³ m⁻³ of soil water content). No single temperature or moisture function described variability in ER on the seasonal scale. However, an exponential temperature–respiration function explained over 50 % of seasonal variation in ER at adequate soil moisture (>0.20 m³ m⁻³), indicating that soil moisture <0.20 m³ m⁻³ started to limit ER. Due to the limitation of soil–atmosphere gas exchange, ER rates declined markedly in wet soil conditions (>0.35 m³ m⁻³) as well. Consequently, both dry and wet conditions lowered temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q ₁₀). Stronger ER–T ₛ relationships were observed at higher soil moisture levels. These results demonstrate that soil moisture greatly influences the dynamics of ER and its relationship with T ₛ in drought prone switchgrass ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adrought 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3agas exchange 3agrowing season 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content1 aKakani, Gopal,0 tBioEnergy research.g2014 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.789-798dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9434-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245008200165300001600247520058200263592002800845650001000873650001200883650001500895650001000910650001400920700002300934700002000957700002000977773011700997856007801114852000901192655001201201IND60466681920221120214905.0151127e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046668192DNAL7 a10.3398/064.075.02152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBridges, Andrew S.10aThreatened San Clemente Bell's Sparrow Nest Depredated by Island Night Lizard  ap. 248-249.  aWe used remote video monitoring systems to document nest predators at San Clemente Bell's Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli clementeae) nests and recorded an unexpected depredation by an island night lizard (Xantusia riversiana) on 22 May 2013.

One such potential microalgal candidate for biofuel production is Scenedesmus abundans. The aim of this study was to optimize the growth and lipid content of Scenedesmus abundans in a batch culture system in order to extend its applicability to the commercial production of biodiesel. Optimization of growth parameters such as culture time, concentration of inoculum, and concentration of sodium bicarbonate was performed by Central Composite Design-Response Surface Methodology (CCD-RSM) to maximize production of biomass as well as biofuel yield. The results obtained using CCD-RSM indicate that 30 days, 10% of inoculum and 8 g L⁻¹ of sodium bicarbonate are optimum working parameters to achieve a tentative maximum biomass yield of 0.0391 g per L per day and a maximum lipid content of 26.28% dcw. It was observed that the model prediction values satisfactorily matched the investigated values, within ±2%, for both growth rate and lipid content. Moreover, the individual and synergistic effects of the operational parameters on growth rate and lipid content were analyzed. The obtained experimental data were fitted to Lineweaver–Burk, Langmuir Hanes, Eadie and Eddie Hofstee plots. Among these models, the Langmuir Hanes method was found to provide the best fit, with a coefficient of regression of 0.9888. Consequently, the results of the study indicate that Scenedesmus abundans would be an apt natural source for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3afuel production 3ainoculum 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium bicarbonate1 aPerumalsamy, Muthiah0 tRSC advances.g2014 May 21, v. 4, no. 42 p.22129-22140dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra01179a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245015400134300001800288520168900306592002801995650002502023650001102048650001102059650000902070650000902079650001202088650001602100650001102116650001802127650001302145650001202158650001002170650002202180650001502202650002502217650001702242650001602259650001702275650001902292653002002311653001602331653002102347653002002368653002802388700001902416773014302435961001302578852000902591655001202600IND60126539120221118093653.0151124e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012653912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFollett, Peter A.10aIrradiation for Quarantine Control of the Invasive Light Brown Apple Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and a Generic Dose for Tortricid Eggs and Larvae  ap. 1971-1978.  aThe effects of irradiation on egg, larval, and pupal development, and adult reproduction in light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), were examined Eggs, neonates, third instars, fifth instars, and early stage pupae were irradiated at target doses of 60 90, 120, or 150 Gy or left untreated as controls in replicated factorial experiments and survival to the adult stage was recorded. Tolerance to radiation generally increased with increasing age and developmental stage. A radiation dose of 120 Gy applied to eggs and neonates prevented adult emergence A dose of 150 Gy prevented adult emergence in larvae at all stages. In large-scale validation tests, a radiation dose of 150 Gy applied to fifth instars in diet, apples or peppers resulted in no survival to the adult stage in 37,947 treated individuals. Pupae were more radio tolerant than larvae, and late stage pupae were more tolerant than early stage pupae. Radiation treatment of late pupae at 350 and 400 Gy resulted in three and one fertile eggs in 4,962 and 4,205 total eggs laid by 148 and 289 mating pairs, respectively. For most commodities, the fifth instar is the most radio tolerant life stage likely to occur with the commodity; a minimum radiation dose of 150 Gy will prevent adult emergence from this stage and meets the zero tolerance requirement for market access. For traded commodities such as table grapes that may contain E. postvittana pupae, a radiation dose >400 Gy may be necessary to completely sterilize emerging adults. After review of the literature, a generic radiation treatment of 250 Gy is proposed for tortricid eggs and larvae in regulated commodities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpiphyas postvittana 3aadults 3aapples 3adiet 3aeggs 3ainstars 3airradiation 3alarvae 3amarket access 3aneonates 3apeppers 3apupae 3apupal development 3aquarantine 3aradiation resistance 3areproduction 3asterilizing 3atable grapes 3azero tolerance 0ax-ray radiation 0aLepidoptera 0ainvasive species 0aregulatory pest 0aphytosanitary treatment1 aSnook, Kirsten0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Dec., v. 105, no. 6 p.1971-1978dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245010100157300001600258500001900274520166100293592002801954650002501982650002802007650000802035650001602043650001702059650002302076650002102099650001202120650001402132650002102146653001402167653003102181653001702212653001402229653001902243700002902262700002402291700002102315700001602336700002202352773010202374856007002476852000902546655001202555IND60695169620221122020122.0200516e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069516962DNAL7 a10.3852/11-3282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCary, Jeffrey W.10aFunctional and phylogenetic analysis of the Aspergillus ochraceoroseus aflQ (ordA) gene ortholog  ap. 857-864.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWithin the Aspergillus parasiticus and A. flavus aflatoxin (AF) biosynthetic gene cluster the aflQ (ordA) and aflP (omtA) genes encode respectively an oxidoreductase and methyltransferase. These genes are required for the final steps in the conversion of sterigmatocystin (ST) to aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁). Aspergillus nidulans harbors a gene cluster that produces ST, as the aflQ and aflP orthologs are either non-functional or absent in the genome. Aspergillus ochraceoroseus produces both AF and ST, and it harbors an AF/ST biosynthetic gene cluster that is organized much like the A. nidulans ST cluster. The A. ochraceoroseus cluster also does not contain aflQ or aflP orthologs. However the ability of A. ochraceoroseus to produce AF would indicate that functional aflQ and aflP orthologs are present within the genome. Utilizing degenerate primers based on conserved regions of the A. flavus aflQ gene and an A. nidulans gene demonstrating the highest level of homology to aflQ, a putative aflQ ortholog was PCR amplified from A. ochraceoroseus genomic DNA. The A. ochraceoroseus aflQ ortholog demonstrated 57% amino acid identity to A. flavus AflQ. Transformation of an O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST)-accumulating A. parasiticus aflQ mutant with the putative A. ochraceoroseus aflQ gene restored AF production. Although the aflQ gene does not reside in the AF/ST cluster it appears to be regulated in a manner similar to other A. ochraceoroseus AF/ST cluster genes. Phylogenetic analysis of AflQ and AflQ-like proteins from a number of ST- and AF-producing Aspergilli indicates that A. ochraceoroseus might be ancestral to A. nidulans and A. flavus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3amethyltransferases 3amultigene family 3amutants 3aphylogeny 3asterigmatocystin 0aaflatoxin 0aAspergillus ochraceoroseus 0agene cluster 0amycotoxin 0aoxidoreductase1 aHarris-Coward, Pamela Y.1 aEhrlich, Kenneth C.1 aMoore, Geromy G.1 aWei, Qijian1 aBhatnagar, Deepak0 tMycologia.g2012 July 1, v. 104, no. 4 p.857-864dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3852/11-3283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008900164300001600253520095300269592002801222650002001250650002301270650002901293650002701322650002401349650001101373650001401384650001201398650003101410650001401441700001801455773011701473856007801590852000901668655001201677IND60466682020221122053940.0151127e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046668202DNAL7 a10.3398/064.075.03022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, Roger A.10aUse of External Characteristics for Rapid Identification of Gender of Pocket Gophers  ap. 251-258.  aPocket gophers are of great importance both for their function in ecological systems and for their impact on anthropogenic environments. Managing pocket gopher populations requires a fundamental understanding of population demographics, specifically sex ratios; yet quick and reliable techniques for visually identifying gender of pocket gophers are lacking. We developed a visual identification method based on external characteristics of genitalia and mammae that allows for rapid, yet correct assessment of gender in pocket gophers. This approach was particularly accurate (>99%) for visual identifications in the field. Our approach was also accurate (>98%) for frozen specimens, although care must be taken when identifying gender of frozen, immature pocket gophers. Although our results pertain specifically to Thomomys talpoides and Thomomys bottae, we believe that our methodology can be broadly applied to additional pocket gopher species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThomomys bottae 3aThomomys talpoides 3aanthropogenic activities 3ademographic statistics 3aecological function 3agender 3agenitalia 3agophers 3asex determination analysis 3asex ratio1 aMeinerz, Ryan0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2015 Oct., v. 75, no. 3 p.251-258dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F064.075.03023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245005600165300001600221520100700237592002801244650001501272650001801287650002201305650001301327650001501340650001301355650001901368650001901387650001101406653001301417653001801430653001501448653001701463653001801480653001301498700001701511700001401528700001901542773012701561856008401688852000901772655001201781IND60625935220221119032913.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062593522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2018.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolbert, Z.10aPlant selenium toxicity: Proteome in the crosshairs  ap. 291-300.  aThe metalloid element, selenium (Se) is in many ways special and perhaps because of this its research in human and plant systems is of great interest. Despite its non-essentiality, higher plants take it up and metabolize it via sulfur pathways, but higher amounts of Se cause toxic symptoms in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms of selenium phytotoxicity have been only partly revealed; the data obtained so far point out that Se toxicity targets the plant proteome. Besides seleno- and oxyproteins, nitroproteins are also formed due to Se stress. In order to minimize proteomic damages induced by Se, certain plants are able to redirect selenocysteine away from protein synthesis thus preventing Se-protein formation. Additionally, the damaged or malformed selenoproteins, oxyproteins and nitroproteins may be removed by proteasomes. Based on the literature this review sets Se toxicity mechanisms into a new concept and it draws attention to the importance of Se-induced protein-level changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametalloids 3aphytotoxicity 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenoproteins 3asulfur 0aSelenium 0aPhytotoxicity 0aOxyprotein 0aNitroprotein 0aSelenoprotein 0aProteome1 aMolnár, Á.1 aFeigl, G.1 aVan Hoewyk, D.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Jan., v. 232 p.291-300dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001600302520164600318592002801964650002801992650002502020650002302045650002202068650001702090650001202107650001102119650001102130650001802141650002702159650002902186650001402215700002402229773008902253856008102342852000902423655001202432IND60081213220221120225659.0151024e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008121322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9439-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalter, Christian10aComparative Cellular Analysis of Pathogenic Fungi with a Disease Incidence in Brachypodium distachyon and Miscanthus x giganteus  ap. 958-973.  aBased on a growing demand on renewable energy, fast growing perennial grasses have been identified as energy crops with a high capacity in sustainable biomass production. Among these grasses, the giant reed Miscanthus x giganteus delivers one of the highest biomass yields. Despite its potential for an extended cultivation, only little is known about putative fungal pathogens that might cause biomass losses. Molecular targets that are related to fungal resistance have not been identified because cellular and molecular tools have not been established in this energy crop. Therefore, our study was aimed to evaluate a method to compare the penetration process of fungal plant pathogens in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon and M. giganteus. In a screening with 13 different fungal species on detached leaves, we identified four filamentous fungi that infected both B. distachyon and M. giganteus and have not been previously described as M. giganteus pathogens. Spray inoculations with these four fungi on intact M. giganteus leaves of whole plants confirmed their pathogenicity. Microscopic analysis of the fungal infections and the hyphal propagation within the leaf tissue revealed that the four newly identified fungi used very similar strategies for penetration and colonization in B. distachyon and M. giganteus. This suggests that B. distachyon could be suitable to establish model pathosystems for these fungal pathogens that colonize M. giganteus. The already existing genetic tools for B. distachyon might improve the identification of defense-related targets and mechanisms supporting fungal resistance in M. giganteus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3abiomass production 3adisease incidence 3aenergy crops 3agrasses 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arenewable energy sources 3ascreening1 aVoigt, Christian A.0 tBioEnergy research.g2014 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.958-973dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9439-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010800179300001800287500001500305520192500320592002802245650001502273650001902288650001302307650001502320650001202335650001102347650001602358650002902374650000902403650002102412650001402433650001502447650001202462650001002474653001802484700003302502700003602535700003202571700002902603700003202632700002702664700001902691700001402710773009102724856008102815852000902896655001202905IND60081213320221120214644.0151024e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008121332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9440-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento, Iracema Andrade10aMicroalgae Versus Land Crops as Feedstock for Biodiesel: Productivity, Quality, and Standard Compliance  ap. 1002-1013.  a2019-12-06  aDespite certain environmental advantages over fossil diesel, land crop-derived biodiesels may not satisfy the increasing worldwide demand for transportation fuels. As an abundant photosynthesizer, algae could be an adequate surrogate for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, high production costs, scarce selected species, and inaccurate assumptions about production yields represent industrial uncertainties. In this study, a reliable approach to analyzing algal biodiesel production has been developed based on species-to-species variations in oil productivity and quality. This approach compares biodiesels from Chlorophyta strains with land crop feedstock according to (i) potential yields, (ii) oil quality, and (iii) compliance with biodiesel quality standards. Algal yields were assessed by (i) extrapolating the strain-specific laboratory results to commercial-scale growth systems; (ii) converting volumetric to areal biomass productivity; and (iii) estimating oil yields for each strain, as the product of their projected areal biomass productivity for each growth system, and the oil percentage in biomass as determined in the laboratory. Biodiesel fuel properties were estimated by using fatty acid methyl ester profile predictive models. The Chlorophyta strains in this study provided annual oil yields that were generally higher than those of land crops by one order of magnitude. Six strains yielding more than 40 mg oil l⁻¹ day⁻¹ were identified as adequate for sustaining biodiesel production. Trebouxiophyceae algae were the most productive. Critical biodiesel parameters from both feedstock types suggest that most microalgae-derived biodiesels meet international fuel quality standards with better values than those of land crops. Because some of the highly productive feedstock does not simultaneously meet all the standards for a high quality biodiesel, optimization solutions are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroalgae 3atransportation 3acropland 3acompliance 3afossils 3amodels 3aChlorophyta 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aoils 3aproduction costs 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3abiomass 3acrops 0aChlorophycota1 aMarques, Sheyla Santa Izabel1 aCabanelas, Iago Teles Dominguez1 ade Carvalho, Gilson Correia1 aNascimento, Maurício A.1 ade Souza, Carolina Oliveira1 aDruzian, Janice Isabel1 aHussain, Javid1 aLiao, Wei0 tBioEnergy research.g2014 Sept., v. 7, no. 3 p.1002-1013dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9440-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245005400169300001400223520050200237592002800739650000800767650002100775650002100796650001900817653002300836653001000859653001600869653002800885653001800913700001900931773009000950856008401040852000901124655001201133IND60553857020221118003521.0180904e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055385702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroher, Florian10aIn vitro selection of antibiotic-binding aptamers  ap. 42-50.  aDespite its wide applicability the selection of small molecule-binding RNA aptamers with high affinity binding and specificity is still challenging.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most advanced nanocarriers for RNA packaging and delivery. Nevertheless, the intracellular delivery efficiency of state-of-the-art LNPs remains relatively low and safety and immunogenicity concerns with synthetic lipid components persist, altogether rationalizing the exploration of alternative LNP compositions. In addition, there is an interest in exploiting LNP technology for simultaneous encapsulation of small molecule drugs and RNA in a single nanocarrier. Here, we describe how well-known tricyclic cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) can be repurposed as both structural and functional components of lipid-based NPs for mRNA formulation, further referred to as CADosomes. We demonstrate that selected CADs, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines, self-assemble with the widely-used helper lipid DOPE to form cationic lipid vesicles for subsequent mRNA complexation and delivery, without the need for prior lipophilic derivatization. Selected CADosomes enabled efficient mRNA delivery in various in vitro cell models, including easy-to-transfect cancer cells (e.g. human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line) as well as hard-to-transfect primary cells (e.g. primary bovine corneal epithelial cells), outperforming commercially available cationic liposomes and state-of-the-art LNPs. In addition, using the antidepressant nortriptyline as a model compound, we show that CADs can maintain their pharmacological activity upon CADosome incorporation. Furthermore, in vivo proof-of-concept was obtained, demonstrating CADosome-mediated mRNA delivery in the corneal epithelial cells of rabbit eyes, which could pave the way for future applications in ophthalmology. Based on our results, the co-formulation of CADs, helper lipids and mRNA into lipid-based nanocarriers is proposed as a versatile and straightforward approach for the rational development of drug combination therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aantidepressants 3acattle 3acornea 3aderivatization 3adrug development 3aencapsulation 3aepithelium 3ahealth services 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmunogenicity 3alipids 3alipophilicity 3amedicinal properties 3ananocarriers 3aophthalmology 3apatients 3arabbits 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aNanomedicine 0aDrug repurposing 0aCationic amphiphilic drugs 0aMessenger RNA 0aRNA therapeutics 0aLipid nanoparticles 0aCellular delivery1 aSauvage, Félix,1 aGuagliardo, Roberta1 aMuntean, Cristina1 aNguyen, Van Phuc1 aPottie, Eline1 aWels, Mike1 aMinnaert, An-Katrien1 aDe Rycke, Riet1 aYang, Qiangbing1 aPeer, Dan1 aSanders, Niek1 aRemaut, Katrien1 aPaulus, Yannis M.1 aStove, Christophe1 aDe Smedt, Stefaan C.1 aRaemdonck, Koen0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Oct., v. 350 p.256-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100003000135245013600165300001500301520192900316592002802245650002402273650001002297650001402307650001102321650001302332650002002345700001902365700002202384700002502406700002502431700001802456773015202474856006902626856010602695990002302801852000902824655001202833IND60653599620221116163814.0190714e20190713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065359962DNAL7 a10.3791/591592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlagovechtchenski, Evgeny10aTranscranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) of wernicke's and broca's areas in studies of language learning and word acquisition  ap. e59159.  aLanguage is a highly important yet poorly understood function of the human brain. While studies of brain activation patterns during language comprehension are abundant, what is often critically missing is causal evidence of brain areas' involvement in a particular linguistic function, not least due to the unique human nature of this ability and a shortage of neurophysiological tools to study causal relationships in the human brain noninvasively. Recent years have seen a rapid rise in the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human brain, an easy, inexpensive and safe noninvasive technique that can modulate the state of the stimulated brain area (putatively by shifting excitation/inhibition thresholds), enabling a study of its particular contribution to specific functions. While mostly focusing on motor control, the use of tDCS is becoming more widespread in both basic and clinical research on higher cognitive functions, language included, but the procedures for its application remain variable. Here, we describe the use of tDCS in a psycholinguistic word-learning experiment. We present the techniques and procedures for application of cathodal and anodal stimulation of core language areas of Broca and Wernicke in the left hemisphere of the human brain, describe the procedures of creating balanced sets of psycholinguistic stimuli, a controlled yet naturalistic learning regime, and a comprehensive set of techniques to assess the learning outcomes and tDCS effects. As an example of tDCS application, we show that cathodal stimulation of Wernicke's area prior to a learning session can impact word learning efficiency. This impact is both present immediately after learning and, importantly, preserved over longer time after the physical effects of stimulation wear off, suggesting that tDCS can have long-term influence on linguistic storage and representations in the human brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3abrain 3acognition 3ahumans 3alearning 3aneurophysiology1 aGnedykh, Daria1 aKurmakaeva, Diana1 aMkrtychian, Nadezhda1 aKostromina, Svetlana1 aShtyrov, Yury0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 July 13, , no. 149 p.e59159-e59159dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/591593Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59159/transcranial-direct-current-stimulation-tdcs-wernicke-s-broca-s-areas  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04438naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003200132024001100164040001800175100002100193245010800214300001600322500000900338506017300347520176400520592002802284650002302312650002902335650001902364650001402383650002402397650002002421650001702441650002402458650002702482650001102509650001602520650002002536650001502556650002702571650002202598650001802620650001602638650002202654650002902676650002302705650002002728650002202748650001502770650001302785650002002798650001002818650000802828650002002836650003102856650002902887650002202916650001702938650001702955650001202972650001102984651001602995651002903011700002703040700002603067700001503093700002203108773015703130856011203287856007903399956013603478961000903614852000903623655001203632IND50068019120221214225843.0191125e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801912DNAL7 a2869692aris7 a10113/569082hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2012.03252doi8 ans2254  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLocke, Martin A.10aConservation Management in Cotton Production: Long-Term Soil Biological, Chemical, and Physical Changes  ap. 974-984.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aConservation practices are increasingly important components of sustainable management systems, and information about their influence on soil characteristics is needed. Soil parameters were assessed in no-till (NT) or minimum tillage (MT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production near Stoneville, MS, Mississippi Delta region, that included cover crop (rye [Secale cereal L.] or Balansa clover [Trifolium michelianum Savi var. balansae (Boiss.) Azn.]) vs. no cover crop. Soils (0–2, 2–5, and 5–15 cm) were sampled (2001–2006) before cotton planting. Independent of tillage, both cover crops accumulated more soil C than no cover, and N was greatest under clover. Soils (0–15 cm) under clover had greater aggregate stability than rye or no cover. The major factor influencing bulk density and infiltration was proximity to crop row bed and wheel traffic, but infiltration rates were sixfold greater under MT than NT (P < 0.01), with less effect of cover crop (P < 0.06, clover > rye or no cover). Moderate tillage slightly increased abundance of both reniform nematodes and earthworms, but neither was affected by cover crop. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity was higher in clover (50%) and rye (20%) in surface soil than with no cover. Soil microbial community structure (total fatty acid methyl ester analysis) (2005–2006) indicated a significant cover crop effect but no tillage effect. Mycorrhizal bioindicator (16:1 ω5c) was greater in soil with rye than clover or no cover; however, cotton mycorrhizal infection was 40% greater in fibrous roots from rye or clover plots than roots from plots with no cover. Collectively, cotton production with a cover crop and reduced tillage resulted in soil conditions indicative of soil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aRotylenchulus reniformis 3aSecale cereale 3aTrifolium 3aaggregate stability 3abioaccumulation 3abulk density 3acommunity structure 3aconservation practices 3acotton 3acover crops 3acrop production 3aearthworms 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid esters 3afibrous roots 3afluorescein 3aindicator species 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3amanagement systems 3aminimum tillage 3amycorrhizal fungi 3ano-tillage 3aplanting 3areduced tillage 3aroots 3arye 3asoil aggregates 3asoil biological properties 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil conservation 3asoil density 3asoil quality 3atraffic 3awheels 3aMississippi 3aMississippi Delta region1 aZablotowicz, Robert M.1 aSteinriede, Robert W.1 aTesta, Sam1 aReddy, Krishna N.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2013 May, v. 77, no. 3 p.974-984dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2012.03253Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/PC-1617-Locke-Conservation%20management%20in%20Cottonpdf.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008600168300001800254500000900272520167300281592002801954650005001982650003002032650001102062650001702073650001402090650001902104650001402123650001602137650001502153650003002168650001102198650001302209650002802222650002102250650001802271651001002289700002102299773021902320856008002539852000902619655001202628IND60665895020221120150636.0191028e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066589502DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2013.04.01332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhuri, Sriroop10aEvaluation of Long-Term (1960–2010) Groundwater Fluoride Contamination in Texas  ap. 1404-1416.  aepub  aGroundwater quality degradation is a major threat to sustainable development in Texas. The aim of this study was to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater fluoride (F⁻) contamination in different water use classes in 16 groundwater management areas in Texas between 1960 and 2010. Groundwater F⁻ concentration data were obtained from the Texas Water Development Board and aggregated over a decadal scale. Our results indicate that observations exceeding the drinking water quality threshold of World Health Organization (1.5 mg F L⁻¹) and secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) (2 mg F L⁻¹) of the USEPA increased from 26 and 19% in the 1960s to 37 and 23%, respectively, in the 2000s. In the 2000s, F⁻ observations > SMCL among different water use classes followed the order: irrigation (39%) > domestic (20%) > public supply (17%). Extent and mode of interaction between F⁻ and other water quality parameters varied regionally. In western Texas, high F⁻ concentrations were prevalent at shallower depths (<50 m) and were positively correlated with bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and sulfate anions. In contrast, in southern and southeastern Texas, higher F⁻ concentrations occurred at greater depths (>50 m) and were correlated with HCO₃⁻ and chloride anions. A spatial pattern has become apparent marked by “excess” F⁻ in western Texas groundwaters as compared with “inadequate” F⁻ contents in rest of the state. Groundwater F⁻ contamination in western Texas was largely influenced by groundwater mixing and evaporative enrichment as compared with water–rock interaction and mineral dissolution in the rest of the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanions 3abicarbonates 3achlorides 3adrinking water 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3amaximum contaminant level 3amixing 3asulfates 3asustainable development 3awater management 3awater quality 3aTexas1 aAle, Srinivasulu0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 July, v. 43, no. 4 p.1404-1416dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.04.01333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008400177300001600261520159300277592002801870650001101898650002101909650001201930650001901942650001301961650001601974650001401990650002502004650002002029650001402049650002102063650001702084650002102101653001102122653002202133653001902155653002602174700002502200700002402225700002102249700001802270700003102288773012202319856008602441852000902527655001202536IND60762037220221122112015.0220106e20220107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076203722DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2021.19637732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaed-Moucheshi, Armin10aScreening barley varieties tolerant to drought stress based on tolerant indices  ap. 739-750.  aWith regards to the importance of drought stress and genotype screening under stress conditions, the current study was conducted to evaluate barley varieties in response to drought stress and find the tolerant ones, along with the determination of the influential ratio of each yield component on grain yield under both conditions. Accordingly, 25 barley varieties were evaluated under two water regimes including 100% (normal condition) and 50% (drought stress) of field capacity. Cluster analysis grouped the genotypes into four and three clusters under normal and stressful conditions, respectively, indicating that drought might limit the phenotypic variability among the verities. Based on the feature selection, spike weight, leaf area, and grain number per spike under normal condition, and the number of fertile spikelets and grain number per spike under water deficit conditions were the most influential traits on grain yield which verifies the impact of drought on the relationship among the agronomic traits. The overall results of biplot showed that varieties Danesiah, Eram, and Yoosef, which had higher grain yield than average for both conditions, were suitable varieties in order to be screened for both normal and drought stress conditions. Finally, according to the results of correlation of tolerance indices with grain yield, stress tolerance index (STI), harmonic mean productivity (HMP), and mean productivity (MP) which showed high correlations with grain yield under both conditions can be introduced as proper indices for screening tolerance genotypes of barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3acluster analysis 3adrought 3afield capacity 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aleaf area 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant nutrition 3aspikelets 3astress tolerance 3awater stress 3ayield components 0abiplot 0adrought tolerance 0astress indices 0astress susceptibility1 aPessarakli, Mohammad1 aMozafari, Ali Akbar1 aSohrabi, Fatemeh1 aMoradi, Mahsa1 aMarvasti, Fatemeh Barzegar0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2022 Jan. 7, v. 45, no. 5 p.739-750dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2021.19637733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009900176300001600275506010400291506007600395520179000471592002802261506003702289650002602326650001302352650001602365650001802381650001802399650003002417650001802447650001902465650004302484650001402527653003302541653000802574653002002582653001402602653001802616653001902634653001202653653001502665653000802680653000802688653000802696653000802704653000802712653000802720653000802728700002602736700002202762700002002784700001802804700002202822700002002844700002102864700002102885700002502906700001602931773011102947856008603058852000903144655001203153IND60788843220221207113345.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078884322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZain, Nur Masirah M.10aDesign and manufacture of a lyophilised faecal microbiota capsule formulation to GMP standards  ap. 324-331.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFaecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is an established and effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and has many other potential clinical applications. However, preparation and quality of FMT is poorly standardised and clinical studies are hampered by a lack of well-defined FMT formulations that meet regulatory standards for medicines. As an alternative to FMT suspensions for administration by nasojejunal tube or colonoscopy, which is invasive and disliked by many patients, this study aimed to develop a well-controlled, standardised method for manufacture of lyophilised FMT capsules and to provide stability data allowing storage for extended time periods. Faecal donations were collected from healthy, pre-screened individuals, homogenised, filtered and centrifuged to remove dietary matter. The suspension was centrifuged to pellet bacteria, which were resuspended with trehalose and lyophilised to produce a powder which was filled into 5 enteric-coated capsules (size 0). Live-dead bacterial cell quantitative PCR assay showed <10 fold viable bacterial load reduction through the manufacturing process. No significant loss of viable bacterial load was observed after storage at -80 °C for 36 weeks (p = 0.24, n = 5). Initial clinical experience demonstrated that the capsules produced clinical cure in patients with CDI with no adverse events reported (n = 7). We provide the first report of a detailed manufacturing protocol and specification for an encapsulated lyophilised formulation of FMT. As clinical trials into intestinal microbiota interventions proceed, it is important to use a well-controlled investigational medicinal product in the studies so that any beneficial results can be replicated in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium difficile 3abacteria 3acolonoscopy 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial load 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atrehalose 0aFaecal microbiota transplant 0aFMT 0aQuality control 0aStability 0aManufacturing 0aLyophilisation 0aCapsule 0aMicrobiome 0aCDI 0aCFU 0aFMT 0aGMP 0aIMP 0aPCR 0aPMA1 ater Linden, Daniëlle1 aLilley, Andrew K.1 aRoyall, Paul G.1 aTsoka, Sophia1 aBruce, Kenneth D.1 aMason, A.

Greenhouse studies were conducted with samples of clayey and sandy soils. Treatments evaluated were: control (without P and S), TSP, TSP + S⁰, TSP + gypsum, MAP + S⁰, MAP + gypsum, reactive phosphate rock + S⁰, reactive phosphate rock + gypsum, natural phosphate of high reactivity + TSP + S⁰ and natural phosphate of low reactivity + TSP + S⁰, applied to the total volume of 10 kg of soil per pots at a rate of 120 mg kg⁻¹ of P₂O₅ and 40 mg kg⁻¹ of S, respectively. Fertilizers were applied to the total volume of 10 kg of soil per pot before planting two pre-sprouted seedlings of sugarcane (variety RB 86-7515). In general, the natural phosphate of low and high reactivity incorporated with TSP and S⁰ in the granule and the phosphates mixed with gypsum were more efficient increasing the sulfur accumulated in sugarcane and the sulfur contents in a clayey soil. On the other hand, the high reactivity natural phosphate incorporated with TSP and S⁰ in the granule and the phosphates mixed with S⁰ were more efficient increasing the phosphorus content in a sandy soil.  aThis study was supported by the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU) and by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3agreenhouses 3agypsum 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aplant nutrition 3arock phosphate 3asandy soils 3asugarcane 3asulfur 0aElemental sulfur 0areactive phosphate 0aTSP 0agypsum and Saccharum spp1 aKorndörfer, Gaspar Henrique1 aPereira, Hamilton Seron1 aNeto, Antônio das Graças0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2022 Jan. 7, v. 45, no. 5 p.775-788dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2021.19851353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010400164300001400268520131300282592002801595650001901623650001201642650001601654650001301670650001701683650001201700650001601712650001001728650002201738650001401760650002001774650001301794650001101807650002101818650001601839650002001855651002301875651002001898700002001918700001501938773007901953856008302032990002302115852000902138655001202147IND60094667920221119182545.0141104e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009466792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2013.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei12aA study of the long-term operation of capacitive deionisation in inland brackish water desalination  ap. 80-85.  aThe long-term cleaning needs and response to different cleaning approaches of a portable capacitive deionisation (CDI) prototype unit were investigated at two Australian locations: Wilora, a remote community in the Northern Territory (NT), and Mawson Lakes, an urban area in South Australia (SA). The high levels of calcium, magnesium and silica at Wilora had a limited effect on long-term CDI operation; Wilora's groundwater had a low level of dissolved organics, causing no observed fouling. The current CDI technology proved suitable for direct application for brackish water desalination in this location. For comparison, ground water containing a higher level of dissolved organics was studied in Mawson Lakes, SA. A reduction in the salinity removal ability of the CDI cells was observed due to organic fouling. However, a relatively mild cleaning solution (0.01M citric acid for calcium and magnesium scaling and 0.01M sodium hydroxide for the organic fouling) restored the desalination capacity of the CDI unit to its initial level. This unit thus represents a viable alternative for brackish water treatment, especially in remote locations where building and operating reverse osmosis (RO) treatment plants is not practical. These findings can be used to guide on-site maintenance of CDI technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3acalcium 3acitric acid 3acleaning 3adesalination 3afouling 3agroundwater 3alakes 3along term effects 3amagnesium 3areverse osmosis 3asalinity 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3aurban areas 3awater treatment 3aNorthern Territory 3aSouth Australia1 aMossad, Mohamed1 aZou, Linda0 tDesalination.g2013 July 1, v. 320 p.80-85dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2013.04.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245006700161300001600228520074000244592002800984650001301012650001301025650001701038650001501055650001201070650001201082651001801094773009401112852000901206856008101215655001201296IND4399869020221120130023.0160903e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9244-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBour, Roger10aGlobal diversity of turtles (Chelonii; Reptilia) in freshwater  ap. 593-598.  aThe turtles are an evolutionary ancient group of tetrapod vertebrates, and their present-day distribution and diversity reflects the long and complex history of the taxon.

However, this is not the only benefit we can obtain from such selection experiments. Since selection from a random library yields an unprecedented, and sometimes comprehensive, view of how a particular biochemical function is distributed across sequence space, selection experiments also provide data for creating and analyzing molecular fitness landscapes, which directly map function (phenotypes) to sequence information (genotypes). Given the importance of understanding the relationship between sequence and functional activity, reliable methods to build and analyze fitness landscapes are needed. Here, we present some statistical methods to extract this information from pools of RNA molecules.

Though widely studied as mediators of tissue development, recent work has uncovered a role for this TF family in modulating the vertebrate hematopoietic compartment. Pertinent to our study, murine Dlx1-3 are expressed in an innate lymphocyte population known as natural killer (NK) cells, and they are implicated to assume a functional role in the NK cell maturation pathway. However, Dlx target genes are poorly understood. In Drosophila, the invertebrate Dlx ortholog Distal-less (Dll) regulates another transcription factor called Spineless (ss), which is critical for specifying distal antennal segments. Importantly, the vertebrate ortholog of ss is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor recently shown to be important in the regulation of a number of immune cell subsets, including NK cells. Given these findings, we investigated whether Dlx TF family members might analogously regulate AhR in an NK cell context. Our results demonstrate that Dlx3 is constitutively co-expressed with AhR in murine and human CD127+ NK cells. Critically, we show that Dlx3 induces AhR promoter activity by binding to a regulatory region that resides ~5.5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. This mechanism is functionally relevant, as Dlx3 expression in human NK cells significantly enhances TF activity at AhR DNA-binding elements (Xenobiotic Responsive Elements, XREs). Thus, our study defines Dlx3 as a positive regulator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNatural killer cells 0aDlx3 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 0aXenobiotic response element 0aTranscriptional regulation1 aHaggadone, Mikel D.1 aSunwoo, John B.0 tBiochemistry and Biophysics Reports.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x2405-58087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01232naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008700170300001600257520039500273592002800668650001400696650001200710650001600722650001900738773011800757856008200875852000900957655001200966IND60653599920221116163807.0190714e193701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065359992DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517537007003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimes, Mary Anna10aComparison of Three Methods for Determining the Breaking Strength of Cotton Fibres  ap. 145-148.  aA method is presented for determining the breaking strength of cotton fibres.

A modified NI artificial diet called T7 was developed to rear this pest for 10 successive generations both individually and in groups. This T7 diet was similar in components and preparation process to the NI diet used for Lygus hesperus in North America, but was comprised of more whole chicken eggs, soybean lecithin, and Vanderzant vitamin mixture, and less brewer's yeast, wheat germ, lima bean meal, soy flour, and sugars than NI diet. While being reared individually on T7 diet, A. lucorum nymphs had a developmental duration of ≈12 d and survival rate of ≈80%, which was not significantly different from that on green beans. While being reared in groups, nymphal survival rate was above 81% (indeed above 90% for the first four generations), the weight of adults was heavier than on green beans and the average fecundity had a logistic increase through generations. The replacement rate of A. lucorum populations was expected to be ≈29 times per generation while being reared at a density of 100 nymphs per box (20 × 12 × 7 cm).

Methods used in transplanting have credence by virtue of common practice; however, there are few scientific studies comparing different methods. Our objective was to determine if different transplanting techniques, time of year of transplanting, and association with a nurse plant upon transplanting affected the long-term survival (8 years) and vigor of Sclerocactus parviflorus (Clover and Jotter). The 3 transplanting procedures were as follows: (1) cacti excavated, soil removed from roots, roots trimmed, plants placed in shaded open environment for 2 days and then transplanted (modification of conventional procedure); (2) cacti excavated to maintain a root ball and transplanted within 2 hours; and (3) cacti excavated, soil shaken off the roots and transplanted within 2 hours. Mortality was documented every spring and fall for 8 years. Plant vigor was determined in the eighth year by measuring flower and tubercle production. There was no difference in cactus survival among the 3 transplanting techniques, time of year of transplanting, and association with a nurse plant. There was no difference in vigor among the treatments as measured by flower and tubercle production. Three years after transplanting, 97% of the cacti were alive, and after 8 years 84% were alive. Based on this study, transplanting of S. parviflorus with high long-term survival can be done by any of these procedures, at any time of year, and with or without an associated nurse plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSclerocactus 3aautumn 3acacti and succulents 3aflowers 3amortality 3anurse plants 3aroots 3asoil 3aspring 3avigor1 aOtt, Rick1 aNovotny, Tim1 aLincoln, Anna1 aRechel, Eric0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2015 Oct., v. 75, no. 3 p.332-338dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F064.075.03103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245008800181300001600269500000900285520149500294592002801789650001601817650001501833650001501848650001601863650001901879650001701898650001901915650002101934650001401955650001601969650001401985650000901999650001302008650002102021650001402042650002002056650002802076650002102104650001802125650001502143651001402158700001702172700001702189700001802206773020702224856009402431852000902525655001202534IND60665895420221120161352.0191028e198507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066589542DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1985.00472425001400030005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMc Clurkin, D.

The plantations were established on eroded and abandoned agricultural lands with fragile soils. Soil series on the catchments include Lexington silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Paleudalfs), Providence sill loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Fragiudalfs) and Ruston sandy loam (fine-loamy, silicious, thermic Typic Paleudults). Eight catchments (0.17–0.56 ha) were instrumented with flumes equipped with water stage recorders to measure stormflow and Coshocton wheel samplers to obtain integrated samples of the flow. Plantations on four catchments were clearcut; the other four were left as uncut controls. Stormflow samples were analyzed for sediment-phase total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) and solution-phase TKN, TP, and potassium (K). Results indicated that a third or more of the TKN and two-thirds of the TP exported in stormflow from the catchments was via sediment. Solution-phase TKN and TP concentrations in stormflow were similar on clearcut and control catchments. Solution K concentrations were consistently higher from clearcut catchments. Rainfall inputs of TKN, TP, and K exceeded stormflow losses. The study demonstrated that pine plantations established on fragile soils can be clearcut without significant impact on water quality if recommended practices are used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragiudalfs 3aPaleudalfs 3aPaleudults 3aPinus taeda 3aabandoned land 3aclearcutting 3acoastal plains 3ahydraulic flumes 3anutrients 3aplantations 3apotassium 3arain 3asamplers 3asandy loam soils 3asediments 3asilt loam soils 3atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aTennessee1 aDuffy, P.

The river-lake ecotone is the ecological buffer zone between rivers and lakes, which can transfer energy and material between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Vegetation restoration of degraded river-lake ecotone can improve the interception capacity of P pollution. However, the effects of different vegetation restoration types on sediment P cycling and its mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we seasonally measured the P fractions and physicochemical properties of sediments from different restored vegetation (three native species and one invasive species). The results found that vegetation restoration significantly increased the sediment total P and bioavailable P content, which increased the sediment tolerance to P pollution in river-lake ecotone. In addition, the total P content in sediments was highest in summer and autumn, but lower in spring and winter. The total P and bioavailable P contents in surface sediments were the highest. They decreased with increasing depth, suggesting that sediment P assimilation by vegetation restoration and the resulting litter leads to redistribution of P in different seasons and sediment depths. Microbial biomass-P (MBP), total nitrogen (TN), and sediment organic matter (SOM) are the main factors affecting the change of sediment phosphorus fractions. All four plants’ maximum biomass and P storage appeared in the autumn. Although the biomass and P storage of the invasive species Alternanthera philoxeroides were lower, the higher bioavailable P content and MBP values of the surface sediments indicated the utilization efficiency of sediment resources. These results suggest that vegetation restoration affects the distribution and circulation of P in river and lake ecosystems, which further enhances the ecological function of the river-lake ecotone and prevents the eutrophication and erosion of water and sediment in the river-lake ecotone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternanthera philoxeroides 3aautumn 3abioavailability 3abiomass 3aecological function 3aecological restoration 3aecotones 3aenergy 3aeutrophication 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3arivers 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3atotal nitrogen 3avegetation 3awinter 0aPhosphorus fractions 0aVegetation restoration 0aInvasive species 0aRiver-lake ecotone 0aPhysicochemical property 0aBioavailable phosphorus 0aP 0aMBP 0aAKP 0aBD 0aMC 0aSOM 0aEC 0aT 0aTC 0aTN 0aTS 0aTP 0aPi 0aPo 0adil.

Urban development in Hanoi has caused a severe decline of groundwater levels. The present study evaluates the actual situation and investigates the suitability of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) to stop further depletion of groundwater resources. The results suggest that groundwater is being overexploited, as vast cones of depression exist in parts of the study area. Suitable locations to implement two MAR techniques—riverbank filtration and injection wells—were identified using multi-criteria decision analysis based on geographic information system (GIS). Three predictive scenarios were simulated. The relocation of pumping wells towards the Red River to induce riverbank filtration (first scenario) demonstrates that groundwater levels can be increased, especially in the depression cones. Groundwater levels can also be improved locally by the infiltration of surplus water into the upper aquifer (Holocene) via injection wells during the rainy season (second scenario), but this is not effective to raise the water table in the depression cones. Compared to the first scenario, the combination of riverbank filtration and injection wells (third scenario) shows a slightly raised overall water table. Groundwater flow modeling suggests that local overexploitation can be stopped by a smart relocation of wells from the main depression cones and the expansion of riverbank filtration. This could also avoid further land subsidence while the city’s water demand is met.  aPublisher supplied data  aĐT.NCCB-ĐHUD.2012-G/02cVietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development  aPostgraduate Degree Courses for ProfessionalscDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)  a01LN1311AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aaquifers 3afiltration 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3ariparian areas 3asubsidence 3aurban development 3awater table 3awells 3awet season 3aVietnam1 aVia Rico, Daniela A.1 aStefan, Catalin1 aNga, Tran Thi Viet0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Nov., v. 26, no. 7 p.2427-2442dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1779-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01157naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100001900168245009100187300001600278520018600294592002800480653001800508653001600526653001400542653001100556653001500567653001800582700001600600773011400616856011600730852000900846655001200855IND60126772720221120112626.0151107e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012677272DNAL7 a10.3157/0013-872X(2007)118[357:ANSONA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnano, Luigi12aA new species of neotournieria apfelbeck, 1932 (coleoptera: curculionidae) from turkey  ap. 357-360.  aNeotournieria ambigener n. sp. from Turkey is described and compared with the three known species of the genus.

A nearest-neighbourhood autoregressive moving average (NN-ARMA) modelling technique along with linear regression has been used to predict localized soil SOM variation based on topographical characteristics and vegetation indices in semi-arid region of Saudi Arabia. Seven topographic variables derived using DEM, and twelve vegetation indices obtained from Landsat 8 used in the model. The best NN-ARMA model showed seven significant variables explaining 96.4% of the total variation of SOM, whereas the best linear regression model could explain 78.8% of the total variation of SOM. The results showed that NN-ARMA model gave better results compared to the linear regression model. Our research gave a better understanding of the possibility of accurate estimation of SOM using the NN-ARMA approach using topographical characteristics and vegetation indices easily acquired by RS sensors.  aPublisher supplied data  aG.R.P. 172: 1440 3aLandsat 3acarbon sequestration 3aglobal carbon budget 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3astochastic processes 3atopography 3avegetation 3aSaudi Arabia 0aSoil organic matter 0asemi-arid region 0anearest-neighbourhood ARMA 0alinear regression 0atopographic variables 0avegetation indices1 aAhmed, Mohd1 aAlqadhi, Saeed Dhafer1 aFalqi, Ibrahim I.1 aParayangat, Muneer1 aSingh, Chander Kumar1 aRahman, Atiqur1 aIjyas, Thafasal0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Jan. 7, v. 37, no. 2 p.413-444dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.17203143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245007600172300002000248520091600268592002801184650002301212650002201235650001401257650001001271650001801281650001401299650001701313650001401330650003701344700002601381773012401407856007401531852000901605655001201614IND60664925420221117194105.0190912e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066492542DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra01204f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaria Nithya, Jeghan Shrine10aEfficient mixed metal oxide routed synthesis of boron nitride nanotubes  ap. 26697-26705.  aBoron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) were successfully synthesized by a simple annealing process. Amorphous boron powder (B) was used as boron source to react with various metal oxide mixtures (V₂O₅/Fe₂O₃ and V₂O₅/Ni₂O₃). V₂O₅ acts as an efficient promoter in the synthetic process due to its highly oxidizing and reducing properties. The Fe₂O₃ and Ni₂O₃ act as catalysts in combination with the B/V₂O₅ system to achieve highly crystalline BNNTs at 1100 °C. The morphology and crystalline nature of the BNNTs were characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The observations revealed the hexagonal-BN (h-BN) phase of the BNNTs, with a highly crystalline tubular structure. This method proved to be simple and economical, using B/V₂O₅/Fe₂O₃ and B/V₂O₅/Ni₂O₃ mixtures for the large scale production of BNNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3aboron 3aboron nitride 3acatalysts 3aferric oxide 3ananotubes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPandurangan, Arumugam0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 20, v. 4, no. 51 p.26697-26705dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra01204f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245009900167300001600266520236500282592002802647650003002675650001502705650001202720650001602732650001502748650001802763650001102781650001102792650001102803650001202814650002202826650001002848650003102858650001902889650001802908650002202926650001602948650002102964650001502985651001203000700002703012700002003039700002603059700001903085700002103104700001703125773011703142856007803259852000903337655001203346IND60466683020221121230557.0151127e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046668302DNAL7 a10.3398/064.075.03122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreiber, Leslie A.10aMicrohabitat Selection of Brood-Rearing Sites by Greater Sage-Grouse in Carbon County, Wyoming  ap. 348-363.  aDeclines in Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse) populations could be attributed to low chick survival, which may be influenced by the availability of food and cover at sites used by females rearing broods. Habitat attributes important to broods may vary regionally; thus, it is necessary to understand factors affecting regional sage-grouse brood-rearing site selection, especially when estimating the impacts of development. We monitored brood-rearing female sage-grouse equipped with solar Argos Global Positioning System Platform Transmitter Terminals from 2011 to 2013 to assess microhabitat selection by broods in Carbon County, Wyoming. We measured vegetation and arthropod characteristics at diurnal sites used by broods (n = 42 in 2011, n = 31 in 2012, n = 32 in 2013) and at 3 paired-random sites associated with each used site (n = 315), located 50 m, 250 m, and 500 m from the used site. We fit conditional logistic models within an information-theoretic framework to identify vegetation and arthropod characteristics associated with microsite selection of brood-rearing sites. Sage-grouse selected brood-rearing sites with greater visual obstruction (0–45.7 cm in height), higher numbers of arthropods in the order Diptera, and lower numbers of arthropods in the order Coleoptera. There was an interaction effect between the number of arthropods in the order Hymenoptera and the canopy cover of broad-leaf forbs; the relative probability of selection increased with increasing number of Hymenoptera when there was low cover (<20%) of broad-leaf forbs, but decreased with increasing number of Hymenoptera when there was high broad-leaf forb cover (>20%). We also found a quadratic relationship between selection of brood-rearing sites and total vegetation canopy cover; the relative probability of selection increased until approximately 75% cover and then decreased with increasing cover. Sage-grouse rearing broods selected a diverse array of vegetation types, but greatest use occurred within mesic communities. Our results could be used to identify vegetation communities with high relative probabilities of use by sage-grouse rearing broods, which will help guide management decisions and provide reference conditions for future research that evaluates the effects of wind energy development on sage-grouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aHymenoptera 3aarthropods 3abrood rearing 3acanopy 3acarbon 3achicks 3afemales 3afood availability 3aforbs 3aglobal positioning systems 3alogit analysis 3amicrohabitats 3aplant communities 3aprobability 3avegetation types 3awind power 3aWyoming1 aHansen, Christopher P.1 aRumble, Mark A.1 aMillspaugh, Joshua J.1 aGamo, R.

Serum bilirubin has antioxidant properties and may serve as a biomarker of oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship of BPA and phthalates with serum bilirubin levels in a Korean population. Urinary concentrations of BPA and six phthalate [mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5- hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP)] were measured in 709 participants. Serum concentrations of BPA and three phthalate metabolites [MnBP, MiBP, and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP)] were measured in 752 participants. After excluding missing variables, associations between above chemicals and serum bilirubin levels were analyzed using multivariate linear regression with age, sex, BMI, GGT, GOT, GPT, and alcohol intake adjustment. Participants were further stratified by sex. Among the urinary chemicals, BPA and four phthalate metabolites (MnBP, MEOHP, MEHHP and MECPP) were inversely associated with serum bilirubin levels (BPA: β = − 0.071, P < 0.0001; MnBP: β = − 0.055, P = 0.025; MEOHP: β = − 0.101, P < 0.0001; MEHHP: β = − 0.106, P < 0.0001; MECPP: β = − 0.052, P = 0.003). In a case of serum chemicals, only MiBP showed significantly positive association (β = 0.036, P = 0.016). After stratification by sex, the associations of urinary BPA remained both in male and female, of which urinary phthalates disappeared in female. The association of serum MiBP was disappeared after stratification. Urinary BPA and phthalate metabolites were inversely associated with serum bilirubin levels, whereas serum MiBP showed positive association with bilirubin. These results could provide clues for understanding the mechanisms of endocrine disruptor from oxidative stress to excretion from our body.  aPublisher supplied data  a18162MFDS121cMinistry of Food and Drug Safety 3aalcohol drinking 3aantioxidant activity 3abilirubin 3abiomarkers 3abisphenol A 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aexcretion 3afemales 3amales 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3aphthalates 3aregression analysis1 aYi, Sŏn-ju,1 aJeon, Jooeun1 aJung, Keum Ji1 aJee, Sun Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9519-30680 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2019 Sept., v. 26, no. 26 p.26685-26695dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05205-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245006800166500001900234520149200253592002801745650001301773650001601786650001201802650002301814650001501837650002501852650001301877650001501890650002401905650000901929653001501938653003301953653002701986653002302013653002202036700001702058700001902075773011902094856008802213852000902301655001202310IND60717299720221121144502.0210201e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071729972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min10aKey coastal landscape patterns for reducing flood vulnerability  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of the present study was to examine key coastal landscape patterns related to flood vulnerability to support resilience strategies for coastal green infrastructure. To this end, we assessed the flood vulnerability of coastal landscapes based on three indicators: exposure, including precipitation; sensitivity, including elevation, slope, soil, drainage, and density; and adaptability, including urban land-use. Subsequently, we investigated whether landscape patterns, including the shape index and subdivision index, would affect flood vulnerability through a multivariate regression analysis, which allowed us to determine key coastal landscape patterns. At the regional scale, including the overall study site, we suggested strategies for green infrastructure planning, focusing on patch shapes of forest, grassland, and water. At each local scale, a variety of landscape patterns were selected: the contiguity index of used area for the central subregion: the division index of forests, the contiguity of water, and the fractal dimension index of used area for the northeast subregion; the circumscribing circle index of barren and wetlands for the northwest subregion; the division and fractal index of forests for the southwest subregion; and the division index of forests and the fractal index of water for the southeast subregion. Based on the derived landscape patterns of each subregion, we propose coastal green infrastructure planning with resilience strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aenvironment 3aforests 3afractal dimensions 3agrasslands 3agreen infrastructure 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asoil 0aResilience 0aCoastal green infrastructure 0aFuzzy overlay analysis 0aSpatial statistics 0aLandscape metrics1 aSong, Kihwan1 aChon, Jinhyung0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 759 p.143454-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170300001600263520143100279592002801710650001501738650001601753650001601769650002601785650001701811650001801828650001701846650002301863650002101886650001301907650001301920650001801933650002201951650001101973650001501984653001301999653001902012653001902031653002102050653001302071700002002084773010402104856008502208852000902293655001202302IND60635027520221121145846.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063502752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigo, Ana P.14aThe hidden biotechnological potential of marine invertebrates: The Polychaeta case study  ap. 270-280.  aMarine biotechnology is under the spotlight, as researchers and industrialists become aware that bioprospecting through the oceans' vast biodiversity can replace the painstaking process of designing synthetic compounds. Millions of years of Natural Selection provided an almost inexhaustible source of marine products that can interfere with specific bioprocesses while being cost-effective, safer and more environmentally friendly. Still, the number of commercial applications of marine compounds, especially from eumetazoans, can seem disappointing. In most part, this results from the challenges of dealing with an immense biodiversity and with poorly known organisms with uncanny physiology. Consequently, shifting the current perspective from descriptive science to actually proposing applications can be a major incentive to industry. With this in mind, the present review focuses on one of the least studied but most representative group of marine animals: the Polychaeta annelids. Occupying nearly every marine habitat, from the deep sea to the intertidal, they can offer a wide array of natural products that are just beginning to be understood, showing properties compatible with anaesthetics, fluorescent probes, and even antibiotics and pesticides, for instance. Altogether, they are a showcase for the ocean's real biotechnological deterrent, albeit our still wispy knowledge on this vast and ancient environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aanesthetics 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiodiversity 3abiotechnology 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescent dyes 3ahabitats 3aindustry 3alittoral zone 3anatural selection 3aoceans 3apesticides 0aAnnelida 0aBioprospecting 0aDrug discovery 0aNatural products 0aVenomics1 aCosta, Pedro M.0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 June, v. 173 p.270-280dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245014300177300001600320520152200336592002801858650002301886650002601909650001901935650001701954650001301971650001401984650001301998650002802011650002602039650002202065650001602087650001902103650001502122650001802137650002002155650001802175650001302193650002602206653002202232653003202254653005902286700005802345700001402403700001302417773011902430856008802549852000902637655001202646IND60583761720221119134940.0181010e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058376172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Cabo, T.10aEvaluation of the aqueous phototransformation routes of phenyl ethyl azolic fungicides by liquid chromatography accurate mass spectrometry  ap. 942-954.  aSimilarities and differences among the phototransformation routes of four azolic fungicides (diniconazole, DIN, imazalil, IMA; penconazole, PEN; and propiconazole, PRO) in surface water aliquots are investigated. Selected compounds share a common chemical structure consisting on dichlorophenyl and azolic rings connected through an ethylene bridge, which is substituted with different functionalities. Liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) was employed as analytical technique to follow the time-course of precursor fungicides and to detect and to identify their photo-transformation products (TPs). Under solar light, the substituents linked to the ethylene chain controlled the stability of the fungicides. Whilst PEN and PRO remained stable, DIN and IMA showed moderate reactivities, with half-lives (t1/2) of 5.1 and 33.5h, respectively. When exposed to UV (254nm) radiation, all compounds were effectively degraded with t1/2 in the range from seconds to a few minutes. Dechlorination followed by intramolecular cyclization, between phenyl and azolic rings, was identified as a common phototransformation route under UV irradiation. Depending on the length and the kind of the functionalities attached to the ethylene bridge, additional cyclization reactions are also possible. In-silico toxicity predictions pointed out to dechlorinated tricyclic TPs as the most concerning ones, with predicted lethal concentrations (LC50) in the same range as the precursor fungicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acyclization reactions 3adechlorination 3adiniconazole 3aethylene 3ahalf life 3aimazalil 3alethal concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apenconazole 3aphotochemistry 3aprediction 3apropiconazole 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 0aAzolic fungicides 0aAqueous phototransformation 0aLiquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry1 aRodríguez, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9693-20421 aRamil, M.1 aCela, R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 615 p.942-954dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001600272520159900288592002801887650002401915650001401939650002401953650000901977650001901986650002002005650001102025650002102036650001902057650000902076653002702085653001702112653001602129653002902145653002202174653001802196700002002214700001702234700002102251700001502272773010402287856008502391852000902476655001202485IND60635027620221122002357.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063502762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Beom Yeol10aDesign and analysis of phase change material based floor heating system for thermal energy storage  ap. 480-488.  aPleasant interior space is essential for modern people who spend considerably more time in the buildings than they did in the past. To achieve this, one aspect includes an ambient temperature that maintains the thermal equilibrium of the human body. The construction of wood framed buildings is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, and there have been recent trends toward constructing high-rise wooden houses. In this respect, heating methods appropriate for use in wooden buildings are being studied. Dry floor heating systems are predominantly used in wooden houses, but they provide a poor heat storage performance, which is not conducive to saving energy. In this study, the effects of thermal comfort and energy savings were analyzed after applying a phase change material (PCM) to floor heating, which can be used to reduce the peak temperature and contribute to energy savings. To enable shape stabilization, this study used Macro-Packed PCM (MPPCM), as shape stabilization is necessary when applying PCM. The heat storage performance was improved by applying MPPCM to a dry floor heating system. Paraffin-based PCMs, such as n-octadecane, n-eicosane, and n-docosane, were used to obtain a comfortable floor temperature range. Experimental temperatures ranged from 28 °C to 35 °C, with an entire temperature range of 7 °C. Experimental results showed that the heat storage performance of MPPCM reduced the amount of energy used for heating by 43%, and n-eicosane was the most effective PCM for use in floor heating with respect to obtaining a comfortable floor temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abuildings 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aheating systems 3ahumans 3aphase transition 3athermal energy 3awood 0aPhase change materials 0aHeat storage 0aLatent heat 0aDry floor heating system 0aPower consumption 0aEnergy saving1 aYang, Sungwoong1 aCho, Hyun Mi1 aChang, Seong Jin1 aKim, Sumin0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 June, v. 173 p.480-488dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245015400180300001600334520129900350592002801649650001301677650002501690650001001715650001001725650001001735650001001745650001201755650001701767650001401784650002301798650001401821651001901835700001601854700001501870700001401885700002201899700001801921700001401939773012501953856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60516730020221122005111.0190727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051673002DNAL7 a215548342pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X110001742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, R.10aFirst record of Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum through the non-invasive sampling of Anguis fragilis: complementary morphological and molecular detection  ap. 125-129.  aRelatively few studies have examined the parasite fauna of British reptiles, partly due to the cryptic nature and low population density of these hosts. Here we examined 12 populations of the slow worm Anguis fragilis which, unlike other UK lizards, occurs at locally high population densities. Morphological examination of non-invasively collected faecal samples revealed the presence of Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum and a second unidentified nematode species. Although previously unrecorded from slow worms in the UK, N. brevicaudatum was present in 38% of animals (mean intensity 70.9, range 1–686). Morphological identification was confirmed by sequencing the 18S ribosomal gene. The use of the species-specific, cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene primers proved an efficient alternative to conventional, microscope screening for parasites, although the original identification of N. brevicaudatum was dependent upon morphological characters. Sequencing also identified the second, smaller nematode as belonging to the Rhabdiasidae family: this species was even more common at a prevalence of 83% (mean intensity 102.8, range 1–2000). While increasing our knowledge of the UK macroparasite fauna, this work demonstrates the benefits of a combined morphological–molecular approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afauna 3afeces 3agenes 3ahosts 3alizards 3amitochondria 3aparasites 3apopulation density 3ascreening 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBrown, D.S.1 aHarris, E.1 aJones, J.1 aSymondson, W.O.C.1 aBruford, M.W.1 aCable, J.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 Mar., v. 86, no. 1 p.125-129dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X110001743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003400146245012900180500001900309520140000328592002801728650001401756650001301770650001201783650001401795650001801809650001201827650002201839650001501861650001901876650001701895650002401912650001201936650002001948650000901968650001401977650001701991650002502008700002602033700003202059700002902091773012202120856008002242852000902322655001202331IND60731965920221123014000.0210326e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073196592DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Pérez, César  A.10aIn Vitro Screening of Sugarcane Cultivars (Saccharum spp. Hybrids) for Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Induced Water Stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater stress caused by drought affects the productivity of the sugarcane crop. A breeding alternative is the selection of drought-tolerant sugarcane cultivars. The objective of this study was the in vitro screening of cultivars tolerant to water stress using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a stressing agent. Cultivars (cv) Mex 69-290, CP 72-2086, Mex 79-431 and MOTZMex 92-207 were subjected to different concentrations of PEG 6000 (0, 3, 6 and 9% w/v) using Murashige and Skoog semi-solid culture medium. At 30 days of culture, different developmental variables and dry matter (DM), total protein (TP), proline (Pr) and glycine-betaine (GB) contents were evaluated. The results showed reduced development in cv CP 72-2086, Mex 79-431 and MOTZMex 92-207 with increasing PEG concentration. The cv Mex 69-290 showed tolerance to osmotic stress of −0.45 MPa using 3% PEG. Overall, TP content decreased with increasing PEG concentration, while DM, Pr and GB contents rose with increasing PEG concentration in all evaluated cultivars. Our results suggest that cv Mex 69-290 has a slight tolerance to water stress and could be used for rainfed cultivation with low rainfall or reduced irrigation for better water use efficiency. In conclusion, the in vitro screening technique of cultivars tolerant to PEG-induced water stress is an alternative for early determination of drought stress in sugarcane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aagronomy 3abetaine 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3airrigation 3aosmotic stress 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproline 3aprotein content 3arain 3asugarcane 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency1 aGómez-Merino, F.

The sporocyst body consists of a mass of branching and intertwining hollow tubules that ramify through the host's digestive gland and gonads. This study investigated the ultrastructure of the sporocyst branches which comprise alternate distended areas (brood chambers) with a relatively thin body wall, narrower portions with a thicker body wall (constricted areas) and terminal regions. Pronounced differences between these areas were revealed in the structure of their tegument and body cavity lining, as well as in the cellular composition of the subtegumental layers. Body wall composition in distended areas was consistent with the specialization for cercarial nurture in the brood chambers. The structure of the constrictions suggested a dual role of nutrient absorption and physical separation of adjacent brood chambers. Two types of terminal region were identified, one specialized for the investigation and penetration of host tissues and the other, in which the germinal cells are formed, for cercarial production. The overall structure of the sporocyst branches helps explain why this linear modular system, i.e. brood chambers and constrictions continuously growing into the host tissue, enables the sporocyst's long-term existence and can continuously produce cercariae in numbers comparable with those produced by rediae and/or daughter sporocyst infrapopulations in other digeneans. The origin of the nuclei in the outer tegumental layer of some branching bucephalid sporocysts is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbra prismatica 3aBucephalidae 3aabsorption 3acercariae 3agonads 3aintegument 3atissues 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aGalaktionov, K.V.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.173-184dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X110001373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005000148245008500198300001800283520159900301592002801900596007301928596009002001596007502091596006802166596006302234650002502297650001402322650001602336650001002352650003002362650001602392650003002408650004202438650001402480650001902494650001602513650001802529650002402547650001002571650001402581650001602595650001402611650002102625650001302646650001702659650003202676700001602708700001702724700001502741700001702756700001902773773010602792856008302898852000902981655001202990IND60780968420221118095352.0220623e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078096842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-022-03143-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7737-457510aFibroblast growth factor 9 attenuates sepsis-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice  ap. 1069-1081.  aSepsis-induced fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a fatal syndrome that has a worse prognosis in clinical practice. Hence, seeking effective agents for sepsis-induced FH treatment is urgently needed. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are vital for tissue homeostasis and damage repair in various organs including the liver. Our study aims to investigate the protective effects and potential mechanisms of FGF9 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-Gal)-induced FH in mice. We found that pre-treatment with FGF9 exhibited remarkable hepaprotective effects on liver damage caused by LPS/D-Gal, as manifested by the concomitant decrease in mortality and serum aminotransferase activities, and the attenuation of hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic histopathological abnormalities in LPS/D-Gal-intoxicated mice. We further found that FGF9 alleviated the infiltration of neutrophils into the liver, and decreased the serum levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LPS/D-Gal-challenged mice. These effects can be explained at least in part by the inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, FGF9 enhanced the antioxidative defense system in mice livers by upregulating the expression of NRF-2-related antioxidative enzymes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These data indicate that FGF9 represents a promising therapeutic drug for ameliorating sepsis-induced FH via its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory capacities.  aPublisher supplied data  aLY19H160029cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  aZY201702122cTCM project of Chongqing Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission  a2021A1515012229cGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  acstc2019jcyj-msxmX0045cNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing  a82174058cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3afibroblast growth factors 3afibroblasts 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahepatitis 3ahistopathology 3ahomeostasis 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amortality 3aneutrophils 3aprognosis 3aprotein subunits 3aquinones 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLi, Xue-Mei1 aSong, Chu-Ge1 aXiao, Xiao1 aYao, Weimin,1 aTian, Hai-Shan0 tAmino acids.g2022 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.1069-1081dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-022-03143-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245012600174500001900300520185900319592002802178650002002206650001902226650001802245650001302263650002502276650001202301650001202313650002302325650002502348650001902373650001202392650001502404650003102419650002302450650001502473650001302488650001802501650001402519650001302533650002302546650002302569650001502592650001702607650001402624650001102638650002802649650001402677700002502691700002202716700002302738700002602761700002602787773012202813856008002935852000903015655001203024IND60731966020221121075106.0210326e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073196602DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110305992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrysargyris, Antonios 10aOrganic Cultivation and Deficit Irrigation Practices to Improve Chemical and Biological Activity of Mentha spicata Plants  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntensive crop production and irrational use of fertilizers and agrochemicals have questionable effects on the quality of products and the sustainable use of water for agricultural purposes. Organic cultivation and/or deficit irrigation are, among others, well appreciated practices for a sustainable crop production system. In the present study, spearmint plants (Mentha spicata L.) were grown in different cultivation schemes (conventional versus organic cultivation, full versus deficit irrigation), and effects on the plant physiological and biochemical attributes were examined in two harvesting periods. Deficit irrigation decreased plant growth, but increased total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of the plants at the second harvest. Spearmint nutrient accumulation was affected by the examined cultivation practices; nitrogen was decreased in organic cultivation, potassium and sodium were elevated at full-irrigated plants, while magnesium, phosphorus, and copper levels were higher at the deficit-irrigated plants. However, conventional/full-irrigated plants had increased height and fresh biomass at the first harvest. Essential oil content decreased at the second harvest in organic and/or deficit treated plants. Additionally, deficit irrigation affected plant growth and delayed the formation of carvone from limonene. The essential oils were further evaluated with regard to their bioactivity on a major vineyard pest Lobesia botrana. Volatile compounds from all essential oils elicited strong electroantennographic responses on female insects antennae, highlighting the role of carvone, which is the major constituent (~70%) in all the tested essential oils. M. spicata essential oils also exhibited larvicidal activity on L. botrana, suggesting the potential of their incorporation in integrated pest management systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobesia botrana 3aMentha spicata 3aagrochemicals 3aagronomy 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3acarvone 3adeficit irrigation 3aelectroantennography 3aessential oils 3afemales 3aflavonoids 3aintegrated pest management 3aintensive cropping 3alarvicides 3alimonene 3alipid content 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3aorganic production 3aphenolic compounds 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asodium 3asustainable agriculture 3avineyards1 aKoutsoumpeli, Eleni 1 aXylia, Panayiota 1 aFytrou, Anastasia 1 aKōnstantopoulou, M.,1 aTzortzakis, Nikolaos 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110305993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245016500182300001600347520146200363592002801825650001901853650001901872650001701891650001001908650001201918650001001930650001901940650001101959650001401970650001401984700002401998700001802022700002302040700001502063700001902078773012502097856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60516730220221121232903.0190727e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051673022DNAL7 a215548362pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X110001492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAznar, F.J.10aAssessing host–parasite specificity through coprological analysis: a case study with species of Corynosoma (Acanthocephala: Polymorphidae) from marine mammals  ap. 156-164.  aIn this paper we report an investigation of the utility of coprological analysis as an alternative technique to study parasite specificity whenever host sampling is problematic; acanthocephalans from marine mammals were used as a model. A total of 252 scats from the South American sea lion, Otaria flavescens, and rectal faeces from 43 franciscanas, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Buenos Aires Province, were examined for acanthocephalans. Specimens of two species, i.e. Corynosoma australe and C. cetaceum, were collected from both host species. In sea lions, 78 out of 145 (37.9%) females of C. australe were gravid and the sex ratio was strongly female-biased. However, none of the 168 females of C. cetaceum collected was gravid and the sex ratio was not female-biased. Conversely, in franciscanas, 14 out of 17 (82.4%) females of C. cetaceum were gravid, but none of 139 females of C. australe was, and the sex ratio of C. cetaceum, but not that of C. australe, was female-biased. In putative non-hosts, the size of worms was similar to that from specimens collected from prey. Results suggest that both acanthocephalans contact sea lions and franciscanas regularly. However, C. australe and C. cetaceum cannot apparently reproduce, nor even grow, in franciscanas and sea lions, respectively. Coprological analysis may represent a useful supplementary method to investigate parasite specificity, particularly when host carcasses are difficult to obtain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aOtaria bryonia 3acase studies 3afeces 3afemales 3ahosts 3amarine mammals 3amodels 3aparasites 3asex ratio1 aHernández-Orts, J.1 aSuárez, A.A.1 aGarcía-Varela, M.1 aRaga, J.A.1 aCappozzo, H.L.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.156-164dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X110001493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245016500164300001600329520202100345592002802366650000802394650002102402650001502423650001702438650002302455650001202478650001802490650003502508650003102543650002102574650002202595650001102617650001902628650001202647650004302659650000902702650002402711650001302735650001502748650001202763653001602775653001802791653002202809653001802831653002602849653001402875700001702889700001402906700001702920700001502937700001502952773011302967856008403080852000903164655001203173IND60590632920221122065828.0190129e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059063292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuan10aMid-gestational sevoflurane exposure inhibits fetal neural stem cell proliferation and impairs postnatal learning and memory function in a dose-dependent manner  ap. 185-197.  aAdvancements in fetal intervention procedures have led to increases in the number of pregnant women undergoing general anesthesia during the second trimester—a period characterized by extensive proliferation of fetal neural stem cells (NSCs). However, few studies have investigated the effects of mid-gestational sevoflurane exposure on fetal NSC proliferation or postnatal learning and memory function. In the present study, pregnant rats were randomly assigned to a control group (C group), a low sevoflurane concentration group (2%; L group), a high sevoflurane concentration group (3.5%; H group), a high sevoflurane concentration plus lithium chloride group (H + Li group), and a lithium chloride group (Li group) at gestational day 14. Rats received different concentrations of sevoflurane anesthesia for 2 h. The offspring rats were weaned at 28 days for behavioral testing (i.e., Morris Water Maze [MWM]), and fetal brains or postnatal hippocampal tissues were harvested for immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and Western blotting analyses in order to determine the effect of sevoflurane exposure on NSC proliferation and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our results indicated that maternal exposure to 3.5% sevoflurane (H group) during the mid-gestational period impaired the performance of offspring rats in the MWM test, reduced NSC proliferation, and increased protein levels of fetal glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). Such treatment also decreased levels of β-catenin protein, CD44 RNA, and Cyclin D1 RNA relative to those observed in the C group. However, these effects were transiently attenuated by treatment with lithium chloride. Conversely, maternal exposure to 2% sevoflurane (L group) did not influence NSC proliferation or the Wnt signaling pathway. Our results suggest that sevoflurane exposure during the second trimester inhibits fetal NSC proliferation via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and impairs postnatal learning and memory function in a dose-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aanesthesia 3abeta catenin 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3adose response 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3alithium chloride 3amaternal exposure 3amemory 3apregnant women 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3astem cells 3atissues 0aSevoflurane 0aMid-gestation 0aNeural stem cells 0aProliferation 0aWnt signaling pathway 0aPregnancy1 aYin, Shaowei1 aXue, Hang1 aYang, Yating1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhao, Ping0 tDevelopmental biology.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 435, no. 2 p.185-197dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012500168300002000293520114400313592002801457596006801485596006801553596014801621650001101769650001901780650002501799650001101824650002901835650001101864650001301875650002201888650001001910651001001920700001501930700001301945700001701958700001701975773016901992856008202161852000902243655001202252IND60654056720221118012805.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05468-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatima, Tehreem10aDecomposition analysis of energy-related CO2 emission in the industrial sector of China: Evidence from the LMDI approach  ap. 21736-21749.  aEnergy consumption and increasing CO₂ emissions in China are mainly indorsed to the industrial sector. The objective of this study was to explore the main factors driving CO₂ emissions in China’s industry throughout 1991–2016. Based on the log-mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, this study decomposes the change of industry-related CO₂ emissions into energy structure effect, income effect, energy intensity effect, carbon emission, and labor effect. The core results indicate that CO₂ emissions in China’s industry experienced a significant increase from 738.5 to 7271.8 Mt during 1991–2013, while it decreased to 6844.0 Mt in 2016. The income effect and labor effect are the top two emitters, which accounted for increases of 351.8 Mt and 57.8 Mt in CO₂ emissions respectively. Additionally, the energy structure effect also played a role in increasing CO₂ emissions. Energy intensity and carbon emission effects are the most important factors in reducing CO₂ emissions. The policy suggestions about the different period-wise analyses in terms of economic growth, energy structure, and energy intensity are provided.  aPublisher supplied data  a71874193;71503249cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016QNRC001cYoung Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST  aSKLCRSM16KFC05cthe Open Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safe Mining (China University of Mining and Technology) 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3aChina1 aXia, Enjun1 aCao, Zhe1 aKhan, Danish1 aFan, Jing-Li0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 21 p.21736-21749dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05468-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167520139800280592002801678650001401706650002101720650003001741650001501771650002001786650002101806650001901827650001701846650001901863650001201882650001901894650001401913650001201927650002101939653003001960653002601990653001302016653000802029700001202037700001702049700001602066700001602082700001702098700001802115700005702133773011002190856008502300852000902385655001202394IND60753011620221122220614.0220214e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075301162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1182772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuchen10aMechanistic insights into soil heavy metals desorption by biodegradable polyelectrolyte under electric field  aIn this study, we firstly used alginate to enhance an electrokinetic technology to remediate soil contaminated with divalent heavy metals (Pb²⁺, Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺). The mechanisms of alginate-associated migration of metal ions in electric field were confirmed. Alginate resulted in a high electrical current during electrokinetic process, and soil conductivity also increased after remediation. Obvious changes in both electroosmotic flow and soil pH were observed. Moreover, these factors were affected by increasing alginate dosage. The highest Cu (95.82%) and Zn (97.33%) removal efficiencies were obtained by introducing 1 wt% alginate. Alginate can desorb Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ ions from soil by forming unstable gels, which could be dissociated through electrolysis. However, Pb²⁺ ions did not easily migrate out of the contaminated soil. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations show Pb²⁺ ions could form a more stable coordination sphere in metal complexes than Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ ions. The metal removal efficiency was decreased by increasing alginate dosage at a high level. More alginate could provide more carboxyl ligands for divalent metal ions to stabilize gels, which were difficult to dissociate by electrolysis. In summary, the results indicate it is potential for introducing alginate into an electrokinetic system to remediate Cu- and Zn- contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiodegradability 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3adivalent metals 3aelectric current 3aelectric field 3aelectrolysis 3aelectroosmosis 3aligands 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3asoil pH 3asoil remediation 0aElectrokinetic technology 0aDivalent heavy metals 0aAlginate 0aDFT1 aLi, Ang1 aRen, Binqiao1 aHan, Zijian1 aLin, Junhao1 aZhang, Qiwei1 aCao, Tingting1 aCui, Chongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9587-27110 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 292 p.118277-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1182773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245020500167300001600372520075900388592002801147650002301175650002101198650001501219651001101234651001001245651001101255651002901266651001101295773010701306856007601413852000901489655001201498IND60523944720221123013345.0190423e20130529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052394472DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.2008.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGęsiński, Krzysztof10aEvaluation of the development and yielding potential of Chenopodium quinoa Willd. under the climatic conditions of Europe.

E-DK-4-PQCIP variety in cluster II showed a very high yield of green matter and a mean seed yield, and in cluster IV - a very high seed yield and a high yield of green matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aclimatic factors 3aseed yield 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aPoland 3aSouthern European region 3aSweden0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 61, no. 1 p.179-184dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2008.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001900151245011500170300001600285520092900301592002801230650000801258650003001266650002701296650001601323650001501339650001501354650002001369650001001389650001201399650001601411650002801427650002501455650003001480650001401510650002201524650003001546650001301576700001501589700001801604700001801622773010001640856008701740852000901827655001201836IND4464774620221120141952.0141112e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446477462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Dingding10aEffects of sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfate concentrations on mercury methylation in freshwater sediments  ap. 331-336.  aMethylmercury (MeHg) is the most poisonous form of mercury (Hg) and it enters the human body primarily through consumption of Hg contaminated fish. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are major producers of MeHg in anoxic sediments. The dsrAB gene was isolated from freshwater fish pond sediments. Sequence analyses showed that the SRB in sediments was mainly composed of Desulfobulbus propionicus and Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The two species of SRB were cultured from freshwater sediments. The addition of inorganic Hg to these freshwater sediments caused an increase in MeHg concentrations at 30days incubation. MeHg levels were sensitive to sulfate concentrations; a medium sulfate level (0.11mg/g) produced higher levels than treatments lacking sulfate addition or when amended with 0.55mg/g. Assessment of bacterial levels by PCR measurements of microbial DNA indicated that the MeHg levels were correlated with cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDesulfobulbus propionicus 3aDesulfovibrio vulgaris 3acell growth 3afish ponds 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agenes 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates1 aKang, Yuan1 aWu, Shengchun1 aWong, Ming H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 May 1, v. 424 p.331-336dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001800200245007100218300001600289520163500305592002801940650000901968650000901977650001601986650001802002650001702020650002102037650001002058650002502068650002302093650001202116650003002128650003402158650005002192650002102242650006302263650003602326650000902362650002902371650002502400650000902425650002502434650002402459650002502483653003202508653001802540653001802558653001902576653000902595700001902604700001902623700001902642700002402661773011602685852000902801856008302810655001202893IND2059820020221121013830.0181203e19960401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205982002DNAL7 a87831772pmid7 a10.1258/0023677967808657362doi4 a0023-6772(19960401)30:2L.149;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöttger, A.,10aStrain-specific response to hypercholesterolaemic diets in the rat  ap. 149-157.  aThe cholesterolaemic effect of 2 hypercholesterolaemic diets was tested in 12 rat inbred strains. Diet I is a commercial diet supplemented with 2.0% (w/w) cholesterol and 5.0% (w/w) olive oil, diet II is identical to diet I with addition of 0.5% (w/w) sodium cholate. Strains with the highest plasma cholesterol response after diet I (BN and LEW) also had the highest cholesterol response after diet II (hyperresponders, mean response>3.5 mmol/l). In the strains DA, SHR, BC, WAC, LOU, PVG and BUF the strain mean cholesterol response remained below 1.3mmol/l after both diets (hyporesponders). Strains F344 and OM had an intermediate cholesterol response after both diets (normoresponders, mean response between 1.3 and 3.5 mmol/l). Only in the strains LOU, PVG and SHR there appeared to be a significant higher cholesterol response after diet II when compared with the cholesterol response after diet I. In the strain WKY this difference was of a borderline significance (P=0.052) and this strain turned from a normoresponder after diet I into a hyperresponder after diet II. Liver cholesterol levels as measured after feeding diet II for two weeks also appeared to be strain-specific. No correlation was found between the plasma cholesterol response after diet II and the liver cholesterol levels. Changes in plasma phospholipid and triglyceride levels have been measured for both diet I and diet II. For group means a correlation between the cholesterol response and the change in phospholipid levels was found (r=0.86 for diet I, P<0.001 and r=0.76 for diet II, P<0.01). No such correlation was found for triglyceride levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3arats 3acholesterol 3aphospholipids 3ablood plasma 3atriacylglycerols 3aliver 3ahypercholesterolemia 3astrain differences 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCholesterolxanalysisxblood. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aFood, Formulated 2aHypercholesterolemiaxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMale 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0aPLASMA CHOLESTEROL RESPONSE 0aPHOSPHOLIPIDS 0aTRIGLYCERIDES 0aINBRED STRAINS 0aRATS1 aden Bieman, M.1 aLankhorst, Æ.1 avan Lith, H.A.1 avan Zutphen, L.F.M.0 tLaboratory animals.g1996 Apr. 01, v. 30, no. 2 p.149-157dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677967808657363Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03962naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245019300165300001600358520208200374592002802456650001502484650001802499650001502517650001002532650001002542650002002552650002102572650001902593650001902612650001802631650003702649650001902686650002102705650001602726650001102742650002602753650003602779650001002815650001302825650001102838651001002849653002802859653001002887653001802897653001402915653001402929653001102943700001502954700001502969700001702984700001803001700001703019700002603036700002203062700001803084700001203102773010403114856008503218852000903303655001203312IND60635028020221122021441.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063502802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yueli14aThe impact on T-regulatory cell related immune responses in rural women exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in household air pollution in Gansu, China: A pilot investigation  ap. 306-317.  aPrevious studies found associations between impairments of immune functions and exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air pollution in the U. S. and China. However, the results remain inconclusive due to the limitations of these studies. In this study, we aimed to examine the direction and magnitude of immune changes related to PAH exposure from household air pollution among rural women living in Gansu, China. Healthy village women (n = 34) were recruited and enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered. Blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed during non-heating (September 2017, “summer”) and heating (January 2018, “winter”) seasons. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) was quantified as the biomarker of PAH exposure. To evaluate Treg cell related immune functions, we examined immunoglobulin E (IgE), percent of T-regulatory (Treg) cells, and gene expression of following: forkhead box transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and interleukin 35 (IL-35), composed of interleukin-12 alpha (IL-12α) and Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (EBi3). Urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured to evaluate oxidative DNA damage. The results showed that the concentration of 1-OHP increased from 0.90 to 17.4 μmol mol-Cr −1 from summer to winter (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, average percent of Treg cells decreased from 5.01% to 1.15% (p < 0.001); IgE and mRNA expressions of Foxp3, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-12α and EBi3 all significantly decreased (p < 0.001); Urinary 8-OHdG increased from 12.7 to 30.3 ng mg-Cr −1 (p < 0.001). The changes in 8-OHdG, Foxp3 and TGF-β were significantly associated with the increase of 1-OHP. The results suggested that we observed a substantial increase of PAH exposure in winter, which was significantly associated with the repression on Treg cell function and oxidative DNA damage. Exposure to PAHs in household air pollution possibly induced immune impairments among rural women in northwest China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aair pollution 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3amessenger RNA 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aquestionnaires 3arural population 3arural women 3asummer 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 3aurine 3avillages 3awinter 3aChina 0aHousehold air pollution 0a1-OHP 0aImmune system 0aTreg cell 0aCytokines 0a8-OHdG1 aWang, Dong1 aMa, Haitao1 aLi, Chengyun1 aChang, Xiaoru1 aLow, Patrick1 aHammond, S.

W.10aHigh-Resolution Filtering for Improved Small Molecule Identification via GC/MS  ap. 8328-8335.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has long been considered one of the premiere analytical tools for small molecule analysis. Recently, a number of GC/MS systems equipped with high-resolution mass analyzers have been introduced. These systems provide analysts with a new dimension of information, accurate mass measurement to the third or fourth decimal place; however, existing data processing tools do not capitalize on this information. Beyond that, GC/MS spectral reference libraries, which have been curated over the last several decades, contain almost exclusively unit resolution MS spectra making integration of accurate mass data dubious. Here we present an informatic approach, called high-resolution filtering (HRF), which bridges this gap. During HRF, high-resolution mass spectra are assigned putative identifications through traditional spectral matching at unit resolution. Once candidate identities have been assigned, all unique combinations of atoms from these candidate precursors are generated and matched to m/z peaks using narrow mass tolerances. The total amount of measured signal that is annotated is used as a metric of plausibility for the presumed identification. Here we demonstrate that the HRF approach is both feasible and highly specific toward correct identifications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical elements 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alibraries1 aBailey, Derek J.1 aRush, Matthew

The key contribution of this work is to achieve the best parameters during the preparation of the suspension and find the best way to remove the excess triton X-100 from the nanotube network. The stability of suspension in different pH, the adsorption capacity, and the reusability of MWCNT was also evaluated. The effects of ultrasound parameters on the BP properties were systematically investigated and characterized by Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and electric resistivity using a four-point probe technique. In addition, the results of using different solvents to wash the BP after filtration process were analyzed by Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM). The optimum condition employed in this work (25min–40%) exhibited the ID/IG ratio of 2.17 and L002 of 5.597nm, which suggests less damage to MWCNT. This study confirms that MWCNT-BP can be used to fabricate high-loading CNT/polymer composites with improved electrical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMultiwalled carbon nanotube 0aBuckypaper 0aTriton X-100 0aUltrasound probe 0aAgglomerate1 aArdila-Rodríguez, L.A.1 aDiniz, M.F.1 aGonçalves, M.1 aRibeiro, B.1 aRezende, M.C.0 tMaterials and design.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 166 p.107612-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26823x0264-12757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2019.1076123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009900170500001900269520126500288592002801553650001601581650001701597650001601614650001701630650000901647650001801656650001001674650001501684651001501699653002301714653001501737653001401752700002301766700002101789700001701810700001901827700002301846700002101869773011901890856008802009852000902097655001202106IND60717300220221119200337.0210201e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071730022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Fahad10aWastewater-based prevalence trends of gout in an Australian community over a period of 8 years  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGout is a rheumatic arthritis disease which poses a health burden. Monitoring the prevalence of gout is key to reduce the community burden of gout disease and associated health costs. Allopurinol has been used as a first line gout preventive medication in Australia which is metabolised into oxypurinol and excreted in urine. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was applied to estimate temporal trends of gout prevalence in an Australian community over eight-years via the quantification of oxypurinol in wastewater. A total of 180 wastewater samples collected between 2012 and 2019 were analysed for oxypurinol to estimate allopurinol consumption in a community in South East Queensland, Australia. Annual gout prevalence was estimated by daily defined doses (DDD) consumed and ranged from 24 to 32 DDD/day/1000, an equivalent gout prevalence of 2.3 to 3.2% over the eight-year period. A statistically significant increase in allopurinol consumption was observed over the period (Slope = 0.094, p = 0.0001), equating to year-on-year increases in gout prevalence of 3.6% per year. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term gout prevalence study using wastewater, adding epidemiological and public health insights in the gout research field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopurinol 3adrug therapy 3aenvironment 3aepidemiology 3agout 3apublic health 3aurine 3awastewater 3aQueensland 0aRheumatic diseases 0aPrevalence 0aAustralia1 aTscharke, Benjamin1 aO'Brien, Jake W.1 aZheng, Qiuda1 aThompson, Jack1 aMueller, Jochen F.1 aThomas, Kevin V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 759 p.143460-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012200166300001600288520110200304592002801406650001801434650001501452650001901467650001301486650002201499650002601521650001201547650002501559650002701584650002401611650002301635650001401658650001701672650001601689650001501705653004401720653002201764653002601786653003301812700001801845700001401863700001701877700001801894700001601912700001701928773012801945856008402073852000902157655001202166IND60582579220221118003153.0180904e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058257922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Chunli10aMultistage biological contact oxidation for landfill leachate treatment: Optimization and bacteria community analysis  ap. 200-207.  aLandfill leachate is a wastewater contained solid waste and is hard to treat due to its complex composition. The most effective treatment is biological method among leachate transfer, biological treatment, and physical and chemical methods, however, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of present biological treatment has not been more than 90% at influent COD concentration of 2000 mg/L to 5000 mg/L. In this study, the multistage biological contact oxidation (MBCO) is performed for treating landfill leachate. The optimized parameters as followed achieve 91.28% COD removal efficiency: influent COD landfill leachate concentration of 4000 mg/L; 0.1 L/min·L (reactor volume) aeration rate; temperature (T) of 35 °C and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h and also obtained 318.64 mg/L ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) effluent concentration, Besides, biofilm community structure show that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are identified as the dominant in phylum.

However, the hypothesis that childhood varicella vaccination may increase the incidence of HZ hinders varicella universal routine vaccination (URV) implementation in many countries.This non-systematic and narrative review of the literature considers the burden of varicella and HZ, and the effectiveness of the respective vaccines. We present the factors involved in the interplay between varicella vaccination and HZ incidence, including the roles of exogenous and endogenous boosting. We review HZ incidence model predictions, and compare these with real-world evidence, which has accumulated since varicella URV was introduced.Although more research and longer surveillance are needed, available real-world evidence has not confirmed the model-predicted increase in HZ incidence, associated with childhood varicella URV. Although there is a rising incidence of HZ globally, this trend appears to be predominantly the result of an aging population. Vaccination against varicella in childhood provides significant benefits with respect to the medical, societal and economic burdens of the disease. Therefore, a theoretical concern of an increased burden of HZ with varicella vaccination programs should not prevent children from being protected against the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3amonitoring 3aequations 3avaccines 3achildren 3avaccination 3achildhood 0aModeling 0aCI 0aURV 0aCDC 0aFDA 0aUK 0aExogenous boosting 0aHIV 0aFOB 0aVaricella 0aVaccination 0aHuman herpesvirus 3 0aCMV 0aCMI 0aVE 0aRZV 0aPHN 0aHZ 0aVZV 0aWHO 0aEndogenous boosting 0aUSA 0aHerpes zoster1 aCasabona, Giacomo1 aCnops, Jennifer1 aAkpo, Esse Ifebi Herve1 aSafadi, Marco Aurelio P.0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 36, no. 46 p.7072-7082dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011700162300001600279520091400295592002801209650002501237650001401262650001301276650002501289650001901314650001601333650001801349650002201367650001301389650001001402650001001412650001401422650001101436650001201447773010701459856007601566852000901642655001201651IND60523944920221123013338.0190423e20130529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052394492DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.2008.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirski, Waldemar10aFungi colonizing shoots of common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in the Jagiellonian University Botanic Garden in Cracow  ap. 191-197.  aThe aim of the investigations was determination the reasons of dying down of needles and branches of common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in the park collection of Botanic Garden of Jagiellonian University in Cracow.

ADAM10 and ADAM17 are involved in the spermatogenesis. To better understand the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, the full-length cDNAs of ADAM10 and ADAM17 were cloned, and named Es-ADAM10 and Es-ADAM17, respectively. Sequence and structural analysis showed that Es-ADAM10 and Es-ADAM17 have the typical structure of the ADAM family. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that Es-ADAM10 and Es-ADAM17 mRNAs were distributed in the heart, hepatopancreas, intestines, brain, muscle, thoracic ganglia, hemolymph, stomach, testis, ovary, gill and accessory gland. Both mRNAs were highly expressed in the muscles, and relatively high in the testis, ovary and accessory gland. In addition, the Es-ADAM17 mRNA level was detected in every stage of testis development, being relatively high from July to September, the lowest during October and November, increasing from December to January, and reached a peak in January. By contrast, the expression of Es-ADAM10 mRNA was constant during testis development. Immunofluorescence further showed that Es-ADAM10 and Es-ADAM17 proteins were present in the cytoplasm and cytomembrane of spermatocytes, and both detected in the sperm. Furthermore, etoposide induced upregulation of Es-ADAM17 and Es-ADAM10 at both the mRNA and protein levels. This study first showed that Es-ADAM10 and Es-ADAM17 were also involved in the spermatogenesis and mainly participated in the later germ cell apoptosis in E. sinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriocheir sinensis 3aanimal ovaries 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoplasm 3aeggs 3aetoposide 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aheart 3ahemolymph 3ahepatopancreas 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3amessenger RNA 3ametalloproteinases 3amuscles 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3astomach 3atestes 3athoracic ganglia 0aADAM 0aBSA 0aPBST 0aHE 0asc1 0asc2 0ast 0aEs-ADAM10 0aEs-ADAM17 0aSpermatogenesis 0aApoptosis1 aXie, Jing1 aHe, Lin1 aWang, Yuanli1 aDuan, Zelin1 aYang, Hongdan1 aWang, Qun0 tGene.g2015 May 10, v. 562 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.02.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245020500192300001600397520115300413592002801566650002001594650002301614650002201637650002001659650001201679650002301691650001001714650002301724650002201747650005001769650004201819650002401861650005701885650002501942650006901967653001202036653003502048653004702083653004302130653002902173700001802202700002002220773010002240856008702340852000902427655001202436IND50069340620221118165058.0190402e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006934062DNAL7 a240542732pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSereshti, Hassan10aDetermination of volatile components of saffron by optimised ultrasound-assisted extraction in tandem with dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 499-505.  aIn the present research, a combined extraction method of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) in conjunction with dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) was applied to isolation and enrichment of saffron volatiles. The extracted components of the saffron were separated and determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique. The mixture of methanol/acetonitrile was chosen for the extraction of the compounds and chloroform was used at the preconcentration stage. The important parameters, such as composition of extraction solvent, volume of preconcentration solvent, ultrasonic applying time, and salt concentration were optimised by using a half-fraction factorial central composite design (CCD). Under the optimal conditions, the linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) were 10–10,000mgL−1. The determination coefficients (R2) were from 0.9990 to 0.9997. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) for the extracted compounds were 6–123mgL−1 and 20–406mgL−1, respectively.

Increasing the epidemic severity (R0 of 1.63), averted 16.0 million symptomatic influenza cases, 35,407 to 141,625 deaths, $1.9 billion in direct costs, $6.0–65.5 billion in productivity losses, and $7.8–67.3 billion in overall costs (varying with mortality rate). Extending pharmacy hours averted up to 16.5 million symptomatic influenza cases, 145,278 deaths, $1.9 billion direct costs, $4.1 billion in productivity loss, and $69.5 billion in overall costs. Adding pharmacies resulted in a cost-benefit of $4.1 to $11.5 billion, varying epidemic severity, mortality rate, pharmacy hours, location vaccination rate, and delay in the availability of the vaccine.Administering vaccines through pharmacies in addition to traditional locations in the event of an epidemic can increase vaccination coverage, mitigating up to 23.7 million symptomatic influenza cases, providing cost-savings up to $2.8 billion to third-party payers and $99.8 billion to society. Pharmacies should be considered as points of dispensing epidemic vaccines in addition to traditional settings as soon as vaccines become available.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abusiness enterprises 3acost effectiveness 3adisease outbreaks 3aeconomic impact 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ainfluenza 3amortality 3asimulation models 3asociety 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aUnited States 0aInfluenza 0aEpidemic 0aPharmacies 0aVaccination 0aEconomic1 aTaitel, Michael S.1 aDePasse, Jay V.1 aCox, Sarah N.1 aSmith-Ray, Renae L.1 aWedlock, Patrick1 aSingh, Tanya G.1 aCarr, Susan1 aSiegmund, Sheryl S.1 aLee, Bruce Y.0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 36, no. 46 p.7054-7063dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024004400135040001800179100001200197245013500209300001800344520204700362592002802409596007102437596008302508650002202591650003702613650001502650650003502665650001302700650001102713650001902724650002002743650001402763650001702777650001502794650001302809650000902822650001602831650001802847650001302865650001402878650001602892650001102908650001302919650001802932650002002950650003702970700002603007700001503033700002803048773010403076856008803180852000903268655001203277IND60567283320221122235610.0170421e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056728332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b029712doi7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b029712chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rui10aFischer–Tropsch Synthesis Performance of Supported Nano-Iron Catalysts Synthesized By a Gas-Expanded Liquid Deposition Technique  ap. 4343-4352.  aA gas-expanded-liquid technique (GXL) was applied to the preparation of supported iron catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). A mixture of presynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles with an average size of 12 nm was deposited onto a SiO₂ support in a manner such that nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm were excluded from the final catalyst product. A series of SiO₂-supported iron oxide nanoparticle catalysts were prepared with iron loadings of 11.4, 18.0, 24.0, and 28.8 wt %. Catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, H₂ temperature-programmed reduction (H₂-TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), trasmission electron microsopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and carbon monoxide temperature-programmed desorption. TEM analysis showed that iron oxide nanoparticles were well-distributed over the surface of the SiO₂ support with an increase in the iron loading resulting in the formation of multilayers and three-dimensional islands of iron oxide nanoparticles. H₂-TPR indicated that the reducibility of the iron oxide nanoparticles increased monotonically with iron loading. According to XRD results, the increase in the iron loading resulted in an increase in the iron oxide crystallite size, and iron carbides were present in the used catalysts after solvent treatment. FTS was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at reaction conditions of 230 °C, 2 MPa, H₂/CO = 1.70, and GHSV = 3000 L/kgcₐₜ/h. For the catalysts studied, the highest syngas conversion and iron time yield were observed at intermediate (18, 24 wt %) iron loadings. The C₅₊ selectivity and carbon chain growth probability factor were approximately 68% and 0.76, respectively, for each catalyst. A 16 wt % iron on SiO₂ catalyst prepared by the same GXL technique was promoted with 0.7 wt % potassium using the incipient wetness method. As expected, K promotion resulted in a slight decrease in FTS activity and increased selectivity toward CO₂ and C₅₊ selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cDivision of Graduate Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000082  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbides 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acrystallites 3adesorption 3ahydrogen 3airon 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3aprobability 3asilica 3asolvents 3asynthesis gas 3asynthetic fuels 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aVengsarkar, Pranav S.1 aRoe, David1 aRoberts, Christopher B.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 31, no. 4 p.4343-4352dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b029713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245014100182300001600323520182300339592002802162650001902190650002302209650002502232650001302257650002702270650001602297650001602313650001502329650000902344650001102353650003002364650001402394650001202408650002802420650002602448650001002474650001602484650001702500650002102517650000902538651001202547700001502559700001602574700001802590700001602608700002002624700002102644700001702665700001502682773012502697856008202822852000902904655001202913IND60516730720221121223354.0190727e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051673072DNAL7 a217293882pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X1100023X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeverin, K.10aLiver enzymes and blood metabolites in a population of free-ranging red deer (Cervus elaphus) naturally infected with Fascioloides magna  ap. 190-196.  aWe investigated the effects of Fascioloides magna infection on the serum biochemistry values of the naturally infected red deer population in eastern Croatia. The investigation was performed on 47 red deer with F. magna infection confirmed patho-anatomically in 27 animals (57.4%). Fibrous capsules and migratory lesions were found in 14 deer while only fibrous capsules without migratory lesions were found in 13 deer. In 13 deer both immature and mature flukes were found, in 5 deer only immature flukes were found and in 9 deer only mature flukes were found. Fascioloides magna infected deer with fibrous capsules and migratory lesions had significantly higher values for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and globulin, and lower values for albumin/globulin ratio and glucose compared to uninfected deer. Fascioloides magna infected deer with fibrous capsules without the presence of migratory lesions had higher values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and globulin, and lower values for albumin/globulin ratio and glucose, than the uninfected deer. The number of immature flukes was positively correlated with values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), LDH, GLDH, urea and triglycerides. The number of migratory lesions was positively correlated with GGT, GLDH, globulin and urea values. The creatinine value was positively correlated with the number of mature flukes. The trial showed that F. magna infection causes significant changes in serum biochemistry. Moreover, these changes do not completely resemble changes following F. hepatica infection. Further investigation of changes in liver enzymes and other serum metabolites in controlled, experimentally induced fascioloidosis in red deer is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of F. magna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aFascioloides magna 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acorrelation 3acreatinine 3adeer 3aflukes 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3ametabolites 3apathogenesis 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 3aCroatia1 aMašek, T.1 aJanicki, Z.1 aKonjević, D.1 aSlavica, A.1 aMarinculić, A.1 aMartinković, F.1 aVengušt, G.1 aDžaja, P.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.190-196dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X1100023X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01505naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011500157300001800272520028500290592002800575650002700603650002300630650002600653650001700679650001100696650002000707700001700727700001800744700001800762700001600780700001600796700001700812700002100829700002000850700002100870773013300891856007401024852000901098655001201107IND60659901720221118222803.0190823e20130704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065990172DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc43461c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xiao-Lin10aPhosphorescence doping in a flexible ultramicroporous framework for high and tunable oxygen sensing efficiency  ap. 6864-6866.  aDoping very small amounts of Ruᴵᴵ into a flexible, ultramicroporous, fluorescent Znᴵᴵ coordination polymer produced phosphorescent materials with very high and tunable oxygen quenching efficiency; and a simple color-changing ratiometric oxygen sensor has been constructed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3afluorescence 3aoxygen 3aphosphorescence1 aLiu, Si-Yang1 aLin, Rui-Biao1 aLiao, Pei-Qin1 aYe, Jia-Wen1 aLai, Zhihui1 aGuan, Yanyan1 aCheng, Xiao-Ning1 aZhang, Jie-Peng1 aChen, Xiao-ming,0 tChemical communications.g2013 July 4, v. 49, no. 61 p.6864-6866dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc43461c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013900165300001800304520155700322592002801879650002601907650001601933650001001949650002401959650002001983650001702003650002102020650001602041650002102057650001102078650001902089650002002108650001302128650001102141650002002152650001602172700001302188700001402201700001602215700001502231773011102246856008602357852000902443655001202452IND60530010720221118071037.0160720e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053001072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b015352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lihong10aSensitive Fluorescence Probe with Long Analytical Wavelengths for γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase Detection in Human Serum and Living Cells  ap. 8353-8359.  aA new sensitive fluorescent probe with long analytical wavelengths for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) assay has been developed by incorporating the γ-glutamyl group as a recognition unit into the fluorophore of cresyl violet (CV). The detection mechanism is based on the GGT-catalyzed cleavage of the γ-glutamyl group, followed by the release of CV, which leads to a distinct color change from light yellow to pink and a large fluorescence enhancement at 615 nm (λₑₓ = 585 nm). Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity of the probe is directly proportional to the activity of GGT in the range of 1–50 U/L with a detection limit of 5.6 mU/L. By virtue of its high sensitivity and long analytical wavelengths, the probe has been used to directly determine GGT in human serum samples from both healthy people and liver cancer patients, and the obtained results accord well with those acquired by commercial GGT fluorometric assay kit. The probe has also been employed to image endogenous GGT in living cells. Notably, with our probe the expression level of GGT in HepG2 cells under the action of sodium butyrate (an anticancer drug) was studied by fluorescence confocal microscopy, revealing that sodium butyrate can induce the upregulation of GGT in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This behavior of sodium butyrate has further been confirmed by lysate assay and inhibitor experiment. The proposed probe is rather simple and may find a wide use in the determination of GGT in clinical and biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood serum 3acolor 3aconfocal microscopy 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorometry 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aliver neoplasms 3apatients 3apeople 3asodium butyrate 3awavelengths1 aShi, Wen1 aWang, Zhe1 aGong, Qiuyu1 aMa, Huimin0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 87, no. 16 p.8353-8359dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b015353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245008100167500001900248520124000267592002801507650001501535650001201550650001401562650001701576650002301593650002701616650001601643650001601659651001001675651002001685653002001705653001601725653003001741653002501771653002301796653002401819700001401843700002101857700001901878700001501897700001801912773011901930856008802049852000902137655001202146IND60717300620221119200327.0210201e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071730062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aNon-indigenous species in marine and coastal habitats of the South China Sea  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe South China Sea (SCS) sustains and is a regional center of high marine and coastal biodiversity. It is also one of the most important mariculture and marine fisheries regions in the world. Many non-indigenous species (NIS) were introduced into the SCS as artifacts of increasing mariculture production and fishery harvests. Little information exists about NIS in the SCS. In this study, research examining NIS and their threats in the SCS are reviewed. Current NIS conditions assessed include their status, threat to native biodiversity, contribution to mariculture and fisheries harvest, management, and the need for future research in specific areas are identified. A total of 90 NIS including 17 algae, 6 vascular plants, 3 bryozoans, 23 molluscs, 6 crustacea, 3 ascidians, and 32 fishes were introduced into the SCS from 1600 to the present. The primary pathways of introduction are through aquaculture, followed by shipping, ecological restoration, and biocontrol. The main introduced country is China. Some NIS have caused negative impacts on the environment and economy. Some NIS are potential threats to humans as well as biodiversity in the SCS. More research focused upon monitoring and managing NIS in the SCS is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3aBryozoa 3aCrustacea 3abiodiversity 3abiological control 3aecological restoration 3aenvironment 3amariculture 3aChina 3aSouth China Sea 0aAquatic systems 0aAquaculture 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aBiological invasions 0aEcological impacts 0aMarine biodiversity1 aXie, Dong1 aBowler, Peter A.1 aZeng, Zhangfan1 aXiong, Wen1 aLiu, Chunlong0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 759 p.143465-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010100175300001600276520156500292592002801857650001901885650001801904650001401922650002801936650001801964650001401982650001401996650001702010650001802027650001002045650001402055650001302069653001802082653001702100653001002117653002302127653002002150700002502170700002102195700002602216700002002242700002302262700002102285700001902306700002702325773010402352856008502456961001202541852000902553655001202562IND60635028420221121220258.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063502842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Kathleen M.10aWildland firefighter smoke exposure and risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality  ap. 462-468.  aWildland firefighters are exposed to wood smoke, which contains hazardous air pollutants, by suppressing thousands of wildfires across the U. S. each year. We estimated the relative risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality from existing PM2.5 exposure-response relationships using measured PM4 concentrations from smoke and breathing rates from wildland firefighter field studies across different exposure scenarios. To estimate the relative risk of lung cancer (LC) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality from exposure to PM2.5 from smoke, we used an existing exposure-response (ER) relationship. We estimated the daily dose of wildfire smoke PM2.5 from measured concentrations of PM4, estimated wildland firefighter breathing rates, daily shift duration (hours per day) and frequency of exposure (fire days per year and career duration). Firefighters who worked 49 days per year were exposed to a daily dose of PM4 that ranged from 0.15 mg to 0.74 mg for a 5- and 25-year career, respectively. The daily dose for firefighters working 98 days per year of PM4 ranged from 0.30 mg to 1.49 mg. Across all exposure scenarios (49 and 98 fire days per year) and career durations (5–25 years), we estimated that wildland firefighters were at an increased risk of LC (8 percent to 43 percent) and CVD (16 percent to 30 percent) mortality. This unique approach assessed long term health risks for wildland firefighters and demonstrated that wildland firefighters have an increased risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abreathing 3acardiovascular diseases 3afire fighters 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aparticulates 3arelative risk 3asmoke 3awildfires 3awildland 0aWildland fire 0aFirefighters 0aSmoke 0aParticulate matter 0aRisk assessment1 aKleinman, Michael T.1 aMackay, Chris E.1 aReinhardt, Timothy E.1 aBalmes, John R.1 aBroyles, George A.1 aOttmar, Roger D.1 aNaher, Luke P.1 aDomitrovich, Joseph W.0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 June, v. 173 p.462-468dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007600170300001800246520124500264592002801509650000801537650000901545650001501554650001401569650001301583650001301596650000901609650001701618650002301635650001601658700001601674700001401690700001601704700001701720700001601737773010401753856008901857852000901946655001201955IND60567283420221122235725.0170421e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056728342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b029842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yanqing10aEffect of Pulverized Coal Preheating on NOx Reduction during Combustion  ap. 4436-4444.  aAlthough various NOₓ removal technologies have been commercialized, NOₓ emissions are still so high that they cannot meet the newest standard and endanger the eco-environment and human health. Meanwhile, some NOₓ reduction technologies suffer from high costs. Recently, a cheap and pending technology called gas-fired coal preheating has surfaced again. This method introduces hot flue gas to heat a coal stream to high temperatures before the coal stream is injected into a utility boiler for combustion, thus resulting in a reduction in NOₓ. Considering the complex mechanisms during preheating, the effect of the preheating parameters, including temperature, residence time, excess air ratio, and coal type, are studied in a laboratory-scale drop-tube furnace in detail. Meanwhile, by means of Chemkin coupled with the mature NOₓ reduction mechanisms of GRI-mesh3.0 and Dagaut, as well as a CPD model, a detailed kinetics analysis on NO removal, including the migration and transformation of hydrocarbons and nitrogenous compounds during PC preheating, is performed. The research provides intuitive guidance, in practice, and a new scientific interpretation, in theory, for NOₓ reduction during PC combustion with preheating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aflue gas 3afurnaces 3aheat 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen compounds 3atemperature1 aShang, Tong1 aZeng, Jun1 aWang, Shuai1 aGong, Yanhao1 aHui, Shi'en0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 31, no. 4 p.4436-4444dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b029843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01394naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245004300163300001600206520038300222592002800605650001700633650001000650650001400660650002200674653002400696653002200720653001600742653001700758653001400775653002200789700002700811773011300838856008400951852000901035655001201044IND60590633420221122053318.0190129e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059063342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chen10aPhenotypic novelty by CRISPR in plants  ap. 170-175.  aGenome editing by CRISPR is now routinely used in plant biology for unravelling gene functions and improving agronomical traits.

In the present work the effect of anti-A. simplex specific antibodies on C3 and C4 levels in human sera was investigated. Up to 309 samples of sera were tested to determine levels of C3 and C4 and anti-A. simplex antibodies, including immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE. Significant differences were observed between levels of C3 and C4 and all immunoglobulins except for IgE. In the case of immunoglobulins, the probability that an anti-A. simplex positive subject has a C3 deficiency was 3.8 times higher than a subject without specific antibodies. In conclusion, an association between elevated levels of anti-A. simplex antibodies and C3 and C4 deficiency was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisakis simplex 3aantibodies 3acomplement 3aexcretory-secretory products 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alarvae 3aprobability 3asomatic antigens1 aRodero, M.1 aGisbert-Criado, R.1 aPuente, P.1 aPelayo, V.1 aAndreu-Ballester, J.C.1 aCuéllar, C.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2012 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.197-201dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X110002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011200177300001800289520189000307592002802197650001602225650002002241650002302261650001702284650002202301650001302323650004302336650000902379650001602388650000902404650001502413650001302428650001502441700002002456700002102476700002102497700001602518773011102534856008602645852000902731655001202740IND60530010820221118071030.0160720e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053001082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b015422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweredoski, Michael
J.10aHigh Resolution Parallel Reaction Monitoring with Electron Transfer Dissociation for Middle-Down Proteomics  ap. 8360-8366.  aIn recent years, middle-down proteomics has emerged as a popular technique for the characterization and quantification of proteins not readily amenable to typical bottom-up approaches. So far, all high resolution middle-down approaches are done in data-dependent acquisition mode, using both collision-induced dissociation or electron capture/transfer dissociation techniques. Here, we explore middle-down proteomics with electron transfer dissociation using a targeted acquisition mode, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), on an Orbitrap Fusion. As an example of a highly modified protein, we used histone H3 fractions from untreated and DMSO-treated Murine ErythroLeukemia (MEL) cells. We first determined optimized instrument parameters to obtain high sequence coverage using a synthetic standard peptide. We then setup a combined method of both MS1 scans and PRM scans of the 20 most abundant combinations of methylation and acetylation of the +10 charge state of the N-terminal tail of H3. Weak cation exchange hydrophilic interaction chromatography was used to separate the N-terminal H3 tail, primarily, by its acetylation and, to a secondary degree, by its methylation status, which aided in the interpretation of the results. After deconvolution of the highly charged ions, peaks were annotated to a minimum set of 254 H3 proteoforms in the untreated and treated samples. Upon DMSO treatment, global quantitation changes from the MS1 level show a relative decrease of 2, 3, 4, and 5 acetylations and an increase of 0 and 1 acetylations. A fragment ion map was developed to visualize specific differences between treated and untreated samples. Taken together, the data presented here show that middle-down proteomics with electron transfer dissociation using PRM is a novel, attractive method for the effective analysis and quantification of large and highly modified peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3acation exchange 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3ahistones 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aions 3amethylation 3amice 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3aproteomics1 aMoradian, Annie1 aRaedle, Matthias1 aFranco, Catarina1 aHess, Sonja0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 87, no. 16 p.8360-8366dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b015423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013500205300002000340520169300360592002802053596004402081650001702125650001802142650001102160650001902171650001102190650001202201650001102213650001102224650002502235650001502260650001402275700002502289700002002314773016902334856008202503852000902585655001202594IND60654057420221118012817.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04663-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkins, Lisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2831-058312aA case study investigating temporal factors that influence microplastic concentration in streams under different treatment regimes  ap. 21797-21807.  aMicroplastics, particles less than 5 mm in size, are an emerging contaminant in waterways worldwide. Most microplastic studies focus on spatial trends in concentration, but in systems as dynamic as rivers, to draw conclusions from existing spatial studies, we must first examine how microplastic concentrations may change with time and flow conditions. In this study, we investigate how microplastic concentrations change over a 24-h period and between seasonally high and low flows. We do this in two streams, controlling for wastewater treatment strategy: one stream in a watershed where waste is treated with septic systems and the other receiving wastewater treatment plant effluent. We hypothesized that a stream with wastewater treatment plant effluent would exhibit higher and more variable microplastic concentrations than a stream in a watershed with septic systems. Results indicate, however, that there is no significant difference between the two streams despite their differing treatment strategies. Additionally, no significant variation in concentrations was measured over two 24-h sampling campaigns. There was, however, significantly higher concentrations measured in summer low flow conditions relative to spring high flow conditions across both sampled streams (p value <0.001), indicating that increases in stream discharge unrelated to storm events dilute and decrease measured microplastic concentrations. From this, we learn that pairing measured concentrations with a description of flow conditions at sampling time is a requisite for a robust microplastic literature that allows for comparisons between existing spatial studies and extrapolations to global loads.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017228528cNational Science Foundation 3acase studies 3amicroplastics 3arivers 3aseptic systems 3astorms 3astreams 3asummer 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3awatersheds 3awaterways1 aSullivan, Patrick J.1 aWalter, M.

There is only limited information on the effects of reduced IRC and its mixture with compost or silicate fertilizer (Si) on the soil nematode community in salt–affected soils. This study aimed to assess the shifts of soil nematode community by reducing a rice crop from triple rice system (RRR) to a double rice system and mixed with compost or Si in paddy fields in acid sulfate soil (ASS) and alluvial soil (AL) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Field experiments were designed with four treatments in four replicates, including RRR and a proposed system of double–rice followed by a fallow (FRR) and with 3 Mg ha–¹ crop⁻¹ compost or 100 kg ha–¹ crop⁻¹ Si. Soils were collected at harvest after the 2 year experiment, reflecting the fifth and third consecutive rice crop in RRR and FRR system, respectively. Results showed that reduced IRC gave a significant reduction in abundance of plant–parasitic nematodes (PPN), dominated by Hirschmanniella and increased abundance bacterivorous nematodes when mixed to compost and silicate fertilizer in ASS. In addition, reduced IRC increased nematode biodiversity Hill’s indices and reduced herbivorous footprint in ASS. Proposed system having compost or Si had strongly increased in bacterivorous and omnivorous footprints. Particularly, reduced IRC mixture with Si increased abundance of Rhabdolaimus, Mesodorylaimus and Aquatides, metabolic footprints (structure footprint, bacterivorous, omnivorous and predator) and diversity Hill’s N1 index in ASS. Our results highlighted that reduced IRC was a beneficial practice for decreasing abundance of PPN in salt-affected soils and increasing abundance of FLN in ASS. IRC mixture with compost or Si had potential in structuring the nematode communities with increasing biodiversity, trophic structure, and metabolic footprints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirschmanniella 3aacid sulfate soils 3aagronomy 3aalluvial soils 3abacterivores 3abiodiversity 3acomposts 3afallow 3aherbivores 3aomnivores 3apaddies 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ariver deltas 3arough rice 3asilicates 3asoil nematodes 3asulfates 3aVietnam1 aKhoi, Chau  Minh1 aPhuong, Nguyen  Thi Kim1 aLinh, Tran  Ba1 aMinh, Dang  Duy1 aPerry, Roland N.,1 aToyota, Koki 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110304253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009500163300002000258520165200278592002801930596005901958650001602017650001102033650001202044650002102056650002402077650001902101650003202120650001402152650001702166650001302183700001902196700001802215700005702233773016902290856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60654057620221118012753.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065405762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05520-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aMolecular mechanism for the discrepant inhibition of microcystins on protein phosphatase 1  ap. 21774-21783.  aDue to variable amino acid residues at positions 2 and 4, microcystins (MCs) had diversified variants with different toxicities. To evaluate the discrepant toxicity, the inhibition effects of five typical MC variants (with the changed amino acid residues at position 4) target to PP1 were evaluated. The inhibition sequence was verified as follows: MCLR (IC₅₀ = 2.6 μg/L) > MCLF (IC₅₀ = 4.4 μg/L) > MCLA (IC₅₀ = 5.5 μg/L) > MCLY (IC₅₀ = 7.9 μg/L) > MCLW (IC₅₀ = 13.6 μg/L). To further clarify the inhibition mechanism for variant toxicity, the interactions between MCs and PP1 were evaluated with the assistance of MOE molecule simulation. Results show the hydrophobic interaction (Adda⁵ with PP1) and the hydrogen bonds (especially for Z⁴ → Glu₂₇₅) were positively correlated with MC toxicity, while the hydrogen bonds (Leu² ← Arg₉₆, IsoAsp³ ← Arg₉₆, and IsoAsp³ ← Tyr₁₃₄) and the ion bonds (between Mn²⁺ and His₁₇₃/Asn₁₂₄/Asp₉₂) were negatively correlated with toxicity. However, the hydrogen bonds (Ala¹ → Glu₂₇₅, Mdha⁷ ← Gly₂₇₄, Z⁴ ← Arg₂₂₁, and Adda⁵ ← His₁₂₅), the covalent combination (between Mdha⁷ and Cys₂₇₃), and the ion bonds (between Mn²⁺ and His₂₄₈/Asp₆₄/His₆₆) were weakly correlated with toxicity. By further analysis, the steric hindrance and hydrophobicity introduced by different Z⁴ residues affected the changes for combination area and energy of MC-PP1 complexes, leading to the discrepancies in MC toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data  a21876103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aamino acids 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amanganese 3amicrocystins 3atoxicity1 aWang, Xiaoning1 aZhang, Shuhan1 aZong, Wansong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1027-14640 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 21 p.21774-21783dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05520-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012600165500001900291506002800310506003200338520155800370592002801928596008601956596004502042506003702087650002202124650001302146650002002159650001402179650001102193650001802204650001302222650001102235650001102246650001002257650002102267650001502288650002302303650002302326650001602349650001702365650002302382650001902405650000902424700002002433773012202453856008002575903002202655852000902677655001202686IND60731966920221207123642.0210326e20210323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073196692DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110306062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsatuke, Anya 10aStrawberry Flavor Is Influenced by the Air Temperature Differential during Fruit Development but Not Management Practices  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aThe majority of cultivated strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) in the northern United States (US) and Canadian provinces is grown in perennial matted rows across a range of soil types and microclimates. Management practices vary in fertilization rates, intensity of pesticide use, and the source of inputs depending on grower preferences. The objective of this study was to identify environmental and management factors that influence strawberry flavor attributes across a range of production systems. The cultivar Jewel was selected for its popularity in this region and reputation for excellent flavor. “Jewel” was sampled from regional farms and, concurrently, grown in a controlled field study with different inputs over three years. Soluble solids content (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA) across farms was found to be positively associated with the air temperature differential during fruit ripening. In controlled field studies, yield was correlated positively with total N in the form of synthetic urea, but not with the rate of applied organic nitrogen (N). Despite different levels of soil carbon inputs, N rates, pesticides, and microbial supplements, the fruit quality attributes, including SSC, TA, aromatic volatile concentration, and phenolics were not associated with treatment. A human sensory evaluation found no perceptible differences in flavor or aroma among contrasting treatments. Our study concludes that growers should invest in temperature management, rather than agricultural inputs, to influence SSC and TA of strawberry.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorth American Strawberry Growers Associationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010639  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFragaria ananassa 3aagronomy 3aair temperature 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3afruits 3ahumans 3aodors 3aorganic nitrogen 3apesticides 3aphenolic compounds 3asensory evaluation 3asoil carbon 3astrawberries 3atitratable acidity 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea1 aPritts, Marvin 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110306063Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle07034naa a2201357 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013600171300001600307520333100323592002803654650002403682650001803706650001903724650000903743650001403752650001003766650002503776650001303801650001203814650001303826650001203839650001103851650000903862650001503871650002503886650001203911650001103923650001403934650001603948650001503964650002003979650001503999650001104014650001704025650001104042650002204053650000904075650000904084650000904093650001204102650001304114651001904127651001704146653001604163653002004179653001204199653001604211653001604227653001604243653002304259653001304282653001604295653003404311653001304345700001704358700001804375700002204393700003204415700001504447700002504462700001704487700001804504700001904522700001904541700001604560700001504576700001504591700002204606700002204628700001804650700002704668700002504695700002304720700001904743700002104762700002404783700002204807700001904829700002104848700001704869700001904886700003404905700002104939700002104960700002004981700002105001700002105022700002305043700001605066700001805082700002605100700002205126700001905148700002105167700001905188700002105207700003205228700001805260700002805278700002005306700002005326700002805346700002505374700002505399700002205424700001805446773010305464856008805567852000905655655001205664IND60590633920221122053445.0210201e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059063392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchant, Rob10aDrivers and trajectories of land cover change in East Africa: Human and environmental interactions from 6000 years ago to present  ap. 322-378.  aEast African landscapes today are the result of the cumulative effects of climate and land-use change over millennial timescales. In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region.Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColocasia esculenta 3aGallus gallus 3aHolocene epoch 3aMusa 3aNicotiana 3aOryza 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aZea mays 3abananas 3achickens 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acorn 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aimmigration 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apaleoecology 3apeople 3apopulation growth 3arain 3arice 3ataro 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3aEastern Africa 3aIndian Ocean 0aArchaeology 0aIron technology 0aPottery 0aPastoralism 0aAgriculture 0aLivelihoods 0aPalaeoenvironments 0aSavannah 0aLandCover6k 0aSustainable Development Goals 0aLand use1 aRicher, Suzi1 aBoles, Oliver1 aCapitani, Claudia1 aCourtney-Mustaphi, Colin J.1 aLane, Paul1 aPrendergast, Mary E.1 aStump, Daryl1 aDe Cort, Gijs1 aKaplan, Jed O.1 aPhelps, Leanne1 aKay, Andrea1 aOlago, Dan1 aPetek, Nik1 aPlatts, Philip J.1 aPunwong, Paramita1 aWidgren, Mats1 aWynne-Jones, Stephanie1 aFerro-Vázquez, Cruz1 aBenard, Jacquiline1 aBoivin, Nicole1 aCrowther, Alison1 aCuní-Sanchez, Aida1 aDeere, Nicolas J.1 aEkblom, Anneli1 aFarmer, Jennifer1 aFinch, Jemma1 aFuller, Dorian1 aGaillard-Lemdahl, Marie-José1 aGillson, Lindsey1 aGithumbi, Esther1 aKabora, Tabitha1 aKariuki, Rebecca1 aKinyanjui, Rahab1 aKyazike, Elizabeth1 aLang, Carol1 aLejju, Julius1 aMorrison, Kathleen D.1 aMuiruri, Veronica1 aMumbi, Cassian1 aMuthoni, Rebecca1 aMuzuka, Alfred1 aNdiema, Emmanuel1 aKabonyi Nzabandora, Chantal1 aOnjala, Isaya1 aSchrijver, Annemiek Pas1 aRucina, Stephen1 aShoemaker, Anna1 aThornton-Barnett, Senna1 aVan der Plas, Geert,1 aWatson, Elizabeth E.1 aWilliamson, David1 aWright, David0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Mar., v. 178 p.322-378dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245017000180300001600350520062500366592002800991650001601019650001401035650001201049650002401061650001401085650001001099651002201109651002901131700002101160700001701181700003001198700002501228700002101253773012501274856008201399852000901481655001201490IND60516731120221121223247.0190727e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051673112DNAL7 a217293812pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X110002892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibas, A.10aFirst report of Troglotrema acutum (Digenea, Troglotrematidae) in the Eurasian badger Meles meles in the Iberian Peninsula and presumptive lesions caused in the host  ap. 222-227.  aA total of 109 badger Meles meles skulls from Catalonia (north-eastern Iberian Peninsula) were studied for helminths.

Pers.) to determine whether an amino acid based biostimulant program applied in the late season (October-November) and early season (March-April) could extend fall color retention (FCR) or hasten the spring green-up (SGU), respectively. Bermudagrass was treated with the biostimulant under five different managements: non-treated; 6 times at 5 L ha⁻¹ weekly; 3 times at 5 L ha⁻¹ in a 14-day interval; 6 times at 10 L ha⁻¹ weekly; and 3 times at 10 L ha⁻¹ in a 14-day interval. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and visual ratings (turf green color and percentage of green coverage in the subplot) were determined weekly, and turf clipping dry weight for the SGU studies. At the end of the FCR studies (2017 and 2018), there was no effect of the biostimulant; although, some isolated positive effects were detected during the experiment in 2017 on bermudagrass treated weekly at 10 L ha⁻¹ for NDVI. However, there was a slight positive effect on SGU when this physiological process occurred slowly (year 2018) and the biostimulant was applied weekly at 10 L ha⁻¹ (4.4 kg N ha⁻¹), compared to another performed management and warmer years (2017 and 2019).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aagronomy 3aamino acids 3acolor 3alawns and turf 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aspring1 aGómez de Barreda, Diego 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110306083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003400146040001800180100001400198245015800212300001300370520122400383592002801607650000901635650001001644650002401654650001501678650002201693650002101715650001401736650001601750650001601766650001201782650002801794650003301822650004401855650002101899650002401920650002701944650002001971650000901991650002102000650002102021650003102042650002102073650003602094653002102130653001802151653001502169653001802184653002402202653000902226653001402235653001002249700001702259700001602276700001502292773011302307852000902420856008302429655001202512IND2059863720221116222814.0181203e19960101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205986372DNAL7 a87095772pmid7 a10.1258/0023677967807449922doi4 a0023-6772(19960101)30:1L.7;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, K.14aThe telemetric monitoring of heart rate, locomotor activity, and body temperature in mice and voles (Microtus arvalis) during ambient temperature changes  ap. 7-12.  aWe have studied the physiological and behavioural responses in small rodents to ambient alterations. For this purpose, voles and mice were exposed to relatively low (12°C) and high (35°C) ambient temperatures, and heart rate (HR), locomotor activity (LA) and body temperature (BT) were recorded using telemetry system. The control HR (at 24°C) of voles was lower than that of mice. The 'heat exposure' decreased HR to 85.0±3.3% in voles, and to 78.0±3.2% in mice compared with the mean HR of the same time in the control day. The 'cold exposure' increased the HR to 131.9±8.8% in voles, and 119±10.9% in mice. The decreasing rate of HR in heat exposure was smaller in voles than mice, and in cold exposure the increased rate was larger in voles than mice. Cold exposure decreased BT in both species; 96.1±0.5% in voles and 93.7±1.0% in mice. The LA was not changed significantly by heat exposure in either species, but was partially increased by cold exposure. These results demonstrate that telemetry was helpful for qualitative and quantitative behavioural studies in small rodents, and confirmed that the physiological and behavioural responses to ambient temperature changes differed between these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3amice 3avoles 3aambient temperature 3aheart rate 3aphysical activity 3abody temperature 3atelemetry 3acold stress 3aheat stress 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexphysiology 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aBody Temperature Regulationxphysiology 2aCold Temperature 2aElectrocardiography 2aHeart Ratexphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aMale 2aMicexphysiology 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aReference Values 2aTelemetryxmethodsxveterinary. 0aBODY TEMPERATURE 0aCOLD EXPOSURE 0aHEART RATE 0aHEAT EXPOSURE 0aLOCOMOTIVE ACTIVITY 0aMICE 0aTELEMETRY 0aVOLES1 aKuwahara, M.1 aTsubone, H.1 aSugano, S.0 tLaboratory animals.g1996 Jan. 01, v. 30, no. 1 p.7-12dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677967807449923Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02519naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012800172500001900300520111400319592002801433650002101461650002101482650002101503650002901524650002101553650001601574650002501590650002601615650001501641653003201656653002401688653002701712653002901739700002201768700001501790700002001805700002101825700002301846773011901869856008801988852000902076655001202085IND60717301220221119200142.0210201e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071730122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakimoto, Yuya10aMaintaining microbial diversity mitigates membrane fouling of an anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor under starvation condition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial community dynamics to membrane fouling development in membrane bioreactor (MBR). We operated laboratory-scale anoxic/oxic-MBRs under prolonged starvation conditions in different seasons and the dynamics and diversity of the microbial communities were investigated. Although fouled-MBRs showed DOC accumulation in the activated sludge (AS), the fouling-mitigated MBR suggested that dissolved oxygen was consumed and DOC of the sludge supernatant was degraded. 16S rRNA genes analysis of AS in the MBRs revealed that Chitinophagaceae and Candidatus Promineofilum specifically increased in the fouling-mitigated MBR, suggesting that they played important roles in membrane fouling mitigation; high microbial diversity in the reactor also contributed to fouling mitigation. In the fouled reactor, enrichment of Xanthomonadaceae might be related to fouling causing substances formation leading to membrane fouling development; lower microbial diversity also contributed to fouling development in the fouled MBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChitinophagaceae 3aXanthomonadaceae 3aactivated sludge 3adissolved organic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobial communities 3astarvation 0aMembrane fouling mitigation 0aMicrobial diversity 0aEndogenous respiration 0a16S rRNA gene sequencing1 aHatamoto, Masashi1 aSoga, Toru1 aKuratate, Daiki1 aWatari, Takahiro1 aYamaguchi, Takashi0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 759 p.143474-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1434743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245013500204300001800339520231100357592002802668650001402696650001602710650002002726650001302746650001702759650001302776650001202789650001002801650002302811650002302834650000902857650001602866650001702882653001902899653001902918653003302937653002202970653001602992653001703008700001303025700001803038700001303056700001803069773009903087856008603186852000903272655001203281IND60629537620221118035010.0190401e20181112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062953762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, V.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9118-983514aThe effect of exercise on local and systemic adverse reactions after vaccinations – Outcomes of two randomized controlled trials  ap. 6995-7002.  aAn adverse reaction associated with vaccination is considered to be a key barrier to vaccinate, yet little attention has been given to interventions to reduce their occurrence. Exercise is a behavioural adjuvant which may also influence adverse reactions. Here, two randomized controlled trials are reported, examining the effects of exercise on self-reported adverse reactions following vaccination in adolescents and young adults.Study one; 116 adolescents receiving the HPV vaccine were randomly allocated to either Control (n = 56) or Pre-vaccine Exercise (n = 60) group (2015–2016). Exercise consisted of 15-minutes upper body exercise. Study two; 78 young adults receiving the influenza vaccine were randomly allocated to either Control (n = 19), or one of 3 exercise groups: Pre-vaccine Arm (n = 19), Pre-vaccine Leg (n = 20) or Post-vaccine Arm (n = 20) (2017). Exercise included 15-minutes of arm or leg exercises prior to or after vaccination. All participants in both studies completed an adverse events diary for seven-days post-vaccination.Study one; Reported days of tenderness in female adolescents that exercised were significantly lower than control (p = 0.032), with a similar trend in reported days of pain (p = 0.050). Furthermore, days of feeling ill (p = 0.070) and reduced appetite (p = 0.067) were found to be lower with exercise, although not significant. Overall, female adolescents reported significantly more days of pain (p = 0.003), tenderness (p < 0.001), swelling (p = 0.011), and feeling ill (p = 0.0040). Study two; Exercise groups reported reduced days of swelling (p = 0.018), fever (p = 0.013), and lowered appetite (p = 0.011) across both genders. Furthermore, females reported reduced days of medication use with exercise (p = 0.034), and a trend toward reduced days of swelling (p = 0.052).In two separate trials, a short bout of exercise reduced reported adverse reactions after vaccinations for local and systemic adverse reactions. Gender differences in reported local and systemic adverse reactions were more evident among adolescents than young adults. These findings support the need for further work to examine the potential benefit of exercise in improving vaccination procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aadolescents 3aadverse effects 3aappetite 3adrug therapy 3aexercise 3afemales 3afever 3agender differences 3ainfluenza vaccines 3apain 3avaccination 3ayoung adults 0aReactogenicity 0aAdverse events 0aHuman Papillomavirus vaccine 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aAdolescents 0aYoung adults1 aBooy, R.1 aSkinner, S.R.1 aFong, J.1 aEdwards, K.M.0 tVaccine.g2018 Nov. 12, v. 36, no. 46 p.6995-7002dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03927naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013000205300001600335520223400351592002802585650001902613650002402632650002202656650001602678650001402694650001102708650001902719650001002738650001302748650001802761650001402779650002002793650002202813650002602835650001702861653001002878653001002888653000902898653000902907653000802916653000802924653001002932653000802942653001002950653000802960653002602968653003002994653001803024653002103042653001503063700006403078700001903142773007303161856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60552468120221121142159.0161021e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055246812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.02.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurali, Reena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5190-083210aSoft computing model for optimized siRNA design by identifying off target possibilities using artificial neural network model  ap. 152-158.  aThe ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to do posttranscriptional gene regulation by knocking down targeted genes is an important research topic in functional genomics, biomedical research and in cancer therapeutics. Many tools had been developed to design exogenous siRNA with high experimental inhibition. Even though considerable amount of work has been done in designing exogenous siRNA, design of effective siRNA sequences is still a challenging work because the target mRNAs must be selected such that their corresponding siRNAs are likely to be efficient against that target and unlikely to accidentally silence other transcripts due to sequence similarity. In some cases, siRNAs may tolerate mismatches with the target mRNA, but knockdown of genes other than the intended target could make serious consequences. Hence to design siRNAs, two important concepts must be considered: the ability in knocking down target genes and the off target possibility on any nontarget genes. So before doing gene silencing by siRNAs, it is essential to analyze their off target effects in addition to their inhibition efficacy against a particular target. Only a few methods have been developed by considering both efficacy and off target possibility of siRNA against a gene. In this paper we present a new design of neural network model with whole stacking energy (ΔG) that enables to identify the efficacy and off target effect of siRNAs against target genes. The tool lists all siRNAs against a particular target with their inhibition efficacy and number of matches or sequence similarity with other genes in the database. We could achieve an excellent performance of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R=0. 74) and Area Under Curve (AUC=0.906) when the threshold of whole stacking energy is ≥−34.6kcal/mol. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the best score while considering the “combined efficacy and off target possibility” of siRNA for silencing a gene. The proposed model shall be useful for designing exogenous siRNA for therapeutic applications and gene silencing techniques in the area of bioinformatics.

The series of data covers the period 1998-2006. The area under investigation is situated in the Roztocze (surroundings of the Guciów village) within the protective zone of the Roztocze National Park. During nine years of monitoring, significant variations were observed between single years of deposition. The occurrence of peak years (1998, 2001, 2003 and 2006) connected with higher production of Alnus pollen was observed at many pollen monitoring sites, but its relationship with different proportions of alder within the surrounding vegetation seems rather weak. The average value of annual pollen deposition of Alnus for the whole region was calculated at ca. 1370 grains &#8226; cm-2. At the sites situated within the open landscape, pollen influx values ranged from 442 (in 2005) to 6894 (in 1998). It seems that other factors than the proportion of alder within the vegetation control the deposition of Alnus pollen. Long-distance transport and meteorological factors such as wind speed and direction should be taken into account in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus 3agrains 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3aplant communities 3apollen 3atraps 3avegetation 3avillages 3awind speed 3aPoland0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 60, no. 2 p.57-64dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2007.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245014700206300002000353520127600373592002801649650001501677650001401692650002601706650001101732650001301743650002601756650001201782650001701794650003101811653001601842653003101858653002001889653002001909653003101929700002301960700001701983700006302000700006002063773014102123856007802264852000902342655001202351IND60685553020200413000000.0200304e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068555302DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b222572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhainaut, Jérémy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1035-011410aFormulation of Metal–Organic Framework Inks for the 3D Printing of Robust Microporous Solids toward High-Pressure Gas Storage and Separation  ap. 10983-10992.  aThe shaping of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has become increasingly studied over the past few years, because it represents a major bottleneck toward their further applications at a larger scale. MOF-based macroscale solids should present performances similar to those of their powder counterparts, along with adequate mechanical resistance. Three-dimensional printing is a promising technology as it allows the fast prototyping of materials at the macroscale level; however, the large amounts of added binders have a detrimental effect on the porous properties of the solids. Herein, a 3D printer was modified to prepare a variety of MOF-based solids with controlled morphologies from shear-thinning inks containing 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose. Four benchmark MOFs were tested for this purpose: HKUST-1, CPL-1, ZIF-8, and UiO-66-NH₂. All solids are mechanically stable with up to 0.6 MPa of uniaxial compression and highly porous with BET specific surface areas lowered by 0 to −25%. Furthermore, these solids were applied to high-pressure hydrocarbon sorption (CH₄, C₂H₄, and C₂H₆), for which they presented a consequent methane gravimetric uptake (UiO-66-NH₂, ZIF-8, and HKUST-1) and a highly preferential adsorption of ethylene over ethane (CPL-1).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3acoordination polymers 3aethane 3aethylene 3amechanical properties 3amethane 3aporous media 3athree-dimensional printing 0a3D printing 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aink formulation 0amethane storage 0aethane/ethylene separation1 aBonneau, Mickaële1 aUeoka, Ryota1 aKanamori, Kazuyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5087-98081 aFurukawa, Shuhei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3849-80380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 9 p.10983-10992dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b222573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245011900208300001600327506007600343520134800419592002801767506003701795650002701832650002501859650001601884650001101900650002301911650001701934650002201951650002701973650001302000650001902013650002102032650002902053650002602082700001602108700001502124700001902139700001802158700001402176700001802190700001502208700001802223700001302241773012802254856008202382852000902464655001202473IND60089411020221207091947.0141102e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008941102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1142doi7 aPMC31809572pmcid7 a216407052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaochen10aRibonucleotide reductase subunit p53R2 regulates mitochondria homeostasis and function in KB and PC-3 cancer cells  ap. 102-107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRibonucleotide reductase (RR) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes de novo conversion of ribonucleotide 5′-diphosphates to the corresponding 2′-deoxynucleotide, essential for DNA synthesis and replication. The mutations or knockout of RR small subunit, p53R2, results in the depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in human, implying that p53R2 might play a critical role for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. In this study, siRNA against p53R2 knockdown approach is utilized to examine the impact of p53R2 depletion on mitochondria and to derive underlying mechanism in KB and PC-3 cancer cells. Our results reveal that the p53R2 expression not only positively correlates with mtDNA content, but also partakes in the proper mitochondria function, such as ATP synthesis, cytochrome c oxidase activity and membrane potential maintenance. Furthermore, overexpression of p53R2 reduces intracellular ROS and protects the mitochondrial membrane potential against oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, knockdown of p53R2 has a modest, if any, effect on mitochondrial and total cellular dNTP pools. Taken together, our study provides functional evidence that mitochondria is one of p53R2-targeted organelles and suggests an unexpected function of p53R2, which is beyond known RR function on dNTP synthesis, in mitochondrial homeostatic control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3aribonucleotide reductase 3asmall interfering RNA1 aLiu, Xiyong1 aXue, Lijun1 aZhang, Keqiang1 aKuo, Mei-Ling1 aHu, Shuya1 aZhou, Bingsen1 aAnn, David1 aZhang, Suzhan1 aYen, Yun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 24, v. 410, no. 1 p.102-107dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245015900216520173900375592002802114650002502142650002602167650001302193650002502206650001402231650001002245650001102255650001102266650001402277650001502291650001402306650001302320650001502333650000902348650001702357650001402374653002702388653000902415653001302424653001402437653002202451700002202473700002102495700002202516700002002538700001902558700002102577773009302598856008602691852000902777655001202786IND60741933620221118052058.0220315e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074193362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e073202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Umar Faruq1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5088-465810aSubtractive proteomics approach to Unravel the druggable proteins of the emerging pathogen Waddlia chondrophila and drug repositioning on its MurB protein  aWaddlia chondrophila is an emerging pathogen that has been implicated in numerous unpropitious pregnancy events in humans and ruminants. Taking into account its association with abortigenic events, possible modes of transmission, and future risk, immediate clinical measures are required to prevent widespread damage caused by this organism and hence this study. Here, a subtractive proteomics approach was employed to identify druggable proteins of W. chondrophila. Considering the essential genes, antibiotic resistance proteins, and virulence factors, 676 unique important proteins were initially identified for this bacterium. Afterward, NCBI BLASTp performed against human proteome identified 223 proteins that were further pushed into KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) for automatic annotation. Using the information from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database 14 Waddlia specific metabolic pathways were identified with respect to humans. Analyzing the data from KAAS and KEGG databases, forty-eight metabolic pathway-dependent, and seventy metabolic pathway independent proteins were identified. Standalone BLAST search against DrugBank FDA approved drug targets revealed eight proteins that are finally considered druggable proteins. Prediction of three-dimensional structures was done for the eight proteins through homology modeling and the Ramachandran plot model showed six models as a valid prediction. Finally, virtual screening against MurB protein was performed using FDA approved drugs to employ the drug repositioning strategy. Three drugs showed promising docking results that can be used for therapeutic purposes against W. chondrophila following the clinical validation of the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWaddlia chondrophila 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3adatabases 3adrugs 3ahumans 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 0aSubtractive proteomics 0aKEGG 0aDrugBank 0aModelling 0aMolecular docking1 aSaba, Abdullah Al1 aSufi, Abu Sufian1 aKhan, Akib Mahmud1 aSharmin, Ishrat1 aSultana, Aziza1 aIslam, Md Ohedul0 tHeliyon.g2021 June, v. 7, no. 6 p.e07320-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e073203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004400147245009100191300001800282520179400300592002802094650001702122650001702139650001302156650001902169650001002188650001402198650001202212650001002224650001002234650000902244650001102253650001802264650001302282650001102295650001702306651001102323700002402334700002702358700003202385700003002417700003002447700002502477773011102502856008102613852000902694655001202703IND60548063820221122230906.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5105-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Daniella de Sousa Mendes Moreira10aExperimental infection of T4 Acanthamoeba genotype determines the pathogenic potential  ap. 3435-3440.  aT4 is the Acanthamoeba genotype most related to cases of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) in immunocompromised patients and of keratitis in contact lens wearers. The determination of the pathogenic potential of Acanthamoeba clinical and environmental isolates using experimental models is extremely important to elucidate the capacity of free-living organisms to establish and cause disease in hosts. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the histopathology and culture between two different routes of experimental infection of T4 Acanthamoeba isolated from environmental and clinical source in mice (intracranial and intraperitoneal). Swiss isogenic healthy mice were inoculated with 10⁴ trophozoites by intracranial (IC) and intraperitoneal (IP) routes and observed during 21 days. The brains from animals inoculated by the IC route were collected and from the animals of the IP inoculation group, the brains, livers, kidneys, spleens, and lungs were removed. The organs were prepared and appropriately divided to be evaluated with histopathology and culture. There was no significant difference between the inoculation routes in terms of isolates recovery (χ² = 0.09; p = 0.76). In the IC group, isolate recovery rate was significantly higher in histopathology than the one achieved by culture (χ² = 6.45; p < 0.01). Experimental infection revealed that all isolates inoculated could be considered invasive because it was possible to recover evolutive forms of Acanthamoeba in both routes. This work represents the first in vivo pathogenicity assay of primary isolation source in Central region of Brazil showing in vivo pathogenicity and hematogenous spread capacity of these protozoa, improving the knowledge on free-living amoebae isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aencephalitis 3agenotype 3ahistopathology 3ahosts 3akeratitis 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amice 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aspleen 3atrophozoites 3aBrazil1 aMoraes, Aline Silva1 aAlves, Luciano Moreira1 aGonçalves, Rodrigo Gurgel,1 aLino Junior, Ruy de Souza1 aCuba-Cuba, César Augusto1 aVinaud, Marina Clare0 tParasitology research.g2016 Sept., v. 115, no. 9 p.3435-3440dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5105-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245007000166300001600236520106700252592002801319650001501347650002601362650002501388650002201413650000901435650002501444650002901469650002701498650002301525700001601548773009501564856008501659852000901744655001201753IND4468309420221118163448.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446830942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingjing10aBioactive compounds from the bark of Eucalyptus exserta F.

Herbaceous vegetation control involved the suppression of grasses, forbs, ferns and low shrubs for the first 2 or 4 growing seasons after planting. Deciduous woody vegetation control treatments, conducted in combination with the herbaceous treatments within a response-surface design, involved the permanent removal of all tall shrubs and deciduous trees at the time of planting, at the end of the 2nd or 5th growing seasons, or not at all. In general, the average size of planted pine was related positively to the duration of herbaceous vegetation control and negatively to delays in woody control. White pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck) altered these trends, reducing the height of pine on plots with little or no overtopping deciduous woody vegetation or mature tree cover. Where natural pine regeneration occurred on these plots, growth was similar but subordinate to the planted pine. Data from the three sites indicate that at least 60% of planted pine may be expected to reach an age-10 height target of 2.5 m when overtopping cover (residual overstory + regenerating deciduous) is managed at approximately 65% ± 10%, and total herbaceous cover is suppressed to levels not exceeding 50% in the first five years. On productive sites, this combination may be difficult to achieve in a clearcut, and requires fairly rigorous vegetation management in shelterwood regeneration systems. Currently, synthetic herbicides offer the only affordable and effective means of achieving such vegetation control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus strobus 3aPissodes strobi 3aclearcutting 3aferns and fern allies 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3aherbicides 3aoverstory 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3ashelterwood systems 3ashrubs 3atrees 3avegetation1 aHoepting, Michael K.1 aParker, William C.1 aMorneault, Andrée E.1 aLanteigne, Len1 aStinson, Albert,1 aFarrell, James C.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Changes in the tolerance to the biocide itself and the cross‐resistance to clinically important antibiotics were analysed. The involvement of efflux mechanism was studied as well as the possible implication of modifications in cytoplasmic membrane properties including integrity, permeability, potential and depolarization in the resistance mechanisms. Most of E. coli isolates that were adapted to TCS showed increased antimicrobial resistance, lower outer and inner membrane permeability, higher membrane depolarization, more negative membrane potential and enhanced efflux activity using qRT‐PCR. Nonsignificant change in membrane integrity was found in the adapted cells. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the extensive use of TCS at sublethal concentrations contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli clinical isolates, by inducing changes in bacterial membrane properties and enhancing the efflux system. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The extensive usage of TCS has a deleterious effect on the spread of antibiotic resistance, and more studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantiseptics 3abiocides 3acell membranes 3across resistance 3adisinfectants 3amembrane permeability 3amembrane potential 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresistance mechanisms 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atriclosan1 aEl‐Banna, T.E.1 aAbd El‐Aziz, A.A.1 aEl‐Ekhnawy, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8287-10260 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 126, no. 3 p.730-739dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.141583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007400162300001800236500002000254520145000274592002801724650001801752650001301770651000901783700002101792700001901813773013801832856007301970852000902043655001202052IND60651699520221117092405.0190712e20150212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065169952DNAL7 a10.3390/su70219852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroer, Audrey L.10aEducating the Aware, Informed and Action-Oriented Sustainable Citizen  ap. 1985-1999.  aJournal Article  aThe Introduction to Sustainability course at the University of Iowa seeks to educate the aware, informed and action-oriented sustainable citizen. A phenomenographic analysis and retrospective pretest were utilized to determine how students formed conceptions of sustainability as a result of completing the course. The study indicated that student conceptions of sustainability can be characterized by the “aware, informed and action-oriented” spectrum. In written reflections following service-learning experiences, students provided ample examples of “awareness moments” where they expressed a first encounter with a wicked problem. In these same reflections, students provided examples of being able to move beyond awareness toward an action-orientation. Many students that were called to action through a service-learning experience expressed hesitation regarding their level of knowledge regarding certain issues. But, many students with this hesitation decided their next action step would be to become more informed. Therefore, even when confronted by a sustainability issue or dilemma that students felt were beyond their knowledge level, they many times expressed an action pathway to become more informed. By challenging student thought processes and exposing the immediate need for global change, the Introduction to Sustainability course empowered students to become aware, informed, and action-oriented sustainable citizens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal change 3astudents 3aIowa1 aLowman, Heili E.1 aJust, Craig L.0 tSustainability.g2015 Feb. 12, v. 7, no. 2 p.1985-1999dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70219853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011600166300001600282520072300298592002801021650001301049650002301062650002001085650002101105650002301126650001201149650001501161650001901176650001201195650001401207650002001221650002201241650002201263700002401285700002301309700002401332700002101356773010001377856007301477852000901550655001201559IND60693068520221120161707.0200504e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069306852DNAL7 a10.4155/bfs.10.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Christopher R10aDiversity, productivity and landscape-level effects in North American grasslands managed for biomass production  ap. 451-461.  aExpanding markets for bioenergy will increasingly shape the composition and configuration of crop production.

Hereon, four different crystal structure of absorbents were selected to illustrate why the crystal structures and surface properties of absorbents were of great importance for the phosphate adsorption. The results showed that MgO/KBC with higher combination degree between MgO and KBC could change the normal crystal structure (MgO/KBC1, MgO phase (dominant)) to C-Mg-O phase (dominant). Therefore, MgO/KBC could achieve highest adsorption rate (k₂, 8.059 g mg⁻¹ min⁻¹) and qₘ (maximal adsorption capacity, 121.950 mg g⁻¹) for phosphate adsorption among absorbents, and even it had high anti-interference capacity for anions and natural organic matter (NOM). The mechanisms of MgO/KBC for phosphate adsorption were hydrogen-bond interaction, inner-sphere complexation and surface chemical adsorption; adsorption of phosphate on MgO/KBC1 was mainly controlled by inner-sphere complexation (Mg-O-PO₃H²⁻, Mg-O-PO₃H₂⁻ species). In addition, the adsorbability of MgO/KBC for phosphate could be restored after recalcination, which further proved that an efficient nanocomposite, calcinated from waste biomass (fallen leaves), was proposed to control eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acrystal structure 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3ahydrogen bonding 3amagnesium oxide 3ananocomposites 3aorganic matter 3aphosphates 0aPhosphate 0aMgO 0aPseudo-second-order kinetics equation 0aLangmuir1 aWang, Yijie1 aWen, Xiaoqing1 aCheng, Shuailong1 aLi, Jie1 aLin, Qintie0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 766 p.142618-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163300001600280520119300296592002801489650002601517650002101543650002801564650002201592650003401614650001201648650001201660650002001672650001401692650002201706650000701728650002001735700002101755700002101776700002301797700002201820700002101842700002201863773009801885856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60133133920221119193625.0150518e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-015-9847-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwai, Marin10aBiochemical Characterization and Overexpression of an Endo-rhamnogalacturonan Lyase from Penicillium chrysogenum  ap. 539-548.  aRhamnogalacturonan lyase (PcRGL4A) was purified from the culture supernatant of Penicillium chrysogenum 31B. PcRGL4A optimal activity occurred between pH 7–8 and at 40 °C. Conserved Domain Search analysis identified PcRGL4A as a member of Polysaccharide Lyase family 4. PcRGL4A contains two conserved catalytic and four conserved substrate-binding residues as determined by X-ray crystallography of the Aspergillus aculeatus RG lyase. Recombinant PcRGL4A (rPcRGL4A) expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrated specific activity against rhamnogalacturonan (RG) but not homogalacturonan. Analysis of the RG reaction products by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography revealed that rPcRGL4A cleaved the substrate in an endo-manner and that the major final product was an RG tetrasaccharide with 4-deoxy-4,5-unsaturated galacturonic acid at the nonreducing end. Based on these results, PcRGL4A was classified as an endo-acting RG lyase (EC 4.2.2.23). Divalent cations were not essential for the enzymatic activity of rPcRGL4A, but addition of calcium ions to the reaction mixture increased enzymatic activity. rPcRGL4A demonstrated a preference for RG lacking galactose decoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus aculeatus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanion exchange chromatography 3acalcium 3acations 3aenzyme activity 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3apH 3apolysaccharides1 aYamada, Hiroyuki1 aIkemoto, Takeshi1 aMatsumoto, Shotaro1 aFujiwara, Daisuke1 aTakenaka, Shigeo1 aSakamoto, Tatsuji0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2015 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.539-548dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-015-9847-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009000207300001800297520106600315592002801381650002201409650002101431650002901452650001201481650001301493650001601506650001901522650002301541650002201564650001301586650004901599650001201648650001401660650002201674650001301696650001101709650001301720700002801733700001701761700002701778700001901805773012401824856008301948852000902031655001202040IND60646012820221120234958.0201028e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064601282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04782-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyrda, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0492-720414aThe effect of organic solvents on selected microorganisms and model liposome membrane  ap. 3225-3232.  aThe effect of methanol, ethanol, acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide and Nujol on the growth of Escherichia coli DH5α, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273 was investigated. All of the tested cultures appeared susceptible to the organic media they were treated with, which evinced in apparent hindering of cell development. The observed diverse solvent tolerance, except from their different biochemical activity, may also be related to the changes in cell membrane fluidity induced by the solvent species. Parallel electron paramagnetic resonance investigations using egg yolk lecithin model liposomes revealed that the fluidity of the phospholipid system in cell membranes may either be considerably decreased (Nujol, DMF, ethanol) or increased (acetone), thus rendering difficult the intracellular nutrient supply. Hence, even the chemically neutral Nujol produced a distinct cell-growth inhibitory effect. These results are fairly consistent with the outcome of the survival tests, particularly for the bacteria strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetone 3abacteria 3acell growth 3acell membranes 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adimethylformamide 3aegg yolk 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aethanol 3alecithins 3amembrane fluidity 3amethanol 3amodels 3asolvents1 aBoniewska-Bernacka, Ewa1 aMan, Dariusz1 aBarchiewicz, Katarzyna1 aSłota, Rudolf0 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.3225-3232dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04782-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011200165300002000277520131900297592002801616650002301644650002201667650003701689650000801726650001301734650001401747650001501761650002501776650001301801650003301814650002501847650003701872650001901909700002001928700002001948700002701968700003201995700002302027700001902050773012402069856007402193852000902267655001202276IND60669099420221121080455.0190920e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066909942DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11884k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanishevsky, Andrei10aRibbon-like and spontaneously folded structures of tungsten oxide nanofibers fabricated via electrospinning  ap. 69534-69542.  aTungsten oxide (WO₃) nanofibers with shapes ranging from cylindrical to ribbon-like were prepared by annealing electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone/ammonium metatungstate (PVP/AMT) fibers. Formation of periodically folded “zigzag” patterns in PVP/AMT and WO₃ ribbon-like fibers was observed for the first time at the initial stage of the electrospinning process on the surface of a stationary substrate. Among methods tested (capillary needle, needleless dc- and ac-electrospinning), only the capillary needle dc-electrospinning process was effective in producing ribbon-like fiber structures. Annealing of such PVP/AMT fibers at 500 °C in air led to the formation of 80 ± 10 nm thick WO₃ ribbons with a width-to-thickness ratio of up to 50 : 1. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze the material. Analyses revealed that regardless the fiber's shape, the annealed oxide fibers were polycrystalline with a grain size of 60 ± 30 nm and consisted of the monoclinic phase of WO₃. When compared to cylindrical fibers, the ribbon-like WO₃ nanofibers exhibited higher porosity but lower mechanical strength with increased width of the ribbon-like structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aammonium 3aannealing 3ananofibers 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrength (mechanics) 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atungsten oxide1 aWetuski, Joshua1 aWalock, Michael1 aStanishevskaya, Inessa1 aYockell-Lelièvre, Hélène1 aKošťáková, Eva1 aLukáš, David0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 5, no. 85 p.69534-69542dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11884k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001600270500001100286520111600297592002801413650002501441650001101466650001401477650001701491650002401508650001401532650001801546650001801564650001401582650002301596650002601619650002101645650002401666650001001690650002601700650002001726650001901746650001001765773013601775856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60681935920221120141210.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068193592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01739-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKępczyński, Jan,10aProgress in utilizing plant-derived smoke water and smoke-derived KAR1 in plant tissue culture  ap. 271-278.  aReview  aPlant-derived smoke, its water extract—the smoke water (SW) and karrikinolide (KAR₁) isolated from smoke or synthesized from different substrates stimulate germination of dormant and non-dormant seeds of plants from fire-prone and fire-free areas, including horticultural crops, agricultural crops and weeds. Both SW and KAR₁ can be successfully used in in vitro cultures. They are able to stimulate pollen germination and growth of tubes. Growth of callus, efficiency of somatic embryogenesis, germination of somatic embryos and its conversion to plantlets are also positively affected by SW or KAR₁. SW can stimulate seed germination in vitro, promote extension of primary root section and increase frequency for initiation of lateral roots.

Here we report a study of the pollination system (floral and reproductive biology, pollen limitation and stigmatic pollen load, floral visitors and inbreeding depression) of Fumana hispidula, a Mediterranean subshrub belonging to a species group with a strong selfing tendency. Autonomous self-pollination, hand self- and hand cross-pollination, open pollination and controls yielded fruits (0.28, 0.65, 0.68, 0.38, and 0.67, respectively); however, autonomous self-pollination resulted in the lowest fruit set. All individuals were fully self-compatible but we found great inter-individual variation in autonomous self-pollination ability, which was probably related to a variable expression of herkogamy degree. Inbreeding depression was low (0.040 for fruit set, 0.015 for seed set and −0.026 for seed mass). The pollen supplementation experiment did not reveal pollen limitation and pollinators were seen visiting the flowers during the observation periods. These results support the idea that F. hispidula has a mixed mating strategy, which represents a successful reproduction mode in their patchy habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCistaceae 3across pollination 3aflowers 3afruit set 3afruit yield 3ahabitats 3ahands 3ainbreeding depression 3amating systems 3aopen pollination 3apollen 3apollinators 3aseed set 3aseeds 3aself-pollination 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCistaceaexclassificationxphysiology. 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFruitxphysiology 2aInbreeding 2aInsecta. 2aPollenxphysiology 2aPollinationxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSelf-Fertilizationxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity1 aGüemes, Jaime0 tJournal of plant research.g2013 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.33-40dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-012-0507-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007900177300001600256520124000272592002801512650001801540650001701558650001401575650002501589650001301614650001701627650001501644650001601659650002201675650001201697650001701709650001101726650001901737650000901756650001701765650001301782650001101795650002001806650001601826650001001842650001101852650001401863650001701877651001401894653002401908653001701932653002301949653001201972653001201984653002101996773008202017856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60637628120221117231832.0190421s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063762812DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900012902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweingruber, Fritz Hans10aAnnual Growth Rings and Growth Zones in Woody Plants in Southern Australia  ap. 359-379.  aCross sections of 760 trunks of approximately 670 species from 47 families of shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and trees were examined to study the incidence and appearance of different categories of growth zones. In montane/alpine sites with relatively cool winter temperatures all the woody plants form distinct growth rings similar to those seen in boreal and temperate regions throughout the world, and thus these rings are considered to represent annual rings. Most species from this phytogeographical zone are useful for crossdating. In the savannahs, the jarrah and karri woodlands of the southwest and the subtropical rain forests of the southeast identifiable growth zones are formed in most species. The approximate age of the woods can be determined, but crossdating is difficult or impossible. In the desert areas woody plants form irregular growth zones, the number of which may correspond to the incidence of rainfall, and age determination and crossdating is mostly impossible. Members of the well-studied families Cupressaceae, Epacridaceae and Myrtaceae form growth zones that are more distinct than the Mimosaceae and Proteaceae. Included phloem is present in all Chenopodiaceae, one Loranthaceae and two species of Verbenaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aCupressaceae 3aEricaceae 3aEucalyptus marginata 3aFabaceae 3aLoranthaceae 3aProteaceae 3aVerbenaceae 3aage determination 3adeserts 3agrowth rings 3aphloem 3aphytogeography 3arain 3arain forests 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter 3awoodlands 3awoody plants 3aAustralia 0aAnnual growth rings 0agrowth zones 0asouthern Australia 0aecology 0aclimate 0adendrochronology0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 13, no. 4 p.359-379dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900012903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245012400187300001700311520132900328592002801657650002201685650002201707650002301729650002301752650002001775650002301795650001301818650001101831650000801842650005401850650005801904650003401962650002801996650007702024650004202101650001802143650003702161650001102198650000902209650003202218650001602250650001502266650003402281650006202315650002302377650002002400650003802420650001702458650002202475651002502497700002702522773011302549852000902662856008302671655001202754IND2325078420221120120205.0181206e200011  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232507842DNAL7 a119128122pmid7 a10.1177/0145721700026006122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendricks, Leo E.14aThe Effect of Diabetes Self-Management Education With Frequent Follow-Up on the Health Outcomes of African American Men  ap. 995-1002.  aPURPOSE This study was conducted to determine whether objective clinical, patient performance, quality-of-life, and subjective outcomes are significantly different among African American men with type 2 diabetes who received follow-up at either monthly or 3-month intervals after participating in a structured diabetes self-management education program. METHODS Prior to the diabetes self-management education program, 30 African American men with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive telephone follow-up at either monthly or 3-month intervals over a 6-month period. Information obtained at follow-up contact included HbA₁c level, perception of general health, and present diabetes knowledge. In addition, daily foot care, dietary, exercise, and medication compliance measures were assessed postprogram. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the participants who received follow-up at monthly and 3-month intervals on any measures of the selected clinical, patient performance, quality-of-life, and subjective outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This cross-sectional study showed that telephone follow-up at 3 month intervals following a structured program of diabetes self-management education may be just as effective in contributing to favorable diabetes health outcomes as monthly follow-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3apatient education 3aeducation programs 3aprogram evaluation 3aquality of life 3apatient compliance 3apatients 3aBlacks 3amen 2aBlack or African Americanxeducationxpsychology. 2aAftercarexorganization & administrationxpsychology. 2aAttitude to Healthxethnology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xmetabolismxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHealth Status 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMenxeducationxpsychology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotivation 2aPatient Compliancexethnology 2aPatient Education as Topicxorganization & administration 2aProgram Evaluation 2aQuality of Life 2aSelf Carexpsychologyxstandards. 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 0aDistrict of Columbia1 aHendricks,, Rosetta T.0 tDiabetes educator.g2000 Nov., v. 26, no. 6 p.995-1002dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721700026006123Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02082naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012100160300001800281500002000299520121000319592002801529650001501557650001301572651001101585773013801596856007301734852000901807655001201816IND60651699920221117092229.0190712e20150213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065169992DNAL7 a10.3390/su70220452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTai, Hsing-Sheng10aCross-Scale and Cross-Level Dynamics: Governance and Capacity for Resilience in a Social-Ecological System in Taiwan  ap. 2045-2065.  aJournal Article  aResilience thinking has strongly influenced how people understand and pursue sustainability of linked social-ecological systems. Resilience thinking highlights the need to build capacity and manage general system properties in a complex, constantly changing world. I modified an analytical framework to address associations among cross-scale and cross-level dynamics, attributes of governance, and capacity to enhance resilience. The Danungdafu Forestation Area represents one of Taiwan’s most controvisal cases concerning land use, indigenous rights, and environmental issues. Analysis of this Taiwanese experience from a social-ecological perspective can show how current capacities for managing resilience are related to critical governance attributes. Analysis helped identify fundamental flaws in current governance and key issues needing to be addressed. The Danungdafu Forestation Area should transition towards a governance regime that is more participatory, deliberative, multi-layered, accountable, just, and networked. This can be done by developing an intermediate level institution that coordinates the cross-scale and cross-level interactions that better fit this social-ecological system.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3aland use 3aTaiwan0 tSustainability.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 7, no. 2 p.2045-2065dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70220453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015100164300001400315520147200329592002801801650002301829650001001852650001501862650001401877650000901891650001401900650001001914700001501924700001701939773010601956856008102062852000902143655001202152IND50089343220221119001316.0150214e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008934322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-002-0051-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherrer, B.10aTwo haplotypes of resistance gene analogs have been conserved during evolution at the leaf rust resistance locus Lr10 in wild and cultivated wheat  ap. 40-50.  aThe isolation of genes of agronomic interest such as disease resistance genes is a central issue in wheat research. A good knowledge of the organization and evolution of the genome can greatly help in defining the best strategies for efficient gene isolation. So far, very few wheat disease resistance loci have been studied at the molecular level and little is known about their evolution during polyploidization and domestication. In this study, we have analyzed the haplotype structure at loci orthologous to the leaf rust resistance locus Lr10 in hexaploid wheat which spans 350 kb in diploid wheat. Two haplotypes (H1, H2) were defined by the presence (H1) or the absence (H2) of two different resistance gene analogs (rga1, rga2) at this locus on chromosome 1AS. Both haplotypes were found in a collection of 113 wild and cultivated diploid and polyploid wheat lines and they do not reflect phylogenetic relationships. This indicates an ancient origin for this disease resistance locus and the independent conservation of the two haplotypes throughout the evolution of the wheat genome. Finally, the coding regions of the H1 haplotype RGAs are extremely conserved in all the species. This suggests a selective pressure for maintaining the structural and functional configuration of this haplotype in wheat.

Fundamental to the functioning of a microbial fuel cell is the formation of highly specialized bacterial biofilms on the electrode surface. While many different bacterial species have been found to associate with electrodes, to date only a few have been isolated in pure culture with the ability to produce a high current density. One such species, Geobacter sulfurreducens, is speculated to form an electrical conductive biofilm capable of electron transfer across a considerable distance greater than 50 µm. The mechanisms for electron transfer across such distances are only just being understood and may involve a matrix of bacterially produced nanowires and/or c-type cytochromes, but limited due to proton accumulation. Evolutionary and genetic engineering studies are now being employed to increase power output on a per cell basis with differing degrees of success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3abiofilm 3acytochromes 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agenetic engineering 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananowires1 aMalvankar, Nikhil1 aNevin, Kelly P0 tBiofuels.g2010 July 1, v. 1, no. 4 p.589-604dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.10.253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007500154300002000229520128000249592002801529650002001557650002801577650001701605650001301622650001101635650001101646650001701657700001701674700001601691773012401707856007401831852000901905655001201914IND60669099620221121080509.0190920e20150817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066909962DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11890e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Bin10aPhase-selective synthesis and formation mechanism of CZTS nanocrystals  ap. 70117-70126.  aIn this paper, we present a simple and feasible phase-selective synthetic approach to kesterite-phase and wurtzite-phase CZTS nanocrystals by controlling the concentration of sulfur and DDT. It is found that the sulfur precursor has an effect on the crystal phase formation and phase purity of the as-synthesized CZTS nanocrystals (NCs). With the increase of the amount of DDT substituted sulfur, CZTS NCs gradually evolve from kesterite-structure nanoplates to wurtzite-structure nanorods, and the as-synthesized CZTS NCs become smaller and more uniform. Time-dependent phase evolution results suggest that a small amount of DDT restrains the reactivity of the sulfur precursors, phase composition gradually evolves from Cu₁.₉₄S then to (ZnS)ₓ(Cu₂SnS₃)₁₋ₓ intermediate compounds and finally to kesterite CZTS NCs. Conversely, a small amount of S accelerates the decomposition of the DDT thiol group, which results in phase composition transformation from Cu₁.₉₄S then to (SnS)ₓ(Cu₂ZnS₃)₁₋ₓ intermediate compounds and finally to wurtzite CZTS NCs. The present study is a contribution towards understanding the phase-selective formation mechanism of CZTS nanocrystals, and provides a feasible approach to the synthesis of similar materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3acopper zinc tin sulfide 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3asulfur 3athiols 3azinc sulfide1 aXia, Donglin1 aWang, Youfa0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 17, v. 5, no. 86 p.70117-70126dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11890e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245008200170300001600252520161500268592002801883650001601911650001201927650002301939650001501962650001701977650001201994650002702006650001702033650004602050650001802096650002102114650001502135650002002150650001402170650001602184650004402200653002802244653000902272653001602281653001402297653001602311653001902327700001102346700005802357700001602415700001602431700001802447700001802465773009102483856009002574852000902664655001202673IND60632899020221118043621.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wanxin10aConversion of haloacid disinfection byproducts to amino acids via ammonolysis  ap. 351-359.  aHaloacetic acids (HAAs) are the major disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are formed during chlorination of drinking water. In this paper, the conversion of HAAs to amino acids (e.g., glycine) via ammonolysis was studied. First, a new and sensitive method for detecting glycine was developed by setting selected ion recording m/z 76 in positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography. Second, among the mono-HAAs under the same test conditions, iodoacetic acid (49.3%) showed a considerably higher conversion to glycine during ammonolysis than chloroacetic acid (4.2%) and bromoacetic acid (27.7%). The conversion of iodoacetic acid to glycine increased with increasing temperature, increasing reaction time, or decreasing the ratio of (NH4)2CO3 to NH3·H2O in the aminating agent. Hydrolysis of iodoacetic acid to glycolic acid was also observed during ammonolysis, and it accounted for at most 50% of the iodoacetic acid conversion. The conversion to amino acids and the hydrolysis were the two major pathways during ammonolysis of HAAs. Third, compared with the iodoacetic acid sample and the simulated tap water sample without ammonolysis, the developmental toxicity of the corresponding samples with ammonolysis decreased by up to 10.4% and 32.1%, respectively. The ammonolysis was thus demonstrated to be a detoxification process for both individual HAAs and DBP mixture in chlorinated tap water. In practice, the ammonolysis of haloacid DBPs in tap water may be realized by simply adding an appropriate amount of an aminating agent during cooking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3aammonium carbonate 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3acooking 3adevelopmental toxicity 3adisinfection 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aglycolic acid 3ahaloacetic acids 3ahydrolysis 3aiodoacetic acid 3atap water 3atemperature 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aDBPs 0aAmmonolysis 0aHaloacids 0aAmino acids 0aDetoxification1 aLi, Yu1 aZhang, Xiangru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6382-01191 aHan, Jiarui1 aZhu, Xiaohu1 aChoi, Ka Chun1 aJiang, Jingyi0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.351-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001800253520070900271592002800980650001301008650002301021650002301044650000901067650002301076653001301099653002501112653003501137653002401172653001601196700002201212700002101234700001901255700002301274773008101297856008101378852000901459655001201468IND60551469920221119192719.0161018e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055146992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Aléo, Anthony10aTuning solid-state emission properties of pyrene-containing chalcone derivatives  ap. 2255-2259.  aThe synthesis and optical properties of chalcone dyes containing pyrene as a donor is described both in solution and in solid-state. With such molecules, we show that, while the ground-state dipole moment is almost zero, the excited state is highly polar resulting in an intramolecular charge transfer excited state. All the chalcone molecules were shown to be emissive in the solid state but the behavior is different as a function of the substituent appended on the aryl group connected to the carbonyl function of the chalcone. We evidenced the beneficial effect of a methoxy function on the aggregation yielding an enhancement of the emission quantum yield in solid-state as compared to the solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3achalcone 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adyes 3aoptical properties 0aChalcone 0aSolid-state emitters 0aIntramolecular charge transfer 0aPhotophysical study 0aAggregation1 aKarapetyan, Artak1 aHeresanu, Vasile1 aGiorgi, Michel1 aFages, Frédéric,0 tTetrahedron.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 71 p.2255-2259dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005100160300001600211520078700227592002801014650001301042650001201055650001401067650002301081650001201104650001501116650001001131650001901141650001901160650001401179650001601193650001001209773010101219856007301320961001301393852000901406655001201415IND60693069020221120171927.0200504e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069306902DNAL7 a10.4155/bfs.10.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Charles C.,10aScreening assays for biomass-degrading enzymes  ap. 575-588.  aThe enzymes that break down the components of lignocellulosic biomass play an important role in the production of value-added chemical feedstocks and biofuels. In order to accommodate the variety of substrates and industrial process conditions, enzymes with diverse activity profiles are required. These enzymes are encoded by genes obtained either through screening of microorganisms or genetic engineering of cloned genes by techniques such as directed evolution. Both of these strategies require activity assays that facilitate the screening of many recombinants to isolate those with the desired characteristics. In this review, activity assays for enzymes that degrade cellulose and hemicellulose (specifically xylan) are described for analyzing samples at various throughputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3adirected evolution 3aenzymes 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3alignocellulose 3amicroorganisms 3ascreening 3avalue added 3axylan0 tBiofuels.g2010 July 1, v. 1, no. 4 p.575-588dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.10.263Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168300001600294520046800310592002800778650001500806650001300821650001700834653001900851653002800870653001800898653001400916773008200930856008101012852000901093655001201102IND60637628420221117231658.0190421s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063762842DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900012952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Shinji10aAnatomy and Properties of Japanese Hardwoods II.

The clinical applications of ansamitocins have stimulated extensive studies to improve their production yields. In this study, we investigated the function of a pathway-specific S treptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family regulator, Asm18, and observed that ectopic overexpression of the asm18 gene increased the production of N-demethyl-4,5-desepoxy-maytansinol (2) to 50 mg/L in the HGF052 + pJTU824-asm18 strain, an increase by 4.7-fold compared to that of the control strain HGF052 + pJTU824. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the overexpression of the asm18 gene selectively increased the transcription levels of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the starter unit (asm43), polyketide assembly (asmA), post-PKS modification (asm21), as well as the transcription levels of the regulatory gene (asm8), which is a specific LAL-type activator in ansamitocin biosynthesis. With the increase of fermentation titre, seven ansamitocin analogs (1–7) including three new ones (1, 5, and 6) and maytansinol (7) were isolated from the HGF052 + pJTU824-asm18 strain. Our results not only pave the way for further improving the production of ansamitocin analogs but also indicate that the post-PKS modifications of ansamitocin biosynthesis are flexible, which brings a potential of producing maytansinol, the most fascinating intermediate for the synthesis of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, by optimizing the HGF052 and/or HGF052 + pJTU824-asm18 strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinosynnema pretiosum 3aantibiotics 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiosynthesis 3aclinical trials 3afermentation 3agene overexpression 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulator genes 3aregulatory proteins1 aLu, Chunhua1 aChang, Xiaoyan1 aShen, Yuemao0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 100, no. 6 p.2641-2649dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7127-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245011800180300001200298520091000310592002801220650001601248650002001264650002401284650002201308650001501330650001301345650001501358700002601373700003001399700002701429773015201456856008201608852000901690655001201699IND60585185120221121233137.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058518512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-6337-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekaran, Sivapragasam10aGenetic programming-based mathematical modeling of influence of weather parameters in BOD5 removal by Lemna minor  ap. 607.  aThis study, through extensive experiments and mathematical modeling, reveals that other than retention time and wastewater temperature (Tw), atmospheric parameters also play important role in the effective functioning of aquatic macrophyte-based treatment system.

It is observed that the combined effect of atmospheric temperature (Tₐₜₘ), wind speed (Uw), and relative humidity (RH) can be reflected through one parameter, namely the “apparent temperature” (Tₐ). A total of eight different models are considered based on the combination of input parameters and the best mathematical model is arrived at which is validated through a new experimental set-up outside the modeling period.

(Polygonaceae) in India and Bangladesh during autumn and winter seasons. The insect is widely available during the winter season when the temperature fluctuates between 9 and 24 °C. Hence, it is of considerable interest to study how the adults cope with the stress resulting due to temperature fluctuations. Consequently, we analysed the levels of H₂O₂, antioxidant enzymes [catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), pyrogallol peroxidases (PPX), ascorbate peroxidases (APOX) and glutathione-S-transferases (GST)] and malondialdehyde (MDA) at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 °C in adult G. placida. H₂O₂ was highest at 24 °C followed by 9 °C and lowest at 18 and 21°C. CAT and SOD were highest at 9 °C followed by 24 °C, while POD was highest at 24 °C followed by 9 °C. CAT and POD were lowest at 18 and 21 °C, but SOD was the lowest at 21 °C. APOX were three-fold higher at 9 °C compared to 12 °C, which was the lowest at 18 and 21 °C, implying that APOX had strong detoxification function at 9 °C. GST was highest and lowest at 9 and 21 °C, respectively. MDA was highest at 9 °C and lowest at 18 and 21 °C, which did not differ significantly at 15 and 24 °C, suggesting that lower and higher temperature stress was accompanied by lipid peroxidation. This finding provides useful information for mass rearing of G. placida for predicting population dynamics and understanding the potential for G. placida as biocontrol agent under varying environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalerucella 3aPersicaria orientalis 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aautumn 3abiological control agents 3acatalase 3aenvironmental factors 3aglutathione transferase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainsects 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amass rearing 3apaddies 3aperoxidase 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3apyrogallol 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3aweeds 3awinter 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 0aH2O2 0aperoxidases 0aascorbate peroxidases 0aglutathione-S-transferases1 aMalik, Ujjwal1 aBarik, Anandamay0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2018 Dec., v. 38, no. 4 p.400-409dCambridge University PresswJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584180002183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245010100185300001800286520139800304592002801702650002201730650002201752650001701774650002301791650001301814650002501827650003601852650007801888650002301966650001101989650001102000650000902011650001602020650003202036650003202068650003202100650004002132650002502172650002402197650003202221650003602253650001402289650002202303773011402325852000902439856008302448655001202531IND2325078620221122091326.0181206e200011  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232507862DNAL7 a119128042pmid7 a10.1177/0145721700026006132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlette, John D.10aSatisfaction With Automated Telephone Disease Management Calls and Its Relationship to Their Use  ap. 1003-1010.  aPURPOSE this paper reports the results of an assessment of automated telephone disease management (ATDM) among patients in 2 randomized trials evaluating ATDM as an adjunct to usual care. METHODS During the 12-month follow-up interview, 256 low-income adults with diabetes from the intervention groups of 2 randomized trials were asked to respond to questions about their satisfaction with the ATDM process. Variation in satisfaction was examined across groups, and satisfaction reports were correlated with the extent to which patients completed ATDM assessments and used them to report glycemic levels or access educational messages. RESULTS Overall, 85% of patients reported that they were satisfied with the ATDM calls, 82% reported that they would be more satisfied with their health care if such calls were available to patients, and 76% reported that they personally would choose to receive such calls in the future. Most patients reported few difficulties completing ATDM assessments and found the calls to be a useful adjunct to their care. Some, however, found the calls intrusive; 16% reported that the calls were a bother. CONCLUSIONS Patients were satisfied with ATDM calls as part of their diabetes care. Satisfaction played some part in determining patients' use of ATDM assessment and health education, although other barriers also contributed to less than optimal usage rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3apatient education 3apatient care 3aprogram evaluation 3apatients 3ainformation services 2aAftercarexmethodsxpsychology. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxmetabolismxnursingxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aDisease Management 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNurse Cliniciansxstandards 2aNursing Assessmentxmethods 2aNursing Evaluation Research 2aPatient Education as Topicxmethods 2aPatient Satisfaction 2aPovertyxpsychology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Carexmethodsxpsychology. 2aTelephone 2aTreatment Outcome0 tDiabetes educator.g2000 Nov., v. 26, no. 6 p.1003-1010dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721700026006133Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01834naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012100178300001800299520067600317592002800993650001401021650002301035650001601058650001101074650001801085650001201103653002201115653002301137653002501160653001801185653001201203700001601215700002201231700002401253773008101277856008101358852000901439655001201448IND60551470020221119062104.0161018e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055147002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Pérez, Héctor10aEnantiopure bisphosphine ligands with appended crown ether groups as regulation sites for Rh-mediated hydrogenations  ap. 4490-4494.  aHerein is reported the efficient preparation of a set of enantiopure bisphosphine ligands, whose backbone incorporates an array of diverse crown ethers as distal regulation sites via well-defined supramolecular interactions to tune the catalytic properties of the bisphosphine groups. These new ligands enabled very good catalytic activity in rhodium-mediated asymmetric hydrogenations at low catalyst loadings, while the enantioselectivity remained moderate. Slightly positive regulation effects for the enantioselectivity of the hydrogenation reactions were obtained as a result of the combination of the appropriate bisphosphine ligand and different regulation agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenantiomers 3aethers 3ahydrogenation 3aligands 0aRegulable ligands 0aPhosphorus ligands 0aAsymmetric catalysis 0aHydrogenation 0aRhodium1 aMon, Ignasi1 aFrontera, Antonio1 aVidal-Ferran, Anton0 tTetrahedron.g2015 July 01, v. 71 p.4490-4494dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007100139245006600210300001600276500002000292520081900312592002801131596007601159596003301235596007501268596007201343596012601415650002301541650002401564650001101588650001701599650002301616650001501639650001301654650003001667650001101697650001801708650002701726651001101753700006401764700002401828700006001852700006501912700006101977700002402038700006402062700006002126700006002186700006602246700006202312700006002374700006402434700002602498700003102524700006802555700005802623700006002681700005802741700005802799700002302857700005602880773012702936856007303063852000903136655001203145IND60631155920221119122606.0190219e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063115592DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo‐Santos, Valter M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8986-640610aProtected areas: A focus on Brazilian freshwater biodiversity  ap. 442-448.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBrazil has a variety of aquatic ecosystems and rich freshwater biodiversity, but these components have been constantly damaged by the expansion of unsustainable activities. An array of different conservation strategies is needed, especially the creation of protected areas (PAs, hereafter). However, Brazil's PAs are biased towards terrestrial ecosystems and we argue that current PAs have limited efficacy in the protection of freshwater biodiversity. New PAs should better consider aquatic environments, covering entire basins, rivers and other freshwater habitats. We recommend ways to implement these PAs and provide guidance to avoid social impacts. Freshwater systems in Brazil provide essential goods and services but these ecosystems are being rapidly degraded and will be lost if not adequately protected.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)  aICAAF 094/2016cCNPq/FAPESPA  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq)  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Mato Grosso (FAPEMAT)  cPrograma de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Tecnológico do Setor de Energia Elétrica‐Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3apublic services and goods 3arivers 3asocial impact 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aBrazil1 aFrederico, Renata G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8858-64261 aFagundes, Camila K.1 aPompeu, Paulo S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7938-15171 aPelicice, Fernando M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9700-11941 aPadial, André A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8766-59741 aNogueira, Marcos G.1 aFearnside, Philip M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3672-90821 aLima, Luciano B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8286-80351 aDaga, Vanessa S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3707-716X1 aOliveira, Fagner J.

Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to explore relationships between the phytoplankton communities and environmental variables. Change points for concentrations of nutrients, which serve as early warnings of state shifts in lacustrine ecosystems, were identified using the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). The biomass of phytoplankton was positively correlated with the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), suspended solids (SS), water temperature (WT), and pH but negatively correlated with the N/P ratio (by mass) and Secchi disk depth (SD). Furthermore, TP, rather than other factors, was a controlling factor limiting the primary production of phytoplankton in most of this region. The change points for concentrations of TP controlling the occurrences of sensitive and tolerant taxa were 56.1 and 103.5 μg TP/L, respectively. These results imply that an abrupt change in this lacustrine ecosystem has occurred in most parts of the study area, and the turbid state of this lake can be altered by reducing TP loading. This study provides an alternative ecological method for exploring the production of algal blooms and could advance the understanding of HABs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aindicator species 3alakes 3anutrients 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3aChina1 aZhu, Yuanrong1 aFu, Zhiyou1 aQin, Ning1 aWang, Hao1 aLiu, Shasha1 aHu, Yan1 aWu, Fengchang1 aGiesy, JohnP.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Dec., v. 189, no. 12 p.608-608dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6318-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012500152300002000277520111300297592002801410650002401438650002301462650002601485650001701511650001501528650001301543650001901556650001701575650001201592650001901604650002201623650001901645650001701664700001701681700001501698700001801713700001601731700001601747773012401763856007401887852000901961655001201970IND60669099920221121051544.0190920e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066909992DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11894h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xu10aMicrostructure and properties of novel SPEEK/PVDF-g-PSSA blends for proton exchange membrane with improved compatibility  ap. 69621-69628.  aNovel blend membranes of poly(vinylidene fluoride) grafted poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PVDF-g-PSSA) with sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) were fabricated for direct methanol fuel cell applications. The PVDF-g-PSSA copolymer can be homogeneously dispersed in the SPEEK matrix with a unique hierarchical particle surface. All the SPEEK/PVDF-g-PSSA blend membranes exhibit better dimensional stability, lower methanol permeability, higher selectivity than commercial Nafion® 117 at room temperature. Notably, at the PVDF-g-PSSA content of 5 wt%, the blend membrane exhibits the best overall membrane performance, which is supposed to benefit from the improved compatibility and strong interactions between the PVDF-g-PSSA and SPEEK matrix. The thermal stability and the temperature dependence of water uptake, dimensional change and proton conductivity of the blend membranes are also investigated. This study provides a promising strategy for the design and fabrication of high performance polymer electrolyte membrane by rational control of microstructure and compatibility of the blend membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acomposite polymers 3adimensional stability 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3amethanol 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3astyrene 3asulfonic acids 3athermal stability 3athermoplastics 3awater uptake1 aMeng, Xiaoyu1 aWu, Juntao1 aHuo, Jiangbei1 aCui, Lishan1 aZhou, Qiong0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 5, no. 85 p.69621-69628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11894h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005400155245016300209300001600372520176100388592002802149650001202177650001902189650001602208650002402224650001802248650001502266650001302281650001302294650000702307650002402314650001102338650002102349650002702370650001302397650001302410650002302423650002902446650001402475650001602489650004402505650001502549650002002564653001202584653001902596653003802615653005102653653001902704700005802723700001402781700001302795773009102808856009002899852000902989655001202998IND60632899320221118043527.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-797410aSelective determination of sartan drugs in environmental water samples by mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 562-571.  aHerein, a method for the simultaneous determination of the currently prescribed sartan drugs (eprosartan, EPR; olmesartan, OLM; losartan, LOS; candesartan, CAN; telmisartan, TEL; irbesartan, IRB; and valsartan, VAL), and the biodegradation product valsartan acid (VALA), in water samples (raw and treated wastewater, river and tap water) was developed. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed as concentration and determination techniques, respectively. Different sorbents and elution solvents were tested for sample preparation. Under optimized conditions, samples at neutral pH (6–8 units) were concentrated using mixed-mode (reversed-phase and anionic exchange) cartridges. Thereafter, the sorbent was washed with 5 mL of a methanol: water (1:1) solution, dried under a nitrogen stream and compounds were eluted with 2 mL of methanol: NH3 (98:2). The accuracy of the method (accounting for SPE efficiency and matrix effects during electrospray ionization) was investigated using solvent-based calibration standards. Global recoveries, obtained for different water matrices (tap, river, treated and raw wastewater), ranged from 82% to 134%, with standard deviations between 2 and 18%. LOQs varied from 2 to 50 ng L−1. Analysis of un-spiked samples confirmed: (1) the incomplete removal of sartans at sewage treatment plants (STPs), (2) the formation of VALA during municipal water treatment, and (3) the presence of VALA in the processed tap water samples. Additional findings of the current study are the detection of hydroxylated derivatives of the sartan drugs IRB and LOS in wastewater, and the E-Z isomerization of EPR in environmental water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abiodegradation 3acalibration 3acis-trans isomerism 3ahydroxylation 3aionization 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3apH 3apublic water supply 3arivers 3asewage treatment 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atap water 3atelmisartan 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awastewater 3awater treatment 0aSartans 0aValsartan acid 0aMixed-mode solid-phase extraction 0aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0aWater analysis1 aRodríguez, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9693-20421 aRamil, M.1 aCela, R.0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.562-571dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245012400162520124000286592002801526650002301554650001201577650001201589650001801601650001401619650001401633650001101647650001701658650001701675650001301692650001001705650001401715650001001729651001001739651002501749700002401774700002501798700003201823700002201855700002101877773011901898856007202017852000902089655001202098IND60648675620221122145619.0190701e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867562DNAL7 a10.3390/f70801562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristiano, Giuseppe10aSalinity Differentially Affects Growth and Ecophysiology of Two Mastic Tree (<em>Pistacia lentiscus</em> L.) Accessions  aPistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae; mastic tree) is an evergreen sclerophyll species, largely distributed in dry areas of the Mediterranean basin and well-adapted to severe conditions of drought in very unfertile soils. In the present study, we evaluated the growing responses of two accessions of P. lentiscus to three different levels of salinity under nursery conditions. The two mastic tree accessions (Manfredonia and Specchia) were collected from individual trees in two different sites in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) and subjected to three different levels of salinization by adding 0, 400, and 800 g of salts 100 L−1 of substrate, respectively. The following parameters were recorded: plant height; survival of plants and total root length; total biomass; number of leaves per plant and leaf area; as well as various ecophysiological traits. Salinity reduced the values of all the examined parameters, both morphological and physiological. Results suggested that P. lentiscus can tolerate and accumulate salt at high concentrations in nursery conditions. As a result, it is important to identify germplasm that is highly tolerant to salinity for the production of nursery seedlings that will be planted in saline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia lentiscus 3abiomass 3adrought 3aecophysiology 3agermplasm 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aplant height 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalts 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aCamposeo, Salvatore1 aFracchiolla, Mariano1 aVivaldi, Gaetano Alessandro1 aDe Lucia, Barbara1 aCazzato, Eugenio0 tForests.g2016 July 27, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245017600173500001900349520193400368592002802302650002002330650000902350650002302359650001402382650001602396650002702412650001102439650001502450650001802465650000902483650001102492650001602503651001002519653003302529653002402562653003202586653004002618653001602658700001602674700001302690700001502703700001902718700001802737700002002755773011902775856008802894852000902982655001202991IND60713223120221117182637.0210201e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071322312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiangxue10aSpatiotemporal variations in the incidence of bacillary dysentery and long-term effects associated with meteorological and socioeconomic factors in China from 2013 to 2017  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacillary dysentery is a global public health problem that exhibits manifest spatiotemporal heterogeneity. However, long-term variations and regional determinant factors remain unclear. In this study, the Bayesian space-time hierarchy model was used to identify the long-term spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the incidence of bacillary dysentery and quantify the associations of meteorological factors with the incidence of bacillary dysentery in northern and southern China from 2013 to 2017. GeoDetector was used to quantify the determinant powers of socioeconomic factors in the two regions. The results showed that the incidence of bacillary dysentery peaked in summer (June to August), indicating temporal seasonality. Geographically, the hot spots (high-risk areas) were distributed in northwestern China (Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia) and northern China (including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei), whereas the cold spots (low-risk areas) were concentrated in southeastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong). Moreover, significant regional differences were found among the meteorological and socioeconomic factors. Average temperature was the dominant meteorological factor in both northern and southern China. In northern and southern China, a 1 °C increase in the average temperature led to an increase of 1.01% and 4.26% in bacillary dysentery risk, respectively. The dominant socioeconomic factors in northern and southern China were per capita gross domestic product and the number of health technicians, with q statistic values of 0.81 and 0.49, respectively. These findings suggest that hot, moist, and overcrowded environments or poor health conditions increase the risk of bacillary dysentery. This study provides suggestions and serves as a basis for surveillance efforts. Further, the suggestions may aid in the control of bacillary dysentery and in the implementation of disease prevention policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acold 3adisease prevention 3adysentery 3aenvironment 3agross domestic product 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperature 3aChina 0aSpatiotemporal heterogeneity 0aBacillary dysentery 0aNorthern and southern China 0aBayesian space-time hierarchy model 0aGeoDetector1 aGu, Xinchen1 aWang, Li1 aZhou, Yuke1 aHuang, Zhentao1 aXu, Chengdong1 aCheng, Changxiu0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.142626-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013600163300001200299520196900311592002802280596006002308596006002368596005802428650002002486650002402506650002302530650001002553650001602563650002102579650002302600650002202623650002602645650001902671700001402690700001202704773013402716856008202850852000902932655001202941IND60501322420221117223917.0210712e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4946-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Yonglei10aBiological characteristics of the nitrobenzene-degrading strain NB1 during bioaugmentation of nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater  ap. 360.  aBioaugmentation is a cost-effective and rapid technology for nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater. However, the biological characteristics of adding the nitrobenzene-degrading strain have not yet been comprehensively investigated. In the present study, a pure culture of the nitrobenzene-degrading strain NB1 was added into nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater for laboratory-scale bioremediation, and the biological characteristics that include biomass and microbial migration, microbial activities and community structures, and the expression of the nbzA gene were analysed. The removal rate of nitrobenzene could reach 82.98–88.36 % with bioaugmentation, and an approximately 2.0 × 10⁴–3.0 × 10⁴ cfu/mL strain of NB1 could grow better in groundwater, whereas most of the added strain of NB1 would rapidly die. The migration velocity of strain NB1 was approximately 0.08 m/day and groundwater flow was likely to provide the main power of migration. The microbial dehydrogenase activities of groundwater with bioaugmentation were maintained at a higher level compared with those of raw nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater. Bioaugmentation with strain NB1 did not obviously change the main microbial species. The influence of the introduction of strain NB1 on the microbial community structure was merely that the abundance of strain NB1 was significantly improved, whereas the abundances of other microorganisms were relatively decreased. The relative abundance and expression of the key nitrobenzene-degrading gene nbzA were enhanced by 1.20–1.65 times and by 1.54–8.57 times, respectively, as compared with raw nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater, which indicated that the addition of strain NB1 showed improved growth and facilitated the degradation of nitrobenzene in groundwater. These research achievements could contribute to the construction of field bioremediation of nitrobenzene-contaminated groundwater with bioaugmentation.  aPublisher supplied data  a41072170cnational natural science foundations of China  a41372236cnational natural science foundations of China  a2013M530986cpostdoctoral science foundation of China 3abioaugmentation 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3agenes 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms1 aLi, Jialu1 aLiu, Na0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.360-360dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4946-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009700173300001600270520098000286592002801266650002401294650004401318650002201362650001301384650002201397650001801419650001701437650000901454650002401463650001601487650001301503650002201516650001501538650001801553650003301571650000901604650001901613653002201632653002301654653002701677653002801704700005601732700001501788700001601803773009101819856009001910852000902000655001202009IND60632899620221118043747.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kejing10aLead removal by phosphate solubilizing bacteria isolated from soil through biomineralization  ap. 272-279.  aMicroorganisms with the function of biological mineralization were isolated from a soil.

Lead removal experiment indicated that the mathematical model of η=ηmax−ηcet/k fit the variation of removal rate with time well. Different from the previous studies, this work discovered that the culture medium had the ability to remove aqueous lead (Pb2+). At the same dosage, the removal rates of Pb2+ followed the order of: cells < culture medium < metabolites < bacterial suspension. The lead removal mechanism was further explored using the techniques of XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The results showed that during the fermentation, the bacteria decomposed phosphate-containing organic compounds in the culture medium to generate a large amount of phosphate groups on the surface of the bacterial cells. Pb2+ was precipitated in the form of Pb3(PO4)2 stable minerals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abacteria 3abiomineralization 3aculture media 3afermentation 3alead 3amathematical models 3ametabolites 3aminerals 3aorganic compounds 3aphosphates 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3asolubilization 0aBiomineralization 0aMathematical model 0aLead removal mechanism 0aPhosphate precipitation1 aXue, Yingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5070-42471 aXu, Huihui1 aYao, Yaonan0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.272-279dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245015500207300001200362506007600374520229000450592002802740506003702768650001902805650003302824650002102857650003002878650001502908650001502923650002602938650001502964650001802979650003002997650000903027650001403036650001903050651001303069700002203082700001703104700001803121700001703139700001603156700002003172700002303192700001903215700002103234700002403255773009103279856008103370852000903451655001203460IND60133134920221207090345.0150808e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313492DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-015-0306-42doi7 aPMC44329622pmcid7 a259721882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanks, Leslie10aDilution testing using rapid diagnostic tests in a HIV diagnostic algorithm: a novel alternative for confirmation testing in resource limited settings  ap. 306.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Current WHO testing guidelines for resource limited settings diagnose HIV on the basis of screening tests without a confirmation test due to cost constraints. This leads to a potential risk of false positive HIV diagnosis. In this paper, we evaluate the dilution test, a novel method for confirmation testing, which is simple, rapid, and low cost. The principle of the dilution test is to alter the sensitivity of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) by dilution of the sample, in order to screen out the cross reacting antibodies responsible for falsely positive RDT results. METHODS: Participants were recruited from two testing centres in Ethiopia where a tiebreaker algorithm using 3 different RDTs in series is used to diagnose HIV. All samples positive on the initial screening RDT and every 10th negative sample underwent testing with the gold standard and dilution test. Dilution testing was performed using Determine™ rapid diagnostic test at 6 different dilutions. Results were compared to the gold standard of Western Blot; where Western Blot was indeterminate, PCR testing determined the final result. RESULTS: 2895 samples were recruited to the study. 247 were positive for a prevalence of 8.5 % (247/2895). A total of 495 samples underwent dilution testing. The RDT diagnostic algorithm misclassified 18 samples as positive. Dilution at the level of 1/160 was able to correctly identify all these 18 false positives, but at a cost of a single false negative result (sensitivity 99.6 %, 95 % CI 97.8-100; specificity 100 %, 95 % CI: 98.5-100). Concordance between the gold standard and the 1/160 dilution strength was 99.8 %. CONCLUSION: This study provides proof of concept for a new, low cost method of confirming HIV diagnosis in resource-limited settings. It has potential for use as a supplementary test in a confirmatory algorithm, whereby double positive RDT results undergo dilution testing, with positive results confirming HIV infection. Negative results require nucleic acid testing to rule out false negative results due to seroconversion or misclassification by the lower sensitivity dilution test. Further research is needed to determine if these results can be replicated in other settings.

This paper, therefore, explores how different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes interact and combine over “space” to produce the mass variations that GRACE-TWSA detects. Using the Nile River Basin (NRB) as a case study, it explicitly analyzes nine hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes, as well as their relationship to the TWSA in different climatic zones. The analytic method employed the long-term trends derived for both the dependent (TWSA) and independent (explanatory) variables via applying two geographically multiple regression (GMR) approaches: (i) an ordinary least square regression (OLS) model in which the contributions of all variables to TWSA variability are deemed equal at all locations; and (ii) a geographically weighted regression (GWR) which assigns a weight to each variable at different locations based on clustering occurrences. The models’ efficacy was investigated using standard goodness of fit diagnostics. The OLS explains that the basin at large TWSA spatial variability significantly attributed to five variables, i.e., precipitation, runoff, surface water storage, soil moisture storage, and population density, (p < 0.0001). The OLS model, however, produced an R² value of 0.14 with skewed standardized residuals. In contrast, the GWR model retained varying explanatory variables by different climate zone. For instance, the results showed that all nine variables contribute significantly, with varying ranking, to the trend in TWSA in the tropical zone. The evapotranspiration (ET) and population density are the only significant variables in the semiarid zone; population density contributes significantly to TWSA variability in all zones. The GWR model yielded R² values with a median of 0.71 and normally distributed standard residuals. To evaluate the robustness of the GWR approach, the basin-wide TWSA pattern was simulated using the GWR model outputs. Herein, the GWR highlights the importance of the spatial locations to attribute the spatial variability in GRACE TSWA long-term trends. This spatial information, therefore, is critical for developing robust statistical models for reconstructing time series of proxy GRACE anomalies that predate the launch of the GRACE and for gap-filling between GRACE and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adiagnostic techniques 3aevapotranspiration 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3astatistical models 3asurface storage 3atime series analysis 3atropics 3awater storage 3awatersheds 3aNile River 0aGRACE-TWSA 0aGRACE-FO 0aNile River 0aSpatial autocorrelation 0aOLS 0aGWR1 aTarhule, Aondover0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 July, v. 586 p.124870-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1248703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245015000154520164800304592002801952650002301980650001202003650001302015650002102028650002002049650002202069650001502091650000902106650002702115650001202142650002502154650001502179651001002194700001502204700001702219700002002236700001802256773011902274856007202393852000902465655001202474IND60648675920221122192138.0190701e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867592DNAL7 a10.3390/f70801602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hanbo10aAssessing the Genetic Diversity and Genealogical Reconstruction of Cypress (<em>Cupressus funebris</em> Endl.) Breeding Parents Using SSR Markers  aTo identify genetic diversity, genetic structure and the relationship among accessions, and further establish a core collection for the long-term breeding of cypress (Cupressus funebris Endl.), the genealogy of breeding parents was reconstructed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers. Seventeen SSR markers were used to detect molecular polymorphisms among 290 cypress accessions from five provinces and 53 accessions with unknown origin in China. A total of 92 alleles (Na) were detected with 5.412 alleles per locus and an average polymorphism information content (PIC) of 0.593. The haplotype diversity (H) ranged from 0.021 to 0.832, with an average of 0.406. The number of alleles (Na) and the effective number of alleles (Ne) ranged from 4.294 to 5.176 and from 2.488 to 2.817 among five populations, respectively. The pairwise population matrix of Nei’s genetic distance ranged from 0.008 to 0.023. Based on the results of unweighted pair group method average (UPGMA) cluster and population structure analyses, 343 breeding parents were divided into two major groups. Lower genetic differentiation coefficients and closer genetic relationships were observed among cypress breeding parents, suggesting that the genetic basis was narrow, and the genetic relationship was confused by frequent introduction and wide cultivation. Moreover, we reconstructed the genealogy between breeding parents and 30 accessions of breeding parents from an identified core collection. According to the present study, not only geographic origin but also the relationship of the individuals should be considered in future crossbreeding work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupressus funebris 3aalleles 3acrossing 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apopulation structure 3aprovenance 3aChina1 aZhang, Rui1 aJin, Guoqing1 aFeng, Zhongping1 aZhou, Zhichun0 tForests.g2016 July 28, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012200181300001600303520110300319592002801422650002101450650002001471650001601491650001701507650001101524650002901535650001901564650002701583650001801610650001001628650001201638650001201650650003401662650002701696650001901723650002901742650002001771650001101791650003201802650002001834700002201854700002301876700003201899700001701931773010701948856008102055852000902136655001202145IND4473646820221119163743.0141111e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447364682DNAL7 a227490142pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2012.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yonglun10aTargeted Genome Editing by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) Vectors for Generating Genetically Modified Pigs  ap. 269-274.  aRecombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have been extensively used for experimental gene therapy of inherited human diseases. Several advantages, such as simple vector construction, high targeting frequency by homologous recombination, and applicability to many cell types, make rAAV an attractive approach for targeted genome editing. Combined with cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), this technology has recently been successfully adapted to generate gene-targeted pigs as models for cystic fibrosis, hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, and breast cancer. This review summarizes the development of rAAV for targeted genome editing in mammalian cells and provides strategies for enhancing the rAAV-mediated targeting frequency by homologous recombination. We discuss current development and application of the rAAV vectors for targeted genome editing in porcine primary fibroblasts, which are subsequently used as donor cells for SCNT to generate cloned genetically designed pigs and provide positive perspectives for the generation of gene-targeted pigs with rAAV in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acystic fibrosis 3afibroblasts 3agene therapy 3agenome 3ahomologous recombination 3ahuman diseases 3ainheritance (genetics) 3asomatic cells 3aswine 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aDependovirusxgenetics 2aGene Targeting 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHumans 2aNuclear Transfer Techniques 2aSwinexgenetics1 aKofod-Olsen, Emil1 aChristensen, Rikke1 aSørensen, Charlotte Brandt1 aBolund, Lars0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2012 June 20, v. 39, no. 6 p.269-274dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011700170300001600287520178300303592002802086650001502114650001602129650001702145650001402162650001502176650001202191650001402203650002202217650001202239651001702251651001302268651001702281651001302298651001202311651000902323700002602332700002102358700002302379700001802402773012602420856005502546852000902601655001202610IND4476873420221119163742.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447687342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01814.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosser, Neil,10aTesting historical explanations for gradients in species richness in heliconiine butterflies of tropical America  ap. 479-497.  aWe compiled a large database of 58 059 point locality records for 70 species and 434 subspecies of heliconiine butterflies and used these data to test evolutionary hypotheses for their diversification. To study geographical patterns of diversity and contact zones, we mapped: (1) species richness; (2) mean molecular phylogenetic terminal branch length; (3) subspecies richness and the proportion of specimens that were subspecific hybrids, and (4) museum sampling effort. Heliconiine species richness is high throughout the Amazon region and peaks near the equator in the foothills and middle elevations of the eastern Andes. Mean phylogenetic terminal branch length is lowest in the eastern Andes and tends to be low in species‐rich areas. By contrast, areas of high subspecies richness, where subspecies overlap in range and/or hybridize, are concentrated along the course of the Amazon River, with the eastern Andes slopes and foothills relatively depauperate in terms of local intraspecific phenotypic diversity. Spatial gradients in heliconiine species richness in the Neotropics are consistent with the hypothesis that species richness gradients are driven at least in part by variation in speciation and/or extinction rates, resulting in observed gradients in mean phylogenetic branch length, rather than via evolutionary age or niche conservatism alone. The data obtained in the present study, coupled with individual case studies of recently evolved Heliconius species, suggest that the radiation of heliconiine butterflies occurred predominantly on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, as well as in the upper/middle Amazon basin. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 105, 479–497.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeliconius 3abutterflies 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aextinction 3ahybrids 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3aAmazon River 3aAmazonia 3aAndes region 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aPeru1 aPHILLIMORE, ALBERT B.1 aHuertas, Blanca,1 aWILLMOTT, KEITH R.1 aMALLET, JAMES0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2012 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.479-497dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01814.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168520173700274592002802011650002102039650002402060650001402084650001302098653002302111653001902134653002902153653002402182700005502206700006102261773010502322856008602427852000902513655001202522IND60686857820221118070216.0210212e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068685782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1248722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wenlong10aAssessment of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion in sloping confined coastal aquifers  aPrevious studies of the impact of sea-level rise on seawater intrusion (SLR-SWI) are mostly based on horizontal coastal aquifers, despite that most coastal aquifers are sloping. A recent study has shown that the effect of aquifer slope can not be neglected when assessing SLR-SWI in unconfined coastal aquifers. However, the effect of slope in confined aquifers has not been evaluated. In this study, we apply existing analytical solutions to quantify the effect of the slope of both upper and lower confining layers on SLR-SWI. The results show that for flux-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, SLR does not change the steady-state interface location, consistent with previous findings for horizontal aquifers. Therefore, our analysis focuses on head-controlled sloping confined coastal aquifer systems, for which we find the assumption of horizontal confining units causes significant errors. We demonstrate this by assessing the sensitivities of the seawater toe location and seawater volume to SLR for various combinations of sloping confining layers. The results indicate that the influence of the slope on SLR-SWI is small in thin confined aquifers. However, the slope is an important factor in thick confined aquifers. The influence of the slope in the lower confining layer on SLR-SWI is much greater than that of the upper confining layer. Aquifers that thin towards the sea are most susceptible to SLR-SWI, whereas those that thin towards inland are least susceptible. The assessment of SLR-SWI in sloping confined coastal aquifers in the current study demonstrates application of a rapid, first-order assessment tool that can be applied to a wide range of other sloping coastal confined-aquifer problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfined aquifer 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 0aSeawater intrusion 0aSea-level rise 0aSloping confined aquifer 0aAnalytical solution1 aLu, Chunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0676-08821 aWerner, Adrian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1190-13010 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 July, v. 586 p.124872-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1248723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245010100187300001600288500001500304520136300319592002801682650001501710650002701725650002201752650001701774650001101791650001001802650001901812650003101831650001501862650001101877650002401888650001101912650002601923650000901949650002401958651001801982653003602000700001902036773011302055852000902168856008302177655001202260IND2326576120221122123450.0190621e200109  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232657612DNAL7 a122120172pmid7 a10.1177/0145721701027005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgede, Leonard E.10aPerceived Difficulty of Diabetes Treatment in Primary Care: Does it Differ by Patient Ethnicity?  ap. 678-684.  a2019-12-04  aPURPOSE The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the attitudes of internal medicine physicians toward treating diabetes in different patient ethnic groups and compared with treating common chronic medical conditions in primary care. METHODS The survey instrument was administered to 55 internal medicine physicians. An e-mail message was sent to each physician with a hyperlink to a site where the survey could be completed. The instrument was a modified, quantitative 10-point scale designed to measure attitudes regarding the difficulty of treating diabetes. RESULTS Diabetes was perceived to be more difficult to treat than hyperlipidemia and angina. African Americans with diabetes were perceived to be more difficult to treat than Caucasian patients. Difficulty in treating diabetes was comparable to that for hypertension, arthritis, and congestive heart failure. Physicians were confident about treatment efficacy for diabetes and changing diabetes outcomes, but not about the adequacy of time and resources for diabetes treatment. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes was perceived as a difficult disease to treat, African American patients were more difficult to treat, and time and resources were inadequate for diabetes treatment. To improve diabetes care, there is a need to address these attitudes and concerns of internal medicine physicians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphysicians 3aattitudes and opinions 3adiabetes mellitus 3apatient care 3aBlacks 2aAdult 2aRacial Groups. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxtherapy 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aHealth Care Surveys 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxtherapy 2aMale 2aPrimary Health Care 0aUnited States 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aMiohel, Yvonne0 tDiabetes educator.g2001 Sept., v. 27, no. 5 p.678-684dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721701027005083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03347naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245015400180300001600334520168900350592002802039650002002067650001902087650001502106650001502121650002502136650001202161650002002173650001402193650002202207650000902229650001502238650001402253650002802267650001102295650001902306650001502325650001102340650003302351653002102384653001502405653001902420653001102439653002002450653001202470653001902482700001902501700002202520700006102542773009102603856009002694852000902784655001202793IND60632899920221118043544.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhadersarbazi, Zhila10aToxicity assessment of arsenic on common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and development of natural sorbents to reduce the bioconcentration by RSM methodology  ap. 247-255.  aThe objective of the present study was firstly acute toxicity bioassay of arsenic on common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and then the development of natural sorbent beds (clinoptilolite and pumice) to reduce bioconcentration of arsenic in muscle tissue were considered in comparative evaluation. In this regard, the acute toxicity of arsenic on juvenile fish was assessed according to the OECD guideline (No. 203). Moreover, the efficacy of clinoptilolite and pumice as natural sorbents was assessed to reduce bioconcentration of arsenic in the fish muscle tissue during a 21 day by response surface methodology (RSM) under central composite design (CCD). The most important point of this study was to evaluate the interactions between independent variables (clinoptilolite and pumice as sorbents and arsenic as pollutant) and arsenic bioconcentration in fish muscle tissue as a dependent variable (response). In these regards, a total of 24 sets of experiments (12 sets for clinoptilolite and pumice separately) were designed by the software to achieve the best adsorption conditions. According to the arsenic toxicity test, results as estimated by Probit method, the 96 h LC50 was 9.48 ± 1.01 mg/L. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) which was applied to modeling and optimization of response revealed that the predicted values were in relatively good agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the obtained value for model desirability by clinoptilolite and pumice were 0.932 and 0.958, respectively. Overall, the obtained results indicate that both adsorbents reduced the bioconcentration of As (V) in the muscle tissue of common carp, but clinoptilolite was more effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aacute toxicity 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abioassays 3acomputer software 3afish 3aguidelines 3ajuveniles 3alethal concentration 50 3amodels 3amuscle tissues 3apollutants 3apumice 3aresponse surface methodology 0aBioconcentration 0aAdsorption 0aClinoptilolite 0aPumice 0aCyprinus carpio 0aArsenic 0aToxicity tests1 aGhiasi, Farzad1 aGhorbani, Farshid1 aJohari, Seyed Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1210-54540 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.247-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001400249520063300263592002800896650001200924650001100936650001600947650001900963650002100982650001701003653001101020653001601031653001101047653002601058653001801084653003101102700001801133773008001151856008101231852000901312655001201321IND60637629320221117231639.0190421s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063762932DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900005762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiner, Gudrun10aGeneric Identification Key to Rattan Palms Based on Stem Anatomical Characters  ap. 55-61.  aThe rattan palms consist of 13 genera which present distinct anatomical differences. Of special significance are the number of phloem fields and vessels per vascular bundie, type of ground parenchyma, occurrence of fibre rows in the cortex, 'yellow cap', raphide sacs, arrangement of sieve tubes and size of the fibre sheath of the outer vascular bundles. On the basis of these features a dichotomous key for the identification of the rattan genera has been developed.

However, metabolic engineering of carotenoid biosynthetic pathways often has unintended effects, leading to major metabolic changes in plants that harbor endogenous beta-carotene biosynthesis pathways. In the present study, we performed transcriptome profiling analysis using RNA-seq to investigate the changes in the transcriptome and some unintended pleiotropic effects on the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of beta-carotene-enhanced transgenic soybean lines, and compared them to those of their non-transgenic counterpart donor variety Kwangan. We observed that transgenic soybeans showed significant changes in secondary metabolic biosynthesis in leaves and down-regulated galactose metabolism in roots. Differentially expressed genes in the transgenic group, which were significantly up-regulated, included those encoding glycine-aspartic acid-serine-leucine-motif esterase/lipase, known as cutin synthase and cutinase. These results suggested enhanced beta-carotene biosynthesis may affect related enzymes to carbohydrate metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Hence, we speculated that upregulation of cutin polymerization resulted in thickened seed coat and delayed seed germination of transgenic soybeans. Furthermore, downregulation of raffinose family oligosaccharide biosynthesis may cause redundancy of myo-inositol, a substrate of phytin formation. This could lead to phytic globoids accumulation in transgenic soybean seeds. The present imformation would be important for transgenic plant development via carotenoid metabolic engineering, with focus on beta-carotene over-production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ010902cRural Development Administration 3abeta-carotene 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarotene 7,8-desaturase 3acutin 3acutinase 3adiet 3afatty acid metabolism 3agalactose 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3ametabolic engineering 3amyo-inositol 3aphytin 3aphytoene synthase 3apleiotropy 3apolymerization 3araffinose 3aroots 3aseed coat 3aseed germination 3asequence analysis 3asoybeans 3astems 3atissues 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency1 aWoo, Hee-Jong1 aShin, Kong-Sik1 aLim, Myung-Ho1 aLee, Seong-Kon0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2020 Feb., v. 140, no. 2 p.341-356dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01731-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002000147040001800167072000900185100002400194245013900218300001600357500002400373520149400397650003101891650002901922650001901951650002201970650001201992650001502004650001602019650002502035650001002060650001502070650002702085650001302112650001402125650001702139650001202156650001502168650001402183650002802197650003502225650001102260650001602271653002002287700002002307773012402327852000902451856008602460856011102546930003302657945002502690946001302715961001302728655001202741IND4375189620221116193706.0051014e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437518962DNAL7 a158897162pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-98.2.2892doi7 a10113/15452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aHollingsworth, R.G.10aPotential of temperature, controlled atmospheres, and ozone fumigation to control thrips and mealybugs on ornamental plants for export  ap. 289-298.  aIncludes references  aOzone (O3) fumigation is a potential quarantine treatment alternative for controlling stored-product pests and surface insect pests on fresh agricultural commodities. We explored the effects of temperature, treatment time, controlled atmospheres, and vacuum in combination with O3 to control two important pests of ornamental crops: western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), and longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus Targioni Tozzetti. Treatment parameters tested were O3 concentrations from 0 to 3,800 ppm, treatment durations were from 30 to 120 min, vacuums were from 0 to 0.41 bar below ambient, temperatures were from 32.2 to 40.6 degrees C, and controlled atmospheres were composed primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or breathing air [BA]. Treatment efficacy was enhanced by higher O3 concentration and temperature, lower oxygen, and longer treatment times. Reduced pressure was not an important factor. Mealybugs were more difficult to kill than thrips. A 30-min treatment of O3 at approximately equal to 200 ppm in 100% CO2 at 37.8 degrees C killed 47.9 and 98.0% of mealybugs and adult female thrips, respectively. All of the ornamentals tested were damaged to some degree by O3 treatments. However, crops with thick leaves such as orchids exhibited little damage, and the waxy portions of certain flowers were not damaged. The results suggest that O3 has potential as a quarantine treatment to control thrips and mealybugs on selected commodities. 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aPseudococcus longispinus 3ainsect control 3aornamental plants 3aexports 3aquarantine 3atemperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3aozone 3afumigation 3achemical concentration 3aduration 3amortality 3aplant damage 2aAnimals 2aFumigation 2aHemiptera 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aOzonexadministration & dosage 2aPlants 2aTemperature 0avacuum pressure1 aArmstrong, J.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2005 Apr., v.  98, no.  2 p.289-298dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-98.2.2893Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070731b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02554naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245018300155520143400338592002801772650002701800650002501827650002001852650001401872650001501886650001001901651001001911700001701921700001901938700001601957700001601973700001501989773011902004856007202123852000902195655001202204IND60648676420221122113156.0190701e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867642DNAL7 a10.3390/f70901942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Lifeng10aDeveloping an Improved Parameter Estimation Method for the Segmented Taper Equation through Combination of Constrained Two-Dimensional Optimum Seeking and Least Square Regression  aThe segmented taper equation has great flexibility and is widely applied in exiting taper systems. The unconstrained least square regression (ULSR) was generally used to estimate parameters in previous applications of the segmented taper equations. The joint point parameters estimated with ULSR may fall outside the feasible region, which leads to the results of the segmented taper equation being uncertain and meaningless. In this study, a combined method of constrained two-dimensional optimum seeking and least square regression (CTOS &amp; LSR) was proposed as an improved method to estimate the parameters in the segmented taper equation. The CTOS &amp; LSR was compared with ULSR for both individual tree-level equation and the population average-level equation using data from three tropical precious tree species (Castanopsis hystrix, Erythrophleum fordii, and Tectona grandis) in the southwest of China. The differences between CTOS &amp; LSR and ULSR were found to be significant. The segmented taper equation estimated using CTOS &amp; LSR resulted in not only increased prediction accuracy, but also guaranteed the parameter estimates in a more meaningful way. It is thus recommended that the combined method of constrained two-dimensional optimum seeking and least square regression should be a preferred choice for this application. The computation procedures required for this method is presented in the article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanopsis purpurella 3aErythrophleum fordii 3aTectona grandis 3aequations 3aprediction 3atrees 3aChina1 aMa, Yongpeng1 aSharma, Ram P.1 aRice, Shawn1 aSong, Xinyu1 aFu, Liyong0 tForests.g2016 Aug. 31, v. 7, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70901943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008900158300001800247500002000265520054900285592002800834650002300862650001300885650002200898650001500920700002200935773013800957856007301095852000901168655001201177IND60651701020221119103453.0190712e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065170102DNAL7 a10.3390/su70222592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeutz, Pauline10aFrom Theory to Practice: Enhancing the Potential Policy Impact of Industrial Ecology  ap. 2259-2273.  aJournal Article  aIndustrial ecology introduced a new paradigm of principles and tools useful to academic analysis and decision support activities for industry and policymakers.

Currently, it feeds 22% of the global population with 9% of the global area of arable land. However, these achievements were made at high external resource use and environmental costs. The challenge facing China is to further increase food production while drastically decreasing the environmental costs of food production. Here we review the major developments in nutrient management in China over the last 50 years. We briefly analyze the current organizational structure of the “advisory system” in agriculture, the developments in nutrient management for crop production, and the developments in nutrient management in animal production. We then discuss the nutrient management challenges for the next decades, considering nutrient management in the whole chain of crop production–animal production–food processing–food consumption by households. We argue that more coherent national policies and institutional structures are required for research extension education to be able to address the immense challenges ahead. Key actions include nutrient management in the whole food chain concomitant with a shift in objectives from food security only to food security, resource use efficiency, and environmental sustainability; improved animal waste management based on coupled animal production and crop production systems; and much greater emphasis on technology transfer from science to practice through education, training, demonstration, and extension services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manure management 3aanimal production 3aarable soils 3acrop production 3aextension education 3afood chain 3afood production 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3anutrient management 3aproduction technology 3atechnology transfer 3aChina1 aZhang, W.

Colletotrichum acutatum, Cladosporium herbarum, Alternaria brassicicola, Exserohilum sp., Alternaria mali, Colletotrichum gleospoiroides, Alternaria alternata, Cercospora sp., Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. dianthi and Fusarium moniliformae, was isolated from soil and identified as Streptomyces hydrogenans DH16. Application of culture supernatant (5%)/cells (10⁷ cfu ml⁻¹), 2 h post inoculation with A. brassicicola (10⁵ spores ml⁻¹), resulted in 85.95 and 93.75% suppression of black leaf spot of Raphanus sativus, respectively on detached leaves. Whereas cells/culture supernatant (above 5%) completely suppressed the disease incidence when co inoculated with fungal pathogen. The crude extract containing antifungal components was completely stable at 70 °C for 1 h retaining 90 and 67.67% activity after boiling (for 1 h) and autoclaving (121 °C for 30 min), respectively. No loss in activity was observed when treated with proteinase K and on exposure to sun and UV light and found to be active over a wide range of pH (2 to 14). Bioautography of the solvent extract against test phytopathogens revealed the presence of three active components. Ethyl acetate extract of DH16 also demonstrated insecticidal activity against Spodoptera litura, causing 40% larval mortality and extension of larval period. In addition, it produced 30 µg ml⁻¹of Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) in a medium containing tryptophan which promoted lateral root formation in Vigna radiata (green gram). These results indicate that Streptomyces hydrogenans holds the potential to be used as antifungal, insecticidal, and plant growth promoting agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAlternaria brassicicola 3aAlternaria mali 3aCercospora 3aCladosporium herbarum 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3aExserohilum 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aRaphanus sativus 3aSpodoptera litura 3aStreptomyces exfoliatus 3aVigna radiata 3aantifungal properties 3aautoclaving 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aboiling 3adisease incidence 3aethyl acetate 3aindole acetic acid 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amortality 3amung beans 3apH 3apeptidase K 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asoil 3asolvents 3aspores 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet radiation1 aManhas, Rajesh Kumari0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2014 Nov., v. 54, no. 11 p.1175-1185dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245005300204300001600257500001900273500002000292520166400312592002801976650001702004650002002021650001402041650001502055650002202070650002202092650001102114650002402125700006002149700002302209700002502232700001902257700006002276773012002336856007402456852000902530655001202539IND60732646320221118035843.0210331e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073264632DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.135752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, Simone L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9807-980710aMatching biodiversity indicators to policy needs  ap. 522-532.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAt the global scale, biodiversity indicators are typically used to monitor general trends, but are rarely implemented with specific purpose or linked directly to decision making. Some indicators are better suited to predicting future change, others are more appropriate for evaluating past actions, but this is seldom made explicit. We developed a conceptual model for assigning biodiversity indicators to appropriate functions based on a common approach used in economics. Using the model, indicators can be classified as leading (indicators that change before the subject of interest, informing preventative actions), coincident (indicators that measure the subject of interest), or lagging (indicators that change after the subject of interest has changed and thus can be used to evaluate past actions). We classified indicators based on ecological theory on biodiversity response times and management objectives in 2 case studies: global species extinction and marine ecosystem collapse. For global species extinctions, indicators of abundance (e.g., the Living Planet Index or biodiversity intactness index) were most likely to respond first, as leading indicators that inform preventative action, while extinction indicators were expected to respond slowly, acting as lagging indicators flagging the need for evaluation. For marine ecosystem collapse, indicators of direct responses to fishing were expected to be leading, while those measuring ecosystem collapse could be lagging. Classification defines an active role for indicators within the policy cycle, creates an explicit link to preventative decision‐making, and supports preventative action.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adecision making 3aeconomics 3aextinction 3aissues and policy 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3awildlife management1 aWatermeyer, Kate1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4589-352X1 aCaggiano, Giovanni1 aFulton, Elizabeth A.1 aFerrier, Simon1 aNicholson, Emily1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2199-34460 tConservation biology.g2021 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.522-532dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.135753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013700185300001800322520124700340592002801587650001401615650002401629650001601653650001101669650001901680650002901699650002601728650001601754650001301770650001601783650001301799650002501812650001401837650001801851650002201869650002101891650001201912650002501924650005201949650001402001650002502015650001402040650001502054650005502069650002102124651001002145651001002155700001902165700002302184700001902207773012202226856004802348852000902396655001202405IND4474640720221118160343.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447464072DNAL7 a228061642pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-012-1067-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Anusree V.10aDiversity and characterization of antagonistic bacteria from tropical estuarine habitats of Cochin, India for fish health management  ap. 2581-2592.  aMortalities due to pathogenic bacteria are a major problem in aquaculture, especially in larval rearing systems. Use of antibiotics to overcome this problem is not an option any more due to the increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens. The present study aims to understand the diversity of bacteria with antagonistic properties in the tropical estuarine habitats of Cochin, located along the southwest coast of India, and to use them as an alternative to antibiotics in aquaculture. Among the 4,870 isolates screened, approximately 1 % showed significant antibacterial activity against six common aquaculture pathogens belonging to the genera Aeromonas and Vibrio. The antagonistic bacteria were identified as Bacillus (81 %) and Pseudomonas (19 %) using biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence homology. The isolates showing stable and higher levels of antibacterial activity were subjected to enzymatic expression profile, antibiotic resistance pattern and abiotic stress tolerance assays. As a result, five Pseudomonas spp. and four Bacillus spp., were identified as promising antagonistic isolates that could be exploited as probionts or microbial products (MP’s), to control bacterial diseases in aquaculture rearing systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aPseudomonas 3aVibrio 3aabiotic stress 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3afish health 3ahabitats 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3astress tolerance 2aAnimals 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aBacillusxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aProbiotics 2aPseudomonasxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTropical Climate 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aVijayan, K.

In this study, we investigated the effects of fucoxanthin, isolated from the edible brown seaweed Petalonia binghamiae, on adipogenesis during the three differentiation stages of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When fucoxanthin was applied during the early stage of differentiation (D0–D2), it promoted 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by increased triglyceride accumulation. At the molecular level, fucoxanthin increased protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and aP2, and adiponectin mRNA expression, in a dose-dependent manner. However, it reduced the expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1c during the intermediate (D2–D4) and late stages (D4–D7) of differentiation. It also inhibited the uptake of glucose in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by reducing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). These results suggest that fucoxanthin exerts differing effects on 3T3-L1 cells of different differentiation stages and inhibits glucose uptake in mature adipocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetalonia 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadiponectin 3adose response 3agene expression 3aglucose 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transducing adaptor proteins 3atriacylglycerols1 aKo, Hee-Chul1 aShin, Hye-Sun1 aKim, Hyo-min,1 aHong, Youn-Suk1 aYi, Nam-ho,1 aKim, Se-Jae0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 17, v. 409, no. 4 p.769-774dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245011200210300001600322500001900338500002000357520164000377592002802017596004102045650001702086650003002103650002402133650002402157773012002181856007402301852000902375655001202384IND60732646420221118035658.0210331e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073264642DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.135982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrould‐Kolieb, Ellycia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3347-300X10aEnhancing synergies between action on ocean acidification and the post‐2020 global biodiversity framework  ap. 548-558.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOcean acidification is a substantial emergent threat to marine biodiversity and the goods and services it provides. Although efforts to address ocean acidification have been taken under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a far greater potential to do so exists by finding synergies between biodiversity conservation efforts and ocean acidification action. The ongoing process to develop a post‐2020 global biodiversity framework offers an opportunity to ensure that opportunities for addressing ocean acidification are capitalized on and not overlooked. I argue that to achieve this, the following are needed: a technical integration of ocean acidification across the targets to be included in the post‐2020 framework and a reframing of the issue as a biodiversity problem so as to highlight the synergies between existing biodiversity work and action needed to address ocean acidification. Given that the post‐2020 framework is intended to establish the global biodiversity agenda for the coming decades, integration of ocean acidification will set a precedent for the other biodiversity‐related conventions and encourage greater uptake of the issue across the wider international community. My approach is of direct relevance to those participating in the negotiations, both from a CBD Party perspective and the perspective of those advocating for a strong outcome to protect marine biodiversity and marine socioecological systems. My discussion of framing is relevant to those working beyond the CBD within other biodiversity‐related conventions in which goals to address ocean acidification are sorely lacking.  aPublisher supplied data  cCommonwealth Government of Australia 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aocean acidification 3awildlife management0 tConservation biology.g2021 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.548-558dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.135983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007000168300001600238520125400254592002801508650002401536650001201560650002201572650002101594650001401615650002901629650002101658650002201679650001301701650001601714650002201730653001801752653001801770653001801788653001601806653001601822653002201838653001301860700002001873700001901893773010301912856008402015852000902099655001202108IND60479498020221119063211.0160122e20020701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047949802DNAL7 a10.1556/ABiol.53.2002.3.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekonnen, A.

BR is a plant specific steroid hormone, which has multiple stress resistance functions besides various growth regulatory roles. Being an important regulator of the BR synthesis, BZR TFs might have stress resistance related activities. However, no stress resistance related functional study of BZR TFs has been reported in any crop plants so far. Therefore, this study identified 15 BZR TFs of Brassica rapa (BrBZR) from a genome-wide survey and characterized them through sequence analysis and expression profiling against several abiotic stresses. Various systematic in silico analysis of these TFs validated the fundamental properties of BZRs, where a high degree of similarity also observed with recognized BZRs of other plant species from the comparison studies. In the organ specific expression analyses, 6 BrBZR TFs constitutively expressed in flower developmental stages indicating their flower specific functions. Subsequently, from the stress resistance related expression profiles differential transcript abundance levels were observed by 6 and 11 BrBZRs against salt and drought stresses, respectively. All BrBZRs showed several folds up-regulation against exogenous ABA treatment. All BrBZRs also showed differential expression against low temperature stress treatments and these TFs were proposed as transcriptional activators of CBF cold response pathway of B. rapa. Notably, three BrBZRs gave co-responsive expression against all the stresses tested here, suggesting their multiple stress resistance related functions. Thus, the findings would be helpful in resolving the complex regulatory mechanism of BZRs in stress resistance and further functional genomics study of these potential TFs in different Brassica crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aabscisic acid 3abrassinosteroids 3acold 3acold stress 3acole crops 3adrought 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3asteroid hormones 3astress tolerance 3asurveys 3atransactivators 0aAbiotic stress 0aBEH 0aBrassica rapa 0aBZR 0aTFs 0aBZR 0aBEH 0aTFs 0aBR 0aBr 0aBRAD 0aCDS 0aDUF 0abHLH 0aRT-PCR 0aqPCR 0aPIR 0aμL1 aPark, Jong-In1 aJung, Hee-Jeong1 aAhmed, Nasar Uddin1 aAbdul Kayum, Md.,1 aKang, Jong-Goo1 aNou, Ill-Sup1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6768-05200 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 July, v. 92 p.92-104dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01364naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245002600173300001600199520052000215592002800735650000900763650001200772650002200784650001500806650001900821700002300840773012000863856008200983852000901065655001201074IND60618451120221118055601.0181029e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061845112DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517582052009042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, Sarfraz A.10aSolubility Parameters  ap. 570-579.  aSeveral methods exist for determining, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, solubility parameters of organic compounds including dyes, fibers, and dyeing sol vents.

In this study, a modified dual-templating strategy for architectural design of 3D HOPC as a promising electrode material for high-rate EC applications was developed by using polystyrene and Pluronic F127 as macro- and meso-porous templates, respectively. Tetraethyl orthosilicate was also added as the silica precursor, and then the sol–gel-derived SiO₂ was removed by sodium hydroxide to form the second mesopore in HOPC (HOPC-s) for enhancing the accessible surface areas and pore structures. The HOPC-s formed by the templating strategy is composed of highly ordered macropores, macroporous windows, bimodal mesopores, and micropores, resulting in high specific surface area (1112 m² g⁻¹), high total pore volume (1.18 cm³ g⁻¹) and an easily accessible environment for fast electrolyte ion transport. The specific capacitance of the HOPC-s electrodes can reach 316 F g⁻¹ at 25 mV s⁻¹ and maintain excellent capacitive retention at a high scan rate of 1000 mV s⁻¹ when compared with that of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-s). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fitting shows that the pore electrolyte resistance of HOPC-s is 3 times lower than that of OMC-s, which is attributed to the hierarchical macroporous structures and short mesoporous channels. In the symmetric capacitor test, the HOPC-s also shows excellent power capability, and the energy density of 4–10 W h kg⁻¹ can be maintained over the power density range of 1–14 kW kg⁻¹. In addition, the capacitance of HOPC-s in the polycarbonate-containing ionic liquid shows 80% retention at a scan rate of 500 mV s⁻¹, indicating that the unique hierarchical structure can provide efficient ion-buffering capacity for high-rate performance. These exceptional electrochemical performances clearly demonstrate that 3D HOPC-s is a superior material to solve the poor ion transport limitation, which can open an avenue to fabricate high-rate ECs with high power and energy densities for energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aionic liquids 3amacropores 3amicropores 3apolystyrenes 3aporous media 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area1 aHuang, Chun-hsien1 aDoong, Ruey-an1 aHu, Chi-chang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Jan. 29, v. 1, no. 8 p.2886-2895dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta01190e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012900165300001800294520109400312592002801406650001601434650001701450650001201467650001701479650001601496650001301512650001101525650002301536650002101559650001401580650002501594700001901619700002001638700002201658700002101680773010701701856007801808852000901886655001201895IND60132541820221117225013.0150505e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013254182DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2013004902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wen‐Jing10aEffect of copper‐induced oxidative stress on sclerotial differentiation and antioxidants contents of Penicillium thomii Q1  ap. 1395-1402.  aPenicillium thomii Q1 strain was able to form abundant orange, sand‐shaped sclerotia in which carotenoids were accumulated. The aim of this work was to determine the effects of copper‐induced oxidative stress on the sclerotial differentiation, biosynthesis of some endogenous antioxidants, and the activities of some antioxidative enzymes of Q1 strain. The results showed that the oxidative stress induced by copper was clearly dependent on the CuSO₄concentrations in media, and characterized by the initiation of lipid peroxidation. Under the copper‐induced oxidative stress conditions, the time of exudates initiation, sclerotial initiation and sclerotial maturation of Q1 strain were advanced in 1–2 days. The analytical results of sclerotial biomass, carotenoids, and ascorbate contents showed that copper‐induced oxidative stress favored the sclerotial differentiation and biosynthesis of carotenoids and ascorbate. The oxidative stress induced by a lower amount of CuSO₄in media could enhance significantly the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities of Q1 strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3acopper 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3asclerotia 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aAn, Cui‐Hong1 aLong, Dan‐Dan1 aZhang, Zhe‐Qing1 aHan, Jian‐Rong0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2014 Dec., v. 54, no. 12 p.1395-1402dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013004903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008800165300002000253520116700273592002801440650002801468650001101496650001301507653001901520653001901539653001301558653003701571700001401608700005201622700005701674773014101731856007801872852000901950655001201959IND60685551020221119163828.0200304e20200214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068555102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b215272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Changshuai10aB ← N Unit Enables n-Doping of Conjugated Polymers for Thermoelectric Application  ap. 10428-10433.  aOnly very few conjugated polymers can be n-doped for thermoelectric applications. In this work, for the first time, we report that incorporation of Boron–Nitrogen coordination bond (B ← N unit) to a donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymer enable n-doping for thermoelectric application. The incorporation of B ← N unit into the polymer backbone leads to not only a downshift of LUMO/HOMO energy levels by 0.27 eV/0.33 eV, but also diminished intramolecular D–A character of the polymer backbone. As a result, while the control polymer cannot be n-doped, the polymer containing B ← N unit (PI-BN) can be n-doped by 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (N-DMBI). Finally, PI-BN exhibits an electrical conductivity (σ) of 0.97 × 10–³ S cm–¹, Seebeck coefficient (S) of −453.8 μV K–¹, and power factor (PF) of 0.02 μW m–¹ K–² when doped with 5 wt % N-DMBI. A great advantage of PI-BN is its excellent miscibility with the n-dopant because of its amorphous nature and large pendent substituents. This work indicates that organoboron polymers can be n-doped and can be used for thermoelectrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3apolymers 0athermoelectric 0an-type polymer 0an-doping 0aboron nitrogen coordination bond1 aMeng, Bin1 aLiu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1487-00691 aWang, Lixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4676-19270 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 12, no. 9 p.10428-10433dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b215273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006100164300001600225520060700241592002800848650001300876650001900889650001800908650002100926650001900947700001900966700001700985773012001002856008201122852000901204655001201213IND60618451220221118055607.0181029e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061845122DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517582052009062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesso, M.M.10aContributions of Binder and Fiber to Nonwoven Properties  ap. 587-597.  aThe contributions of web construction, fiber, binder and interfacial properties. and binder distribution to nonwoven performance were studied.

Several PTMs display pharmaceutically interesting bioactivities, and the early stages of PTM biosynthesis involving polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymology are well studied. However, the timing and mechanisms of post PKS-NRPS oxidations by P450 monooxygenases encoded in PTM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that CftA, encoded in clifednamide-type PTM BGCs, is a multifunctional P450 monooxygenase capable of converting the C29–C30 ethyl side chain of ikarugamycin to either a C29–C30 methyl ketone or a C29–C30 hydroxymethyl ketone through C–H bond activation, resulting in the formation of clifednamide A or clifednamide C, respectively. We also report the complete structure of clifednamide C solved via multidimensional NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY, and TOCSY) using material purified from an engineered Streptomyces strain optimized for production. Finally, the in vitro reconstitution of recombinant CftA catalytic activity revealed the oxidation cascade for sequential conversion of ikarugamycin to clifednamide A and clifednamide C. Our findings confirm prior genetics-based predictions on the origins of clifednamide complexity via P450s encoded in PTM BGCs and place CftA into a growing group of multifunctional P450s that tailor PTM natural products through late-stage regioselective C–H bond activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymology 3anonribosomal peptides 3aoxidation 3apolyketide synthases 3aregioselectivity1 aQi, Yunci1 aBlodgett, Joshua A.

B3GALT5 transcripts were down-regulated in colon cancer, while they remained expressed in pancreatic cancer. Even ST3GAL3 transcript appeared well expressed in the pancreas but poorly in the colon, irrespective of normal or cancer conditions. CpG islands flanking B3GALT5 native promoter presented an extremely low degree of methylation in pancreatic cancer with respect to colon cancer. In a DNA region about 1kb away from the B3GALT5 retroviral promoter, a stretch of CG dinucleotides presented a methylation pattern potentially associated with transcription. Such a DNA region and the transcription factor binding site provided overlapping results by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, corroborating the hypothesis.CA19.9 appears as a physiological product whose synthesis strongly depends on the tissue specific and epigenetically-regulated expression of B3GALT5 and ST3GAL3.CA19.9 and other Lewis antigens acquire tumor marker properties in the pancreas due to mechanisms giving rise to reabsorption into vessels and elevation in circulating levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorption 3aantigens 3abinding sites 3abiosynthesis 3achromatin 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agenomic islands 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amethylation 3amucosa 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic ducts 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aprecipitin tests 3astaining 3atranscription factors 0a5AZA 0aB3GALT5 0aChIP 0aDAPI 0aFUT2 0aFUT3 0aH&E 0aIF 0aIH 0aLea 0aLeb 0aLTR 0aqPCR 0aRT 0asLea 0aST3GAL3 0aST6GALNAC6 0aUTR 0aCarbohydrate antigen 0aColon cancer 0aGlycosyltransferase 0aPancreatic cancer 0aTumor marker, DNA methylation1 aAvagliano, Laura1 aCaretti, Anna1 aTosi, Delfina1 aBulfamante, Gaetano Pietro1 aTrinchera, Marco0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Jan., v. 1861, no. 1 p.3210-3220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008500167300001200252520094200264592002801206650002601234650001201260650001301272650001901285650001101304650000901315650001001324700001901334773011501353856008201468852000901550655001201559IND60618451420221118055619.0181029e198301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061845142DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517583053001012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTae Jin Kang, 10aMechanics of High Speed TexturingbPart I: Theoretical Analysis of Belt Twisting  ap. 1-8.  aThe mechanics of the belt twisting principle are analyzed for slipping mode and positive driving mode. In slipping mode the yarn and the friction surfaces are ev erywhere slipping and the relative speed gives frictional forces to the yam in its direction. In positive driving mode, however, the yam is fully gripped by two belts, the system has no slippage in yarn rotational or forward directions, and the belt motion determines the twist level and tension ratios of the yam. General equations are derived relating the variables of tension, belt angle, twist level, ratio of belt speed to yarn speed, and yarn torque. The solutions to these differential equations give the expressions for the yarn tension ratio and yam torque as a function of twist, yarn parameter, and machine variables. In this paper, the theoretical performance of the system with changes in the configuration of the twister is discussed and limitations considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential equation 3afabrics 3afriction 3atextile fibers 3atorque 3ayams 3ayarns1 aEl-Shiekh, Aly0 tTextile research journal.g1983 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.1-8dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517583053001013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245011700181300001600298500000900314520130400323592002801627650002101655650002401676650001301700650001601713650001401729650001501743650000701758650001501765650001301780650001301793651001501806700002101821700002401842773020701866856009402073852000902167655001202176IND60665965020221117233412.0191028e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066596502DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000030008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeeley, George M.10aTransformation and Sorption of 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane in Subsurface Samples Collected at Fresno, California  ap. 547-556.  aepub  aThe transformation rate of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) was determined in phosphate buffer solution, in groundwater, and in groundwater/aquifer solid slurries from ambient temperatures to 72 °C. From the disappearance data, the apparent Arrhenius constants for DBCP transformation were calculated and found to decrease in Eₐ with temperature from 19.2 (±2.4) kcal mol⁻¹ in the 55 to 72 °C range to 12.5 (±1.8) kcal mol⁻¹ in the 21 to 55 °C range. Low sorption values were an indication that sorption does not play a major role in the aquifer being studied. No significant difference in the disappearance rates was observed in the buffer solution (corrected for buffer effects) and in groundwater with and without solids added. However, in the phosphate buffer solution, dehydrohalogenation appeared to be the favored transformation process in contrast to the groundwater systems where hydrolysis seemed to predominate. This apparent influence of dissolved constituents or temperature on transformation mechanism or rate may restrain the use of direct extrapolation of data between systems. Applying the transformation data from this study to median field parameters, a DBCP half-life of 6.1 yr was calculated for typical groundwater conditions in California (pH 7.8 and 21.1 °C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDBCP (pesticide) 3aambient temperature 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3aphosphates 3aslurries 3asorption 3aCalifornia1 aReinhard, Martin1 aStearns, Stephen M.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1991 July, v. 20, no. 3 p.547-556dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000030008x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010300173520179000276592002802066650002002094650001902114650001402133650001002147650001202157650001502169650001702184650001602201650001502217650001302232650001002245650000902255651001102264653001502275653001802290653001402308653001702322653002302339653002202362700001802384700002402402700002202426700003102448773011902479856008702598852000902685655001202694IND60774030620221122053110.0220531e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilipiak, Paweł10aPlants and palynomorphs from the Lower Devonian (upper Emsian) of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland  aWe present a preliminary assessment of a new Lower Devonian biota from an exposure of the Zagórze Formation at Bukowa Góra quarry in the Łysogóry Region of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. Abundant plant macrofossils preserved as carbonaceous compressions, adpressions, and permineralizations occur alongside a diverse assemblage of microfossils. Palynostratigraphic analysis places the fossiliferous sequences in the narrow Pro. Zone within the AP Zone of the douglastownense-eurypterota Miospore Zone, which corresponds to the upper part of the Emsian. Palynofacies analysis confirms that these sediments formed in a shallow-water, alluvial environment. The biota contains a rich assemblage of freshwater and brackish water organisms and fully terrestrial ones. Common elements include filamentous green algae, arthropods, terrestrial fungi-like filaments, nematophytes and abundant land plants. Scolecodonts and acritarchs are much rarer, suggesting limited marine influence. The new flora contains stem-group vascular plants, lycophytes and euphyllophytes. Among the permineralized remains is some of the earliest evidence of complex vascular systems, including cruciform and plate-like stelar organizations and secondary wood. We record the earliest fossil evidence of a dissected stele of the cladoxylopsid type. Innovations such as these were fundamental to the later evolution of arborescent growth in plants and the development of forest ecosystems. The biota complements and extends our knowledge of Emsian biotas in Euramerica just prior to the rapid changes that marked the Middle Devonian. It provides insights into a diverse early terrestrial community and raises further questions about the affinities and roles of arthropods and nematophytales in these ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDevonian period 3abrackish water 3aevolution 3aflora 3aforests 3afreshwater 3amicrofossils 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3aquarries 3astele 3awood 3aPoland 0aLycophytes 0aCladoxylopsid 0aArthropod 0aPalynofacies 0aPalynostratigraphy 0aCuticle dispersae1 aKenrick, Paul1 aWawrzyniak, Zuzanna1 aKondas, Marcelina1 aStrullu-Derrien, Christine0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 July, v. 302 p.104666-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245019000208300001600398520095700414592002801371650002801399650001701427650002101444650001701465650001301482650001401495650003001509650002701539650001701566650003301583650002601616650003001642651001401672700002101686700003401707700002501741700005701766700002001823773017101843856008502014852000902099655001202108IND60765557920221117005915.0220130e20211229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076555792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c006222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayasari, Dian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4378-619210aTLC-Based Fingerprinting Analysis of the Geographical Variation of Melastoma malabathricum in Inland and Archipelago Regions: A Rapid and Easy-to-Use Tool for Field Metabolomics Studies  ap. 292-300.  aMelastoma malabathricum is an Indo-Pacific herb that has been used traditionally to treat numerous ailments such as wounds, dysentery, diarrhea, toothache, and diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of the metabolic profiles of M. malabathricum across its geographic distribution. By employing thin layer chromatography (TLC), specimens collected from six terrestrial and archipelago regions of Indonesia were analyzed by densitometry for metabolomic fingerprinting analysis combined with chemometric tools: principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Two PCAs were identified as PC1 and PC2 with 41.90% and 20.36%, respectively.

But until now, buffalo business in Banten Province is still small, and has not led to commercial business. The research was conducted in Cibarani Village, Cisata District, Pandeglang Regency, Banten in 2016. This study used interview and questionnaire filling methods to the 24 buffalo breeders. By accidental sampling, sampling of respondents was found in the cage, house, paddy field and fields. Primary data were obtained from stockbreeders and secondary data were obtained from the local institution. Primary and secondary data were analyzed descriptively, quantitatively, t-test analysis and economic analysis. The aim of this research was to determine the economic efficiency of buffalo business (bubalus bubalis) with the shepherds in stockbreeders. The results showed that, the factors that influenced the increased economic efficiency of buffalo business in breeders had a significant effect on (P <0.05) to the breeders profits variable. The female buffalo business by breeding, breeders' profits was Rp.7.889.000 / year, with R / C 1.02 higher. The male buffalo business by fattened up, breeders’ profits amounting to Rp.7.575.000 with R / C of 1.05 lower. The buffalo business in breeders by shepherded, through male fattened up or breeding, was economically worth to try.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBubalus bubalis 3abuffaloes 3acages 3aeconomic analysis 3afemales 3amales 3apaddies 3aquestionnaires 3at-test 3avillages1 aPraharani, Lisa1 aSianturi, Riasari Gail0 tSoca : Jurnal Sosial Ekonomi Pertanian.g2020 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.275-287dProdi Agribisnis Fakultas Pertanian Universitas UdayanawJournal:27754x2615-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24843/SOCA.2020.v14.i02.p083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167300001600276500001500292520151300307592002801820650001501848650001501863650000901878650001901887650001901906650002601925650002701951650002401978650001502002650001702017650001302034653001502047653002302062653001802085653003002103653002502133653001602158653002702174700002002201700002502221700002402246700002402270700002102294700003002315700002602345700002502371700002302396773010702419856008502526852000902611655001202620IND50060605820221118155824.0190215e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006060582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLunt, Ian D.10aUsing assisted colonisation to conserve biodiversity and restore ecosystem function under climate change  ap. 172-177.  a2019-12-06  aAssisted colonisation has received considerable attention recently, and the risks and benefits of introducing taxa to sites beyond their historical range have been vigorously debated. The debate has primarily focused on using assisted colonization to enhance the persistence of taxa that would otherwise be stranded in unsuitable habitat as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change and habitat fragmentation. However, a complementary motivation for assisted colonisation could be to relocate taxa to restore declining ecosystem processes that support biodiversity in recipient sites. We compare the benefits and risks of species introductions motivated by either goal, which we respectively term ‘push’ versus ‘pull’ strategies for introductions to preserve single species or for restoration of ecological processes. We highlight that, by focusing on push and neglecting pull options, ecologists have greatly under-estimated potential benefits and risks that may result from assisted colonisation. Assisted colonisation may receive higher priority in climate change adaptation strategies if relocated taxa perform valuable ecological functions (pull) rather than have little collateral benefit (push). Potential roles include enhancing resistance to invasion by undesired species, supporting co-dependent species, performing keystone functions, providing temporally critical resources, replacing taxa of low ecological redundancy, and avoiding time lags in the provisioning of desired functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecologists 3amotivation 3arisk 3aclimate change 3ahistoric sites 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aecological restoration 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 0aadaptation 0aManaged relocation 0aTranslocation 0aClimate change adaptation 0aEcosystem management 0aRestoration 0aEcological replacement1 aByrne, Margaret1 aHellmann, Jessica J.1 aMitchell, Nicola J.1 aGarnett, Stephen T.1 aHayward, Matt W.1 aMartin, T.

The interfacial behaviors of OP on natural minerals affect the transport, transformation, and bioavailability of P in the environment. This paper reviews the processes involving adsorption-desorption, dissolution-precipitation, and enzymatic/mineral-mediated hydrolysis of OP at the mineral-water interface, and their subsequent effects on OP speciation and mineral colloidal stability/reactivity. The sorption mechanisms of OP on natural minerals mainly include surface complexation and precipitation, which are controlled by factors such as mineral identity and crystallinity, relative molecular weight of OP, reaction pH, ionic strength, temperature, and co-existing ligands or ions. The desorption amount and rate of OP from minerals are determined by mineral identity, desorbent type, pre-sorption time, OP species, reaction pH, the number of desorption cycles, and redox status. The interactions between OP and minerals affect the sorption of co-existing metal ions and the stability of minerals. The effect of minerals on enzymatic hydrolysis of OP sorbed on mineral surfaces depends on mineral identity and OP species. Some minerals themselves also exhibit catalytic activity to promote the cleavage of C-O-P bonds and OP hydrolysis. We give an overview of state-of-the-art techniques currently applied in environmental OP research. The main challenges and future directions of research are also summarized to further explore OP interactions with natural minerals in complex environmental settings.  aRetracted: 2022 ; 10.1016/j.jia.2022.08.046zThe Publisher regrets that this article is an accidental duplication of an article that has already been published, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedsph.2022.08.001.

Three lucilactaene analogues were detected via UPLC-ESI-MS analysis in NPD938-treated culture. The three metabolites were successfully purified and identified as dihydroNG391 (1), dihydrolucilactaene (2), and 13α-hydroxylucilactaene (3) via extensive spectroscopic analyses. DihydroNG391 (1) exhibited weak in vitro antimalarial activity (IC₅₀ = 62 μM). In contrast, dihydrolucilactaene (2) and 13α-hydroxylucilactaene (3) showed very potent antimalarial activity (IC₅₀ = 0.0015 and 0.68 μM, respectively). These findings provide insight into the structure–activity relationship of lucilactaene and its analogues as antimalarial lead compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aantimalarials 3ametabolism 3asecondary metabolites 3aspectroscopy 3astructure-activity relationships1 aBin Mahmud, Fauze1 aMotoyama, Takayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7602-23941 aFutamura, Yushi1 aTakahashi, Shunji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1684-92981 aOsada, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3606-49250 tJournal of natural products.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 85, no. 1 p.63-69dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c006773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011600161300001400277506002800291520126800319592002801587506003701615650001401652650001801666650002201684650002401706650001101730651001201741653002101753653001501774653002001789653001801809773013301827856007601960852000902036655001202045IND60785681920221207074647.0090701e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568192DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha3412782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMANIUTIU, Danut10aResearches concerning plant directing method and fertilization method on eggplant cultivated in plastic tunnels  ap. 69-74.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim and the objectives of the experiments effectuated at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, Romania, was to establish the best plant directing method and the fertilization method for eggplant cultivated in plastic tunnel covered with durable polyethylene film in a less favourable area. During the experience the following observations have been done: crop dynamic; early and total yield; fruit quality. The directing method of plants influences both early and total yield. So, for the variants with plants directed with 3 branches the yield increase was 58.6% for early yield and 7.5% for the total yield comparative with the variants with undirected plants. Fertilization method influenced mostly the early yield. For the weekly fertilization the yield difference was significant positive given the control (monthly fertilization). If we take in consideration the total yield variants with weekly fertilization had a yield increase about 9.2% given the control but the yield differences were not assured statistically. Under the combined influence of factors the best results, for both early and total yield, were obtained by the variants with plant directed with 2 respectively 3 branches and weekly fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeggplants 3afruit quality 3apolyethylene film 3aveterinary medicine 3ayields 3aRomania 0adirecting method 0aegg plants 0aplastic tunnels 0afertilization0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2006 Aug., v. 34, no. 1 p.69-74dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha3412783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01579naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007000167300001600237520053400253592002800787650001800815650001000833650001000843653000800853653000800861653000800869653001300877653003500890653003300925653002600958700001600984700002101000773010301021856008401124852000901208655001201217IND60479498920221119064846.0160122e20021101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047949892DNAL7 a10.1556/ABiol.53.2002.4.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMészáros, I.10aHypnotic susceptibility and alterations in subjective experiences  ap. 499-514.  aPavlov has described hypnosis as a partial sleep.

Observing human activity from outer space using satellite technology and remote sensing focusing on man-made light emissions presents real opportunity, especially where reliable national statistics are lacking. The methodology involves the estimation of panel data, autoregressive distributed lag and co-integration models that estimate provincial night-time light intensity as a proxy for provincial gross regional product (GDP). Both the ARDL and co-integrating models point to a long-run co-integrating relationship between GDP and night-time total light intensity, while the panel models suggest that the inverse Henderson elasticity for all provinces is 0.277 (cross-section fixed model). The ARDL models also establish a statistically significant short-term error correction term. The combined results suggest that a statistically significant long- and short-term relationship does indeed exist between provincial GDP and night-time lights within the South African and provincial context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3ahumans 3alight intensity 3amodels 3asatellites 3astatistics 0aNight lights 0aDMSP/OLS 0aVIIRS/DNB 0aUrban human activity 0aRegional economics 0aC46 0aD30 0aR121 aKleynhans, E.P.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2321-85930 tRemote sensing applications.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.100564-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011500163300001600278506002800294520174700322592002802069506003702097653003402134653001202168653001002180653001602190700002102206700002202227773010602249856008002355852000902435655001202444IND60785682220221207060202.0210221e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568222DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.266252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartika, Dewi10aAktivitas Antimikroba Ekstrak Kulit dan Jantung Pisang Muli (Musa Acuminata) terhadap Bakteri Escherichia coli  ap. 355-363.  aResource is Open Access  aDaging ayam merupakan salah satu bahan pangan yang memegang peranan penting sebagai sumber protein hewani dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan gizi masyarakat.

Resveratrol exhibits multiple bioactivities and is used in the agriculture, medical, food, and cosmetic industries due to its antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and antioxidant properties. Due to the increasing demand, an active area of investigation is the use of plant cell culture and metabolic engineering techniques to produce large quantities of active resveratrol. However, most recent studies have focused on the efficiency of synthesizing resveratrol in vitro, but have not investigated the contributions of the transcriptional activities of the genes encoding the related enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway. This article reviews recently developed methods for the biosynthesis of resveratrol and comprehensively reviews the current state of knowledge of the function of the key pathway enzymes in resveratrol synthesis. Approaches for enhancing resveratrol production, such as introducing non-pathway genes and co-localizing enzymes are described in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acell culture 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aindustry 3ametabolic engineering 3aphenol 3aresveratrol 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics)1 aShao, Dongyan1 aShi, Junling1 aHuang, Qingsheng1 aYang, Hui1 aJin, Mingliang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 100, no. 17 p.7407-7421dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7723-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014900164520121700313592002801530650001101558650001501569650001601584650001001600650001601610650002001626650001301646650001301659650001401672650001301686653003301699653002701732653003001759653001201789653001301801700001901814700001601833700001401849700005401863773009201917856008602009852000902095655001202104IND60774031320221118233616.0220929e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao10aRolling circle amplification assisted dual signal amplification colorimetric biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of leukemia-derived exosomes  aTumor-derived exosomes as a liquid biopsy marker hold great promising for the accurate tumor diagnosis. However, the visual exosomes detection method with high sensitivity and convenience is still a challenge and highly valuable in the clinical application. Herein, we fabricated a colorimetric biosensor that could visually detect leukemia-derived exosomes, and dual amplified the signal based on the rolling circle amplification (RCA) assisted platform. To avoid the interference of components in serum, trigger-aptamer complex was firstly modified on the magnetic beads (MBs) to recognize exosomes, and then release trigger probe to initiate RCA reaction. Therefore, the trigger probe could produce long repeated sequences and hybridized with numerous signal probe. After that, GNPs-HRP (HRP modified gold nanoparticles) bound with signal probe and induced dramatic color change of TMB to achieve the sensing of exosomes. Benefiting from the RCA assisted dual signal amplification, the presented method showed a limit of detection as low as 100 particles/μL. Moreover, this method exhibited good specificity to distinguish healthy and leukemia patients, suggesting its great potential for clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aexosomes 3aleukemia 3amagnetism 3ananogold 0aRolling circle amplification 0aColorimetric biosensor 0aDual signal amplification 0aExosmes 0aLeukemia1 aZhou, Mengyang1 aWang, Haoyu1 aWang, Jie1 aHuang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8794-79200 tTalanta.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 245 p.123444-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001100158245011300169300001600282520130600298592002801604650001801632650001501650650001601665650001201681650001201693650002701705650003101732650004401763650002801807650002101835650004101856650004201897650002601939650001101965650004401976650002802020650002302048700001102071700001302082700001302095700001302108700001202121700001002133773012202143856007302265852000902338655001202347IND50071962620221117105329.0150206e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007196262DNAL7 a241384242pmid7 a10.1111/rda.122462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Y14aThe Construction of Cloned Sika Deer Embryos (Cervus nippon hortulorum) by Demecolcine Auxiliary Enucleation  ap. 164-169.  aThe objective of our study was to establish the feasibility of experimental protocols for cloning sika deer. We performed auxiliary enucleation to improve the efficiency of nuclear transfer operation by optimizing the demecolcine concentration to induce cytoplasmic protrusions in the sika deer oocytes. In the present study,we had studied the impact of different demecolcine concentrations on cytoplasmic protrusions and enucleation rates. We determined that 95.9% of the sika deer oocytes formed cytoplasmic protrusions when treated for 1 h with 0.8 μg/ml demecolcine. The lowest observed rate of protrusion was 19.3% after overnight treatment with demecolcine. When the oocytes aged or had a poor cumulus expansion, they exhibited a significant decrease in the ability to form cytoplasmic protrusions. The rates of enucleation (94.9% vs 85.8%, p < 0.05), cell fusion (84.6% vs 70.1%, p < 0.05) and blastocyst formation (15.4% vs 10.9%, p < 0.05) using demecolcine auxiliary enucleation were significantly higher than those after blind enucleation. These results demonstrated that sika deer oocytes could be enucleated quickly and effectively using demecolcine auxiliary enucleation, which could enhance the enucleation rate, cell fusion rate and blastocyst rate of cloned embryos in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3ablastocyst 3acell fusion 3aoocytes 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCell Nucleusxdrug effects 2aCloning, Organismxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCytoplasmxdrug effects 2aDeerxembryology 2aDemecolcinexadministration & dosage 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aEmbryonic Development 2aFemale 2aNuclear Transfer Techniquesxveterinary 2aOocytesxultrastructure 2aTubulin Modulators1 aMei, M1 aZhang, D1 aZhang, S1 aFan, A.,1 aZhou, H1 aLi, Z0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.164-169dP.

However, activities can be misreported and reporting accuracy may change following conservation interventions, making it hard to verify any apparent changes. Techniques for asking sensitive questions are increasingly integrated into survey designs to improve data quality, but some can be costly or hard for nonexperts to implement. We demonstrate a straightforward, low‐cost approach, the bean method in which respondents give anonymous answers by adding a colored bean to a jar to denote a yes or no response. We applied the bean method to measure wild‐meat hunting and trading over 2 years at a conservation‐project (hunting reduction) site in Gola Forest, Liberia. We extended the technique to accommodate questions about hunting and meat‐selling frequency. We compared responses given using the bean method and direct questioning for groups that did and did not participate in conservation interventions. Results from the bean method corresponded to those from direct questioning, and there was no indication of change in question sensitivity following conservation interventions. Estimates from both methods indicated that wild‐meat trading decreased in project and nonproject households (from 36% to 20%) and that hunting decreased in 1 project group (38–28%). Where inconsistent answers were given (2–6% of respondents), differences were in both directions and were most likely attributable to measurement error. The bean method was quick and straightforward to administer in a low‐literacy setting. We showed how it can be modified for answers of more than 2 categories and consider it a valuable tool that could be adapted for a wide range of conservation settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3adata quality 3aforests 3ahuman behavior 3asurveys 3awildlife management 3aLiberia1 aPapworth, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8746-19121 aKeane, Aidan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9704-55761 aVickery, Juliet1 aSt John, Freya A.

To date, the search for new HIV treatment is ongoing. Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using medicinal plants is an emerging technology that can be utilized as antiviral agents for the treatment of HIV. Hence, this study evaluated the anti-HIV activity of plant-based AgNPs using MT-4 cells. The one pot green synthesis technique was performed to produce AgNPs using leaf (L), stolon (S), and root (R) extracts from Centella asiatica. Subsequently, the AgNPs were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The anti-HIV and the cytotoxic activity of the synthesized AgNPs were evaluated using the MTT method. The UV-Vis spectra revealed the characteristic peak for AgNPs at 420 nm. The L-AgNPs, S-AgNPs and R-AgNPs were predominately spherical in shape with average particle sizes of 16 ± 5 nm, 17 ± 7 nm and 26 ± 12 nm, respectively. Other observations included the end-capping of AgNPs with phytocompounds, polydispersity, negatively charged and crystalline with a face-centered cubic structure. The protection of synthesized AgNPs on cell viability of HIV-infected MT-4 cells were ≤ 10% at concentrations ranging from 11 to 1375 µg/mL, 9–1125 µg/mL, and 2.52–315 µg/mL for L-AgNPs, S-AgNPs and R-AgNPs, respectively. Negligible cytotoxicity was induced by L-AgNPs and S-AgNPs at concentrations of 1375 µg/mL and 225–1125 µg/mL, respectively, in non-infected MT-4 cells. Our findings suggest that AgNPs synthesized using extracts of the medicinal plant, Centella asiatica may be a promising anti-HIV agent and warrants further investigation. The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentella asiatica 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantiretroviral agents 3aantiretroviral properties 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aherbal medicines 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3ananosilver 3apublic health 0aAnti-HIV activity 0aNanotechnology 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aGreen synthesis 0aCentella asiatica 0aHIV1 aMoodley, R.1 aRamdhani, S.1 aParboosing, R.0 tJournal of herbal medicine.g2022 Sept., v. 35 p.100592-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:21606x2210-80337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2022.1005923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006600161300001600227500000900243520175300252592002802005650001602033650001502049650002002064650002102084650001802105650001302123650001302136650001602149650001302165650000902178650001502187700002002202700002702222700001902249700002302268700002302291773021602314856008002530852000902610655001202619IND60665965720221117233615.0191028e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066596572DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2015.07.03992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddy, Kelly10aDenitrifying Bioreactors for Nitrate Removal: A Meta-Analysis  ap. 873-881.  aepub  aMeta-analysis approaches were used in this first quantitative synthesis of denitrifying woodchip bioreactors. Nitrate removal across environmental and design conditions was assessed from 26 published studies, representing 57 separate bioreactor units (i.e., walls, beds, and laboratory columns). Effect size calculations weighted the data based on variance and number of measurements for each bioreactor unit. Nitrate removal rates in bed and column studies were not significantly different, but both were significantly higher than wall studies. In denitrifying beds, wood source did not significantly affect nitrate removal rates. Nitrate removal (mass per volume) was significantly lower in beds with <6-h hydraulic retention times, which argues for ensuring that bed designs incorporate sufficient time for nitrate removal. Rates significantly declined after the first year of bed operation but then stabilized. Nitrogen limitation significantly affected bed nitrate removal. Categorical and linear assessments found significant nitrate removal effects with bed temperature; a Q₁₀ of 2.15 was quite similar to other studies. Lessons from this meta-analysis can be incorporated into bed designs, especially extending hydraulic retention times to increase nitrate removal under low temperature and high flow conditions. Additional column studies are warranted for comparative assessments, as are field-based studies for assessing in situ conditions, especially in aging beds, with careful collection and reporting of design and environmental data. Future assessment of these systems might take a holistic view, reviewing nitrate removal in conjunction with other processes, including greenhouse gas and other unfavorable by-product production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3abyproducts 3adenitrification 3agreenhouse gases 3ameta-analysis 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3atemperature 3avariance 3awood 3awood chips1 aGold, Arthur J.1 aChristianson, Laura E.1 aDavid, Mark B.1 aSchipper, Louis A.1 aRatigan, Nicole A.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2016 May, v. 45, no. 3 p.873-881dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2015.07.03993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008600164520146000250592002801710650001301738650001501751650001501766650001201781650002001793650001101813650001701824650002301841650001601864650001701880653001601897653002201913653001401935653001501949653002301964653002801987700001802015700005302033700001702086700001702103773009202120856008602212852000902298655001202307IND60774031420221118233505.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Fu12aA biosensor based on a thermal camera using infrared radiance as the signal probe  aFlexible-type signal probes and their detection methods are increasingly being applied in biosensors. Among these, temperature-based signal probes represent a novel research direction. These sensors convert immunoassay signals into temperature signals, which are then detected using a thermometer or thermal infrared reader. However, from a physical viewpoint, we know that the temperature measured directly using a thermal infrared camera is the infrared radiance temperature, which is proportional to both the true temperature and emissivity. Herein, we design a novel sensing method that uses infrared radiance rather than true temperature as the signal probe. We convert the immunoassay to an infrared radiation temperature measurement by controlling an aluminum plate in constant temperature whose infrared radiation temperature varied significantly with immunoassay-based the amount of the target. We then develop two readout systems: one is based on a scientific-grade infrared camera, and the other uses a smartphone-based thermal camera, which is more portable, flexible, and can be used as an in-pocket sensor. The sensors are verified via detecting exemplary biomarker human IgG, and show excellent quantitative model performances in 0–100 ng mL⁻¹ concentration range with the detection limit estimated as low as 0.54 ng mL⁻¹. The excellent quantitative results demonstrate the powerful detection performance of this sensing method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acameras 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3ainfrared radiation 3atemperature 3athermometers 0aImmunoassay 0aInfrared radiance 0abiosensor 0aEmissivity 0aGold nanoparticles 0aThermal infrared camera1 aCao, Fengjing1 aGao, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7905-35131 aShuang, Feng1 aDong, Daming0 tTalanta.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 246 p.123453-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245010000203300001600303500001100319520179700330592002802127596004402155596003502199650001302234650002102247650002502268650001002293650002202303650003002325650002402355650002802379650001402407650001802421650001502439650001102454650001802465650001202483650002102495650002002516700005602536700001502592700001402607700005402621773013202675856007302807852000902880655001202889IND60631153620221119101816.0190219e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063115362DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.141122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía‐Aljaro, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4863-354710aPathogens, faecal indicators and human‐specific microbial source‐tracking markers in sewage  ap. 701-717.  aREVIEW  aThe objective of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge of pathogens, general faecal indicators and human‐specific microbial source tracking markers in sewage. Most of the microbes present in sewage are from the microbiota of the human gut, including pathogens. Bacteria and viruses are the most abundant groups of microbes in the human gut microbiota. Most reports on this topic show that raw sewage microbiological profiles reflect the human gut microbiota. Human and animal faeces share many commensal microbes as well as pathogens. Faecal‐orally transmitted pathogens constitute a serious public health problem that can be minimized through sanitation. Assessing both the sanitation processes and the contribution of sewage to the faecal contamination of water bodies requires knowledge of the content of pathogens in sewage, microbes indicating general faecal contamination and microbes that are only present in human faecal remains, which are known as the human‐specific microbial source‐tracking (MST) markers. Detection of pathogens would be the ideal option for managing sanitation and determining the microbiological quality of waters contaminated by sewage; but at present, this is neither practical nor feasible in routine testing. Traditionally, faecal indicator bacteria have been used as surrogate indicators of general faecal residues. However, in many water management circumstances, it becomes necessary to detect both the origin of faecal contamination, for which MST is paramount, and live micro‐organisms, for which molecular methods are not suitable. The presence and concentrations of pathogens, general faecal indicators and human‐specific MST markers most frequently reported in different areas of the world are summarized in this review.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2016‐75536‐PcSpanish Government  a2017SGR170cCatalan Government 3abacteria 3adigestive system 3adisease transmission 3afeces 3aindicator species 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobiological quality 3apathogens 3apublic health 3asanitation 3asewage 3asurface water 3aviruses 3awater management 3awater pollution1 aBlanch, A.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7632-67581 aCampos, C.1 aJofre, J.1 aLucena, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8892-04310 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 126, no. 3 p.701-717dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.141123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012800171300001800299520124900317592002801566650002101594650001701615650002501632650002001657650002301677650002001700650004301720650002501763650000901788650001201797650002501809700002701834700001701861700002101878700002101899700002201920700002901942773012701971856008102098852000902179655001202188IND60501319920221118020205.0160222e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050131992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7240-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaffarian, Parvaneh10aTAT-BoNT/A(1–448), a novel fusion protein as a therapeutic agent: analysis of transcutaneous delivery and enzyme activity  ap. 2785-2795.  aBotulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) has been used as an injectable therapeutic agent for the treatment of some abnormal muscle contractions. In this study, TAT₍₄₇–₅₇₎ peptide, a cell-penetrating peptide, was fused with the catalytic domain of BoNT/A for therapeutic purposes. HeLa and BE(2)-C cell lines were treated separately with purified TAT-BoNT/A₍₁–₄₄₈₎ recombinant protein, and transduction of protein was analyzed by western blotting. Also, transcutaneous delivery through mouse skin surface was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The in vitro catalytic activity of TAT-BoNT/A₍₁–₄₄₈₎ was evaluated by HPLC. The presence of recombinant protein was detected in both of the cell lines as well as mouse skin cryosections after 60 and 120 min of incubation. The concentration of intracellular proteins was increased over time. HPLC analysis showed that this fusion protein has a biological activity 1.5 times as much as the full-length BoNT/A₍₁–₄₄₈₎ protein.

Winter Q<inf>10</inf> (known as the increase in respiration rate per 10 °C increase in temperature) values (2.8–19) were much higher than those from the growing season (1.5). R<inf>s</inf> and Q<inf>10</inf> were greatly enhanced in freeze-thaw cycles compared to frozen days. Diurnal patterns of R<inf>s</inf> between freeze-thaw and frozen days differed. Although the freeze-thaw period was relatively short, its cumulative R<inf>s</inf> contributed significantly to winter R<inf>s</inf>. The presence of biocrust might induce lower temperature, thus having fewer freeze-thaw cycles relative to bare soil, leading to the lower R<inf>s</inf> for microsites with biocrusts. In conclusion, winter R<inf>s</inf> in drylands was sensitive to soil temperature (T<inf>s</inf>) and T<inf>s</inf>-induced freeze-thaw cycles. The temperature impact on R<inf>s</inf> varied among soil cover types. Winter R<inf>s</inf> in drylands may become more important as the climate is continuously getting warmer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acarbon 3acell respiration 3aclimate 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystems 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agrowing season 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3ashrublands 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina1 aZha, Tianshan1 aJia, Xin1 aWang, Ben1 aGuo, Xiaonan1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aWu, Bin1 aYang, Qiang1 aPeltola, Heli0 tForests.g2016 July 29, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006600159300001600225520072600241592002800967650001800995650000801013650001301021650001001034650002301044650002301067650002001090650000901110650000901119650001801128650002001146651001801166700002501184700002201209773010101231856007301332852000901405655001201414IND60693067220221120161654.0200504e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069306722DNAL7 a10.4155/bfs.09.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowers, Susan E10aOpinion: The water footprint of biofuel production in the USA  ap. 255-260.  aThe US mandates for increased use of domestically produced biofuels will help to reduce the dependence on imported oil, yet it will necessitate the increased use of our earth and ecosystem services, our ‘natural capital’. Biofuels can be sustainably produced if we recognize the limits of our soil, water and air resources to provide these services. Many of the dedicated crops used for biofuels have a significant water footprint. That is, they consume water for growth and evapotranspiration, and a fraction of the agrochemicals used to obtain higher yields are leached into surface water bodies. This opinion summarizes the extent of this water footprint and explores mechanisms for reducing the resulting impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3aair 3abiofuels 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3aevapotranspiration 3afuel production 3aoils 3asoil 3asurface water 3awater footprint 3aUnited States1 aDominguez-Faus, Rosa1 aAlvarez, Pedro JJ0 tBiofuels.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 1, no. 2 p.255-260dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.09.203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008500163300001600248500001500264520166000279592002801939650002801967650001201995650000902007650000702016650001302023650002202036650001202058651001802070651001502088651001302103651001102116651001402127653002402141700002602165700001902191773009502210856004802305852000902353655001202362IND4477101320221119163737.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447710132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-010-0713-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, Carlos10aMacroecology of high-elevation myxomycete assemblages in the northern Neotropics  ap. 423-437.  a2019-12-06  aA number of recent studies have been directed towards developing a more complete understanding of myxomycete ecology throughout the world. However, the lack of comparative data obtained using standard methodologies makes the results of these studies somewhat speculative. The objective of this investigation was to examine the evidence of macroecological patterns in myxomycete assemblages in high-elevation areas of the northern Neotropics. For this, a series of study areas in Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica, as well as two external study areas (one in the United States and the other in Thailand), were selected to compare the diversity-environment relationships exhibited by myxomycetes. Altogether, the 2592 moist chamber cultures prepared yielded a total of 1377 myxomycete records, representing 89 different species. A trend of decreasing species richness with decreasing latitude was observed for the species assemblages associated with the study areas in the Neotropics. As latitude increased, species assemblages in the Neotropical study areas became increasingly similar to the temperate study area. The difference in species richness between study areas in Mexico and Thailand, along with the results obtained for a series of macroclimatic patterns evaluated in the study areas of the Neotropical region, suggests that forest structure plays an important role in the structure of myxomycete assemblages. In contrast, soil chemical characteristics and the pH of the substrates present seem to be indirectly related to the diversity estimators used for analysis, suggesting that they are probably more important at a smaller ecological scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3atropics 3asoil 3apH 3alatitude 3aspecies diversity 3aforests 3aUnited States 3aCosta Rica 3aThailand 3aMexico 3aGuatemala 0aspecies differences1 aStephenson, Steven L.1 aHuxel, Gary R.0 tMycological progress.g2011 Nov., v. 10, no. 4 p.423-437dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-010-0713-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009500158520090700253592002801160650002001188650002101208650002201229650001801251650002601269650001201295650002901307650001201336700002101348700001901369773011901388856007201507852000901579655001201588IND60648673520221122083401.0190701e20160730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867352DNAL7 a10.3390/f70801652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikita, Tomáš10aForest Stand Inventory Based on Combined Aerial and Terrestrial Close-Range Photogrammetry  aIn this article we introduce a new method for forest management inventories especially suitable for highly-valued timber where the precise estimation of stem parameters (diameter, form, and tapper) plays the key role for market purposes. The unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based photogrammetry is combined with terrestrial photogrammetry executed by walking inside the stand and the individual tree parameters are estimated. We compare two automatic methods for processing of the point clouds and the delineation of stem circumference at breast height. The error of the diameter estimation was observed to be under 1 cm root mean square error (RMSE) and the height estimation error was 1 m. Apart from the mentioned accuracy, the main advantage of the proposed work is shorter time demand for field measurement; we could complete both inventories of 1 hectare forest stand in less than 2 h of field work.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3aground photogrammetry 3amarkets 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awalking1 aJanata, Přemysl1 aSurový, Peter0 tForests.g2016 July 30, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001500269520098400284592002801268650002301296650001101319650000901330650001301339650002401352650001001376650001001386650001001396650001701406650001001423653001301433653001501446653002301461773008101484856008101565852000901646655001201655IND60637626520221117231556.0190420s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063762652DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900005602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Fukuju10aEffects of Depth of Flooding on Growth and Anatomy of Stems and Knee Roots of Taxodium Distichum  ap. 93-104.  aDepth of flooding of Taxodium distichum trees influeneedin height and diametergrowth, formation of knee roots , and anatomy of sterns and knee roots.

Traeheids in the submerged portions of sterns of deeply flooded trees were shorter, slightly wider, and had thinner walls than traeheids of shallowly flooded trees. The inner bark of the submerged sterns of deeply flooded trees had wider phloemrays and more intercellular space than the bark of shallowly flooded trees. The xylem anatomy of knee roots resembled that of the xylem in the submerged portions of sterns of deeply flooded trees.

To understand tree assembly processes in a semideciduous tropical forest, we analyzed the variation of Functional Richness (FRic), Functional Divergence (FDiv), and Functional Evenness (FEve) of small vs. large trees in relation to fallow age after slash-and-burn agriculture and topographical position (flat sites vs. hills). FRic of small trees was lower than null model predicted values across the successional gradient, and decreased unexpectedly in older successional ages. FRic of large trees was higher than null model predictions early in succession and lower in late-successional stands on hills. Dominant species were more similar (low FDiv) in early and intermediate successional stands for small trees, and on hills for large trees, suggesting that species that are best adapted to harsh conditions share similar traits. We also found evidence of competitive exclusion among similar species (high FEve) for small trees in early successional stands. Overall, our results indicate that community assembly of small trees is strongly affected by the changing biotic and abiotic conditions along the successional and topographical gradient. For large trees, hills may represent the most stressful conditions in this landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompetitive exclusion 3adominant species 3aenvironmental factors 3afallow 3afunctional diversity 3ahills 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3asecondary succession 3ashifting cultivation 3atrees 3atropical dry forests1 aDupuy, Juan Manuel1 aAndrade, José Luis,1 aReyes-García, Casandra1 aPaz, Horacio1 aJackson, Paula C.0 tForests.g2016 July 30, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001800276520121400294592002801508650001801536650001101554650001201565650002001577650003801597650003301635650002001668650002601688650001901714650002201733650001301755650001101768700001801779700001601797700001501813700001601828700001601844700001501860700001501875700001601890700001401906700001601920700001801936773012701954856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60501320320221117223836.0160222e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7296-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Xiangzhong10aDevelopment of sandwich ELISAs that can distinguish different types of coxsackievirus A16 viral particles  ap. 2809-2815.  aCoxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). No CA16 vaccine candidates have progressed to clinical trials so far. Immunogenicity studies indicated that different CA16 particles have much influence on the efficacy of a candidate vaccine. However, there are still no relevant reports on the methods of detecting different CA16 particles. In this study, we screened several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for different CA16 particles, and several sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) were developed to measure the different types of CA16 viral particles. The mAbs that could only bind denatured or empty capsids could not neutralize CA16. In contrast, the mAbs that could bind mature full particles or all types of particles showed obvious neutralizing activity. The thermal stability of different CA16 particles was evaluated using these sandwich ELISAs. The mature full particles were found to be more thermolabile than the other types of particles and could be stabilized by high concentrations of cations. These methods can be used to assist in the potency control of CA16 vaccines and will promote the development of a CA16 vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3acapsid 3acations 3aclinical trials 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3aimmune response 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3athermal stability 3avaccines 3avirion1 aYang, Lisheng1 aJia, Jizong1 aHan, Jinle1 aLi, Shuxuan1 aLiu, Yajing1 aXu, Longfa1 aZhao, Huan1 aChen, Yixin1 aLi, Yimin1 aCheng, Tong1 aXia, Ningshao0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 100, no. 6 p.2809-2815dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7296-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002700163245008300190300001600273520061700289592002800906650001000934650001900944650001300963650001300976650002000989650001501009650002501024650001001049650003201059650002801091650004401119650006801163650001101231650001101242650000901253650006601262651001001328651001001338700002001348700001801368700002201386773010701408856008401515852000901599655001201608IND4472955620221119163825.0120503e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447295562DNAL7 a217300402pmid7 a10.1177/07482337114094832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Rajnarayan R.,10aBlood chromium levels of children working in gem-polishing industries in India  ap. 170-173.  aThe gem-polishing industry in Jaipur, India employs a substantial proportion of children.

However, the practice of employing children should be totally curbed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achromium 3aindustry 3aschool children 2aAdolescent 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChild 2aChromiumxbloodxpoisoning. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEmploymentxstatistics & numerical data 2aExtraction and Processing Industryxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOccupational Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aSāhā, Asīma,1 aSathwara, N G1 aParikh, Jagdish R0 tToxicology & industrial health.g2012 Mar., v. 28, no. 2 p.170-173dSAGE Publicationsx0748-23377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/07482337114094833Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245006300154520146300217592002801680650001901708650001301727650002201740650001401762650001601776650001501792650001501807650001301822650001101835650001401846650001701860650001101877650001701888650001601905650001201921650001401933651001001947700001601957773011901973856007202092852000902164655001202173IND60648673720221122083328.0190701e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867372DNAL7 a10.3390/f70801582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Kunpeng10aEstimates of Wildfire Emissions in Boreal Forests of China  aWildfire emissions in the boreal forests yield an important contribution to the chemical budget of the troposphere. To assess the contribution of wildfire to the emissions of atmospheric trace species in the Great Xing’an Mountains (GXM), which is also the most severe fire-prone boreal forest region in China, we estimated various wildfire activities by combining explicit spatio-temporal remote sensing data with fire-induced emission models. We observed 9998 fire scars with 46,096 km2 in the GXM between the years 1986 and 2010. The years 1987 and 2003 contributed 33.2% and 22.9%, respectively, in burned area during the 25 years. Fire activity is the strongest in May. Most large fires occurred in the north region of the GXM between 50° N and 54° N latitude due to much drier weather and higher fire danger in the northern region than in the southern region of the study domain. Evergreen and deciduous needleleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest are the main sources of emissions, accounting for 84%, 81%, 84%, 87%, 89%, 86%, 85% and 74% of the total annual CO<inf>2</inf>, CH<inf>4</inf>, CO, PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, BC and NO<inf>x</inf> emissions, respectively. Wildfire emissions from shrub, grassland and cropland only account for a small fraction of the total emissions level (approximately 4%–11%). Comparisons of our results with other published estimates of wildfire emissions show reasonable agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3acropland 3adeciduous forests 3aemissions 3afire hazard 3afire scars 3agrasslands 3alatitude 3amodels 3amountains 3anitric oxide 3ashrubs 3aspatial data 3atroposphere 3aweather 3awildfires 3aChina1 aBao, Yulong0 tForests.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70801583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245014700150300001600297500002000313520136800333592002801701596008501729596005701814596005701871596008901928596005902017650001402076650002302090650001202113650001202125650002002137650001202157650002102169650001402190650001702204650001902221650001402240650001002254650001102264650001302275650002502288700005002313700001202363700001102375700001302386700001202399700001202411700001302423700001302436700001302449700001102462700001302473700001402486700001202500700001102512773013202523856007302655852000902728655001202737IND60631154220221119102230.0190219e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063115422DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.141652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.14aThe potential of cadmium ion‐immobilized Rhizobium pusense KG2 to prevent soybean root from absorbing cadmium in cadmium‐contaminated soil  ap. 919-930.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Because the effect of Cd²⁺‐immobilized microbe on Cd uptake of plants in Cd‐contaminated soil remains underexplored, this study focuses on the effect of Cd²⁺‐immobilized rhizobia on Cd uptake of soybean. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strain KG2 from soybean nodule was identified as Rhizobium pusense KG2 by phylogenetic analysis. Rhizobium pusense KG2 showed the 120 mg l⁻¹ of minimal lethal concentration for Cd²⁺. In 50 and 100 mg l⁻¹ of Cd²⁺ liquid, approximately 2 × 10¹⁰ cells removed 56·71 and 22·11% of Cd²⁺, respectively. In pot soil containing 50 and 100 mg kg⁻¹ of Cd²⁺, strain KG2 caused a 45·9 and 35·3% decrease in soybean root Cd content, respectively. Meanwhile, KG2 improved the root and shoot length, nitrogen content and biomass of soybean plants and superoxide dismutase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The Cd²⁺‐immobilized rhizobia could inhibit soybean plants to absorb Cd²⁺ from soil, promote plant growth and improve plant's tolerance against Cd. This study is the first time to report that R. pusense is an effective nodulating rhizobium of legume. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some Cd²⁺‐immobilized microbe lowering Cd uptake of plant and promoting plant growth should be considered as an effective strategy for producing safety crops in the Cd‐contaminated agricultural soil.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017RZ0064cScience and Technology Innovation Talent Project in Sichuan Province  a2017SZ0183cKey Research Project in Sichuan province  a2017SZ0087cKey Research Project in Sichuan province  a201710626077cStudent Innovation Training Program of Sichuan Agricultural University  a31872696cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aRhizobium 3aagricultural soils 3abiomass 3acadmium 3aenzyme activity 3aliquids 3anitrogen content 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aYu, X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5776-47951 aCui, Y.1 aTu, W.1 aShen, T.1 aYan, M.1 aWei, Y.1 aChen, X.1 aWang, Q.1 aChen, Q.1 aGu, Y.1 aZhao, K.1 aXiang, Q.1 aZou, L.1 aMa, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 126, no. 3 p.919-930dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.141653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245016600177300001600343520102400359592002801383650005001411650001501461650001301476650001901489650001301508650001401521650001901535650003701554650002501591650002701616650001601643650001301659653002301672653005201695653006301747653002201810653001901832700002401851700005901875700001701934700001801951773009101969856009002060852000902150655001202159IND60632897820221118043814.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoulangé, Marine10aFenton-like and potassium permanganate oxidations of PAH-contaminated soils: Impact of oxidant doses on PAH and polar PAC (polycyclic aromatic compound) behavior  ap. 437-444.  aPotassium permanganate and Fenton-like oxidations were applied on two PAH-contaminated soils collected on former coking plant and gas plant sites. The impact of oxidant dose on the polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) evolution, including 16 US-EPA PAHs, 11 oxygenated- and 4 nitrogen heterocyclic-PACs (O- and N-PACs) was studied for both treatments. The content of extractable organic matter and PACs was determined prior and after oxidation. Overall, permanganate treatment was more efficient than Fenton-like to decrease the PAH content, this latter being limited by the contamination availability. However, permanganate treatment resulted in incomplete PAH degradation, leading to the formation of O-PACs, that was limited with the application of higher dose. It underlines the importance of the dose and the oxidant type in the selection of oxidation parameters for remediation purpose, as improper use of oxidant can lead to the accumulation of oxidation by-products that could be as toxic as the parent compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abyproducts 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolycyclic compounds 3apotassium permanganate 3aremediation 3atoxicity 0aChemical oxidation 0aOxygenated polycyclic aromatic compound (O-PAC) 0aNitrogen heterocyclic polycyclic aromatic compound (N-PAC) 0aCoking plant soil 0aGas plant soil1 aLorgeoux, Catherine1 aBiache, Coralie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5575-45261 aSaada, Alain1 aFaure, Pierre0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.437-444dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171300001600263520213300279592002802412650002202440650001402462650002602476650001802502650001202520650002002532650001402552650001602566650001002582700002502592773011402617856008502731852000902816655001202825IND60694712620221120155816.0200514e19971201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069471262DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.1997.99894932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelenes, Javier10aMorphological variations among species of the fossil dinoflagellate genus Gonyaulacysta  ap. 173-196.  aSpecies assigned to the widely known genus Gonyaulacysta are typically bicavate with an apical horn, parasutural crests, and a precingular archeopyle. Closely related genera are currently distinguished by variations in the degree of cavation, and shape and size of the parasutural crests. Based on details of morphology and paratabulation, three morphologic groups can be distinguished within species now assigned to Gonyaulacysta, and they are here assigned to three genera: Gonyaulacysta emend., distinguished by well‐developed apical horn and cavation, elliptical cingular cross‐section, and a paratabulation pattern including the contacts 1u/1i, A/1i, ai/II, and the presence of accessory K intercalary paraplates. Forms included in this genus as emended here have been described only from Jurassic rocks. Stanfordella gen. nov., distinguished by weakly developed apical horn and cavation, circular cingular cross‐section, and a paratabulation pattern including the contacts 1u/1i, 1u/6, au/Iu, and absence of accessory K intercalary paraplates. Forms included in this new genus have been described from Tithonian to Albian rocks. Wrevittia gen. nov., distinguished by well‐developed apical horn, weakly developed cavation, circular cingular cross‐section, and paratabulation pattern including the contacts A/ai, lu/ai, au/ lu, and variable presence or absence of accessory K intercalary paraplates. Forms included in this new genus have been described from Berriasian to Cenomanian rocks. The paratabulation pattern of this genus is commonly found in Tertiary forms, and in the living species Gonyaulax spinifera. The separation of these three genera points out the morphological similarities and differences between the species treated here, and should also help to biostratigraphically resolve Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous sedimentary sequences. New taxa include: Stanfordella granulosa gen. nov., sp. nov., S. exsanguia comb, nov., S. fastigiata comb, nov.; S. ordocava comb, nov., Wrevittia gen. nov., W. helicoidea comb, nov., W. cassidata comb, nov., W.? diutina comb, nov., and W. ? perforobtusa comb nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aGonyaulax 3aMiddle Jurassic epoch 3aTithonian age 3afossils 3anew combination 3anew genus 3anew species 3arocks1 aLucas‐clark, Joyce0 tPalynology.g1997 Dec. 1, v. 21, no. 1 p.173-196dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl4184753x1558-91887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.1997.99894933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011900159300001800278520185800296592002802154650001502182650003102197650001702228650002002245650001402265650001302279650001802292650002102310650001502331650003602346650001702382650001802399650001802417650001402435650001602449650000902465650001702474650002302491650001502514650002602529650001402555650001002569700002102579700002402600700001502624700001602639700002402655700001902679773012502698856007402823852000902897655001202906IND60639858120221120061831.0190503e20161012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063985812DNAL7 a10.1039/c6fo00867d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrace, Mary H.10aIn vitro lipolytic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of roasted pistachio kernel and skin constituents  ap. 4285-4298.  aA comprehensive phytochemical analysis was conducted on pistachios to identify the differential contributions of skin and kernel phytochemicals to in vitro bioactivity. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of skin and kernel non-polar extracts (SNP and KNP, respectively) indicated that the major components are fatty acids (696.36 and 879.70 mg g⁻¹), phytosterols (16.08 and 4.28 mg g⁻¹), and γ-tocopherol (304.17 and 397.10 μg g⁻¹). Analysis of the skin and kernel polar extracts (SP and KP, respectively) showed that skin accumulated higher levels of phenolic compounds, especially flavan-3-ols, compared to the kernel. An (epi)catechin hexoside was the major component in SP and KP (9.8 mg g⁻¹ and 3.3 mg g⁻¹, respectively). Flavan-3-ols with different degrees of polymerization were detected in SP, but only the monomers were identified in the KP. Quercetin glycosides were the major flavonols present in both SP and KP. Bioassays with 3T3L1 mouse adipocytes demonstrated that all extracts decreased lipid accumulation, with SNP demonstrating the highest activity (17% inhibition). Bioassay guided fractionation of SNP indicated that the lipolytic activity was highest in the fraction consisting of linoleic acid (20%), linolenic acid (10%), and β-sitosterol (50%). Radical scavenging assays indicated that all pistachio extracts significantly inhibited ROS, while SP was the most inhibiting to NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Gene expression profiles associated with inflammation (IL6, iNOS, and COX2) were characterized in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages after treatment with pistachio extracts. SP and KP were the most potent to inhibit the expression of COX2. The SNP had the strongest effect in decreasing non-mitochondrial oxidative burst associated with inflammatory response in macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-sitosterol 3abioassays 3acatechin 3afractionation 3agamma-tocopherol 3aglycosides 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alinoleic acid 3alipolysis 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3aphenolic compounds 3apistachios 3aquantitative analysis 3aquercetin 3aseeds1 aEsposito, Debora1 aTimmers, Michael A.1 aXiong, Jia1 aYousef, Gad1 aKomarnytsky, Slavko1 aLila, Mary Ann0 tFood & function.g2016 Oct. 12, v. 7, no. 10 p.4285-4298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6fo00867d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010500169300001400274520104000288592002801328650002301356650001001379650001001389650002201399650001101421650002701432650002301459650001601482650001401498651001001512651001801522700002101540700002001561700001801581700003101599773011001630856008101740852000901821655001201830IND60120111720221122024724.0150125e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012011172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-014-0876-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaratti, Mariella10aInvestigating the puzzling genetic structure of mallard populations (Anas platyrhynchos L.) in Italy  ap. 81-89.  aThe mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.), the most abundant waterfowl species, is an important migratory component of the Holartic fauna. In Europe, massive numbers of farm-reared mallards of unknown genetic origin are released into the wild for hunting and in urban areas for ornamental purposes. Human manipulations have caused shifts in range, influenced migration propensity, led to behavioural modifications and altered the genetics of this duck species. With the aim to contribute to knowledge on the genetic consequences of large-scale game releases of mallards in southern Europe, we analysed the relationship among 245 individuals (wild and captive-bred) from eight localities in central and northern Italian regions and four from North America, by using nine microsatellite loci. In most Italian sites, a large admixture of mallard strains were observed, whereas significant genetic differentiation levels were found between urban and wild populations and among the wild population from North America and all European populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aducks 3afauna 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory behavior 3aurban areas 3awaterfowl 3aItaly 3aNorth America1 aBaccetti, Nicola1 aCordaro, Matteo1 aMori, Alessia1 aDessì-Fulgheri, Francesco0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2015 Feb., v. 61, no. 1 p.81-89dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-014-0876-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01550naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245015800184300001600342520059800358592002800956650001100984650001700995650001501012650001601027700002101043773011401064856008501178852000901263655001201272IND60694712720221120143921.0200514e19971201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069471272DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.1997.99894942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalliani, Raffaella Bucefalo10aUmbriadinium mediterraneen se gen. et sp. nov. and valvaeodinium hirsutum sp. nov.: Two dinoflagellate cysts from the lower Jurassic of the Tethyan Realm  ap. 197-206.  aTwo species of dinoflagellate cysts, Umbriadinium mediterraneense gen. et sp. nov. and Valvaeodinium hirsutum sp. nov. occur in the Lower Jurassic (lower Toarcian) of the Tethyan Realm.

The system with rhamnolipids was characterised by relatively high particle homogeneity. However, the addition of saponins to diesel oil caused the cells to aggregate (the polydispersity index: 0.542) and the biodegradation of diesel oil was only 46%.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from ‘the B-PROOF study’ (B-vitamins for the Prevention Of Osteoporotic Fractures). PARTICIPANTS: 2842 participants aged 65 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: BMI and fat percentage, measured by Dual Energy X-ray, and serum 25(OH) D levels. RESULTS: Mean age was 74 years (6.5 SD), with 50% women. Mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 55.8 nmol/L (25 SD). BMI and total body fat percentage were significant inversely associated with serum 25(OH)D levels after adjustment for confouders (β−0.93; 95%CI [−1.15; −0.71], p<0.001 and β−0.84; 95%CI [−1.04; −0.64], p<0.001). This association was most prominent in individuals with a BMI in the ‘overweight’ and ‘obesity’ range (β−1.25 and −0.96 respectively) and fat percentage in the last two upper quartiles (β−1.86 and −1.37 respectively). CONCLUSION: In this study, higher BMI and higher body fat percentage were significantly associated with lower serum 25(OH)D levels in older persons. This association was particularly present in individuals with overweight, and higher fat percentages, suggesting that these persons are at increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adata analysis 3aelderly 3aenergy 3aobesity 3arisk 3avitamin B complex 3avitamin D 3awomen1 avan Dijk, S.

In addition, the histologic picture also shows whether there has actually been an interaction between the body and the fungus. To be sure, cultures are necessary to distinguish the species of certain genera: e.g., Candida, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Mucor; however, of the two, cultures can more readily be dispensed with. It is necessary to distinguish more strictly than heretofore between the infections that have been lumped under actinomycosis; these are true actinomycosis, actinobacillosis, nocardiosis, streptothricosis and bacterial granulomas with sulfur granule formation, e.g., staphylococcal granulomas. The means for distinguishing between these are discussed. The more or less pronounced granulomatous character of the numerous bacterial or fungal inflammations is a peculiar attribute of these processes; it is better to use the more general term “infectious granulomas” rather than “specific inflammations”. The histologic appearance of the lesion and the causative organism is illustrated for several of the infectious granulomas of animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCandida 3aMucor 3aPenicillium 3aactinomycosis 3aanimal pathology 3aanimals 3afungi 3agranuloma 3ahistology 3anocardiosis 3asulfur0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 1, no. 3 p.221-247dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985864001003033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04563naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245020600171300001400377520217200391592002802563650002602591650002702617650001302644650001802657650001802675650000902693650001802702650002702720650001602747650001502763650001002778650004102788650001402829650001802843650001202861650001602873650001802889650004002907650000902947650002102956650001502977650001902992650000703011650001603018650001903034650002303053650001903076650001003095650002103105650002503126653001003151653000803161653000803169653000803177653000703185653000703192653000803199653000803207653000803215653000803223653000803231653000603239653001003245653000903255653000803264653000703272653000903279653000803288653000803296653000803304653002103312653002703333653001003360653002103370653002503391700001603416700001503432773011603447856008903563852000903652655001203661IND60611038920221120154111.0200515e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061103892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2018.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKholif, A.E.10aCrushed flaxseed versus flaxseed oil in the diets of Nubian goats: Effect on feed intake, digestion, ruminal fermentation, blood chemistry, milk production, milk composition and milk fatty acid profile  ap. 66-75.  aPlant oils or oil-rich seeds that are rich in unsaturated fatty acids can be used as feedstocks to modify milk fatty acid profiles. The effect of providing lactating Nubian goats with flaxseed oil or crushed seeds on the feed intake, digestion, ruminal fermentation, lactational performance and milk fatty acid profile was assessed. Fifteen lactating does, weighing 33.2 ± 0.8 kg after parturition, were randomly assigned to three treatments in a quintuplicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Does were stratified according to their previous milk production, parity and expected average milk yield in a 90-day experiment. Does were fed a basal diet containing 500 g of berseem clover and 500 g of concentrates (Control treatment) or the control diet supplemented with 50 g of crushed flaxseed containing 37.5% oil (Seed treatment) or 20 mL of flaxseed oil (Oil treatment). Without affecting the feed intake, crushed flaxseed and flaxseed oil increased (P<0.05) the organic matter and crude protein digestibilities. Flaxseed oil lowered (P<0.05) ruminal pH and acetate proportion. Flaxseed and oil increased (P<0.05) total volatile fatty acids and propionate concentration and proportion. Flaxseed oil had no effect on fibre digestibility, but crushed flaxseed increased (P<0.01) fibre digestibility. High concentrations of serum glucose (P<0.05) and low (P<0.001) concentrations of triglycerides (P<0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and beta-hydroxybutyrate were observed with crushed flaxseed and flaxseed oil. Flaxseed oil and crushed flaxseed increased (P<0.05) milk production and milk (feed) efficiency; however, flaxseed oil decreased (P<0.05) milk fat content. Moreover, crushed flaxseed and flaxseed oil decreased (P<0.05) milk saturated fatty acids and atherogenicity index and increased the concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids and total conjugated linoleic acid. In conclusion, supplementing the diet of lactating Nubian goats with flaxseed oil or crushed flaxseed enhanced milk production and altered milk fatty acid composition. However, crushed flaxseed is preferable to flaxseed oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aacetates 3ablood glucose 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3afeedstocks 3agoats 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alactation 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amilk 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk yield 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aparturition 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3aseed treatment 3aseeds 3atriacylglycerols 3avolatile fatty acids 0aADFom 0aBHB 0aCH4 0aCLA 0aCP 0aDM 0aECM 0aGOT 0aGPT 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aN 0aNDFom 0aNEFA 0aNSC 0aOM 0aPUFA 0aVFA 0aSFA 0aUFA 0aFeed utilization 0aFlaxseed oil and seeds 0aGoats 0aMilk fatty acids 0aMilk nutritive value1 aMorsy, T.A.1 aAbdo, M.M.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2018 Oct., v. 244 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2018.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006400204300001600268520144700284592002801731650001101759650002301770650001601793650001801809650001401827650001601841650001801857650002201875650001801897650003301915650002101948650002201969773014001991856008302131852000902214655001202223IND60758980520221119225808.0211205e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075898052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00427-021-00680-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlik, Elif1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0669-272510aPotential stress tolerance roles of barley germins and GLPs  ap. 109-118.  aGermins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) known as germination markers are encoded by multigene families in several plant species, including barley. To date, functional analysis has revealed germins and GLPs are involved in diverse processes such as embryonic development and stress responses. The aim of this study was the analysis of barley germins and GLPs. In this study, 80 putative germins and GLPs have been identified in barley by using known 17 germins and GLP sequences. Analysis of germins and GLPs showed all germins and GLPs are distributed on all seven chromosomes that most of them spread through chromosome 3, 4 and 7 with 16, 18 and 12 proteins on each, respectively. The protein sizes varied between 185 and 335 amino acids, with an average length of 225 aa. Twelve conserved motifs were found. While germin motifs 1 and 3 were detected in all germins and GLPs, some motifs were found to be related to signalization. Interestingly, protein–protein interaction analysis demonstrated some GLPs are associated with RAB6-interacting golgin, oligopeptide transmembrane transporter activity, beta-glucuronidase activity, protein N-linked glycosylation, multi-pass membrane protein, and proteins containing zinc finger (Znf) domain and RING (really interesting new gene)-type zinc finger domains. Our findings suggest that barley germins and GLPs may have diverse functions that make them important candidates for crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abeta-glucuronidase 3achromosomes 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3agermination 3aglycosylation 3amembrane proteins 3aoligopeptides 3aprotein-protein interactions 3astress tolerance 3azinc finger motif0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2021 Dec., v. 231, no. 5-6 p.109-118dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870042x0949-944X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-021-00680-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009300158300001800251520036300269592002800632650001100660650001600671700002000687700003000707700002500737700002200762700002000784700002200804700001600826700002000842700001900862773013300881856007401014852000901088655001201097IND60659928420221120200454.0190823e20130808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065992842DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc44276d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasmal, Ashok10aReversible switching of the electronic ground state in a pentacoordinated Cu(ii) complex  ap. 7806-7808.  aAn easy reversible switching of the electronic ground state in a pentacoordinated copper(ii) complex is reported for the first time.

Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein heifers (initial body weight 276 ± 8.3 kg) were used in a replicate 4 × 4 Latin square design with four dietary RUP amounts in the total dietary protein, as follows: 38% of RUP (38RUP), 44% of RUP (44RUP), 51% of RUP (51RUP) and 57% of RUP (57RUP). The experimental period was 84 days, subdivided into four periods of 21 days (14 days for adaptation + 7 days for collections). Eight spot collections of faeces, urine, ruminal content and omasal digesta were performed at 9-h intervals, as follows: on 15ᵗʰ day samples were collected at 0600 h and 1500 h; on 16ᵗʰ day samples were collected at 0000 h, 0900 h and 1800 h; on 17ᵗʰ day samples were collected at 0300 h, 1200 h and 2100 h. Two complete rumen evacuations were performed: one on 19ᵗʰ day 4 h after morning feeding and another on 21ˢᵗ day immediately before morning feeding. Total (kg/day) and relative (g/kg of body weight) intake of dry matter, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre corrected for ash and protein were not affected (P > 0.10) by dietary RUP amounts. Ruminal (P = 0.06) and intestinal (P = 0.09) digestibilities of CP presented a tendency to decrease with increasing RUP. There were no effects of dietary RUP amounts (P > 0.10) on the rates of ingestion, passage and digestion (%/h) as well on the total volatile fatty acid concentration in the rumen. Urinary N excretion presented a tendency (P = 0.08) to decrease with increasing RUP. In addition, retained N presented a tendency (P = 0.09) to increase according to dietary RUP amounts and greater values were observed for treatments 51RUP and 57RUP. Microbial protein synthesis, microbial efficiency and the efficiency of use of N for microbial synthesis decreased with increasing RUP (P < 0.05). Metabolisable protein flow presented a tendency to increase (P = 0.091) and greater values were observed for 51RUP and 57RUP. In general, urinary N excretion decreased, while the flow of metabolisable protein and RUP increased with increasing RUP levels. As a consequence of this pattern, the treatments 51RUP and 57RUP presented increases in the retained N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adairy heifers 3adietary protein 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aexcretion 3afatty acid composition 3afeces 3afermentation 3aingestion 3aintestines 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient use efficiency 3aprotein synthesis 3arumen 3aurine 3avolatile fatty acids 0aANRO 0aCP 0aCPI 0aCPI/DOMI 0aCPRO 0aDM 0aDOM 0aEMS 0aiNDF 0akd 0aki 0akp 0aMP 0aMPmic 0aNDFap 0aN 0aNend 0aOM 0apdNDFap 0aPmic 0aRAN 0aRDP 0aRUP 0aVFA 0a38RUP 0a44RUP 0a51RUP 0a57RUP 0aMicrobial protein 0aNitrogen balance 0aRDP 0aRUP1 aDetmann, Edenio1 aRennó, Luciana N.1 aPedroso, Alexandre M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1819-76681 aFontes, Marta M.S.1 aMorais, Valber C.1 aSguizzato, Anna L.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3867-971X1 aAbreu, Marcelo B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6236-83081 aRotta, Polyana P.1 aMarcondes, Marcos I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4843-28090 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2018 Oct., v. 244 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245018200162300001800344500002000362520151900382592002801901596006201929596004001991650002202031650002102053650002302074650001602097650001602113650002002129650002002149650003802169650001502207650001302222650001802235650002502253650001902278650002102297650001602318650002102334650003002355700002102385700002302406700007102429700006002500773012002560856007802680852000902758655001202767IND60624592320221118213332.0181204e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062459232DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2018002582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Chor Yin14aThe hypolipidemic effects of Tamarindus indica fruit pulp extract in normal and diet‐induced hypercholesterolemic hamsters are associated with altered levels of serum proteins  ap. 2965-2973.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe hypolipidemic effects of Tamarindus indica fruit pulp extract (Ti‐FPE) have been earlier reported but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still uncertain. In this study, hamsters fed with Ti‐FPE, both in the absence and presence of high‐cholesterol diet, were shown to have significantly reduced levels of serum triglyceride, LDL‐C and total cholesterol. The Ti‐FPE‐fed non‐hypercholesterolemic hamsters also showed significant enhanced levels of serum apolipoprotein A1, antithrombin III, transferrin and vitamin D binding protein. In diet‐induced hypercholesterolemic hamsters, apolipoprotein A1, antithrombin III and transferrin, which were relatively low in levels, became significantly enhanced when the hamsters were fed with Ti‐FPE. These Ti‐FPE‐fed hypercholesterolemic hamsters also showed significant higher levels of serum vitamin D binding protein. When the different treated groups of hamsters were analyzed for the levels of the four serum proteins by ELISA, similar altered abundance were detected. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the Ti‐FPE modulated serum proteins singled out “Lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry” as the top network. Our results suggest that the hypolipidemic effects of Ti‐FPE are associated with alterations of serum proteins that are known to be cardioprotective and involved in the metabolism of lipids.

Supplemental feeding systems compensate for food limitation, but modify resource distribution and potentially affect individual space use. We investigated the importance of snow cover and supplemental feeding in shaping winter habitat use and selection of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), a small deer species not specifically adapted to snow. We applied a used/available experimental design to assess the effects of snow cover on roe deer distribution at a fine scale and compared this approach with remotely sensed satellite data, available at moderate spatial resolution (snow MODIS). Based on this, we developed a resource selection function. We found a strong selection for habitat spots covered by forest where snow sinking depth was less pronounced, likely providing thermal and hiding protection on the one side and minimising the effect of snow on locomotion on the other. Roe deer showed only a minor preference for sites in proximity to feeding stations, possibly compensating the costs of access to these sites by means of a ‘trail-making’ behaviour.

The direction of droplet motion is determined by the polarity of the surfactant charge and the orientation of the imposed electric field. We have found that the effective electrophoretic mobility of dielectric droplets in a confined channel is directly proportional to the logarithm of the surfactant concentration even for values significantly exceeding critical micelle concentration (CMC). We attribute this finding not only to adsorption of ionic surfactants to the surface of dielectric droplets but also to the weakening of electro‐osmosis at channel walls due to the increase of ionic strength in the aqueous phase. Our findings can be exploited in microfluidic reactors and separators for on request dosing, sampling, and separation of dielectric fluids.  aPublisher supplied data  a17–09914ScCzech Science Foundation  cMSMT 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adroplets 3aelectric field 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3aionic strength 3aionic surfactants 3akerosene 3aliquids 3amicelles 3aseparators1 aSlouka, Zdeněk1 aPřibyl, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8288-91270 tElectrophoresis.g2018 Dec., v. 39, no. 23 p.2997-3005dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2018001763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010400166300001600270500002000286520105200306592002801358650001901386650001401405650002001419650002201439650001701461650002001478650003201498650001101530650001801541773013301559856007901692852000901771655001201780IND60693757420221121042923.0200508e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069375742DNAL7 a10.1111/1477-9552.123652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGohin, Alexandre14aThe Land Use Impacts of the EU Biodiesel Policy: Assessing the Direct, Indirect and Induced Effects  ap. 305-329.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper deals with the controversial measure of indirect land use changes of the European biodiesel policy. Two studies sponsored by the European Commission find significant, but contrasted, land use impacts for the different vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. The first study uses an aggregate computable general equilibrium model capturing direct, indirect and induced effects. The second more recent study uses a biotechnical partial equilibrium model providing a detailed representation of the indirect effects occurring through the livestock sectors. We develop an original economic emulator to understand the diverging key results of these studies and test their sensitivity. We find that the direct and indirect effects on vegetable oil and land markets explain most of the differences. We also find that indirect effects on the feed markets and the induced effects have less influence on the biodiesel results. We finally argue that the development of emulators as done here can help to understand complex policy assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiesel 3afuel production 3aissues and policy 3aland markets 3aland use change 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3avegetable oil0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2020 June, v. 71, no. 2 p.305-329dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl18305x0021-857X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245015100171300001600322520190300338592002802241650001402269650001502283650001502298650002402313650002402337650001402361650001002375650001302385650002302398650001202421650001702433650002202450651001402472700002402486700002502510773010002535856008202635852000902717655001202726IND4485200420221121071029.0161105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448520042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10152-010-0236-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSueiro, MarÃ­a Cruz10aHabitat complexity and community composition: relationships between different ecosystem engineers and the associated macroinvertebrate assemblages  ap. 467-477.  aSeveral species of ecosystem engineers inhabiting coastal environments have been reported structuring different kinds of communities. The magnitude of this influence often depends on the habitat complexity introduced by the engineers. It is commonly accepted that an increase in habitat complexity will result in an increase in diversity and/or abundance in the associated fauna. The rocky salt marshes along the coast of Patagonia are dominated by cordgrasses, mussels, and barnacles forming a mosaic of engineered habitats with different complexity. This system allows us to address the following questions: how different is a macroinvertebrate assemblage when dominated by different ecosystem engineers? And, is there a positive relationship between increasing habitat complexity and the species richness, diversity and total density of the assemblages? To address these questions, we compared the three ecological scenarios with decreasing habitat complexity: cordgrassâmussel, mussel, and barnacle-engineered habitats. We found a total of 22 taxa mostly crustaceans and polychaetes common to all scenarios. The three engineered habitats showed different macroinvertebrate assemblages, mainly due to differences in individual abundances of some taxa. The cryptogenic amphipod Orchestia gammarella was found strictly associated with the cordgrassâmussel habitat. Species richness and diversity were positively related with habitat complexity while total density showed the opposite trend. Our study suggests that species vary their relative distribution and abundances in response to different habitat complexity. Nevertheless, the direction (i.e., neutral, positive or negative) and intensity of the communityâs response seem to depend on the physiological requirements of the different species and their efficiency to readjust their local spatial distribution in the short term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aCirripedia 3aPolychaeta 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem engineers 3aengineers 3afauna 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3amussels 3asalt marshes 3aspecies diversity 3aArgentina1 aBortolus, Alejandro1 aSchwindt, Evangelina0 tHelgoland marine research.g2011 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.467-477dSpringer-Verlagx1438-387X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1007/s10152-010-0236-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014000176300001400316520176800330592002802098650001202126650002402138650002102162650002102183650001102204650003102215650001002246650001002256650001302266650002502279650001802304650001402322650001202336650001502348650001402363650002002377650002202397650002202419650002602441650001302467653002102480653001002501653000902511653000902520700002602529700002602555700002202581773010802603856008502711852000902796655001202805IND60589438720221119033832.0180222e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058943872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomarathne, M.B.C.L.10aDevelopment of siRNA mediated RNA interference and functional analysis of novel parasitic nematode-specific protein of Setaria digitata  ap. 42-49.  aDespite the differences of the host, parasitic nematodes may share commonalities in their parasitizing genes. Setaria digitata novel protein (SDNP) is such an entity which is parasitic nematode-specific and having sequence similarities with those of W. bancrofti, B. malayi, Loa loa and Onchocerca volvulus. Post-transcriptional gene silencing by siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) is a widely used technique in functional genomics. Though the technique has been used in several free-living, plant and animal parasitic nematodes, it has not yet been tried out for the filarial worm S. digitata. In this study, we developed an effective siRNA delivery method by microinjection and utilized the siRNAi tool to knockdown SDNP to study the phenotypic and cellular changes associated with the interference.qPCR analysis revealed, a significant reduction of SDNP transcript levels following siRNA microinjection into S. digitata adult worms. Similarly, immunohistochemical staining indicated a reduction of SDNP protein expression. Furthermore, worms treated with siRNA showed a significant reduction of microfilariae release together with embryonic lethality by arresting an early developmental stage compared to non-treated worms. A distinct motility reduction was also observed in treated worms compared to non-treated counterparts.This is the first report of the amenability of S. digitata to the siRNA induced RNAi. The presence of inter-domain linkers of muscle-specific twitchin kinase and calcium-dependent protein kinase isoform CDPK1 together with what our results revealed suggest that SDNP is most likely a protein involved in muscle movement and growth and development of the nematode. Hence SDNP has the characteristics of a potential drug target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoa loa 3aOnchocerca volvulus 3aRNA interference 3aSetaria digitata 3aadults 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3adrugs 3agenes 3agenomics 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicrofilariae 3amortality 3amuscles 3aparasitism 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3asequence homology 3asmall interfering RNA 3astaining 0aSetaria digitata 0asiRNA 0aRNAi 0aSDNP1 aGunawardene, Y.I.N.S.1 aChandrasekharan, N.V.1 aDassanayake, R.S.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2018 Mar., v. 186 p.42-49dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001600264520025200280592002800532650001300560650001600573650001600589650001200605650001300617700002500630700001800655700003300673700002100706700002500727700002100752773008100773856008100854852000900935655001200944IND60555910320221119162304.0161030e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055591032DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-016-0174-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViana, Patrik F.13aAn optimized protocol for obtaining mitotic chromosomes from cultured reptilian lymphocytes  ap. 191-195.  aWe provide an efficient protocol for obtaining mitotic chromosomes with well-defined morphology in 17 different taxa of the class Reptilia.

Oryza punctata is a distantly related wild Oryza species having BB genome with untapped genetic resources for rice improvement. Low crossability between the cultivated O. sativa and O. punctata restricts the success of transferring many desirable traits into cultivated rice. Artificially induced autotetraploids of an elite breeding line, IR31917-45-3-2, were produced and crossed with O. punctata. Allotriploid F₁ plants were backcrossed to IR31917-45-3-2 and generated progenies with extra chromosomes from O. punctata. Twenty BC₁F₁ and 59 BC₂F₁ plants were produced with chromosome numbers ranging from 24 (2n) to 29 (2n + 5) and 2n (24) to 26 (2n + 2), respectively. Eleven monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) were characterized morphologically and cytologically and designated as MAAL 1–12. MAALs were genotyped using O. punctata genome-specific molecular markers and detected chromosome segments inherited from O. punctata. O. punctata introgressions across all the chromosomes of O. sativa were identified except for chromosome 8. The most frequent introgressions were observed in chromosomes 4, 6, 10, and 11, which could be the recombination hotspots between A and B genomes. Some of the qualitative traits such as black hull, purple coleoptile base, purple stigma, long awn, and short grain size from O. punctata were inherited in some disomic introgression lines (DILs).

This line will be valuable in rice breeding. Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a destructive disease of cultivated rice. Pyramiding BB resistance genes is an essential approach for increasing the resistance level of rice varieties. We selected an advanced backcross recombinant inbred line 132 (ABL132) from the BC₃F₇ population derived from a cross between cultivars Junam and IR72 by K3a inoculation and constructed the mapping population (BC₄F₆) to locate the Xa4 locus. The Xa4 locus was found to be delimited within a 60-kb interval between InDel markers InDel1 and InDel2 and tightly linked with the Xa3 gene on chromosome 11. After cold (4 °C) treatment, ABL132 with introgressions of IR72 in chromosome 11 showed lower survival rate, chlorophyll content, and relative water content compared to Junam. Genetic analysis showed that the cold stress-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) qCT11 was located in a 1.3-Mb interval close to the Xa4 locus. One line, ABL132-36, containing the Xa3 resistance allele from Junam, the Xa4 resistance allele from IR72, and the cold-tolerance QTL from Junam (qCT11), was developed from a BC₄F₆ population of 250 plants. This is the first report on the pyramiding of Xa3 and Xa4 genes with a cold-tolerance QTL. This region could provide a potential tool for improving resistance against BB and low-temperature stress in rice-breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3aalleles 3abackcrossing 3ablight 3achlorophyll 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3aessential genes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ainbred lines 3aintrogression 3aloci 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asurvival rate 3awater content1 aCho, Jun-Hyeon1 aPark, Hyun-Su1 aNoh, Tae-Hwan1 aPak, Tong-su,1 aLee, Ji Yun1 aSohn, Young-Bo1 aShin, Dongjin1 aSong, You Chun1 aKwon, Young-Up1 aLee, Jong-Hee0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Oct., v. 129, no. 10 p.1861-1871dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2744-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156300001600246500002000262520199900282592002802281650001502309650001902324650001302343650001202356650001802368650001302386650001802399650001202417650001302429650001102442650002002453650002202473650001102495650001502506650001502521651001102536651001802547700002102565700002002586700002502606700002602631773010902657856007302766852000902839655001202848IND60557934820221120120854.0161103e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055793482DNAL7 a10.1890/08-0773.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYano, Yuriko10aNitrogen dynamics in a small arctic watershed: retention and downhill movement of 15N  ap. 331-351.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe examined short‐ and long‐term nitrogen (N) dynamics and availability along an arctic hillslope in Alaska, USA, using a stable isotope of nitrogen (¹⁵N), as a tracer. Tracer levels of ¹⁵NH₄ ⁺ were sprayed once onto the tundra at six sites in four tundra types: heath (crest), tussock with high and low water flux (mid‐ and footslope), and wet sedge (riparian). ¹⁵N in vegetation and soil was monitored to estimate retention and loss over a 3‐year period. Nearly all ¹⁵NH₄ ⁺ was immediately retained in the surface moss–detritus–plant layer, and >57% of the ¹⁵N added remained in this layer at the end of the second year. Organic soil was the second largest ¹⁵N sink. By the end of the third growing season, the moss–detritus–plant layer and organic soil combined retained ≥87% of the ¹⁵N added except at the Midslope site with high water flux, where recovery declined to 68%. At all sites, non‐extractable and non‐labile‐N pools were the principal sinks for added ¹⁵N in the organic soil. Hydrology played an important role in downslope movement of dissolved ¹⁵N. Crest and Midslope with high‐water‐flux sites were most susceptible to ¹⁵N losses via leaching, perhaps because of deep permeable mineral soil (crest) and high water flow (Midslope with high water flux). Late spring melt season also resulted in downslope dissolved‐¹⁵N losses, perhaps because of an asynchrony between N release into melt water and soil immobilization capacity. We conclude that separation of the rooting zone from the strong sink for incoming N in the moss–detritus–plant layer, rapid incorporation of new N into relatively recalcitrant‐soil‐N pools within the rooting zone, and leaching loss from the upper hillslope would all contribute to the strong N‐limitation of this ecosystem. An extended snow‐free season and deeper depth of thaw under warmer climate may significantly alter current N dynamics in this arctic ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3agrowing season 3aleaching 3amelting 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3aorganic soils 3arooting 3asnowmelt 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3atopographic slope 3atundra 3awater flow 3awatersheds 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aShaver, Gaius R.1 aGiblin, Anne E.1 aRastetter, Edward B.1 aNadelhoffer, Knute J.0 tEcological monographs.g2010 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.331-351dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0773.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012400170300001600294520162100310592002801931650003801959650002201997650001402019650001302033650001702046650002002063650001502083650001702098650001502115650002702130650002002157650003102177650001002208650001102218650002402229650001402253650001102267650002002278650001202298650001902310650001602329653001102345653002302356653001202379653002302391653001002414700001702424700001302441700001602454700002102470700001702491773011002508856008502618852000902703655001202712IND60519289420221121012306.0160426e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051928942DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2016.11621102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhaopeng10aEffects of organic fertilizer applications on starch changes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves during maturation  ap. 173-179.  aStarch is a major feedstock for biofuel production. To meet growing fuel demands, the starch yields of energy crops need to be improved. In this study, the effects of the application of an organic fertilizer composed of cotton cake, oil cake and wheat straw at different concentrations (3000, 6000 and 9000 kg ha ⁻¹) were investigated in order to optimize the yield of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves. To analyze the effects of the application of organic fertilizers on starch biosynthesis, we compared the phenotypic index, starch content, ultrastructure and starch granule volume during maturation. The results revealed that application of the organic fertilizer markedly promoted the accumulation of starch in tobacco leaves, and the concentration of organic fertilizer required for optimal yield in yellow loam areas was 6000 kg hm ⁻². Analysis of starch synthesis-related gene expression patterns revealed that the transcript levels of adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase (SS) and starch branching enzyme (SBE) increased gradually as leaf growth progressed, attained a maximum value at the mature stage, and then declined as leaves progressed toward maturity and senescence. The expression levels of these genes were higher in plants treated with the organic fertilizer than in those grown under normal conditions. Notably, AGPS3, AGPSL, GBSS1 and SS1 were highly expressed, indicating that these genes play crucial roles in starch synthesis in leaf tissue. The results provide insights into the molecular regulation of starch biosynthesis in tobacco leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aadenosine 3abiofuels 3abiosynthesis 3acottonseed cake 3acrop yield 3aenergy crops 3afeedstocks 3afertilizer application 3afuel production 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphenotype 3astarch 3astarch synthase 3atobacco 3aultrastructure 3awheat straw 0aStarch 0aorganic fertilizer 0atobacco 0aexpression pattern 0ayield1 aWang, Jianan1 aSun, Mou1 aWu, Jingcao1 aKong, Changrong,1 aLiu, Guoshun0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 62, no. 2 p.173-179dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2016.11621103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001200161245006100173300001600234500000900250520118800259592002801447650001701475650001701492650001501509650001301524650001201537650002201549650002901571650001101600650001701611650000901628650001401637650002401651650001801675650001501693650000901708700001701717773014901734856009601883852000901979655001201988IND60668411220221123035205.0191125e198009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066841122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400050019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, S.10aSorption of Copper, Zinc, and Cadmium by Some Acid Soils  ap. 969-974.  aepub  aThe sorption of Cu, Zn, and Cd as a function of pH was examined for three acid soils. Sorption occurred at pH levels markedly below the zero point of charge (ZPC). Copper sorption increased with increasing pH, and Cu was preferentially sorbed over Zn and Cd. The presence of Cu interfered with the sorption of Zn and Cd. The sorption at higher pH levels varied with the source of hydroxide used. Sodium hydroxide had a greater ability than calcium hydroxide to disperse organic matter and to reduce the ability of the soils to retain metals. Reduction of heavy metal sorption at high pH levels was attributed to the formation of metal-organic complexes. The metal sorptive capability of Chehalis (Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls) soil was greater than that of Puyallup (Fluventic Haploxerolls) and Sultan (Aquic Xerofluvents) soils, perhaps due to its higher organic matter and Fe contents and its higher cation exchange capacity (CEC). Further investigation revealed that the CEC played a more important role than soil organic matter content in the sorption of the metals. The solubility of Al and Mn in the soil solution may also help to regulate sorption of heavy metals by acid soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaploxerolls 3aXerofluvents 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acation exchange capacity 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3asoil organic matter 3asoil solution 3asolubility 3azinc1 aBaker, A.

To examine the clinical utility of gene rearrangement analysis for demonstrating neoplastic proliferation of small lymphocytes, gene rearrangement analysis was performed in comparison with immunophenotyping using peripheral lymphocytes in dogs with small lymphocytosis. Thirty-one dogs with small-cell lymphocytosis (8,100–884,300/μl) were enrolled. By immunophenotyping, lymphocytosis of all dogs was suggested to be neoplastic in nature based on the detection of marked expansion of phenotypically homogeneous lymphocytes or the presence of an aberrant antigen-expressing population of lymphocytes. In contrast, gene rearrangement analysis represented clonality in 27 dogs (detection rate of 87%). From the present study, gene rearrangement analysis was considered to be worthwhile to strengthen the evidence of neoplastic proliferation of small lymphocytes when coupled with immunophenotyping and to be a suitable diagnostic substitute if immunophenotyping is not available in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3adog diseases 3alymphatic diseases 3aneoplasms 3adisease detection 3adisease diagnosis 3alymphocytes 3adimensions 3aphenotype 3aimmunologic techniques 3aneoplasm antigens 3aphenotypic variation 3arisk assessment 3acell proliferation 2aAnimals 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDog Diseasesxbloodxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aGene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor 2aImmunophenotypingxveterinary 2aLymphocytosisxbloodxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aLymphoproliferative Disordersxbloodxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 0aClonality 0adogs 0alymphoproliferative disorders 0aphenotyping 0asmall lymphocytosis1 aUematsu, Yosuke1 aKoike, Ayumi1 aTamura, Kyoichi1 aIsotani, Mayu1 aYamaguchi, Tomohiro1 aOno, Kenichiro1 aWashizu, Tsukimi1 aBonkobara, Makoto0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 21, no. 2 p.197-202dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638709021002033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011800161300001600279500002000295520246500315592002802780650002002808650002702828650002802855650002302883650001402906650001102920650001302931650001402944650001102958650001902969650002502988650001303013650002203026651001403048700001903062700001903081700002003100700002503120700002303145773010903168856007303277852000903350655001203359IND60557934920221120105904.0161103e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055793492DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0052.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeisey, Dennis M.10aLinking process to pattern: estimating spatiotemporal dynamics of a wildlife epidemic from cross‐sectional data  ap. 221-240.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderlying dynamic event processes unfolding in continuous time give rise to spatiotemporal patterns that are sometimes observable at only a few discrete times. Such event processes may be modulated simultaneously over several spatial (e.g., latitude and longitude) and temporal (e.g., age, calendar time, and cohort) dimensions. The ecological challenge is to understand the dynamic latent processes that were integrated over several dimensions (space and time) to produce the observed pattern: a so‐called inverse problem. An example of such a problem is characterizing epidemiological rate processes from spatially referenced age‐specific prevalence data for a wildlife disease such as chronic wasting disease (CWD). With age‐specific prevalence data, the exact infection times are not observed, which complicates the direct estimation of rates. However, the relationship between the observed data and the unobserved rate variables can be described with likelihood equations. Typically, for problems with multiple timescales, the likelihoods are integral equations without closed forms. The complexity of the likelihoods often makes traditional maximum‐likelihood approaches untenable. Here, using seven years of hunter‐harvest prevalence data from the CWD epidemic in white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Wisconsin, USA, we develop and explore a Bayesian approach that allows for a detailed examination of factors modulating the infection rates over space, age, and time, and their interactions. Our approach relies on the Bayesian ability to borrow strength from neighbors in both space and time. Synthesizing a number of areas of event time analysis (current‐status data, age/period/cohort models, Bayesian spatial shared frailty models), our general framework has very broad ecological applicability beyond disease prevalence data to a number of important ecological event time analyses, including general survival studies with multiple time dimensions for which existing methodology is limited. We observed strong associations of infection rates with age, gender, and location. The infection rate appears to be increasing with time. We could not detect growth hotspots, or location by time interactions, which suggests that spatial variation in infection rates is determined primarily by when the disease arrives locally, rather than how fast it grows. We emphasize assumptions and the potential consequences of their violations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3achronic wasting disease 3adisease prevalence 3aequations 3agender 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3aspace and time 3astatistical analysis 3awildlife 3awildlife diseases 3aWisconsin1 aOsnas, Erik E.1 aCross, Paul C.1 aJoly, Damien O.1 aLangenberg, Julia A.1 aMiller, Michael W.0 tEcological monographs.g2010 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.221-240dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0052.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245014300217300001800360500001900378520173100397592002802128650002802156650001002184650001902194650001902213650001902232650001702251650001602268650001702284650001902301650001102320650000902331650002202340650001302362650001702375650000902392650001402401650002102415700007002436700002502506773012402531856008302655852000902738655001202747IND60685492920221122053740.0210216e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068549292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05259-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Shammari, Ahmed Majeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2699-151410aCombined therapy of oncolytic Newcastle disease virus and rhizomes extract of Rheum ribes enhances cancer virotherapy in vitro and in vivo  ap. 1691-1702.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhytotherapy has been used to treat a different type of diseases including cancer for a long time, and it was a source for different active anti-tumor agents. Oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (AMHA1) are very promising anti-tumor therapy. Nevertheless, NDV-based monotherapeutics have not been very useful to some resistant tumors. Thus, the efficiency of oncolytic NDV must enhance by combining NDV with other novel therapies. The current study aimed to determine the possibility of improving the oncolytic effect induced by NDV through Rheum ribes rhizomes extract administration in vitro and in vivo. Methods, the in vitro study include exposure of the crude extract of Rheum ribes alone or NDV alone or combination of both agents for 72 h. The cancer cells tested were murine mammary adenocarcinoma AMN3, Human Rhabdomyosarcoma RD, and Human Glioblastoma AMGM5, and using rat embryo fibroblast REF as normal control cells. MTT cell viability assay was used and analyzed for possible synergism using the Chou–Talalay analysis method. In vivo experiment included study the combination and the monotherapeutic modalities in the transplanted murine mammary adenocarcinoma AM3 line and tumor sections analyzed by histopathology. Results, Combination therapy of NDV–R. ribes showed enhanced oncolytic activity on cancer cells. With no cytotoxicity on normal cells. In vivo study showed that monotherapeutic modalities had lower growth inhibitory effect on transplanted tumors in mice in compare to combination therapy. Histopathological examination revealed the broader area of necrosis in tumors treated by combination therapy. In conclusion, the novel combination recommended for clinical application for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aRheum 3aadenocarcinoma 3acancer therapy 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3aglioblastoma 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amice 3amolecular biology 3anecrosis 3aphytotherapy 3arats 3asynergism 3aviability assays1 aJalill, Raghad Dhyea Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2574-91091 aHussein, Mohammed F.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.1691-1702dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05259-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010200174300001600276520153500292592002801827650004401855650002101899650002201920650002001942650001001962650003801972650002902010650001502039650004402054650001502098650003702113651001302150653003402163653000902197653002002206653002202226700001902248700001702267700002102284700001902305700002102324773012702345856005102472852000902523655001202532IND50076473820221117232324.0140410e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007647382DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2012.6938672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido, E. Manuela10aHost-guest complexes of phenoxy alkyl acid herbicides and cyclodextrins. MCPA and β-cyclodextrin  ap. 869-875.  aThe chlorophenoxy herbicide MCPA (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid), widely used for the control of broad-leaf weeds primarily in cereal and grass seed crops, still remains one of the most often used herbicides in Portugal. As the formation of inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins can improve its solubility properties, the interaction between the herbicide MCPA and β-cyclodextrin was investigated. The stability constants describing the extent of formation of the complexes have been determined by phase-solubility studies. Different analytical techniques [ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H NMR)] were employed for a thorough investigation of the structural characteristics of the obtained complexes, which exhibited distinct features and properties from both “guest” and “host” molecules. FTIR and ¹H NMR data obtained for the MCPA/β-CD complexes gave information about the interaction between MCPA and the nonpolar cyclodextrin cavity. The dramatic change observed in band frequency and proton displacements of OCH₂ group and H6 aromatic proton confirmed the inclusion of MCPA in β-CD. The formation of an inclusion complex between MCPA and β-CD increased the aqueous solubility of this herbicide which could be a particularly advantageous property for some specific applications, namely to improve commercial formulation and for environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abroadleaf weeds 3acrops 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenvironmental protection 3agrass seed 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolubility 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aPortugal 0aPhenoxyacetic acid herbicides 0aMCPA 0aβ-cyclodextrin 0ainclusion complex1 aSantos, Marcos1 aSilva, Paulo1 aCagide, Fernando1 aGarrido, Jorge1 aBorges, Fernanda0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 47, no. 9 p.869-875dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.693867  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016500153300001600318520185800334592002802192650001402220650002002234650000902254650001502263650001302278650001802291650001602309650000902325650001302334650001102347650001302358650001202371650001402383653001402397653001602411653002002427653000802447653001302455653001302468700002102481773023002502856007402732852000902806655001202815IND60616733920221119001831.0190412e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061673392DNAL7 a10.1111/vaa.120502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO, Odette12aA comparison of epidural analgesia provided by bupivacaine alone, bupivacaine + morphine, or bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine for pelvic orthopedic surgery in dogs  ap. 527-536.  aTo compare the analgesic efficacy of bupivacaine, bupivacaine + morphine, or bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine administered epidurally in dogs undergoing pelvic limb orthopedic surgery.Prospective, randomized, double blinded clinical trial.Sixty dogs weighing (mean ± SD) 35 ± 15.7 kg, aged 5 ± 3 years.Dogs were assigned to receive a lumbosacral epidural containing bupivacaine (B) 0.5%, 1 mg kg−1; B, bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg−1 + morphine 1%, 0.1 mg kg−1; B + M, or bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg−1 + dexmedetomidine 0.05%, 4 μg kg−1; B + D. The anesthetic protocol was standardized. The median expired isoflurane concentration (E′Iso) and requirement for additional induction agent preventing purposeful movement were recorded. Pain was scored using visual analog (VAS) and modified University of Melbourne (UMPS) pain scales. Sedation was assessed using a 0–4 scale. All parameters were recorded preoperatively, and at extubation (t = 0), then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20–24 hours. Hydromorphone was administered postoperatively to patients with a VAS ≥ 35 and/or UMPS ≥ 9. Time to first voluntary urination and first motor activity were recorded.Postoperatively, B + D had a lower UMPS pain score than B at t = 1 hour (p = 0.013), but not compared to B + M. The B + D group had a shorter time to urination (p = 0.0131) and a longer time for return of motor function (p = 0.0068). There were no other differences between the treatments.Epidurally administered B, B + M, or B + D in dogs all provided acceptable analgesia to manage post–operative orthopedic pelvic limb pain. Epidural administration of B + D is an effective alternative to the analgesia provided by B or B + M, but is associated with increased time to return of motor function. The direct neurotoxic effects of epidural dexmedetomidine have not been fully tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3adexmedetomidine 3adogs 3aisoflurane 3amorphine 3aneurotoxicity 3aorthopedics 3apain 3apatients 3apelvis 3asedation 3asurgery 3aurination 0aanalgesia 0abupivacaine 0adexmedetomidine 0adog 0aepidural 0amorphine1 aSmith, Lesley J.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2013 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.527-536dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.120503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014700164300001800311520108600329592002801415596007901443596007201522650002401594650001601618650001001634650001601644650001701660650001801677650001201695650005301707650000701760650001501767650001301782700001301795700001201808700009501820700001801915773014801933856008302081852000902164655001202173IND60648165520221121233249.0191115e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064816552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-01861-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zijie10aImidazolium-based ionic liquid surfactants as pseudostationary in combination with a chiral selector in micellar electrokinetic chromatography  ap. 3849-3856.  aIn recent years, ionic liquid-based surfactants have drawn more and more attention. As a new promising brand of surfactants, ionic liquid-based surfactants have their unique properties and superior aggregation behavior, which can be introduced as micellar pseudostationary in MEKC mode. In this paper, a novel ionic liquid-based surfactant, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolum dodecyl sulfate [C₄MIm][C₁₂SO₄], was synthesized through ion exchange reaction and applied for the first time to form micellar as pseudostationary phase for chiral separation with clindamycin phosphate as chiral selector. As observed, compared with conventional non-ionic liquid anionic surfactant, improved separation of tested drug enantiomers was obtained in the established MEKC system with ionic liquid-based surfactant. Parameters such as concentration of ionic liquid-based surfactants, type and proportion of organic modifier, concentration of chiral selector, and pH of buffer solution were systematically investigated to optimize the ionic liquid-based surfactant MEKC system.

Here, as a novel implementation of the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) based Transfer Entropy (TE) calculations, we show that the dissection of dynamic information into subsets of slow dynamic modes discloses different layers of multi-directional allosteric pathways inherent in a given protein structure. In these subsets of slow modes, the degree of collectivity (Col) in the information transfer of residues with their TE values (TECol score) identifies distinct residues as powerful effectors, global information sources; showing themselves with a high dynamic capacity to collectively disseminate information to others. As exemplified on aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase), Na⁺/K⁺-adenosine triphosphatase (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase), and human transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) along with a dataset of 20 proteins, these specific residues are associated with known active and allosteric sites. These information source residues, which collectively control others and lead allosteric communication pathways, hint at plausible binding sites for structure-based rational drug design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartate carbamoyltransferase 3abiological control 3adata collection 3adissection 3adrug design 3aentropy 3ahumans 3ainformation exchange 3ainformation sources 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aprotein structure 0aallostery 0ainformation transfer 0acausality 0acollectivity 0aglobal information sources 0aGNM 0aTE 0aTECol 0aCol1 aAcar, Burcin1 aErman, Burak1 aHaliloglu, Turkan0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 434, no. 17 p.167644-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2022.1676443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04188naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012100170300001600291520213200307592002802439650000802467650002302475650002502498650001102523650004402534650002102578650001502599650002802614650002802642650002902670650002102699650001902720650001202739650001602751650001102767650003002778650002002808650002302828650001302851650001202864650001802876650001302894650001802907651001002925651001202935653001602947653002302963653002102986653001303007653001203020700001803032700002303050700001903073700001803092700001903110700002103129700003303150700002303183700002503206700002003231700002303251773011003274856008503384852000903469655001203478IND60519289720221122121146.0160426e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051928972DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2016.11655982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Hironori10aFunction of the methanogenic community in mangrove soils as influenced by the chemical properties of the hydrosphere  ap. 150-163.  aCoastal ecosystems represent a potential additional source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH ₄) that has been insufficiently quantified. Thus, to understand the mechanisms controlling greenhouse gas emissions in these ecosystems, this study investigated CH ₄ emissions from and the related microbial properties of mangrove soils. Soil and gas samples were collected from several plots at different distances from the seashore in Soc Trang and Ca Mau in Vietnam, and the Sundarbans in India. Soil samples were incubated under different conditions, i.e., anaerobic or aerobic, and the microbial properties of each soil sample with the addition of different amounts of seawater were analyzed. Relatively high CH ₄ fluxes and production were detected during the aerobic incubation of samples from the seashore plots in Soc Trang and Ca Mau. However, CH ₄ production was reduced under anaerobic conditions [soil electrical conductivity (EC): 179–289 mS m ⁻¹, pH (H ₂O): 7.45–8.10] compared with aerobic conditions [water content: 38.9–109.2%, EC: 187–299 mS m ⁻¹, pH (H ₂O): 6.86–7.72], but it increased with increasing sulfate concentration, soil EC and cellulase activity and lowering soil pH under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, mangrove soil with a relatively high level of total organic carbon (C) exhibited relatively high CH ₄ production when diluted 4-fold with seawater under anaerobic conditions [water content: 38.9–109.2%, EC: 533 mS m ⁻¹, pH (H ₂O): 6.67]. Nearly all of the DNA bands excised from polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis contained identical sequences related to archaea from the class Halobacteria . The high potential of the seashore plot for CH ₄ emissions could be due to the enhancement of cellulase activity under the intermittent oxygen supply, which promotes polysaccharide depolymerization and subsequently increases anaerobic methanogenic activities during tidal flooding. This study also indicates that the major archaea responsible for CH ₄ production require a particular hydrospheric salt concentration and soil pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic conditions 3acarbon 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adepolymerization 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amangrove soils 3amethane 3amethanogens 3aoxygen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolysaccharides 3asalt concentration 3aseawater 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3asulfates 3awater content 3aIndia 3aVietnam 0ablue carbon 0acoastal ecosystems 0agreenhouse gases 0amangrove 0amethane1 aYoshioka, Ryo1 aHanazawa, Syunsuke1 aMinh, Vo Quang1 aTuan, Vo Quoc1 aTinh, Tran Kim1 aPhu, Truong Quoc1 aJhā, Candraśekharaśarmā,1 aRodda, Suraj Reddy1 aDadhwal, Vinay Kumar1 aMano, Masayoshi1 aInubushi, Kazuyuki0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 62, no. 2 p.150-163dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2016.11655983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001600295520167200311592002801983650001102011650001502022650001302037650001202050650002202062650001502084650001502099650001902114650001402133650001302147650000902160650001902169651001302188700002302201700002402224700002202248773009902270856008102369852000902450655001202459IND60630837520221119211400.0190214e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063083752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-018-0257-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuvengwi, Justice10aAre Termite Mounds Always Grazing Hotspots? Grazing Variability with Mound Size, Season and Geology in an African Savanna  ap. 125-136.  aForaging site selection by large herbivores is influenced by multiple factors varying across landscapes and spatial scales. Termite mounds harbour highly nutritious plants compared with the savanna matrix, making them preferred foraging patches in many savannas. However, it is unknown whether termite mounds equally influence herbivore grazing intensity across geological substrates and mound sizes. These knowledge gaps hamper our ability to draw general trans-ecosystem conclusions about the effect of termite mounds for savanna herbivores. We measured grazing intensity on mounds of three different size classes (small, medium and large) across two geologies with differing soil nutrition (granite and basalt) in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. We recorded measurements across three seasons (hot wet, cool dry and hot dry), and at multiple distances from mounds. Grazing intensity on mounds was higher on nutrient-poor granite than nutrient-rich basalt, and termite mounds of all sizes had a significant effect on grazing on granite during the cool dry season. Grazing was highest on large mounds on both geologies throughout the year. Large mounds also had the largest spatial influence on grazing in the cool dry season, up to 8 m beyond the mound edge on granite and 2 m on basalt. When scaled up to the landscape level, mounds influenced about 15% of the granite landscape, but only about 0.5% of the basalt landscape. Our results show that the positive effects of mounds on grazing intensity were pronounced on nutrient-poor soils but negligible on nutrient-rich soils, and that the magnitude of these effects varied across seasons and with mound size.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3adry season 3aforaging 3agranite 3agrazing intensity 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3anutrition 3asavannas 3asoil 3atermite mounds 3aZimbabwe1 aParrini, Francesca1 aWitkowski, E.

However, the interaction mechanisms, between milk proteins and these polysaccharides, are not entirely clear. To explore the interactions between uncharged and charged polysaccharides and the caseins, we used a model acid-milk-gel system, which allowed acidification to occur separately from gelation. The effect of adding uncharged dextran (DX; molecular weight ~2.0×106 Da) and negatively charged dextran sulfate (DS; molecular weight ~1.4×106 Da) to model acid milk gels was studied. Two concentrations (0.075 and 0.5%, wt/wt) of DX or DS were added to cold milk (~0°C) that had been acidified to pH values 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, or 4.9. Acidified milks containing DX or DS were then quiescently heated at the rate of 0.5°C/min to 30°C, which induced gelation, and gels were then held at 30°C for 17 h to facilitate gel development. Dynamic small-amplitude-oscillation rheology and large-deformation (shear) tests were performed. Microstructure of gels was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Gels made with a high concentration of DX gelled at a lower temperature, but after 17 h at 30°C, these gels exhibited lower storage moduli and lower yield-stress values. At pH 4.8 or 4.9 (pH values greater than the isoelectric point of caseins), addition of 0.5% DS to acidified milk resulted in lower gelation temperature. At pH 4.4 (pH values less than the isoelectric point of caseins), addition of 0.5% DS to acidified milk resulted in gels with very high stiffness values. Gels made at pH 4.8 or 4.9 with both concentrations of DS had much lower stiffness and yield-stress values than control gels. Microstructural analysis indicated that gels made at pH 4.4 with the addition of 0.5% DX exhibited large protein strands and pores, whereas gels made with 0.075% DX or the control gels had a finer protein matrix. At higher pH values (>4.4), gels made with 0.5% DX had a finer structure. At all pH values, gels made with 0.5% DS exhibited larger pores than the control gels. This study demonstrated that low concentrations of uncharged DX did not significantly affect the rheological properties of model acid milk gels; high concentrations of DX resulted in earlier gelation, possibly caused by depletion-induced attractions between casein particles, which altered the microstructure and created weaker gels. At pH values <4.6, negatively charged DS produced stiff casein gels, which might be due to attractive crosslinking by electrostatic interactions between DS and caseins at pH values below the isoelectric pH of casein (i.e., positively charged casein regions interacted with negatively charged DS molecules).  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidification 3aacidified milk 3acasein 3acasein gels 3acold 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence microscopy 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3aisoelectric point 3amicrostructure 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3apH 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3asulfates 0adextran 0adextran sulfate 0aexopolysaccharide 0aacid milk gel 0astabilizer1 aHorne, D.S.1 aLucey, J.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 May, v. 98, no. 5 p.2843-2852dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-86603Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008600171300001600257520151200273592002801785650002501813650002101838650002501859650002001884650001401904650002001918650001401938650001701952650002601969650002401995650001302019650000902032653002502041653002202066653002002088653001402108653000902122700002302131700002002154773010402174856008502278852000902363655001202372IND60519289820221122154133.0160807e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051928982DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2016.11441282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalilian, Jalal10aSafflower Growth as Affected by Cropping Intensity and Micronutrient Foliar Spray  ap. 259-273.  aPlant growth analysis is a useful set of quantitative methods that describe the performance of whole plant systems. To evaluate growth changes in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), an experiment was conducted as a split-plot arrangement with three replications at the Urmia University farm in 2011. Cropping systems (main plots) included conventional (high-, medium-, and low-input) and ecological (eco-friendly) systems. Micronutrient treatments [separate and combined use of Zn (2 g/l) and Mn (3 g/l), water spray and control] were the subplots. Leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), crop growth rate (CGR), and relative growth rate (RGR) were evaluated and subjected to variance and regression analyses. Leaf area index showed an early increasing trend up to 900 growing degree days (GDDs); afterwards, LAI declined in both cropping systems and micronutrient treatments. In the two sets of treatments, a linear response for TDM and RGR was observed. The trend for CGR in response to treatments was different; except for high-input system, the trend was linear for Zn+Mn and quadratic for other treatments. The LAI and TDM were less in ecological and low-input systems than in medium and high-input systems. Application of micronutrients increased growth parameters, particularly during the early growth stages. Because decreased chemical inputs did not adversely affect safflower growth, farmers should be able to reduce chemical inputs to obtain an acceptable level of safflower production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3acropping systems 3adevelopmental stages 3afoliar spraying 3aheat sums 3aleaf area index 3amanganese 3aplant growth 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3azinc 0aCarthamus tinctorius 0aecological system 0aleaf area index 0amanganese 0azinc1 aKohnaward, Parinaz1 aPirzad, Alireza0 tJournal of crop improvement.g2016 May 3, v. 30, no. 3 p.259-273dTaylor & Francisx1542-75367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2016.11441283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245008400207300001400291520115600305592002801461650002501489650001501514650001301529650000901542650001301551650001701564650001701581700001801598700001701616700001701633773014001650856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60612408020221119125933.0180905e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061240802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9608-269314aThe role of traceability in transforming seafood governance in the global South  ap. 25-32.  aBusiness-to-business traceability has historically played an important role in coordinating value chain activities and helping businesses to manage reputational risk. Its use and value, however, have recently extended beyond industry value chain actors alone, and traceability information may now contribute to improving government regulation, and via consumer-facing traceability (CFT) systems to sustainable seafood governance. Implementing traceability can be costly and requires coordination, consequently most systems utilized till date have been in the global North. Yet seafood value chains remain incredibly complex, and the majority of seafood is sourced from the South. This paper synthesizes the traceability literature through an informational governance perspective, analyzing if and how information can transform production practices while at the same time empowering producing nations. Traceability has gone beyond simply facilitating improved recall coordination, but the future value of traceability lies in how to design and organize systems in such a way that information flows can be harnessed to improve global seafood governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3agovernance 3aindustry 3arisk 3aseafoods 3asupply chain 3atraceability1 aBush, Simon R1 aMiller, Alex1 aKochen, Momo0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2016 Feb., v. 18 p.25-32dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013200164300001800296520133300314592002801647650002201675650003401697650001601731650003701747650002501784650001701809650001901826650001701845650001601862650001101878650001901889650000901908650002001917650002201937653002001959653002401979653001902003653001702022653001602039653002302055700002102078700001902099773012602118856007302244852000902317655001202326IND60527404420221119071803.0160715e20120627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052740442DNAL7 a10.1021/am300404v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuysinuan, Piyachat10aPreparation and Characterization of Caffeic Acid-Grafted Electrospun Poly(l-Lactic Acid) Fiber Mats for Biomedical Applications  ap. 3031-3040.  aCaffeic acid (CA) was chemically immobilized onto the surfaces of the individual electrospun poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) fibers to enhance the hydrophilicity and impart the antioxidant activity to the obtained fibrous membranes. This was done in two sequential steps. First, amino groups were covalently introduced onto the surfaces through the reaction with 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (HMD). In the second step, the amino moieties reacted with CA, which had been preactivated sequentially with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). The success of the reactions was confirmed by the ninhydrin assay and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis (XPS). Indirect cytotoxicity evaluation with murine dermal fibroblasts (L929) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) revealed that the neat and the modified PLLA fibrous matrices released no substances in the levels that were harmful to the cells. Direct culturing of HDFa on these fibrous substrates indicated that they supported the proliferation of the cells on days 2 and 3 very well and that the CA-immobilized substrates exhibited the highest cell viability. Lastly, the antioxidant activity of the CA-immobilized substrates, as revealed by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryldrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, was as high as 88% on average.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3acaffeic acid 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3amice 3apolylactic acid 3aspectral analysis 0aelectrospinning 0apoly(l-lactic acid) 0aimmobilization 0acaffeic acid 0aantioxidant 0aradical scavanging1 aPavasant, Prasit1 aSupaphol, Pitt0 tACS applied materials .g2012 June 27, v. 4, no. 6 p.3031-3040dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am300404v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015200171300001600323520139800339592002801737650001401765650001401779650001701793650002301810650001701833650002401850650002301874650001801897650002301915650000901938650001601947650001101963650001301974650001301987650002002000653003202020653001002052653001302062653001702075653001602092653002002108700001902128773012702147856005102274852000902325655001202334IND50076474120221117232236.0140410e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007647412DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2012.6938702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTien, Chien-jung10aAssessing the toxicity of organophosphorous pesticides to indigenous algae with implication for their ecotoxicological impact to aquatic ecosystems  ap. 901-912.  aThis study aimed to determine the toxicity of three organophosphorous pesticides, chlorpyrifos, terbufos and methamidophos, to three indigenous algal species isolated from local rivers and algal mixtures. The diatom Nitzschia sp. (0.30–1.68 mg L⁻¹ of EC₅₀ -the estimated concentration related to a 50% growth reduction) and the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. (EC₅₀ of 0.33–7.99 mg L⁻¹) were sensitive to single pesticide treatment and the chlorophyta Chlorella sp. was the most tolerant (EC₅₀ of 1.29–41.16 mg L⁻¹). In treatment with the mixture of three pesticides, Chlorella sp. became the most sensitive alga. The antagonistic joint toxic effects on three indigenous algae and algal mixtures were found for most of the two pesticide mixtures. The results suggested that mixture of pesticides might induce the detoxification mechanisms more easily than the single pesticide. The synergistic interactions between terbufos and methamidophos to algal mixtures and between methamidophos and chlorpyrifos to Nitzschia sp. indicated methamidophos might act as a potential synergist. Differential sensitivity of three families of algae to these pesticides might result in changes in the algal community structures after river water has been contaminated with different pesticides, posing great ecological risk on the structure and functioning of the aquatic ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aNitzschia 3aOscillatoria 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achlorpyrifos 3acommunity structure 3agrowth retardation 3amethamidophos 3apesticide mixtures 3arisk 3ariver water 3arivers 3aterbufos 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aOrganophosphorous pesticide 0aalgae 0atoxicity 0aantagonistic 0asynergistic 0aecological risk1 aChen, Colin S.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 47, no. 9 p.901-912dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.693870  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300001800267500001900285500001100304520137400315592002801689650000801717650001701725650002201742650001001764650002701774650002201801650002201823650001701845700001601862700001701878773012401895856008302019852000902102655001202111IND60685493320221122053823.0210216e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068549332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05268-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDash, Hirak R.10aAlternatives to amelogenin markers for sex determination in humans and their forensic relevance  ap. 2347-2360.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aForensic DNA typing and subsequent molecular methods of sex determination in humans have been proven to be an imperious tool to criminal justice system. In current practice, most of the short tandem repeat (STR) based commercial kits contain amelogenin as the sexing marker. Amelogenin gene which contributes to the tooth enamel formation is present on both X and Y chromosome with a variation in base pair size. However, huge discrepancies have been observed with amelogenin based sex determination mostly due to X and Y deletion in the population and mutation in primer binding sites. Some ethnicities such as those in Indian population are affected badly with inappropriate sex determination by amelogenin marker due to the presence of high frequency of Y deletion in the population. Presence of PCR inhibitors, degradation in the DNA samples and presence of mixed DNA also contribute to the discrepancy in results obtained by amelogenin analysis. To overcome this problem, many alternative markers/techniques such as STS, SRY, TSPY, DXYS156, SNPs, DYZ1 and Next generation sequencing have been discussed in much detail with their respective pros and cons. In this regard, inclusion of one or more alternative markers along with amelogenin will decrease the anomalies in sex determination observed while using the amelogenin marker alone in forensic sample analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aY chromosome 3aforensic sciences 3agenes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular biology 3asex determination 3atooth enamel1 aRawat, Neha1 aDas, Surajit0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.2347-2360dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05268-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245010300208300001800311506007600329520185400405592002802259596009702287596015002384506003702534650000802571650001502579650003202594650001502626650001902641650001602660650002202676650001902698650002002717650004202737650001102779650001702790650002002807650001402827650001302841650002602854650004302880650005202923700001602975700002202991700002703013700002203040773014803062856008303210852000903293655001203302IND60648165820221207132720.0191115e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064816582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-01878-z2doi7 aPMC65950712pmcid7 a311613202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomori, Makoto10aMeasurement of microRNA with isothermal DNA amplification on fully automated immunoassay analyzers  ap. 3789-3800.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) in a blood sample are usually measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), microarray, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) which requires time-consuming pre-treatment, manual operation, and a stand-alone instrument. To overcome these disadvantages, miRNA testing has been developed using the automated analyzers routinely used in clinical laboratories. An isothermal DNA amplification reaction was adapted to a fully automated immunoassay analyzer that conducts extraction, amplification, and detection processes at 37 °C in 44 min. In a reaction vessel, a pre-designed single-stranded signal DNA was amplified in the presence of miRNA, using DNA templates, DNA polymerase, and nicking endonuclease. Then, the amplified signal DNA was hybridized by one DNA probe attached to a magnetic particle and another DNA probe labeled with acridinium ester. After the chemiluminescence reaction, luminescence intensity was automatically measured. The automated assays of cancer-related miRNAs were implemented on the analyzer with throughput of 66 tests per hour. In the assays with one-step amplification, three miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-18a-5p, and miR-500a-3p) at concentrations lower than 100 fM were automatically detected and the cross reactivity for miR-21-5p with fifteen similar miRNAs was not higher than 0.02%. In the assay with two-step amplification, detection sensitivity and amplification rate for miR-21-5p were 3 fM and 103-fold, respectively. The coefficient of variations (CVs) in the measurement at the target concentrations from 5 fM to 1000 pM were less than 8%. Furthermore, we also achieved automated nucleic acid detection in human serum. The proposed fully automated miRNA assays showed high sensitivity, low cross reactivity, and reproducibility suitable for clinical use.

Three hundred 1-day-old Avian broilers were randomly divided into four groups, and fed on diets as follows: control diet (Mo 13 mg/kg) and high molybdenum diets (Mo 500 mg/kg, high molybdenum group I; Mo 1,000 mg/kg, high molybdenum group II; Mo 1,500 mg/kg, high molybdenum group III) for 6 weeks. The results showed that the relative weight of kidney were higher (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and the cellular percentages of G0/G1 phase were lower, and cellular percentages of S phase and the proliferating index were higher in high molybdenum groups II and III than in control group (P < 0.01). The percentage of renal cell apoptosis was increased in high molybdenum groups II and III when compared with that of control group (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical test showed that there were increased frequencies of positive cells containing Bax protein and decreased frequencies of positive cells containing Bcl-2 protein in high molybdenum groups II and III. It was concluded that dietary high molybdenum (1,000 mg/kg and 1,500 mg/kg) impaired the progression of renal cells from S phase to G2M phase obviously and induced renal cell apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abirds 3adiet 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterphase 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3amolybdenum 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aChickens 2aFlow Cytometry 2aKidneyxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMolybdenumxpharmacology 2aRandom Allocation 2abcl-2-Associated X Proteinxmetabolism1 aCui, Heng-min1 aYang, Fan1 aPeng, Xi1 aCui, Yun0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Sept., v. 142, no. 3 p.523-531dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8772-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008600168300001400254520163100268592002801899650001501927650001801942650001901960650001601979650001201995650001602007650001602023650000902039650001302048650000902061650001702070650002402087650002202111651001402133653001602147653001202163653001702175653001502192653001202207653003802219653001702257700001802274700002302292700002302315700006002338700002002398773009402418856008702512852000902599655001202608IND60589439620221119032122.0190502e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058943962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiang10aSoil organic carbon and mineral interactions on climatically different hillslopes  ap. 71-80.  aClimate and topography have been widely recognized but studied separately as important factors controlling soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Subsequently, the significance of their interplay in determining SOC storages and their pools is not well understood. Here we examined SOC storages and SOC-mineral interactions along two hillslope transects in differing climate zones (MAP = 549 mm in semi-arid eucalyptus savannah vs. 816 mm in temperate eucalyptus forest) in southeastern Australia. On eroding slopes, SOC inventories were twice as large at the wetter site (4.5 ± 0.6 vs. 2.3 ± 0.9 kg m−2), whereas depositional soils had similar SOC inventories at both locations (7.5 ± 2.0 vs.7.0 ± 2.2 kg m−2). On eroding slopes, carbon concentrations of the mineral-associated SOC fraction (<250 μm and >2.0 g cm−3) increased by ~50% with increasing rainfall, which was also positively correlated to abundances of clay minerals and pedogenic iron oxides. Within individual hillslopes, carbon concentrations of the mineral-associated SOC fraction doubled from eroding to depositional soils at the drier site, but no topographic trend was observed at the wetter site. The effects of topography on SOC inventories and mineral-associated SOC were more strongly expressed under the drier climate, where vegetation was sparser and soil erosion involved mineral grain size sorting. Our results demonstrate that SOC pools and their interactions with minerals are dependent on topographic locations, emphasizing the need to include geomorphic data when assessing climatic controls of SOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aclay minerals 3aclimatic zones 3acorrelation 3aforests 3ainventories 3airon oxides 3arain 3asavannas 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic carbon 3atopographic slope 3aAustralia 0aSoil carbon 0aClimate 0aMicroclimate 0aTopography 0aErosion 0aMineral associated organic carbon 0aBioturbation1 aYoo, Kyungsoo1 aWackett, Adrian A.1 aGutknecht, Jessica1 aAmundson, Ronald1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1510-73131 aHeimsath, Arjun0 tGeoderma.g2018 July 15, v. 322 p.71-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245016200176300001600338520088300354592002801237650002601265650001501291650001601306650001301322650002101335650000901356650001701365650002801382650002201410650001401432650002301446650002001469650002401489650002101513700002401534700002801558700003201586700002201618700003401640700002601674700003301700700004401733700003301777773012501810856008101935852000902016655001202025IND60555551320221120143628.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055555132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-016-1837-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampaio, Fernanda Garcia10aEffects of Dietary Exposure to Sulfamethazine on the Hematological Parameters and Hepatic Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 528-535.  aSulfamethazine (SMZ) is one of the most commonly used sulfonamide compounds in fish farming, and its physiological effects on fish are unknown. SMZ was administered to juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) at a dose level of 422 mg kg⁻¹ body weight, for a period of 11 days, via medicated feed. Fish were divided into two groups, the control group (CG) and the group fed with SMZ in feed. The administration of SMZ did not alter the erythrograms and leukograms of the Nile tilapia. The SMZ-fed group showed the same hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) concentration as the CG. Nonetheless, the oral administration of SMZ raised the hepatic catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities, the increase probably being sufficient to prevent hepatic LPO production. The oral administration of SMZ affects the hepatic GST and CAT activities of Nile tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3acatalase 3adietary exposure 3afish 3afish culture 3aglutathione transferase 3ahematologic tests 3ajuveniles 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicated feeds 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress1 aCarra, Maria Lídia1 aJonsson, Claudio Martin1 aGonçalves, Vitoria Teodoro1 aDal’Bo, Genoefa1 aNunes, Kátia Santos Damacena1 aValim, José Henrique1 aDallago, Bruno Stéfano Lima1 ado Nascimento de Queiroz, Sonia Claudia1 aReyes, Felix Guillermo Reyes0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 Oct., v. 97, no. 4 p.528-535dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-016-1837-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010100168300001600269520091000285592002801195650001401223650000901237650001801246650001001264650001601274653002601290653002501316653002901341700001901370700001801389700002301407773012701430856005101557852000901608655001201617IND50076474320221117232236.0140410e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007647432DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2012.6938782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemur, Cemile10aAdaptation and validation of QuEChERS method for the analysis of trifluralin in wind-eroded soil  ap. 842-850.  aThis study was carried out to develop and validate a reliable analytical procedure for trifluralin analysis in wind-eroded sediments. Soil sediments trapped in BEST sediment traps were subjected to QuEChERS extraction method, incorporating a simple simultaneous cleanup step, followed by trifluralin analysis with GC-ECD. Results revealed that QuEChERS method offered a potential alternative technique for pesticide extraction from soil samples. The validity of analytical method was performed by the method-performance criteria such as, recovery, LOD, LOQ repeatability, precision, and all found to be within the required limits. It was also observed in this study that herbicide concentrations in the wind-eroded sediment did not vary with the time and trap height. Trifluralin concentrations of surface soil after four erosion events were higher (626.05 μg/kg) than wind-eroded soil (450.08 μg/kg).  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atraps 3atrifluralin 0aWind-eroded herbicide 0atrifluralin movement 0aQuEChERS method for soil1 aTiryaki, Osman1 aUzun, Oguzhan1 aBaşaran, Mustafa,0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 47, no. 9 p.842-850dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.693878  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245020300176520198900379592002802368650002902396650002002425650001402445650000902459650001302468650001502481650001402496650001802510650002102528650001802549650001002567650003102577650001702608650000902625650001402634650001402648650001302662651002102675653001602696653001902712653002202731653003302753653002102786700002402807700002402831700002202855700001602877700002302893700001802916700002002934773010602954856008803060852000903148655001203157IND60753320120221120023020.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075332012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1130332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlava, Juan José,10aOccurrence and size distribution of microplastics in mudflat sediments of the Cowichan-Koksilah Estuary, Canada: A baseline for plastic particles contamination in an anthropogenic-influenced estuary  aDocumenting the prevalence of microplastics in marine-coastal ecosystems serves as a first step towards understanding their impacts and risks presented to higher trophic levels. Estuaries exist at the interface between freshwater and marine systems, and provide habitats for a diverse suite of species, including shellfish, fish, and birds. We provide baseline values for estuarine mudflats using sediment samples collected at Cowichan-Koksilah Estuary in British Columbia, Canada, a biologically-rich estuary. The estuary also contains a marine shipping terminal, forestry log sort area, and input of contaminants from nearby residential and agricultural areas. Microplastics, both fragments and fibers, occurred in 93% (13/14) of sediment samples. A mean of 6.8 microfibers/kg dw (range: 0–12 microfibers/kg dw) and 7.9 microfragments/kg (range: 0–19 fragments/kg dw) occurred in individual samples, and counts of fibers and fragments were strongly correlated (r = 0.78, p = 0.008, n = 14). The abundance of microplastics tended to be higher on the north side of the estuary that receives greater inputs from upland sources relative to the south side. Size distributions of microplastic fragments and fibers were similar to sediment grain size distribution with size categories 0.063 to 0.25 mm and 0.25 to 0.6 mm being the most common for plastics and sediment, indicating the occurrence of microplastics likely followed existing depositional processes within the estuary. Microplastics in sediments were composed of a variety of polymers, including high density polyethylene (HDPE), Nylon 6/6 (polyhexamethylene adipamide), and polyethylene terephthalate-PETE (poly(1,4-cyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate)). This study indicates that microplastics occur throughout most of the Cowichan-Koksilah Estuary, and future studies should focus on the exposure risk and potential for bioaccumulation for wildlife species that feed on the surface of intertidal mudflats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioaccumulation 3aestuaries 3afish 3aforestry 3afreshwater 3ahighlands 3alittoral zone 3amarine pollution 3amicroplastics 3anylon 3aparticle size distribution 3apolyethylene 3arisk 3asediments 3ashellfish 3awildlife 3aBritish Columbia 0aMicrofibers 0aMicrofragments 0aMudflat sediments 0aSediment deposition patterns 0aCowichan Estuary1 aKazmiruk, Tamara N.1 aAntwoodc(Musician)1 aSchuerholz, Goetz1 aHeath, Bill1 aFlemming, Scott A.1 aBendell, Leah1 aDrever, Mark C.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.113033-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1130333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007900170300001400249520122400263592002801487650002501515650001801540650001801558650001501576650002301591650002301614651001801637700002101655700001701676700001701693773012501710856008401835852000901919655001201928IND60612408420221119130002.0180905e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061240842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2015.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamers, Machiel14aThe changing role of environmental information in Arctic marine governance  ap. 49-55.  aIn the Arctic region global environmental change creates economic opportunities for various sectors, which is increasing pressure on marine biological resources. Next to state governance arrangements, informational governance instruments deployed by non-state actors, such as private certification schemes, mapping exercises and observation systems, play a progressive role in introducing ecosystem-based approaches for governing the marine environment. In this paper we review recent academic literature to understand the role of environmental information in Arctic marine governance. Our review reveals that environmental information may on one hand enable safe or sustainable operations of actors by creating legitimacy and building trust, while on the other hand the participation and empowerment of some actors may constrain other actors, leading to conflict and controversy. We conclude that the growing importance of environmental information in Arctic marine governance is driven both by state management systems and non-state actors, that currently the enabling role of information dominates the literature, but that the constraining role of information will likely increase in future Arctic marine governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological resources 3acertification 3aglobal change 3agovernance 3amanagement systems 3amarine environment 3aArctic region1 aPristupa, Alexey1 aAmelung, Bas1 aKnol, Maaike0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2016 Feb., v. 18 p.49-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2015.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245006500180300001600245520230400261592002802565650001002593650002402603650000902627650001202636650001302648650001002661650001202671650001002683650001602693650001802709650001202727650000902739650002002748650001002768650001202778650001602790650001302806650002102819650001102840650001802851650000902869650001202878650002302890650005302913650002402966651001202990651001303002651001003015651001203025651001303037651001003050700001703060700001803077700001803095700001403113700001603127700001303143700001703156773013703173856008103310852000903391655001203400IND4477391420221118123214.0120419e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447739142DNAL7 a220218132pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2011-42942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMárquez, G. C.10aIndex selection in terminal sires improves early lamb growth  ap. 142-151.  aThe use of terminal sires (TS) for crossbreeding is integral to the UK sheep industry where approximately 71% of market lambs are sired by TS rams. Early growth of these crossbred lambs affects profitability. The objectives of this study were i) to evaluate the effectiveness of index selection among TS on BW and ADG of their crossbred offspring; and ii) to compare the efficacy of that selection within TS breeds. The most widely used TS breeds in the United Kingdom are Charollais, Suffolk, and Texel. These participated in sire referencing schemes in which they were evaluated on a lean growth index designed to increase carcass lean weight at a given age. From 1999 to 2002, approximately 15 high and 15 low lean growth index rams per breed (93 in total, differing in index on average by 4.6 SD) were selected from within their sire referencing schemes and mated to Welsh and Scottish Mule ewes. Their crossbred offspring were reared commercially on 3 experimental farms in England, Scotland, and Wales. A total of 6,515 lambs were born between 2000 and 2003. Lambs were weighed at birth (BWT), 5 wk (5WT), and 10 wk (10WT), and their ADG from birth to 10 wk was calculated. Lambs sired by high index rams were on average, across breeds, heavier at all ages (P < 0.01) with 0.07 ± 0.03, 0.3 ± 0.1, and 0.4 ± 0.1 kg greater BWT, 5WT, and 10WT, respectively. Their ADG was 5.1 ± 1.9 g/d greater than low-index-sired lambs (P < 0.01). Suffolk-sired lambs were on average heavier at all ages, with greater ADG, whereas Charollais-sired lambs were lightest with smallest ADG. Overall, there was no significant interaction between sire index and sire breed (P > 0.10). Within Suffolk-sired lambs, there was little difference between high and low index sires for the traits studied (P > 0.3). High and low index Charollais-sired lambs differed in BWT (0.09 ± 0.04 kg) and 5WT (0.3 ± 0.1 kg), and Texel-sired lambs differed in 5WT (0.5 ± 0.1 kg), 10WT (0.9 ± 0.2 kg), and ADG (10.2 ± 3.3 g/d; P < 0.01). Lambs from Scottish Mule dams were heavier, with greater ADG, than lambs born to Welsh Mules (P < 0.01). Lambs reared in Scotland were heavier at all ages (P < 0.01). The results suggest that using index selection in TS can improve the growth of their commercial offspring reared on grass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTexel 3ademonstration farms 3aewes 3agrasses 3aindustry 3alambs 3amarkets 3amules 3aparturition 3aprofitability 3aprogeny 3arams 3aselection index 3asires 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSheep, Domesticxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSpecies Specificity 3aEngland 3aScotland 3aWales 0aEngland 0aScotland 0aWales1 aHaresign, W.1 aDavies, M.

O.10aResistance of Annual Ryegrass Germplasm to a Highly Aggressive New Strain of Blast (Gray Leaf Spot)  ap. 311-322.  aAnnual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) is a highly nutritive, fast-growing, C3 cool-season annual forage. Blast or gray leaf spot is a fungal disease of ryegrass caused by Magnaporthe orygae (anamporph Pyricularia oryzae). The disease kills seedlings as well as adult plants. Blast-resistant annual ryegrass cultivars are not available at present. Therefore, identifying sources of resistance and developing blast-resistant germplasm are priorities to circumvent the devastating disease. Incorporation of germplasm screening in a breeding program requires an efficient, low-cost, and high-throughput evaluation system. Screening methods reported in literature lack both efficiency and throughput capabilities suitable for breeding. The aims in this work were to develop a low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping system, and to screen the annual ryegrass National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) collection with a highly aggressive, newly isolated M. oryzae strain from naturally infected annual ryegrass plants, which was named MoGA1. Host specificity was tested on four species in addition to annual ryegrass. Extensive damage was caused to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh), whereas rice (Oryza sativa L.) and orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) exhibited a hypersensitivity response and resisted the infection, suggesting that pathogenicity of the strain was limited to the Lolium genus. A portable low-cost, high-throughput screening system capable of screening 1,536 plants per unit was developed and used to screen 138 ryegrass accessions with MoGA1. Two accessions showed resistance to the pathogen and produced seed. These two entries can be used to incorporate blast resistance in annual ryegrass germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aDactylis glomerata 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aOryza sativa 3abreeding 3acultivars 3aforage 3afungi 3agermplasm 3agermplasm screening 3agrasses 3ahost specificity 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaf spot 3amature plants 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3arice 3aseedlings 0aBlast resistance 0ahigh-throughput screening 0ahost specificity 0aLolium multiflorum 0aMagnaporthe oryzae1 aJones, K.1 aAdhikari, L.1 aKim, D.

The size and morphology of nanocrystals can be readily controlled by tuning the ratio of solvents, and the size-dependent behavior of lithium storage performance is also observed. After a carbon-coating surface treatment, rhombic-shaped LiFePO₄ nanocrystals display excellent lithium storage properties with high reversible capacities and good cycle life (141.0 mAh g–¹ at 0.5 C after 50 cycles etc.). This method can be extended to prepare LiMnPO₄ nanorods by substituting iron source with manganese salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3alithium 3amanganese 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3asolvents 0alithium iron phosphate 0aliquid-phase reduction process 0aelectrochemical performance1 aLiu, Wen1 aChen, Jitao1 aHou, Y.q(Yanglong),0 tACS applied materials .g2012 June 27, v. 4, no. 6 p.3062-3068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am300418p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245005100157300001600208500002000224520199000244592002802234650002002262650001502282650002502297650002802322650001102350650000902361650002202370700001802392700001502410700001802425773011002443856007302553852000902626655001202635IND60557935620221122065013.0161103e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055793562DNAL7 a10.1890/08-2225.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchleuter, D.12aA user's guide to functional diversity indices  ap. 469-484.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFunctional diversity is the diversity of species traits in ecosystems. This concept is increasingly used in ecological research, yet its formal definition and measurements are currently under discussion. As the overall behavior and consistency of functional diversity indices have not been described so far, the novice user risks choosing an inaccurate index or a set of redundant indices to represent functional diversity. In our study we closely examine functional diversity indices to clarify their accuracy, consistency, and independence. Following current theory, we categorize them into functional richness, evenness, or divergence indices. We considered existing indices as well as new indices developed in this study. The new indices aimed at remedying the weaknesses of currently used indices (e.g., by taking into account intraspecific variability). Using virtual data sets, we test (1) whether indices respond to community changes as expected from their category and (2) whether the indices within each category are consistent and independent of indices from other categories. We also test the accuracy of methods proposed for the use of categorical traits. Most classical functional richness indices either failed to describe functional richness or were correlated with functional divergence indices. We therefore recommend using the new functional richness indices that consider intraspecific variability and thus empty space in the functional niche space. In contrast, most functional evenness and divergence indices performed well with respect to all proposed tests. For categorical variables, we do not recommend blending discrete and real‐valued traits (except for indices based on distance measures) since functional evenness and divergence have no transposable meaning for discrete traits. Nonetheless, species diversity indices can be applied to categorical traits (using trait levels instead of species) in order to describe functional richness and equitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afunctional diversity 3aintraspecific variation 3amixing 3arisk 3aspecies diversity1 aDaufresne, M.1 aMassol, F.1 aArgillier, C.0 tEcological monographs.g2010 Aug., v. 80, no. 3 p.469-484dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-2225.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245005400186300001600240500001500256520060800271592002800879650001600907650001600923650001300939650002600952650001700978650002200995650001901017650000901036650002701045650001701072650002101089650001101110650002101121650001201142650002101154650001401175650001101189650001201200650003101212650002401243650003501267650001801302650004101320650002401361650003601385650003401421653002101455653002701476653004401503700002401547773013201571852000901703856008301712655001201795IND4419398020221120082845.0181016e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441939802DNAL7 a192865072pmid7 a10.1177/1040638709021002132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrüss, Aurélie10aCotoneaster sp.

The clinical signs were dyspnea, with congested mucous membranes, chewing, recumbency, and opisthotonos. Several hours after ingestion of the plant, the llama died, despite treatment with sodium thiosulfate and nitrite. Necropsy revealed approximately 676 g of leaves and fruit of Cotoneaster in the first compartment of the stomach. The blood was light red and did not clot. Because Cotoneaster sp. contains low concentrations of cyanogenic glycosides, toxicosis occurs only following massive ingestion of plant material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotoneaster 3aphytotoxins 3aetiology 3acyanogenic glycosides 3adrug therapy 3anatural toxicants 3adisease course 3aLama 3aanticoagulant activity 3acase studies 3adisease severity 3allamas 3adietary exposure 3adyspnea 3apoisonous plants 3apoisoning 3aleaves 2aAnimals 2aAntidotesxtherapeutic use 2aCamelids, New World 2aDyspneaxetiologyxveterinary. 2aFatal Outcome 2aPoisoningxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aRosaceaexpoisoning 2aSodium Nitritextherapeutic use 2aThiosulfatesxtherapeutic use 0atoxic substances 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aPriymenko, Nathalie0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 21, no. 2 p.247-249dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638709021002133Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02803naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245012400194300001600318520101300334592002801347650001701375650002001392650001501412650000901427650001101436650000901447650001401456650001301470650001101483650000901494650001001503650001201513650004601525650000901571650004601580650000901626650002001635650001101655650004501666650003301711650002301744650003901767650003101806653001301837653002201850653001701872653001801889653002401907700001201931700001901943700001601962700002301978773012802001856005102129852000902180655001202189IND50076474520221117232305.0140410e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007647452DNAL7 a229385752pmid7 a10.1080/03601234.2012.7065482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyk, Melinda Bigelow10aFate and distribution of fipronil on companion animals and in their indoor residences following spot-on flea treatments  ap. 913-924.  aUse of fipronil {5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile CAS 120068–37-3} topical pet products on dogs and cats introduces low level residues into residences.

We hypothesized that treatment of lignin with Lewis acids would increase the concentration of hydroxyl groups available to react with diisocyanate monomers. Under the conditions used, hydrogen bromide-catalyzed modification resulted in a 28% increase in hydroxyl group content. Associated increases in hydrophilicity of solvent-cast thin films were also recorded as evidenced by decreases in water contact angle. Polyurethanes were then prepared by first preparing a prepolymer based on mixtures of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and unmodified or modified lignin, then polymerization was completed through addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in mass ratios of TDI:lignin:PEG of 43:17:40 in the compositions investigated here. The mixture of TDI and unmodified lignin resulted in a lignin powder at the bottom of the liquid, suggesting it did not react directly with TDI. However, a homogeneous solution resulted when TDI and the hydrogen bromide-treated lignin were mixed, suggesting demethylation indeed increased reactivity and resulted in better integration of lignin into the urethane network. Significant improvements in mechanical properties of modified lignin polyurethanes were observed, with a 6.5-fold increase in modulus, which were attributed to better integration of the modified lignin into the covalent polymer network due to the higher concentration of hydroxyl groups. This research indicates that chemical modification strategies can lead to significant improvements in the properties of lignin-based polymeric materials using a higher fraction of an inexpensive lignin monomer from renewable resources and a lower fraction an expensive, petroleum-derived isocyanate monomer to achieve the required material properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacid treatment 3acontact angle 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3alignin 3amechanical properties 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3arenewable resources 3aurethane 0arenewable resources 0alignin 0aLewis acid 0apolyurethane1 aWashburn, Newell R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 June 27, v. 4, no. 6 p.2840-2846dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam300425x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006200162300001600224500001100240500001500251520232700266592002802593650001202621650002102633650002202654650001202676650001002688650001302698650001402711650001002725650001302735650001802748650001202766650001302778650002202791650001002813650001902823650001502842650001602857650001002873650001002883650002102893650001202914650001802926653001102944773011002955856007303065852000903138655001203147IND60557935720221122084438.0161103e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055793572DNAL7 a10.1890/09-1988.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkhardt, Juergen10aHygroscopic particles on leaves: nutrients or desiccants?  ap. 369-399.  aREVIEW  a2019-12-06  aAerosols have always been part of the atmosphere, and plant surfaces are a major aerosol sink. Given the nutrient content of aerosols and the natural stability of aerosol concentrations over evolutionary time, plants may have developed adaptations to aerosol input. Although little is known about such adaptations, leaf surface micro‐roughness appears to play a key role. This review focuses on the deposition and fate of fine aerosols that are less than 2.5 μm in diameter. Most of these aerosols are hygroscopic, and they are often deliquescent (liquid) on transpiring leaves. Such concentrated solutions may be taken up by both the cuticle and stomata, contradicting previous concepts. The establishment of a continuous liquid water connection along stomatal walls affects individual stomata and is a new concept called “hydraulic activation of stomata” (HAS). HAS enables the efficient bidirectional transport of water and solutes between the leaf interior and leaf surface and makes stomatal transpiration partly independent of stomatal aperture. The response of plants to changes in humidity can be explained by the split transpiration in an HAS pore and its interaction with neighboring stomata, i.e., as an emergent property of a stomatal patch. Normally, HAS affects only a few stomata, but if too many are activated by excessive particle accumulation or additional surfactants, hygroscopic particles may work as “desiccants,” reducing the drought tolerance of plants. This is made use of when hygroscopic salts and acids are sprayed to kill potato vine, but may cause problems in foliar fertilization. Excessive particle accumulation may also be caused by air pollution. It is hypothesized that deliquescent hygroscopic particles, due to their amorphous appearance, may have been misinterpreted as “degraded waxes.” Degraded waxes have been highly correlated to leaf loss, decreased drought tolerance, and decreased frost tolerance of trees. No sound explanation for degraded waxes has been found, and they have been interpreted as symptoms of forest decline. Because hygroscopic particles may affect the drought tolerance of trees, they could be drivers of regional tree die‐off and especially affect those trees that have adapted to capture aerosols. Several research questions are identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3adie-off 3anutrient content 3adrought tolerance 3aliquids 3atrees 3apotatoes 3anutrients 3aacids 3aaerosols 3atranspiration 3asolutes 3ahumidity 3astomatal movement 3avines 3aforest decline 3adesiccants 3asurfactants 3awaxes 3asalts 3afrost resistance 3astomata 3aair pollution 0aleaves0 tEcological monographs.g2010 Aug., v. 80, no. 3 p.369-399dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1988.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245010500184300001600289500001500305520036700320592002800687650001200715650002100727650001300748650001400761650002400775650003100799650001100830650002000841650001500861650001400876650000900890650001300899650001000912650001700922650001800939650002200957650001200979650004600991650001801037650005701055650003701112650007101149650005901220650000901279650001201288650005901300653001101359653001801370653001501388653001101403653001401414653001501428653001401443653004401457700001801501700001901519773013201538852000901670856008301679655001201762IND4419399420221120082959.0181016e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441939942DNAL7 a192865092pmid7 a10.1177/1040638709021002152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, Scott D.10aSpinal Lymphoma and Pulmonary Filariasis in a Pet Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus Cuniculus Domesticus)  ap. 253-256.  a2019-12-04  aSpinal lymphoma and concurrent pulmonary filariasis are reported in a pet rabbit.

L.10aHeat Treatments Modify the Tribological Properties of Nickel Boron Coatings  ap. 3069-3076.  aThe effects of annealing temperature on the tribological properties of electroless nickel–boron coatings have been investigated. The coatings were annealed in a tube furnace under a flow (0.0094 N m³/min) of oxygen gas at temperatures of 250, 400, 550, and 700 °C for 3 h. Using scanning electron microscopy, images of the annealed coatings documented changes in surface morphology. From this it was seen that the higher annealing temperatures produced marked changes, moving from the nodular structure of nickel–boron coatings to a flaked surface morphology. The chemical effect of the annealing temperature was studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The XPS data indicated that after annealing at the temperatures of 550 and 700 °C, an accumulation of boron oxide species could be seen at the surface as well as a complete loss of nickel signal. An analysis of Raman spectra collected across the surface further identified the predominant species to be boric acid. The tribological response of the coatings was studied with a pin-on-disk tribometer with 440C stainless steel balls run against the coatings in ambient air. It was seen that the as received sample and the sample annealed at 250 °C samples exhibited modest friction properties, while the 400 °C sample had increased friction due to wear debris from the ball. The 550 and 700 °C samples showed remarkably low friction coefficients between 0.06 and 0.08, attributable to the presence of boric acid. The wear tracks were analyzed using scanning white light interferometry and from this data wear rates were obtained for the coatings ranging from 10–⁸ to 10–⁷ mm³/Nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aannealing 3aboric acid 3aboron 3acoatings 3afriction 3afurnaces 3aheat treatment 3ainterferometry 3anickel 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3awhite light 0anickel boron 0alow friction coating 0aelectrolessly deposited coating 0alow wear coating 0atribology 0aboric acid1 aNino, Juan C.1 aRiddle, Yancy W.1 aHahn, David W.1 aPerry, Scott S.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 June 27, v. 4, no. 6 p.3069-3076dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam30042973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245005300175300001600228520087000244592002801114650001801142650002701160650001501187650001401202650001301216650001001229650001601239650001101255650001401266650001001280653001601290653001301306653001201319653001301331653001401344653002201358653001001380773010401390856008501494852000901579655001201588IND60519290420221120080253.0160807e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051929042DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2016.11604622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMmojieje, Josephine10aPyroligneous Acid: A Farmer’s Flexible Friend?  ap. 341-351.  aThis article is a review of the findings of key studies into the potential benefits of pyroligneous acid, arising from charcoal production, to the agricultural industry.

The technique has the advantage of analyzing multiple molecules without prior knowledge while maintaining the relation with tissue morphology. Particularly, MALDI-based approaches have been applied to obtain in-depth knowledge of cardiac (dys)function. Here, we discuss the different aspects of the MSI protocols, from sample handling to instrumentation used in cardiovascular research, and critically evaluate these methods. The trend towards structural lipid analysis, identification, and “top-down” protein MSI shows the potential for implementation in (pre)clinical research and complementing the diagnostic tests. Moreover, new insights into disease progression are expected and thereby contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanisms related to cardiovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aLINK programcProvince of Limburg0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomedical research 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease progression 3aimage analysis 3ainstrumentation 3alipids 3amass spectrometry1 aMingels, Alma M.

Interference by pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate at concentrations of 10 and 200 ppm is < 1% of their P content. The precision of the method was satisfactory (the calibration curve has a correlation coefficient > 0.999 and a standard deviation around the regression line of ± 0.06), baseline drift was small, and only small changes in absorbance for the same standards over the course of 6 hours were observed. Analytical results obtained via the automated method for soil extracts and prepared mixtures compare favorably with analyses performed via the original manual method. One of the adaptations described also improves the original manual method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aautomation 3acalibration 3aorthophosphates 3asoil 3astandard deviation 3atripolyphosphates0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1980 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.173-175dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400010037x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010900161300001800270520084400288592002801132650001301160650000901173650001801182650001101200650001801211650001501229650001101244650002001255650001401275653000901289653001101298653001801309653001801327653001801345653003101363700002101394700002201415700002001437700002001457700002501477773012301502856007501625852000901700655001201709IND60527405120221119071946.0160715e20120627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052740512DNAL7 a10.1021/am30044132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarus, Laura

Ionic liquids have advantageous properties for metal nanoparticle synthesis as a result of their low interfacial tension and complexing ability; however, droplet formation of ionic liquids within microfluidic channels in a two-phase system has not yet been attained because of their complex interfacial properties and high viscosities. Here, breakup of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid into droplets in a simple two-phase system has for the first time been achieved and characterized by using a microchannel modified with a thin film fluoropolymer. This microfluidic/ionic liquid droplet system was used to produce small, spherical gold (4.28 ± 0.84 nm) and silver (3.73 ± 0.77 nm) nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3agold 3aionic liquids 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 0agold 0asilver 0ananoparticles 0aionic liquids 0amicrofluidics 0avapor-phase polymerization1 aRiche, Carson T.1 aMarin, Brandon

Two organic solvents, acetone and acetonitrile, were evaluated as extraction solvents. In both cases, the amount of extract was enhanced with increasing extraction temperature. The extracts obtained using acetonitrile were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after a cleanup process based on the analytical method for the Japanese Positive List System for Agricultural Chemicals Remaining in Foods. The effect of extraction temperature (range: 40– 130°C) on extraction efficiency was evaluated by a recovery study using 21 organophosphorus pesticides and 10 pyrethroid pesticides as target analytes and acetonitrile as the solvent. The results indicated that at 130°C, some organophosphorus pesticides might be degraded, whereas extraction temperatures between 70°C and 100°C were optimal. Next, a prepared sample containing fenitrothion and permethrin was analyzed. Although the sample was not soaked in water prior to analysis, PLE provided analytical results comparable to those obtained by solvent extraction with homogenization. Therefore, PLE is considered a simple and alternative technique for the extraction of organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3aagrochemicals 3afenitrothion 3afoods 3agas chromatography 3ahomogenization 3amass spectrometry 3apermethrin 3apyrethrins 3asolvents 3asoybeans 3atemperature 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aLiquid-Liquid Extractionxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPesticidesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPressure 2aPyrethrinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 0aPressurized liquid extraction 0apesticide residue analysis 0aorganophosphorus pesticides 0apyrethroid pesticides 0asoybean 0agas chromatography/mass spectrometry1 aAoyagi, Yoshie1 aOtake, Takamitsu0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 47, no. 10 p.942-948dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.706559  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008600157300001800243520074800261592002801009650001501037650001501052650001901067650001601086650001301102650001801115650001901133650001501152650001501167653001301182653001901195653002201214653001301236653002801249700002001277700001401297700001801311700001201329700001701341773012301358856007501481852000901556655001201565IND60527405220221119071647.0160715e20120627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052740522DNAL7 a10.1021/am300445f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinfeng10aReduced Graphene Oxide/ZnO Composite: Reusable Adsorbent for Pollutant Management  ap. 3084-3090.  aReduced graphene oxide (RGO) coated with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) was synthesized by a self-assembly and in situ photoreduction method, and then their application for removing organic pollutant from water was investigated.

Chitosan was incorporated in this blend in order to improve its antimicrobial property. The incorporation of chitosan to the blended apparel was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Two microorganisms were used to create individual bacterial medium; one is the gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and the other is the gram-negative Escherichia coli. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were carried out to evaluate antimicrobial property of chitosan, where the results appeared in favour of chitosan’s significant efficacy as an antimicrobial agent against both before-mentioned microorganisms.

Cellulases are a family of enzymes which can effectively hydrolyze the biomass polysaccharides at mild conditions. Cellulolytic fungi belonging to the genera Trichoderma and Aspergillus are the most commonly source of commercial cellulases used so far. More recently, Talaromyces cellulolyticus was also scored as a promising cellulases producer. In comparison to the Trichoderma and Aspergillus systems, Talaromyces enzymes have been less investigated. The present research dealt with the conversion of steam-pretreated corn stover by commercial blend of T. cellulolyticus enzymes with respect to the common blends. The paper also investigated the stability of the enzyme preparation and tested the use of additives (namely Tween 80, Tween 20, and BSA) to improve the enzymes performances and the hydrolysis efficiency. The results indicated that, at the same process conditions, T. cellulolyticus cellulases were more effective and yielded 20% more sugars compared to control blends. Furthermore, the cellulase components displayed a synergistic interaction with hemicellulases. The results indicate that cellulases from T. cellulolyticus are less affected by the high dry matter consistency and the use of additives could increase the total activity by around 50% and β-glucosidase capacity by 10–15%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aTalaromyces pinophilus 3aTrichoderma 3aadditives 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiobased products 3abiomass 3acorn stover 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3apolysorbates 3asugars 3asynergism1 aMastrolitti, Silvio1 aDe Bari, Isabella0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2019 July, v. 188, no. 3 p.690-705dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-02946-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015400166300001600320520180100336592002802137650002102165650001302186650002702199650001502226650002302241650001602264650001402280650001402294650001402308650001002322650004202332650002502374650001202399650001002411650001302421651001302434700001602447700001602463700001902479773013702498856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60516172220221121061833.0190731e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051617222DNAL7 a10.1017/S09592709140004832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMURN, CAMPBELL10aPopulation and spatial breeding dynamics of a Critically Endangered Oriental White-backed Vulture Gyps bengalensis colony in Sindh Province, Pakistan  ap. 415-425.  aThe Critically Endangered Oriental White-backed Vulture Gyps bengalensis has declined across most of its range by over 95% since the mid-1990s. The primary cause of the decline and an ongoing threat is the ingestion by vultures of livestock carcasses containing residues of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, principally diclofenac. Recent surveys in Pakistan during 2010 and 2011 revealed very few vultures or nests, particularly of White-backed Vultures. From 2011 in the Tharparkar District of Sindh Province we monitored a colony of Oriental White-backed Vultures. Between 2011 and 2014 the number of active nests in this colony increased from 11 to 34 while nest density decreased from 13.7 to 9.2 nests km⁻², suggesting that the colony is expanding. We conclude that the rate of increase is being subsidised by immigration, as the population demographics do not support the observed rate of increase in nests. We present the first analysis of spatial breeding dynamics for the Oriental White-backed Vulture and describe how a clustered pattern of nest trees in colonies supports a highly clustered pattern of nests. The spatial pattern of nests relies on both the distribution of trees and the ability of trees to support more than one nest. These results highlight that the preservation of larger nest trees and the sustainable management of timber resources are essential components for the conservation management of this species. We emphasise the high importance of this colony and a nearby Long-billed Vulture Gyps indicus colony in this area of Pakistan. Recommended conservation management actions include the continuation of a Vulture Safe Zone established in 2012, measuring breeding success, assessing dispersal and determining the impact of mortality on these populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyps bengalensis 3abreeding 3ademographic statistics 3adiclofenac 3aendangered species 3aimmigration 3aingestion 3alivestock 3amortality 3anests 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3areproductive success 3asurveys 3atrees 3avultures 3aPakistan1 aSAEED, UZMA1 aKhan, Uzma,1 aIqbal, Shahid,0 tBird conservation international.g2015 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.415-425dCambridge University PresswJournal:J000000056x1474-00017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09592709140004833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013600158300002000294500001900314520109100333592002801424650002601452650002201478650001001500650002501510650001901535650001901554650001501573650001701588650001301605700001801618700001701636773012401653856007401777852000901851655001201860IND60693753720221120112624.0200508e20200507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069375372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra02396e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Haijuan10aFacile synthesis of a direct Z-scheme BiOCl–phosphotungstic acid heterojunction for the improved photodegradation of tetracycline  ap. 17369-17376.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe fabrication of a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst can effectively modulate the electron transfer and separation of photoinduced charge carriers to enhance photocatalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate a direct Z-scheme BiOCl–phosphotungstic acid (BiOCl–HPW) heterojunction, fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, as a highly active and stable photocatalyst for the photodegradation of tetracycline. BiOCl–HPWs result in a dramatic improvement in visible-light utilization and photogenerated e⁻ and h⁺ separation, as well as a decrease in the electrical resistance by the addition of HPW. Notably, the BiOCl–HPW heterojunction with optimized phosphotungstic acid (HPW) content achieved an outstanding photodegradation rate of tetracycline (0.0195 min⁻¹). A reasonable Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism based on the analysis of band structure and monitoring of active radicals is proposed. This study highlights the potential implications of the BiOCl–HPW heterojunctions in the photodegradation of other toxic chemicals and photocatalytic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectron transfer 3alight 3aphosphotungstic acid 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3atetracycline 3atoxicity1 aShi, Bingfang1 aZhao, Shulin0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 07, v. 10, no. 29 p.17369-17376dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra02396e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245012500202300001800327500001900345520131700364592002801681650001301709650002401722650001101746650002201757650001101779650001301790650001101803700006001814700006301874700006301937700006002000773014702060856007702207852000902284655001202293IND60736294220210615000000.0210520e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073629422DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c024632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueen, Joshua D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-417X12aA Monomeric Aluminum Imide (Iminoalane) with Al–N Triple-Bonding: Bonding Analysis and Dispersion Energy Stabilization  ap. 6351-6356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe reaction of :AlArⁱᴾʳ⁸ (Arⁱᴾʳ⁸ = C₆H-2,6-(C₆H₂-2,4,6-ⁱPr₃)₂-3,5-ⁱPr₂) with Arᴹᵉ⁶N₃ (Arᴹᵉ⁶ = C₆H₃-2,6-(C₆H₂-2,4,6-Me₃)₂) in hexanes at ambient temperature gave the aluminum imide Arⁱᴾʳ⁸AlNArᴹᵉ⁶ (1). Its crystal structure displayed short Al–N distances of 1.625(4) and 1.628(3) Å with linear (C–Al–N–C = 180°) or almost linear (C–Al–N = 172.4(2)°; Al–N–C = 172.5(3)°) geometries. DFT calculations confirm linear geometry with an Al–N distance of 1.635 Å.

Dispersion accounts for −89 kJ mol–¹, which is similar in strength to one Al–N π-interaction. The electronic spectrum has an intense transition at 290 nm which tails into the visible region. In the IR spectrum, the Al–N stretching band is calculated to appear at ca. 1100 cm–¹.

Model stability is estimated performing multiple model fitting runs using half of the data for model training and the other half for evaluation. Correlation coefficient, mean absolute error and mean squared error are used to evaluate model performance. UniChill (a model using sigmoidal development rate and temperature relationship and taking into account the necessity for dormancy release) and DDcos (a simple degree-day model considering the diurnal temperature fluctuations) are found to be the best models for describing the considered spring phases. A strong collinearity between base temperature and required heat sum is found for several model fitting runs of the simple degree-day based models. Large variation of the model parameters between different model fitting runs in case of more complex models indicates similar collinearity and over-parameterization of these models. It is suggested that model performance can be improved by incorporating the resolved daily temperature fluctuations of the DDcos model into the framework of the more complex models (e.g. UniChill).

Rupr.) are reported. Three sample plots were laid out in the larch ledum–cowberry–green moss forest on the northwest facing slope (8°–10°) in close proximity to each other; they differed in the proportions of area occupied by the principal components of a moss–lichen cover (Aulacomnium turgidum, Pleurozium schreberi, Cladonia rangiferina, and Hylocomium splendens), spatial distribution, and thermal properties of seasonally thawed soil layers. The worst thermal soil properties under the current climatic conditions have determined the comparatively low radial growth of trees in the sampling area, reduced response to air-temperature variations in the period of preseason cambium activity and at the beginning of the radial growth period, and heightened the response to this factor at the end of a season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladonia rangiferina 3aHylocomium splendens 3aLarix gmelinii 3aPleurozium schreberi 3aair temperature 3acambium 3aclimatic factors 3aforests 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3asoil thermal properties 3ataiga 3athermal properties 3atrees1 aZyryanova, O.

A series of double mutant analyses showed potentiation of callose deposition and the heightened disease resistance phenotype in ocp3 plants required the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and the PMR4 gene encoding a callose synthase. This finding was congruent with an observation that ocp3 plants exhibited increased ABA accumulation, and ABA was rapidly synthesized following fungal infection in wild‐type plants. Furthermore, we determined that potentiation of callose deposition in ocp3 plants, including enhanced disease resistance, also required jasmonic acid (JA) recognition though a COI1 receptor, however JA was not required for basal callose deposition following fungal infection. In addition, potentiation of callose deposition in ocp3 plants appeared to follow a different mechanism than that proposed for callose β‐amino‐butyric acid (BABA)‐induced resistance and priming, because ocp3 plants responded to BABA‐induced priming for callose deposition and induced resistance of a magnitude similar to that observed in wild‐type plants. Our results point to a model in which OCP3 represents a specific control point for callose deposition regulated by JA yet ultimately requiring ABA. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of callose deposition regulation in response to pathogen attack; however the complexities of the processes remain poorly understood.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,3-beta-glucan synthase 3aArabidopsis 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aabscisic acid 3acallose 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3ainduced resistance 3ajasmonic acid 3amutants 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAminobutyratesxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aBotrytisxphysiology 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDisease Resistance 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGlucansxmetabolism 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aRamírez, Vicente1 aFlors, Victor1 aVera, Pablo0 tplant journal.g2011 Sept., v. 67, no. 5 p.783-794dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04633.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012900155300002000284520064500304592002800949650001900977650001300996650001801009650001301027700001501040700001501055700001301070773013501083856007501218852000901293655001201302IND60758978520221119224128.0211204e20211203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075897852DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc05565h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Meihui10aEnzymatic noncovalent synthesis of peptide assemblies generates multimolecular crowding in cells for biomedical applications  ap. 12870-12879.  aEnzymatic noncovalent synthesis enables the spatiotemporal control of multimolecular crowding in cells, thus offering a unique opportunity for modulating cellular functions.

The resolution of the images obtained by means of the X-ray microtomography experimental setup associated to the capabilities of an in-house developed image processing software allowed the reconstruction of the trajectories of almost all filaments within different yarn specimens. Various structural information are derived from these trajectories, dealing in particular with the orientation of individual segments of filaments with respect either to the ply trajectory or to the yarn axis. Compared to orientation distributions provided by different analytical models available in the literature, those resulting from reconstructed trajectories show similar global trends, while providing more details in peripheral regions and regions close to contact zones between plies. Maps of radial and spatial distributions of orientations provide a comprehensive representation of how filaments are oriented within the plies, which gives valuable insight into the inner structural arrangement of fibers which is one of the sources of nonlinearities in the mechanical behavior of filament yarns.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afabrics 3amechanical properties 3amicro-computed tomography 0aYarn 0afiber 0aorientation distribution 0astatistical properties 0aX-ray microcomputed tomography1 aAdrien, Jérôme1 aDurville, Damien1 aMaire, Eric0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2020 May 3, v. 111, no. 5 p.646-659dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2019.16594713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001600268520068200284592002800966650001700994650001101011650001001022650000901032650001401041650001001055650001001065650001101075650001701086650002001103650002101123650001401144700001801158700001801176700001801194700001901212700001901231773011901250856008101369852000901450655001201459IND60647324220221120084402.0190618e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064732422DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829190201112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlov, D.

It has been revealed that the concentrations of the studied hormones in the blood of juvenile specimens and mature male brown trout from the Alats-oya River (Lake Ladoga basin) are significantly lower than in the blood of fish from the Orzega and Shoksha rivers (Lake Onega basin). It is shown that the concentrations of thyroid hormones in the blood of brown trout change insignificantly with age. On the contrary, the level of sex-steroid hormones increases significantly by the beginning of sexual maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3abasins 3ablood 3afish 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3amales 3arivers 3asex hormones 3asexual maturity 3athyroid hormones 3athyroxine1 aGanzha, E.

It is therefore important to understand factors that govern the deployment of selective attention over the visual field. Both location and feature-specific mechanisms of attention have been identified and their modulatory effects can interact at a neural level (Treue and Martinez-Trujillo, 1999). The effects of spatial parameters on feature-based attentional modulation were examined for the feature dimensions of orientation, motion and color using three divided-attention tasks. Subjects performed concurrent discriminations of two briefly presented targets (Gabor patches) to the left and right of a central fixation point at eccentricities of ± 2 . 5 ◦ , 5 ◦ , 10 ◦ and 15 ◦ in the horizontal plane. Gabors were size-scaled to maintain consistent single-task performance across eccentricities. For all feature dimensions, the data show a linear increase in the attentional effects with target separation. In a control experiment, Gabors were presented on an isoeccentric viewing arc at 10 ◦ and 15 ◦ at the closest spatial separation (± 2 . 5 ◦) of the main experiment. Under these conditions, the effects of feature-based attentional effects were largely eliminated. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that feature- based attention prioritizes the processing of attended features. Feature-based attentional mechanisms may have helped direct the attentional focus to the appropriate target locations at greater separations, whereas similar assistance may not have been necessary at closer target spacings. The results of the present study specify conditions under which dual-task performance benefits from sharing similar target features and may therefore help elucidate the processes by which feature-based attention operates.

The highly reactive facets can impact not only the CO₂ reduction but also the TiO₂ modification. Herein, atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma, a green method with no environmentally hazardous reducing agents, was developed to achieve the self-doping of a TiO₂ single crystal film with exposed highly reactive facets. This method combines the advantages of the special facets and crystal defects. The characterization results indicate that the DBD cold plasma method achieves the modification of the TiO₂ film. The samples show remarkable improvement in reducing CO₂ and H₂O to CO and CH₄ under simulated solar light, with yields reaching 0.075 micromol per m² and 0.015 micromol per m², respectively. The formation mechanisms of the method for TiO₂ modification and CO₂ reduction are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acold 3aengineering 3agreen chemistry 3alighting 3amethane 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3areducing agents 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Xiya1 aDong, Peimei1 aHuang, Zhengfeng1 aNie, Xiaoxiao1 aZhang, Xiwen0 tGreen chemistry.g2018 May 8, v. 20, no. 9 p.2084-2090dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7gc02963b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111024002000148040001800168072000900186072000900195100001400204245012000218300001800338500002400356520114800380650002501528650001901553650001701572650002601589650001101615650002701626650001601653650001301669650003401682650003001716650001501746650001701761650001201778650002301790650001901813650002601832650002201858650002301880650001601903650001701919773012601936852000902062856008702071856011102158930003302269945002502302946001302327961001302340655001202353IND4376990520221121184949.0060105e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699052DNAL7 a165391112pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-98.6.18992doi7 a10113/15702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aQ1151 aLiu, Y.B.10aUltralow oxygen treatment for postharvest control of Nasonovia ribisnigri (Homoptera: Aphididae) on iceberg lettuce  ap. 1899-1904.  aIncludes references  aThe aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosley) is a common pest of lettuce in the United States. It hinders export of U.S. lettuce to the overseas market such as Japan where it is a quarantined pest. Ultralow oxygen treatments were studied for control of the insect on iceberg lettuce. Small-scale ultralow oxygen treatments in plastic jars were conducted at 1, 5, and 10 degrees C for different durations to determine effective treatment against nymphs and alates of N. ribisnigri. At oxygen levels of 0.015-0.025%, N. ribisnigri can be controlled in 3 d at 1 degrees C, 2 d at 5 degrees C, and 1 d at 10 degrees C. Large-scale ultralow oxygen treatments were conducted in bulk container treatment chambers with commercial iceberg lettuce heads for 2 d at 6 degrees C with oxygen levels of 0.015 and 0.025% and for 3 d at 3 degrees C with oxygen level of 0.015%. All treatments achieved complete control of N. ribisnigri. No negative impact on lettuce quality was detected after 2 wk of posttreatment storage. Therefore, the selected treatments have potential to be commercially developed for postharvest control of N. ribisnigri on iceberg lettuce. 3aNasonovia ribisnigri 3ainsect control 3ahead lettuce 3apostharvest treatment 3aoxygen 3achemical concentration 3atemperature 3aduration 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3astored product protection 3aquarantine 3afood quality 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxmetabolism 2aInsect Control 2aLettucexparasitology 2aNymphxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2005 Dec., v.  98, no.  6 p.1899-1904dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-98.6.18993Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/01/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03208naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245006800163300001300231520232900244592002802573653001502601653002002616653001402636653001702650653001702667700001802684700002202702773009302724856008002817852000902897655001202906IND60615605620221122001034.0181011s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061560562DNAL7 a10.1163/187847510X4886032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlais, David10aMultisensory Processing in Review: from Physiology to Behaviour  ap. 3-38.  aSeeing and Perceiving 23 (2010) 3–38 brill.nl/sp Multisensory Processing in Review: from Physiology to Behaviour David Alais 1 , ∗ , Fiona N.

Tremendous advances have been made in a variety of fields from single-unit neural recordings and functional brain imaging through to be- haviour, perception and cognition. These diverse approaches have highlighted how the senses work together to produce a coherent multimodal representation of the external world that enables us to function better by exploiting the redundancies and complementarities provided by multiple sensory modalities. With large numbers of new students and researchers being attracted to multisensory research, and the multi-disciplinary nature of the work, our aim in this review is to provide an overview of multisensory processing that includes all fields in a single review. Our intention is to provide a comprehensive source for those interested in learning about multisensory processes, covering a variety of sensory combinations and methodologies, and tracing the path from single-unit neurophysiology through to perception and cognitive functions such as attention and speech. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 Keywords Multisensory, perception, behaviour, neuroimaging, neurophysiology 1. Introduction The recent decade or so has seen an explosion of research activity in multisensory processing. Prior to this, most sensory work, whether cognitive or neurophysiolog- ical, focused on single modalities independently of the other senses. This reflected the prevailing view of cortical organisation that each modality initially processed in- formation independently, with sensory integration or ‘binding’ occurring at a later stage of processing (Treisman and Gelade, 1980), particularly in later association * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Since differences in community composition often lead to differences in community function, understanding compositional multistability is essential to comprehend the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystems. In community assembly studies, it has long been recognized that the order and timing of species migration and extinction influence structure and function of communities. The study of multistability in ecology has focused on the change in dynamical stability across environmental gradients, and was developed mainly for low‐dimensional systems. As a result, methodologies for studying the compositional stability of empirical multispecies communities are not well developed. Here, we show that models previously used in ecology can be analyzed from a new perspective, the energy landscape, to unveil compositional stability in observational data. To show that our method can be applicable to real‐world ecological communities, we simulated assembly dynamics driven by population‐level processes, and show that results were mostly robust to different simulation assumptions. Our method reliably captured the change in the overall compositional stability of multispecies communities over environmental change, and indicated a small fraction of community compositions that may be channels for transitions between stable states. When applied to murine gut microbiota, our method showed the presence of two alternative states whose relationship changes with age, and suggested mechanisms by which aging affects the compositional stability of the murine gut microbiota. Our method provides a practical tool to study the compositional stability of communities in a changing world, and will facilitate empirical studies that integrate the concept of multistability from different fields.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP20gm1010009cAMED‐CREST  a18H04805cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  a20H03010cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  a20K06820cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  aJP15H05707cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  cCenter of Innovation Program from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)  aJPMJER1902cJST ERATO  cProgram for the Advancement of Research in Core Projects under Keio University’s Longevity Initiative  aJPMJPR1537cJST PRESTO  aJPMJPR16E9cJST PRESTO  cFood Science Institute Foundation  cRIKEN  cTakeda Science Foundation 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aextinction 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3aobservational studies1 aNakaoka, Shinji1 aFukuda, Shinji1 aMasuya, Hiroshi0 tEcological monographs.g2021 Aug., v. 91, no. 3 p.e01469-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.14693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010700157300002000264520035200284592002800636650001900664650001700683650001400700650002300714650001200737650001200749650001600761700001900777700002200796700002200818700001900840700001500859700001800874773013500892856007501027852000901102655001201111IND60758978920221120191810.0211204e20211203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075897892DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc06173a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAman, Michal10aSn,P-coordinated Ru cation: a robust catalyst for aerobic oxidations of benzylamine and benzyl alcohol  ap. 12992-12995.  aA stable ionic κ²Sn,P-coordinated Ru complex shows excellent catalytic activity in aerobic oxidations of benzylamine and benzyl alcohol.

Brazil claims to provide a ‘horizontal’ cooperation (i.e. absence of hierarchical relations) and a capacity building methodology that focus on sharing of its own development experiences. This paper demonstrates how Brazil intends to build capacities of partner countries through its own experiences. Specific attention is given to the ‘transferability’ of those experiences to other countries, which do not necessarily operate in the same context. The object of the analysis is the Centre of Excellence against Hunger (CEAH), an office located in Brasília that aims to develop developing countries’ capacities to combat food insecurity. Conclusions are that, on the one hand, the capacity development approach of the CEAH focuses on facilitating the creation of the political and institutional factors that were crucial for the supposed success of Brazil’s domestic policies, without neglecting the different environmental and institutional contexts. On the other hand, the approach does not yet have answers to addressing the absence of other contextual factors, notably relating to availability of domestic resources and a strong civil society, while its effectiveness in Brazil is jeopardized by the lack of impact studies and fragmentation of the national cooperation framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3afood security 3ahunger 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3aAfrica 3aBrazil1 aBruyn, Tom de,0 tFood security.g2015 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.1153-1164dSpringer Netherlandsx1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-015-0503-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245007800152300002000230500001900250520033700269592002800606650003100634650002400665650002200689650002400711650001300735650001100748700001700759700001400776700001400790700001600804700001900820700001800839700001700857700001700874700001600891773012400907856007401031852000901105655001201114IND60693754420221120121839.0200508e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069375442DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra02778b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhe10a49.25% efficient cyan emissive sulfur dots via a microwave-assisted route  ap. 17266-17269.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyan emissive sulfur dots with a record high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 49.25% have been successfully prepared via a microwave-assisted top-down route.

For the first time, we studied the sustainable aspects in the batchwise dyeing process of electrospun polymeric nanofibers in terms of conserving thermal energy and reducing the wastewater pollution. The nanofibrous mats were prepared using polyurethane (PU) polymer followed by dyeing with disperse dyes by conventional (CN) dyeing method as well as ultrasonic (US)-assisted dyeing method. Potential of savings in thermal energy (1000 kcal), dwell time (40 min) and quantity of disperse dyes (1.5% on the mass of nanofibers) were realized during the US-assisted dyeing method in comparison with the CN dyeing method. Further, total dissolved solids (TDS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) contents of dyeing effluents demonstrated considerable ecological merits of the US dyeing method in terms of 30% reduction in TDS and 46% reduction in COD contents in comparison with the CN dyeing method. Excellent color strength (K/S) (reached 10) of dyed PU nanofibrous mats were achieved by US-assisted dyeing method in comparison with the K/S (reached 6) with CN dyeing method. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV–Vis spectrophotometer and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were also applied during the study for characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3adyeing 3afabrics 3ananofibers 3apolyurethanes 3athermal energy 3aultrasonics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater pollution 0aElectrospun polymeric nanofibers 0acolor strength 0apolyurethane 0adisperse dyes 0abatchwise dyeing 0aultrasonic energy1 aKhatri, Awais1 aJaveed, Alishba1 aKim, Seong Hun0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2020 May 3, v. 111, no. 5 p.723-733dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2019.16610643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013200170300001600302520089300318592002801211650002001239650002301259650001301282650001601295650001401311650001201325650001401337650001001351650001301361650001001374700004401384773011901428856008101547852000901628655001201637IND60647324820221120075146.0190618e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064732482DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829190200812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirdyasheva, A.

Paedomorphic tendencies in the males of Daphnia cucullata Sars are manifested in their similarity to females, and, in males of Daphnia galeata Sars, they are mainly manifested in their similarity to juvenile males of Daphnia longispina (O.

There is therefore a crucial necessity to develop specialized tools for an accurate detection and unbiased interpretability of the genetically determined metabolic signals. Here we introduce and implement a combined chemoinformatic approach for objective and systematic analysis of untargeted ¹H NMR-based metabolic profiles in quantitative genetic contexts. The R/Bioconductor mQTL.NMR package was designed to (i) perform a series of preprocessing steps restoring spectral dependency in collinear NMR data sets to reduce the multiple testing burden, (ii) carry out robust and accurate mQTL mapping in human cohorts as well as in rodent models, (iii) statistically enhance structural assignment of genetically determined metabolites, and (iv) illustrate results with a series of visualization tools. Built-in flexibility and implementation in the powerful R/Bioconductor framework allow key preprocessing steps such as peak alignment, normalization, or dimensionality reduction to be tailored to specific problems. The mQTL.NMR package is freely available with its source code through the Comprehensive R/Bioconductor repository and its own website (http://www.ican-institute.org/tools/). It represents a significant advance to facilitate untargeted metabolomic data processing and quantitative analysis and their genetic mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanimal models 3achromosome mapping 3adata collection 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative trait loci1 aGauguier, Dominique1 aZalloua, Pierre A.1 aNicholson, Jeremy K.,1 aDumas, Marc-Emmanuel1 aCazier, Jean-Baptiste0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Apr. 21, v. 87, no. 8 p.4377-4384dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b001453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009500167300001400262520184800276592002802124650002602152650001102178650001202189650001002201650001902211650001902230650002002249650002402269650001502293650001102308650001302319650002302332650002002355650001102375650002002386650002202406650001202428650001602440650001202456651001702468700002102485773013502506856008202641852000902723655001202732IND60516173020221121030155.0190731e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051617302DNAL7 a10.1017/S09592709140005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEE, ALAN T.

Little is known about population sizes or realised distribution ranges of these six species, but projected range modelling based on occurrence from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) has suggested these species are vulnerable to climate change. We estimate global population sizes for these six endemics based on densities calculated from two intensive biome-wide point count surveys in 2012. We modelled regions of suitable climatic space, from which we established that mean annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest quarter of the year appear to limit Cape Rock-jumper Chaetops frenatus and Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus ranges. Both species have seen an apparent > 30% decrease in range and reporting rates (a proxy for abundance) in the twenty years between SABAP atlas periods (1987–1991 and 2007–ongoing). The Cape Rock-jumper result is unexpected: encounter rates are higher in shorter vegetation, dry slopes and habitats with more recent occurrence of fire – all proxies for proximate causes of climate change on the Fynbos. Although coastal plains are highly transformed, mountain Fynbos is the best protected of all the world’s Mediterranean-climate habitats, with relatively little anthropogenic land transformation. Long term weather datasets from the Fynbos demonstrate significant warming since 1960. We conclude from these lines of evidence that these decreases are consistent with the loss of suitable climate space and inability of these species to adjust physiologically to increasing temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aProtea 3aSerinus 3abirds 3aclimate change 3acoastal plains 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3afynbos 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aweather 3aSouth Africa1 aBarnard, Phoebe,0 tBird conservation international.g2016 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.52-68dCambridge University PresswJournal:J000000056x1474-00017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09592709140005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04072naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009200169300001800261520183500279592002802114596007702142596007702219596007702296596007702373596007702450596007702527596007802604596007702682596007702759650002502836650001402861650002602875650002002901650002102921650001102942650003002953650001002983650001802993650003403011650001303045650001103058650001203069650001403081650001303095700002103108700002303129700002303152700002103175700002103196700006103217773012403278856008303402852000903485655001203494IND60753504820221119162611.0220318e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075350482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-021-01345-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuruya, Tomoyuki12aA plant-specific DYRK kinase DYRKP coordinates cell morphology in Marchantia polymorpha  ap. 1265-1277.  aDual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are activated via the auto-phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in their activation loop during protein translation, and they then phosphorylate serine/threonine residues on substrates. The DYRK family is widely conserved in eukaryotes and is composed of six subgroups. In plant lineages, DYRK homologs are classified into four subgroups, DYRK2s, yet another kinase1s, pre-mRNA processing factor 4 kinases, and DYRKPs. Only the DYRKP subgroup is plant-specific and has been identified in a wide array of plant lineages, including land plants and green algae. It has been suggested that in Arabidopsis thaliana DYRKPs are involved in the regulation of centripetal nuclear positioning induced by dark light conditions. However, the molecular functions, such as kinase activity and the developmental and physiological roles of DYRKPs are poorly understood. Here, we focused on a sole DYRKP ortholog in the model bryophyte, Marchantia polymorpha, MpDYRKP. MpDYRKP has a highly conserved kinase domain located in the C-terminal region and shares common sequence motifs in the N-terminal region with other DYRKP members. To identify the roles of MpDYRKP in M. polymorpha, we generated loss-of-function Mpdyrkp mutants via genome editing. Mpdyrkp mutants exhibited abnormal, shrunken morphologies with less flattening in their vegetative plant bodies, thalli, and male reproductive organs, antheridial receptacles. The surfaces of the thalli in the Mpdyrkp mutants appeared uneven and disordered. Moreover, their epidermal cells were drastically altered to a narrower shape when compared to the wild type. These results suggest that MpDYRKP acts as a morphological regulator, which contributes to orderly tissue morphogenesis via the regulation of cell shape.  aPublisher supplied data  a19K21189cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a20K15813cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a17K07753cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a16H04805cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a25113002cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a19H05672cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a251113009cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a25113001cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology  a19H05675cministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBryophyta 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3acell structures 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amales 3amorphogenesis 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aresearch 3aserine 3athallus 3athreonine 3atyrosine1 aShinkawa, Haruka1 aKajikawa, Masataka1 aNishihama, Ryuichi1 aKohchi, Takayuki1 aFukuzawa, Hideya1 aTsukaya, Hirokazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4430-45380 tJournal of plant research.g2021 Nov., v. 134, no. 6 p.1265-1277dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-021-01345-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245014100178300001800319520196400337592002802301650002602329650002202355650001202377650001702389650002402406650002502430650001802455650001502473650001102488650001902499650004502518650001002563651001602573651002002589651002302609773009402632856008102726852000902807655001202816IND60477863620221120191512.0160106e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047786362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-015-0508-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Timothy Olalekan10aReconciling food and water security objectives of MENA and sub-Saharan Africa: is there a role for large-scale agricultural investments?  ap. 1199-1209.  aThe attainment of food and water security rank high on the agendas of governments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Although the objectives are similar, the underlying drivers, resource endowments and opportunities for achieving them are different. Differences between two regions in natural resource endowment and investment capital stock can, in theory, lead to mutually beneficial trade to achieve desired objectives. Concerns about the recent food crises coupled with the disparity in land and water endowment and investable capital between MENA and SSA have led in recent years to investment in agricultural land in the latter by a number of MENA countries with the aim of producing food. At the same time, many SSA countries seek these investments to infuse capital, technology and know-how into their agricultural sector to improve productivity, food security and rural livelihoods. However, these recent foreign direct agricultural investments have to date performed poorly or have been abandoned without achieving the initial objectives of setting them up. Based on research conducted in selected sub-Saharan countries, this paper analyses the reasons for the failure of these investments. It then reviews a few successful agricultural investments by private sector companies with a long history of operation in SSA. Juxtaposing lessons distilled from failed and successful case studies, the paper argues that large-scale agricultural investments that take advantage of this accumulated knowledge are needed and do have a critical role to play. Such investments, when they also incorporate ecosystems management practices and smallholder inclusive business models in their operations, can serve as appropriate instruments to reconcile the food and water security objectives of both the MENA region and SSA, while promoting sustainable intensification of agriculture and improved rural livelihoods in SSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural land 3acapital 3acase studies 3aeconomic investment 3aecosystem management 3afood security 3alivelihood 3amodels 3aprivate sector 3asustainable agricultural intensification 3atrade 3aMiddle East 3aNorthern Africa 3aSub-Saharan Africa0 tFood security.g2015 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.1199-1209dSpringer Netherlandsx1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-015-0508-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011000161300001800271520192400289592002802213650001102241650001602252650002002268650001702288650002502305650002302330650001502353650001702368650001802385650002002403650001302423650002002436650001102456650001502467650001902482700001702501700001602518700002402534700002302558700001802581700001702599700001302616700002102629700001602650700002402666700001602690773012402706856007402830852000902904655001202913IND60618111320221123024516.0181029e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061811132DNAL7 a10.1039/c7gc02989f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoelewijn, S.-F.10aPromising bulk production of a potentially benign bisphenol A replacement from a hardwood lignin platform  ap. 1050-1058.  aA full lignin-to-chemicals valorisation chain – from hardwood over bissyringols to aromatic polyesters (APEs) – is established for renewable 4-n-propylsyringol (PS), the main product from catalytic hydrogenolysis of (native) hardwood lignin. To do so, reagent-grade PS was produced from birch wood via reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) and isolated in 34 wt% yield on lignin basis. Additional early-stage theoretical calculations, based on both relative volatility (α) and distillation resistance (Ω) as well as Aspen Plus® simulations, predict that the isolation of PS by means of distillation is economically feasible at industrial scales ($85–95 per ton of propylphenolics at 200–400 kt a⁻¹ scale). Subsequent stoichiometric acid-catalysed condensation with formaldehyde unveils a remarkably high 92 wt% selectivity towards the dimer 3,3′-methylenebis(4-n-propylsyringol) (m,m′-BSF-4P), which is isolated in >99% purity by facile single-step crystallisation. The striking dimer selectivity is ascribed to the synergetic interplay between the activating methoxy groups and the oligomerisation-inhibiting propyl chain. Next, an in vitro human oestrogen receptor α (hERα) assay was performed to ensure safe(r) chemical design. The bissyringyl scaffold displays reduced potency (∼19–45-times lower affinity than bisphenol A) and lower efficacy (∼36–45% of BPA's maximum activity). Lastly, to assess the functionality of the safe(r) bissyringol scaffold, it was converted into an APE. The APE displays a Mw = 43.0 kDa, Mₙ = 24.4 kDa, Tg = 157 °C and Td,₅% = 345 °C. In short, (i) the feasibility and scalability of the feedstock, (ii) the simplified process conditions, (iii) the reduced in vitro oestrogenicity, and (iv) the functionality towards polymerisation, make this bissyringol a renewable and potentially benign bisphenol replacement, capable for production at bulk scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3abisphenol A 3acrystallization 3adistillation 3aeconomic feasibility 3aestrogen receptors 3afeedstocks 3aformaldehyde 3afractionation 3agreen chemistry 3ahardwood 3ahardwood lignin 3ahumans 3apolyesters 3apolymerization1 aCooreman, C.1 aRenders, T.1 aAndecochea Saiz, C.1 aBosch, S. van den,1 aSchutyser, W.1 aDe Leger, W.1 aSmet, M.1 aVan Puyvelde, P.1 aWitters, H.1 aVan der Bruggen, B.1 aSels, B.

Effects of extraction steps/agents on chemical composition and anticoagulant activity of Fv I–V were examined. Dark brown F. vesca conjugates Fv I–V were recovered in 4.5–8.4% yields, based on dry herb. Isolates were composed of carbohydrate, phenolic and protein components. Fv I–V displayed on HPLC broad molecule-mass distribution patterns with dominance of low molecule-masses 9–14kDa. Their carbohydrate parts revealed high hexuronic acids content (35–60%) while the dominant neutral sugars – galactose, arabinose and rhamnose were found in lower amounts and indicated the presence of rhamnogalacturonans associated with arabinogalactans in all F. vesca preparations. In all Fv I–V isolates high polyphenolic contents were determined, whereas proteins were found in low amounts only. In in vitro experiments on human pooled plasma Fv I–V showed at higher concentrations complete inhibition of plasma clot formation and the most active conjugates in aPTT, PT and TT tests were shown to be Fv I and Fv III, containing the highest amounts of phenolics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria vesca 3aair drying 3aanticoagulant activity 3aarabinogalactans 3aarabinose 3achemical composition 3agalactose 3aglycoconjugates 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aphenolic compounds 3aproteins 3arhamnose 3astrawberries 3ayields 0aFragaria vesca L. 0aMedicinal plant 0aGlycoconjugates 0aAnticoagulant activity 0aFT-IR 0aUV–vis 0aNMR1 aLewik-Tsirigotis, Marta1 aCapek, Peter1 aMatulová, Mária1 aSasinková, Vlasta1 aDąbrowski, Paweł,1 aWitkiewicz, Wojciech1 aGancarz, Roman0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 92, no. 1 p.741-750dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245003300209300001300242506007600255520114900331592002801480506003701508650001301545650002301558650001601581650002101597650001801618650001201636700002201648700002001670773009801690856008101788852000901869655001201878IND60120109820221207104327.0150407e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012010982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-014-0677-42doi7 aPMC43753012pmcid7 a255165002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerauchi, Makoto10aPlasmodesmata of brown algae  ap. 7-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlasmodesmata (PD) are intercellular connections in plants which play roles in various developmental processes. They are also found in brown algae, a group of eukaryotes possessing complex multicellularity, as well as green plants. Recently, we conducted an ultrastructural study of PD in several species of brown algae. PD in brown algae are commonly straight plasma membrane-lined channels with a diameter of 10–20 nm and they lack desmotubule in contrast to green plants. Moreover, branched PD could not be observed in brown algae. In the brown alga, Dictyota dichotoma, PD are produced during cytokinesis through the formation of their precursor structures (pre-plasmodesmata, PPD). Clustering of PD in a structure termed “pit field” was recognized in several species having a complex multicellular thallus structure but not in those having uniseriate filamentous or multiseriate one. The pit fields might control cell-to-cell communication and contribute to the establishment of the complex multicellular thallus. In this review, we discuss fundamental morphological aspects of brown algal PD and present questions that remain open.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDictyota 3acell communication 3acytokinesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3aplasmodesmata 3athallus1 aNagasato, Chikako1 aMotomura, Taizo0 tJournal of plant research.g2015 Jan., v. 128, no. 1 p.7-15dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-014-0677-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016600165300001800331520115200349592002801501596005901529596004301588650001001631650001101641650001001652650002001662650001501682650001401697650001901711650001301730651002101743700002001764700002001784700001801804700001901822700002701841700002601868700001901894700001701913700002001930700002301950700005901973773012402032856008302156852000902239655001202248IND60753504920221119162455.0220318e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075350492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-021-01339-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSata, Haruna10aPhylogeography of the East Asian grassland plant, Viola orientalis (Violaceae), inferred from plastid and nuclear restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data  ap. 1181-1198.  aTo elucidate the origin and migration history of the “Mansen elements,” a group of temperate grassland plants mainly distributed in northeastern Asia, phylogeographic analyses based on chloroplast DNA markers and double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) data were performed on Viola orientalis, one of the representative species of the group. Phylogenetic analyses using ddRAD-seq data revealed that the populations of V. orientalis were clustered into five clades, among which the continental clades made of populations from Russia and Korea diverged more than 100,000 years earlier than the Japanese clades. The Japanese clade likely diverged during the last glacial period, followed by a further post-glacial divergence into the Kyushu and the Honshu subclades. Our study demonstrated that V. orientalis originated in the continental area of northeastern Asia and, during the last glacial period, has spread southward through the Korean Peninsula across the Japanese Islands. This finding supports the previously proposed evolutionary hypothesis regarding the origin and migration routes of the Mansen elements.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP17H03721cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a3037, 3140, & R236cOkayama University 3aJapan 3aRussia 3aViola 3achloroplast DNA 3agrasslands 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aresearch 3aKorean Peninsula1 aShimizu, Midori1 aIwasaki, Takaya1 aIkeda, Hajime1 aSoejima, Akiko1 aKozhevnikov, Andrey E.1 aKozhevnikova, Zoya V.1 aIm, Hyoung-Tak1 aJang, Su-Kil1 aAzuma, Takayuki1 aNagano, Atsushi J.1 aFujii, Noriyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1971-17800 tJournal of plant research.g2021 Nov., v. 134, no. 6 p.1181-1198dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-021-01339-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01300naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012000158300001800278520027500296592002800571650002400599650002000623650002700643650002300670650002400693650002200717650001100739700001800750773013500768856007400903852000900977655001200986IND60659926220221120200602.0190823e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065992622DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc44226h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Younshin10aDirect observation of valence band splitting using room temperature photoluminescence of CdS hollow submicrospheres  ap. 8940-8942.  aThe room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of CdS hollow submicrospheres prepared via employing silica hard templates and microwave irradiation present a profound insight into the quantum confinement-induced splitting of electron and hole states in the valence band.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acadmium sulfide 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3amicrowave radiation 3aphotoluminescence 3asilica1 aJang, Du-Jeon0 tChemical communications.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 49, no. 79 p.8940-8942dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc44226h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011500165300001600280520085700296592002801153650001401181650002101195650002601216650001901242650001701261650001801278650001301296650001601309650001901325653002701344653001701371653002701388653002801415653002001443700001801463700002901481700001301510700001901523700001901542700001801561700001501579773011401594856008601708852000901794655001201803IND60088003020221119235646.0220509e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008800302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.09.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueda, L.10aCellulose nanocrystals/polyurethane nanocomposites. Study from the viewpoint of microphase separated structure  ap. 751-757.  aCellulose nanocrystals (CNC) successfully obtained from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were dispersed in a thermoplastic polyurethane as matrix. Nanocomposites containing 1.5, 5, 10 and 30wt% CNC were prepared by solvent casting procedure and properties of the resulting films were evaluated from the viewpoint of polyurethane microphase separated structure, soft and hard domains. CNC were effectively dispersed in the segmented thermoplastic elastomeric polyurethane (STPUE) matrix due to the favorable matrix–nanocrystals interactions through hydrogen bonding. Cellulose nanocrystals interacted with both soft and hard segments, enhancing stiffness and stability versus temperature of the nanocomposites. Thermal and mechanical properties of STPUE/CNC nanocomposites have been associated to the generated morphologies investigated by AFM images.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3ahydrogen bonding 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apolyurethanes 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermoplastics 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aPolyurethane 0aHard and soft segments 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aCrystallization1 aSaralegui, A.1 aFernández d’Arlas, B.1 aZhou, Q.1 aBerglund, L.A.1 aCorcuera, M.A.1 aMondragon, I.1 aEceiza, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 92, no. 1 p.751-757dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.09.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
