Although dUTP is a normal intermediate in DNA synthesis, its accumulation and misincorporation into DNA is lethal. Importantly, uracil misincorporation is a mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by fluoropyrimidine chemotherapeutic agents including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and elevated expression of dUTPase is negatively correlated with clinical response to 5-FU-therapy. In this study we performed the first functional characterization of the dUTPase promoter and demonstrate a role for E2F-1 and Sp1 in driving dUTPase expression. We establish a direct role for both mutant and wild-type forms of p53 in modulating dUTPase promoter activity. Treatment of HCT116 p53⁺/⁺ cells with the DNA-damaging agent oxaliplatin induced a p53-dependent transcriptional downregulation of dUTPase not observed in the isogenic null cell line. Oxaliplatin treatment induced enrichment of p53 at the dUTPase promoter with a concomitant reduction in Sp1. The suppression of dUTPase by oxaliplatin promoted increased levels of dUTP that was enhanced by subsequent addition of fluoropyrimidines. The novel observation that oxaliplatin downregulates dUTPase expression may provide a mechanistic basis contributing to the synergy observed between 5-FU and oxaliplatin in the clinic. Furthermore, these studies provide the first evidence of a direct transcriptional link between the essential enzyme dUTPase and the tumor suppressor p53.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA replication 3acorrelation 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3afluorouracil 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3atranscription (genetics) 3auracil1 aFazzone, William1 aLaBonte, Melissa J.1 aLenz, Heinz-Josef1 aLadner, Robert D.0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.78-95x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02361naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016400183300001600347520066000363650001801023650001301041650001001054650001701064650001901081650001101100650002301111650002301134650003501157650001201192650002701204650004001231650004001271650004701311650003701358650003901395650003401434650003301468650001901501653001401520653001801534700002301552773014001575852000901715856008501724930003301809946001301842655001201855IND4438460220221117210656.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846022DNAL7 a204497242pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-0020-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoye, John K. 10aEffects of Chlorpyrifos and Aldicarb on Flight Activity and Related Cholinesterase Inhibition in Homing Pigeons, Columba livia: Potential for Migration Effects  ap. 677-681.  aHoming pigeons (Columba livia) were used as a model to assess the effects of chlorpyrifos and aldicarb on flight times at sub-lethal, environmentally relevant concentrations. A significant increase in flight times of birds dosed with aldicarb and with chlorpyrifos was observed. Plasma cholinesterase activity was measured over time following exposure to either compound. The results suggest that the time of peak inhibition would correlate with migratory flight activity after exposure. In total, the results of these studies show that sub-lethal exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides can affect the flying ability of non-target avian species. 3aColumba livia 3aaldicarb 3abirds 3achlorpyrifos 3acholinesterase 3aflight 3amigratory behavior 2aAldicarbxtoxicity 2aAnimal Migrationxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChlorpyrifosxtoxicity 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxtoxicity 2aCholinesterasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aColumbidaexbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aHoming Behaviorxdrug effects 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aToxicity Tests 0aMigration 0aHoming pigeon1 aPritsos, Chris A. 0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.677-681dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0020-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02876naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001200161245014200173300001400315500002400329520087300353650003001226650001401256650001601270650002301286650001101309650003701320650002001357650002401377650007001401650002801471650002101499650005401520650004701574650005201621650001101673650003201684650000901716650007701725650005001802650006201852650004401914650004501958700001402003700001602017700001302033700001802046700001502064700001402079700001802093700001502111773006902126852000902195856008202204655001202286IND4456622420221117210715.0110412s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662242DNAL7 a206076492pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12500762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aMAPKs are not involved in triptolide-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines with different p53 status  ap. 27-31.  aIncludes references  aTriptolide showed excellent antitumor activity against several solid tumors. However, its mechanism has not been fully understood. To further elucidate it, the effects of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) on the activity of triptolide towards prostate cancer cell lines were investigated in the present study using both LNCaP (p53 positive and androgen-dependent) and PC-3 (p53 deficient and androgen-independent) cells. Our results showed that triptolide exerted potent growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects on both cell lines, and the effects were independent of the expression of p53. Although upregulation of ERK and JNK phosphorylation was observed after the triptolide treatment, the results with inhibitors showed that these MAPKs were not involved in the mechanism of triptolide activity in human prostate cancer cell lines with different p53 status. 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprostatic neoplasms 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Alkylatingxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCytostatic Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDiterpenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aEpoxy Compoundsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aMale 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aPhenanthrenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxenzymologyxpathology. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xmetabolism1 aLiu, Yong1 aLi, Xue-Xia1 aYu, Yang1 aWu, Jing-Jing1 aWang, Qing1 aHuo, Hong1 aWang, Liming.1 aYang, Ling0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.27-31x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12500763Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02451naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014400170300001400314500019200328520096000520650001901480650001901499650001401518650002201532650001401554650001401568650001301582650001101595650001601606650002301622650001501645650001001660650001601670650001001686651001201696700001501708700001601723700001501739773014301754856005401897856004501951852000901996655001202005IND60752007520220418000000.0210929e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075200752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1276.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourment, M.10aIs phenological behaviour of Tannat (Vitis vinifera L.) affected by temperature variability in the coastal wine region of Southern Uruguay?  ap. 41-48.  aPaper presented at the XXX International Horticultural Congress IHC2018: International Symposium on Viticulture: Primary Production and Processing held August 12-16, 2018 Istanbul, Turkey  aIn order to understand and enhance grapevine adaptability to climate change, the knowledge of local climatic factors impact on vine behaviour is essential. The aim of this work is to assess the spatial and temporal variability of temperature at meso-scale and its relation with Tannat phenology. Ten temperature sensors were installed in Tannat commercial vineyards in the southern Uruguay wine region. Phenological monitoring was done in 100 bunches per plot across four phenological stages: flowering (FL), fruit set (FS), bunch closure (BC) and veraison (VE). Temperature database of three growing seasons (2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014) was analysed through bioclimatic indices adapted to viticulture. The region showed a high spatial variability of temperature explained by the distance to the La Plata River, as well as its topography. The plots with the highest temperatures had no impact on the precocity of the different phenological stages. 3aVitis vinifera 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aearly development 3afruit set 3aphenology 3aripening 3arivers 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3avines 3aviticulture 3awines 3aUruguay1 aFerrer, M.1 aBarbeau, G.1 aQuenol, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2020 Apr. 15, , no. 1276 p.41-48dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1276.640uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7520075  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245014000183300001400323500002400337520146200361650002301823650001901846650002101865650001701886650002201903650001601925650002601941650000901967650001301976650002901989650002002018650001802038650001602056650001202072650003202084650003502116650006302151650003602214650001602250650006502266650002502331650000902356650002302365650006702388650002202455650001402477700001902491700001902510700002002529700001802549773006902567852000902636856008202645655001202727IND4456622820221117211233.0110412s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662282DNAL7 a206528552pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12501122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodensieck, Antje10aDifferential and stereoselective In vitro cytotoxicity of eremophilane sesquiterpenes of Petasites hybridus rhizomes in rat hepatocytes  ap. 32-39.  aIncludes references  aWe tested two CO2 extracts of Petasites hybridus L. rhizomes, A (rich in furanoeremophilanes) and B (rich in petasins), for in vitro cytotoxicity in rat hepatocytes by means of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (EC50 values of 0.64 mg/mL for A and 0.32 mg/mL for B). Eight eremophilane sesquiterpene lactones (SL) (1-8) and one petasin (9) isolated from A were nontoxic or showed moderate cytotoxicity. The presence and type of the ester side chain most probably control the extent of cytotoxicity of the eremophilanolides. (8R)-2-[(angeloyl)oxy]eremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide (1) damaged the hepatocytes most. The 8α-stereoisomers of both 8-H epimeric couples of the 2-angeloyloxy- and 2-methacroyloxy-esters seem to be more cytotoxic (up to approx. 10-fold) than the corresponding 8β-H stereoisomers. Moreover, the results of the MTT assay depended on the cell density being more pronounced with both 8α-stereoisomers. Further investigations were conducted to study the influence of the stereochemistry on cell respiration, energy metabolism, and membrane integrity [release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] with both couples of the 2-angeloyloxy- and 2-methacroyloxy-esters. In the LDH-leakage assay, (8R)-2-[(methacroyl)oxy]eremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide (2) was the most toxic eremophilane. The stereoselectivity of cell damage of some SL points to a specific, yet unidentified molecular cytotoxicity target. 3aPetasites hybridus 3acarbon dioxide 3acell respiration 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy metabolism 3ahepatocytes 3alactate dehydrogenase 3arats 3arhizomes 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3astereochemistry 3astereoisomers 3atetrazolium 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aCell Respirationxdrug effects 2aCytotoxinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aHepatocytes 2aNaphthalenesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aPetasitesxchemistry 2aRats 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aSesquiterpenesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aTetrazolium Salts 2aThiazoles1 aGaunitz, Frank1 aGebhardt, Rolf1 aDanesch, Ulrich1 aBauer, Rudolf0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.32-39x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12501123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02112naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001600206500011200222500002400334520103800358650002401396650002601420650002501446650001801471650001601489650001201505650001601517650001001533700001501543700001801558773014001576852000901716856004901725655001201774IND4456616320221117211255.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarone, F.10aGrowth, Yield and Fruit Quality of ‘Peluche’ Loquat under Windbreak Nets  ap. 155-159.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aThe advantages of protecting 6-year-old ‘Peluche’ loquat trees (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) with nets were investigated in Sicily. Vegetative and reproductive growth were measured on 20 trees under net protection and 20 in open field conditions. A neutral, 50% windbreak net (yielding 70% of light penetration) was positioned around the field and above trees to cut down wind action and other occasional extreme atmospheric phenomena. Side openings were left on the nets to provide the entrance for pollinators. Compared to trees in the open field, trees under nets showed increased vigor (trunk cross-sectional area) and fruit growth (relative growth rate), and higher yields due also to larger fruit. In addition, fruit from protected trees had an increased flesh thickness (indicating better hydration) and a reduction in russet. The results of this trial indicate that protecting ‘Peluche’ trees with windbreak nets may be a promising technique for improving loquat fruit yields and quality in Mediterranean environments. 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aMediterranean climate 3aasexual reproduction 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3aloquats 3apollinators 3atrees1 aFarina, V.1 aLo Bianco, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.155-159dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_25.htm 7aarticle02744naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245012100198300001600319506007600335520143800411506003701849650002501886650000801911650001701919650001201936650002501948650003301973650002902006650002602035700001702061700002202078773008002100852000902180856007802189930003302267946001102300990002302311655001202334IND4414805420221207115134.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480542DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9002doi7 aPMC26156212pmcid7 a190333612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelzer, Rainer14aThe class E floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 is sufficient to loop DNA in 'floral quartet'-like complexes in vitro  ap. 144-157.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe organs of a eudicot flower are specified by four functional classes, termed class A, B, C and E, of MADS domain transcription factors. The combinatorial formation of tetrameric complexes, so called 'floral quartets', between these classes is widely believed to represent the molecular basis of floral organ identity specification. As constituents of all complexes, the class E floral homeotic proteins are thought to be of critical relevance for the formation of floral quartets. However, experimental support for tetrameric complex formation remains scarce. Here we provide physico-chemical evidence that in vitro homotetramers of the class E floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana bind cooperatively to two sequence elements termed 'CArG boxes' in a phase-dependent manner involving DNA looping. We further show that the N-terminal part of SEPALLATA3 lacking K3, a subdomain of the protein-protein interactions mediating K domain, and the C-terminal domain, is sufficient for protein dimerization, but not for tetramer formation and cooperative DNA binding. We hypothesize that the capacity of class E MADS domain proteins to form tetrameric complexes contributes significantly to the formation of floral quartets. Our findings further suggest that the spacing and phasing of CArG boxes are important parameters in the molecular mechanism by which floral homeotic proteins achieve target gene specificity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3adimerization 3aflowers 3ahomeodomain proteins 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aVerelst, Wim1 aTheissen, Günter0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.144-157x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9003Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03024naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009100126300001600217500011200233500002400345520191500369650002302284650001402307650001502321650002102336650001202357650001102369650001502380650001002395650001702405651001002422700001502432700001702447773014002464852000902604856004902613655001202662IND4456616120221117210644.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHueso, J.J.10aModification of Flowering Dates in ‘Algerie’ Loquat by Means of Deficit Irrigation  ap. 143-148.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aRegulated deficit irrigation prior to bloom makes loquat more profitable by advancing flowering and consequently the next season’s harvesting. To achieve this goal, an irrigation strategy was developed in which watering was completely suppressed during shoot growth (June-July in SE Spain), until the trees accumulated a water stress integral of over 47 MPa day. With the aim of maximizing flowering advancement, the effect of an earlier irrigation restriction was studied. Three deficit irrigation treatments were compared: T1, water cut at the beginning of harvest; T2, water cut at the end of harvest, and T3, irrigation suppressed five weeks after harvest. T1 accumulated a water stress integral of 50.4 MPa between April 7th and June 22nd (76 days). T2 accumulated 57.9 MPa between May 4th and July 13th (70 days). T3 extended from June 8th to August 3rd (56 days), accumulating 57.4 MPa. Water applied throughout the season was 585 mm for T1, 568 mm for T2 and 587 mm for T3, resulting in water savings of around 25 % compared to full irrigation needs (763 mm) in the area. Earlier water withholding modified bloom date and length. T3 trees reached full bloom on October 27th, 10 days before fully irrigated trees located in a nearby plot. Bloom season was short in T3 trees (22 days). T1 advanced full bloom by 18 days compared to T3 trees in a small proportion of shoots, those located at the top of the tree (early bloom), whereas most shoots flowered nine days later than T3 (late bloom). Early and late blooms of T1 were staggered, extending over 40 days. T2 lengthened flowering by 30 days and advanced full bloom by four days in comparison to T3. High flowering intensity was observed under all deficit irrigation treatments, especially in T3 and early flowering of T1. This work has allowed us to determine the best timing for deficit irrigation with a view to maximizing flowering advancement. 3adeficit irrigation 3aflowering 3aharvesting 3airrigation rates 3aloquats 3ashoots 3atree crown 3atrees 3awater stress 3aSpain1 aAlonso, F.1 aGonzalez, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.143-148dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_23.htm 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245016000175300001600335500002400351520177700375650001902152650002702171650003102198650001502229650001502244650001602259650002302275650001302298650003202311650002202343650001002365650001702375650001602392650001302408650001102421650001902432651001502451700002602466700002802492700002702520773009402547852000902641856008502650655001202735IND4456478820221117210653.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445647882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-011-0770-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassaro, Flavia Carmelina10aCerumen of Australian stingless bees (Tetragonula carbonaria): gas chromatography-mass spectrometry fingerprints and potential anti-inflammatory properties  ap. 329-337.  aIncludes references  aCerumen, or propolis, is a mixture of plant resins enriched with bee secretions. In Australia, stingless bees are important pollinators that use cerumen for nest construction and possibly for colony's health. While extensive research attests to the therapeutic properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) propolis, the biological and medicinal properties of Australian stingless bee cerumen are largely unknown. In this study, the chemical and biological properties of polar extracts of cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria in South East Queensland, Australia were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses and in vitro 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cell-free assays. Extracts were tested against comparative (commercial tincture of A. mellifera propolis) and positive controls (Trolox and gallic acid). Distinct GC-MS fingerprints of a mixed diterpenic profile typical of native bee cerumen were obtained with pimaric acid (6.31 ± 0.97%, w/w), isopimaric acid (12.23 ± 3.03%, w/w), and gallic acid (5.79 ± 0.81%, w/w) tentatively identified as useful chemical markers. Characteristic flavonoids and prenylated phenolics found in honeybee propolis were absent. Cerumen extracts from T. carbonaria inhibited activity of 5-LOX, an enzyme known to catalyse production of proinflammatory mediators (IC₅₀ 19.97 ± 2.67 μg/ml, mean ± SEM, n = 4). Extracts had similar potency to Trolox (IC₅₀ 12.78 ± 1.82 μg/ml), but were less potent than honeybee propolis (IC₅₀ 5.90 ± 0.62 μg/ml) or gallic acid (IC₅₀ 5.62 ± 0.35 μg/ml, P < 0.001). These findings warrant further investigation of the ecological and medicinal properties of this stingless bee cerumen, which may herald a commercial potential for the Australian beekeeping industry. 3aApis mellifera 3aTetragonula carbonaria 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapiculture 3aflavonoids 3agallic acid 3agas chromatography 3aindustry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amass spectrometry 3anests 3apimaric acid 3apollinators 3apropolis 3aresins 3astingless bees 3aQueensland1 aBrooks, Peter Richard1 aWallace, Helen Margaret1 aRussell, Fraser Donald0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2011 Apr., v. 98, no. 4 p.329-337dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-011-0770-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02731naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009600164300001600260500002400276520179700300650001902097650001602116650001402132650000902146650001302155650000902168650000902177650000902186700002202195773009402217852000902311856008502320655001202405IND4456478520221117210558.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445647852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-011-0767-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergara, Pablo10aMultiple coloured ornaments in male common kestrels: different mechanisms to convey quality  ap. 289-298.  aIncludes references  aThe simultaneous exhibition of more than one secondary sexual trait is a widespread phenomenon in nature, though it has rarely been explored. It has been proposed that different ornaments may convey complementary or back-up information about a single aspect of individual quality (redundancy hypothesis) or that each ornament may convey unique information (multiple-messages hypothesis). During a 5-year period, we measured several carotenoid-based (eye ring, bill cere and tarsi skin) and melanin-based (head, back, rump and tail feathers) potential ornamental colours in male common kestrels. We analysed whether multiple ornaments can convey different or related information about individual quality. We explored whether different ornaments can express different information depending on the pigment (carotenoids or melanins), the time-scale over which the ornament can change (dynamic vs. static) and the season of the year when the ornament is formed. We found that both melanin- and carotenoid- based traits correlated with indexes of quality, including body condition, body condition of their partners and laying date. However, not all ornaments correlated with the same measures of quality. In addition, some ornaments were intercorrelated within the same individuals while others were not. These results suggest that different ornaments can convey information about different qualities, as predicted by the multiple-messages hypothesis. In addition, this study suggests that the predominant pigment (e.g. carotenoid vs. melanin, eumelanin vs. pheomelanin), the time-scale over which the trait is developed (static feathers vs. dynamic skin) and the season of the year at which the ornament is produced can be potential mechanisms to convey different messages in male common kestrels. 3abody condition 3acarotenoids 3aeumelanin 3aeyes 3afeathers 3ahead 3arump 3atail1 aFargallo, Juan A.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2011 Apr., v. 98, no. 4 p.289-298dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-011-0767-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01919naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001700179245004600196300001600242506007600258520080100334506003701135650002101172650001001193650002001203650001801223650001401241700001901255700001601274700001801290700001401308773008001322852000901402856007801411930003301489946001101522655001201533IND4414806720221207102418.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480672DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9162doi7 aPMC26156222pmcid7 a190429742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra, Genis10aAssessing the gene space in draft genomes  ap. 289-297.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome sequencing projects have been initiated for a wide range of eukaryotes. A few projects have reached completion, but most exist as draft assemblies. As one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. To answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes (CEGs), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. From an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of CEGs mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used N50 length and x-fold coverage values.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3anucleic acids 3aphylogeny1 aBradnam, Keith1 aNing, Zemin1 aKeane, Thomas1 aKorf, Ian0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.289-297x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02233naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012000128300001600248500001500264520106000279650002801339650002301367650000801390650002001398650001401418650001501432650002501447650001501472650001801487651001101505653002401516653002801540653001601568653002801584700002001612700002001632773009301652852000901745930003301754945001301787946001101800655001201811IND2061373920221117210606.0980120e199706  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206137392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrydom, R.C.10aRibosomal DNA sequence comparison of Leptographium lundbergii and L. truncatum and neotypification of L. lundbergii  ap. 295-300.  a2019-12-05  aRecent studies have shown that Leptographium lundbergii and L. truncatum are morphologically similar. This has led to suggestions that the species, which both occur in Europe and are associated with European scolytid bark beetles, might represent a single taxon. Synonymising these two species based on their similar morphology has been resisted in the past. This is primarily due to the fact that L. lundbergii is the type species of the genus and it was felt that such a decision should be based on more intensive study. PCR amplified DNA fragments of isolates of L. lundbergii and L. truncatum from numerous geographic origins were compared on the basis of the DNA sequence from the ITS2 region and part of the 5.8S gene of the rRNA operon. Phylogenetic analyses show that L. lundbergii and L. truncatum isolates group together and separate from the outgroups, L. wingfieldii, Ceratocystis fimbriata and C. albofundus. Based on these data and the morphological similarity of the two species, we conclude that L. truncatum is a synonym of L. lundbergii. 3ainterspecific variation 3asequence alignment 3aDNA 3aOphiostomatales 3aphylogeny 3aScolytidae 3anucleotide sequences 3aprovenance 3achemotaxonomy 3aEurope 0aspecies differences 0aleptographium truncatum 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data1 aWingfield, B.D.1 aWingfield, M.J.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 June, v. 20, no. 2 p.295-300x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle05111naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245011400189300001600303520328400319650001303603650006003616650003803676650005503714650004703769650003903816650005803855650005203913650001103965650002603976650001104002650000904013650004404022650005104066651001004117653002704127653002804154653001704182653002704199700002204226700002504248700002304273700002304296773013604319852000904455856008504464930003304549946001104582655001204593IND4438468920221117210403.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846892DNAL7 a204643832pmid7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0828-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiabrando, Giacomo 10aProfile of atypical-antipsychotics use in patients affected by dementia in the University Hospital of Ferrara  ap. 661-669.  aBackground The use of off-label atypical antipsychotic drugs (AA) has been noted for the treatment of behavior disorders in older patients affected by Alzheimer's or by other forms of dementia, even though effectiveness data are limited and use seems to be associated with severe cerebrovascular risks. The data concerning such risks caused the Italian Ministry of Health to release a statement discouraging doctors from prescribing olanzapine and risperidone outside of the registered indications, in May 2004. This study aimed to analyze the prescriptive profile of AAs in patients with dementia, in terms of the choice of active substance and of the clinical characteristics of the patients. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of dementia and in treatment with AA (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) were selected from three main Alzheimer Evaluation Centers (Geriatrics, Neurology, Internal Medicine) of the University Hospital in Ferrara, in the period 05/2003-04/2006. For each subject, the following information was collected: the frequency of prescriptions, the drug received, and the amount of AAs in the considered period. In the third year of observation, the intensity of treatment was evaluated (intense treatment: >300 tablets of any AA; weak treatment: <300 tablets of any AA or up to three packages of risperidone drops). Such data were analyzed in terms of the type of dementia, the behavioral disturbance, and the possible presence of psychomotor agitation. In addition, the adverse reactions that occurred during the treatment were gathered. Lastly, the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among the selected subjects was described. Results Among the 392 subjects (63% female), Alzheimer's (49%) was the most frequent form of dementia, hallucinations were present in 50% of the cases and aggression in 53%.The statement by the Ministry of Health resulted in a foreseeable increase in the consumption of quetiapine and a parallel decrease in risperidone and olanzapine; subsequently, the distribution among the drugs stabilized to similar percentages. The doses used for the control of behavioral disturbances during dementia were on average much lower than those for treating more severe psychoses. Among the patients followed in the third year of observation (n = 159), the number of subjects in intense treatment was greater than those in weak treatment (60 vs 40%). Olanzapine was the AA most frequently used in intense dosages. Among the patients in weak treatment, about 50% used risperidone, available as oral droplets. In the patients at the Geriatric Center (n = 174), in the initial period of analysis 10 adverse events were observed and out of these 10 subjects, all of whom were under intense treatment , 8 out of 10 took quetiapine. The most frequently observed adverse events were tremors, a typical extrapyramidal symptom. Conclusions As physicians await next studies helping to identify specific classes of drugs for specific symptoms or subpopulations, they should turn to pharmacological treatment only after a careful risk-benefit evaluation. They should consider both the important role of the relationship between patient and carers and the adverse effects of antipsychotics, which are particularly dangerous in the elderly. 3adementia 2aAntipsychotic Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aBehavioral Symptomsxdrug therapy 2aBenzodiazepinesxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxtherapeutic use 2aDementiaxdiagnosisxdrug therapy. 2aDibenzothiazepinesxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aDrug Prescriptionsxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHospitals, University 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPractice Patterns, Physicians'xtrends. 2aRisperidonexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 0aItaly 0aBehavioral disturbance 0aAtypical antipsychotics 0aDrug regimen 0aAdverse drug reactions1 aBianchi, Stefano 1 aPoluzzi, Elisabetta 1 aMontanaro, Nicola 1 aScanavacca, Paola 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2010 July, v. 66, no. 7 p.661-669dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0828-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03946naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245022500191300001600416500001500432520193200447650003202379650002502411650001602436650001802452650001502470650004902485650001002534650002902544650001102573650002202584650001102606650006802617650000902685650002502694650001602719650002402735650005202759650001702811651001202828651002502840651002302865651002702888653003202915653001202947653001502959700002302974700002802997700002103025700002403046773013603070852000903206856008503215930003303300946001103333655001203344IND4438469820221117210314.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846982DNAL7 a203936952pmid7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0816-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFolmann Hempler, Nana 10aDo immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan and Yugoslavia receive adequate medical treatment with beta-blockers and statins after acute myocardial infarction compared with Danish-born residents? A register-based follow-up study  ap. 735-742.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose We undertook a study investigating whether immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan and Yugoslavia received adequate medical treatment with beta-blockers and statins after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) when compared with Danish-born residents and explored whether associations between patient origin and medical treatment were mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Methods This register-based follow-up study consisted of individuals >17 years of age, admitted to hospital with AMI between 2001 and 2005 (n = 25 443). Danish-born residents were compared with immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan and Yugoslavia. Individuals were identified by civil registration number, and data were obtained through linkage to the national registers of hospitalisations and drug prescriptions. Odds of initiating treatment and hazard ratios (HR) of terminating treatment were estimated. Mediators such as income and employment were included in the models. Results Pakistanis were less likely than Danish-born residents to initiate treatment with beta-blockers after AMI [odds ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.80]. Immigrants from Turkey (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07-1.73) and Pakistan (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.21-2.08) were more likely to terminate treatment with beta-blockers before being recommended to do so. Estimates did not change markedly when income and education were included in the models. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that immigrants from Pakistan and Turkey do not receive adequate medical treatment with beta-blockers after a first AMI compared with Danish-born residents. Mediators such as income and employment may not be sufficient indicators of SES when the effect of patient origin on medical treatment is explored. A lower SES of immigrants, communication problems between doctor and patient and doctors' attitudes towards immigrants may explain ethnic differences in medical treatment after AMI. 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3asocioeconomic status 3aimmigration 2aAcute Disease 2aAdolescent 2aAdrenergic beta-Antagonistsxtherapeutic use 2aAdult 2aEmigrants and Immigrants 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitorsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMedication Adherence 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Statistical 2aMyocardial Infarctionxdrug therapyxethnology. 2aSocial Class 0aDenmark 0aPakistanxethnology. 0aTurkeyxethnology. 0aYugoslaviaxethnology. 0aAcute myocardial infarction 0aStatins 0aimmigrants1 aDiderichsen, Finn 1 aLarsen, Finn Breinholt 1 aLadelund, Steen 1 aJørgensen, Torben 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2010 July, v. 66, no. 7 p.735-742dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0816-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03931naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002600186245012500212300001600337520189000353650001202243650001502255650001002270650006102280650004202341650003702383650002702420650001002447650002102457650002202478650001102500650002602511650001102537650004602548650000902594650001602603650001502619650002202634650004802656650004202704653003602746653002002782653001602802700002402818700002402842700002102866700001902887700002002906700002002926700002602946700002402972700002302996773013603019852000903155856008503164930003303249946001103282655001203293IND4438469420221117210323.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846942DNAL7 a203007432pmid7 aPMC28830822pmcid7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0804-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshley, Elizabeth A. 10aComparison of plasma, venous and capillary blood levels of piperaquine in patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria  ap. 705-712.  aPurpose Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is a fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination treatment. Field pharmacokinetic studies would be simplified and facilitated by being able to use small volume capillary assays rather than venous blood. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between piperaquine concentrations measured in capillary blood, venous blood and venous plasma. Methods Samples of plasma, whole blood obtained by venesection and capillary blood were taken simultaneously from patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria treated with DP between 0 and 9 weeks after treatment. Piperaquine concentrations in venous and capillary samples were measured using solid phase extraction and analysis by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Results A total of 161 sets of the three measures were obtained from 54 patients. Piperaquine concentrations in the venous blood samples were approximately twofold higher and those in the capillary blood samples were threefold higher than the corresponding venous plasma concentrations. Capillary blood piperaquine concentrations were approximately 1.7-fold higher than venous blood concentrations, and this difference also increased with time. Conclusion Differences in whole blood and plasma levels of piperaquine suggest compartmentalisation of the drug within blood cells, as also occurs with the structurally related quinoline chloroquine. The relationship between piperaquine concentrations in the venous plasma, venous blood and capillary blood is variable and unpredictable at low concentrations. However, within the range of concentrations usually present in patients between 3 and 21 days after treatment with currently recommended doses, the relationship between capillary and venous whole blood is predictable; consequently, capillary blood sampling can be used in field assessments. 3amalaria 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntimalarialsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxblood. 2aArtemisininsxadministration & dosage 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxmethods 2aCapillariesxchemistry 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDrug Combinations 2aFemale 2aFingersxblood supply 2aHumans 2aMalaria, Falciparumxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhlebotomy 2aPlasmaxchemistry 2aQuinolinesxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 0aArtemisinin combination therapy 0aCapillary blood 0aPiperaquine1 aStepniewska, Kasia 1 aLindegardh, Niklas 1 aAnnerberg, Anna 1 aTarning, Joel 1 aMcGready, Rose 1 aPhaiphun, Lucy 1 aPratap Singhasivanon.1 aWhite, Nicholas J. 1 aNosten, François 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2010 July, v. 66, no. 7 p.705-712dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0804-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03210naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011400123300001500237500014800252500002400400520176700424650001602191650001702207650001002224650001102234650001002245650001002255650001202265650001102277650002202288650001202310650001302322650003402335650002602369650001102395650000902406650001502415650001702430650001502447650001402462650001602476700002202492700001702514773013902531852000902670856004902679655001202728IND4456632520221117210328.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGude, H.10aExtending the Shelf Life of Flower Bulbs and Perennials in Consumer Packages by Modified Atmosphere Packaging  ap. 99-103.  aPaper presented at the Tenth International Symposium on Flower Bulbs and Herbaceous Perennials, held April 20-24, 2008, Lisse, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aThe quality of flower bulbs and herbaceous perennials in consumer packages declines rapidly due to sprouting and drying out. The present study was undertaken to develop Modified Atmosphere Packages (MAP) with suitable filling materials for a prolonged shelf life of different species of flower bulbs (e.g., Lilium, Anemone, Erythronium) and herbaceous perennials (e.g., Hemerocallis, Hosta, Phlox). As filling materials peat moss and Toresa (wood fiber) were tested. So-called continuous MA films were used, i.e., without laser holes, which means that they are virtually impermeable to water. The shelf life of plants and bulbs was tested in packages produced from these films after addition of filling materials with different moisture contents. The shelf life was determined in a climate chamber at 23°C with a high ventilation rate. The same products were packed in traditional packages with microperforation for comparison. The shelf life of bulbs and perennials was extended dramatically from 3 to 4 weeks in the traditional package with microperforation to 2 to 3 months by the use of MA packaging. It was however not the low oxygen level inside the packages that caused this effect but the reduction of water loss by using MA films. In microperforation packages the products dried out completely in 3 to 4 weeks, whereas in the MA packages the products remained turgescent and vital for 2 to 3 months. Sprouting was inhibited by using dry filling materials. The term Modified Humidity Packaging therefore seems to be more appropriate for this type of packaging. To prevent too low oxygen levels inside MA packages it is recommended to use an MA film with a high permeability for oxygen. This also enables the use of one film for a wide range of products. 3aErythronium 3aHemerocallis 3aHosta 3aLilium 3aPhlox 3abulbs 3aclimate 3adrying 3afilling materials 3aflowers 3ahumidity 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxygen 3apeat 3aperennials 3apermeability 3ashelf life 3asprouting 3awood fibers1 aDijkema, M.H.G.E.1 aMiller, C.T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 886 p.99-103dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/886/886_11.htm 7aarticle03060naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006100126300001600187500014800203500002400351520159900375650002501974650002001999650002002019650001002039650001902049650001202068650002002080650001202100650001202112650002202124650001002146650001902156650001002175650001302185650001902198650001302217650001802230650001302248650001602261650002102277650001102298700001802309700001202327700001702339773014002356852000902496856004902505655001202554IND4456632720221117210723.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInamoto, K.10aEvaluation of Freezing Hardiness of Ornamental Geophytes  ap. 105-112.  aPaper presented at the Tenth International Symposium on Flower Bulbs and Herbaceous Perennials, held April 20-24, 2008, Lisse, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aInformation of freezing hardiness of plants is important for landscape planting. Eleven species of ornamental geophytes were planted in pots and were cooled at a constant rate for various periods, and their freezing hardiness was evaluated by calculating the median lethal dose temperature (LT50). We also measured the initiation temperature of the low temperature exotherm (IET) of “bulbs” of geophytes and discuss the possibility of IET as a rapid method to estimate freezing tolerance. In the experiment in January, Agapanthus africanus, Babiana stricta, Canna ‘Butter Cup’, Freesia ‘Elegance’ and Narcissus tazetta were freezing sensitive at LT50 >-3°C and Allium chinense and Muscari armeniacum were resistant with LT50 <-9°C. Liatris spicata was a species markedly resistant to freezing, because all plants survived even when its tubers were at -12°C. The freezing hardiness of Crocus sativus, Lycoris albiflora and Oxialis purpurea were intermediate. The LT50 of Muscari, Lycoris and Liatris decreased by acclimatization from October to December and that of Agapanthus, Canna and Narcissus did not. In a different thermal analysis of 25 geophytes, the initiation of exotherm (IET) was detected by freezing bare bulbs, corms, tubers or rhizomes from 5°C at a rate of -1.6°C h-1. The IETs varied among the species tested but the relationship between the IET and anatomical characteristics or mass of the plants was unclear. Because the correlation between LT50 and IET was not significant, we conclude that IET is not a useful indicator of freezing hardiness of geophytes. 3aAgapanthus africanus 3aAllium chinense 3aBabiana stricta 3aCanna 3aCrocus sativus 3aFreesia 3aLiatris spicata 3aLycoris 3aMuscari 3aNarcissus tazetta 3abulbs 3acold tolerance 3acorms 3afreezing 3alethal dose 50 3aplanting 3arapid methods 3arhizomes 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3atubers1 aMatsubara, K.1 aDoi, M.1 aImanishi, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 886 p.105-112dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/886/886_12.htm 7aarticle02629naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004500128300001600173500014800189500002400337520136900361650001201730650001501742650001701757650001501774650001301789650000901802650001001811650001401821650001201835650001601847650001101863650001201874650001301886650001701899650001601916650001901932650001901951650002701970773014001997852000902137856004902146655001202195IND4456633320221117210658.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleynhans, R.10aPotential New Lines in the Hyacinthaceae  ap. 139-145.  aPaper presented at the Tenth International Symposium on Flower Bulbs and Herbaceous Perennials, held April 20-24, 2008, Lisse, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aGenera from the Hyacinthaceae family have been utilized in breeding programs at the Agricultural Research Council for many years with the aim to develop new products for the international floriculture market. Through conventional breeding, several Lachenalia and Ornithogalum cultivars were released. The Lachenalia breeding program was the only active breeding program during the past 5 years and several potential new lines (comprising of different colour combinations and flower forms) are available for commercial evaluation. Besides conventional breeding, a project on the use of mutation technology has also resulted in the availability of new lines. Members of the Hyacinthaceae are particularly suitable for mutation breeding because two of the positive circumstances for mutation breeding can be combined: vegetative propagation and single cell origin of adventitious buds on leaf tissue. A method combining irradiation and tissue culture was developed to induce mutations in four genera, namely Lachenalia, Ornithogalum, Eucomis and Veltheimia. To date at least four potential new varieties have been identified from three of the four genera. These lines have been initiated in tissue culture for multiplication purposes. When large quantities of material are available, application for Plant Breeders Rights and commercial establishment will take place. 3aEucomis 3aLachenalia 3aOrnithogalum 3aVeltheimia 3abreeding 3abuds 3acolor 3acultivars 3aflowers 3airradiation 3aleaves 3amarkets 3amutation 3anew products 3anew variety 3aplant breeders 3atissue culture 3avegetative propagation0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 886 p.139-145dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/886/886_17.htm 7aarticle02944naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002400161245015100185300001400336500002400350520096700374650002801341650001401369650001601383650001301399650001901412650002101431650002901452650001201481650000901493650001501502650001201517650004501529650002601574650008001600650004401680650000901724650006901733650007101802650006701873650000901940650001701949700003701966700003602003700003602039700001702075700001702092700003202109700003102141700003402172773006902206852000902275856008202284655001202366IND4456631220221117210606.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663122DNAL7 a206484172pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12501162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuca, Davi Matthews14aThe essential oil of Eucalyptus tereticornis and its constituents, α- and β-pinene, show accelerative properties on rat gastrointestinal transit  ap. 57-59.  aIncludes references  aThe essential oil of Eucalyptus tereticornis (EOET) has pharmacological activities but their effects on the gastrointestinal tract are yet unknown. It possesses α- and β-pinene as minor constituents, isomers largely used as food or drink additives. In this work, we studied their actions on gut motility. After feeding with a liquid test meal, conscious rats received perorally EOET, α-, or β-pinene, and the fractional dye retention was determined. EOET and its constituents decreased the gastric retention. In anesthetized rats, pinenes increased gastric tonus, while enhancing the meal progression in the small intestine of conscious rats. Both α- and β-pinene contracted gastric strips in vitro but relaxed the duodenum. Conversely, EOET relaxed both the gastric and duodenal strips. In conclusion, EOET accelerates the gastric emptying of liquid, and part of its action is attributed to the contrasting effects induced by α- and β-pinene on the gut. 3aEucalyptus tereticornis 3aadditives 3abeta-pinene 3aduodenum 3aessential oils 3agastric emptying 3agastrointestinal transit 3aisomers 3arats 3atest meals 2aAnimals 2aBridged Bicyclo Compoundsxpharmacology. 2aEucalyptusxchemistry 2aGastrointestinal Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMonoterpenesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aSilva, Moises Tolentino Bento da1 aPalheta Junior, Raimundo Campos1 aLima, Francisco Jose Batista de1 aOkoba, Willy1 aLahlou, Saad1 aOliveira, Ricardo Brandt de1 aSantos, Armenio Aguiar dos1 aMagalhaes, Pedro Jorge Caldas0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.57-59x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12501163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02103naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002400161245003900185300001400224500002400238520065800262650002700920650003000947650001900977650001300996650002901009650001701038650008101055650002101136650007701157650003001234650001101264650002501275650003901300650007201339700001901411700002201430700002401452700002101476773006901497852000901566856008201575655001201657IND4456630720221117210541.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663072DNAL7 a205601162pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12500552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozzuto, Giuseppina10aTea tree oil might combat melanoma  ap. 54-56.  aIncludes references  aIn this study we present new data from experiments focused on the antitumor activity of tea tree oil (TTO), an essential oil distilled from Melaleuca alternifolia.

Moreover, the survival role of the MDR-marker P-glycoprotein appears to be involved in the mechanism of invasion of melanoma cells. The results reported herein indicate that TTO and its main active component, terpinen-4-ol, can also interfere with the migration and invasion processes of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant melanoma cells. 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aessential oils 3amelanoma 3amultiple drug resistance 3atea tree oil 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCytostatic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use. 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aHumans 2aMelaleucaxchemistry 2aMelanomaxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aTea Tree Oilxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use.1 aColone, Marisa1 aToccacieli, Laura1 aStringaro, Annarita1 aMolinari, Agnese0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.54-56x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12500553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02479naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006900128300001400197500014800211500002400359520122800383650001301611650001301624650001201637650001601649650001101665650001301676650001501689650001401704650002001718650002301738650001401761650001201775650001501787650001201802650001301814700001601827700001901843773013801862852000902000856004802009655001202057IND4456632120221117210513.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445663212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Zongqi,10aImproving Disease Resistance in Caladium: Progress and Prospects  ap. 69-76.  aPaper presented at the Tenth International Symposium on Flower Bulbs and Herbaceous Perennials, held April 20-24, 2008, Lisse, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aOne of the priority objectives in our caladium breeding program has been to develop new cultivars resistant to important fungal or bacterial diseases. Disease-resistant cultivars can serve as valuable tools for disease control and help increase crop yield and quality and reduce economic losses. Resistant cultivars can also help reduce pesticide usage and protect the environment. For the last several years, we have focused our research and breeding efforts on resistance to Fusarium tuber rot, Pythium root rot, and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas leaf spot). Five commercial cultivars were found resistant to Fusarium tuber rot, seven commercial cultivars showed moderate levels of resistance to Pythium root rot, and five commercial cultivars were resistant to bacterial blight. Using these sources of resistance as breeding parents, thousands of progeny have been generated. These progeny have been screened through a multi-stage process for horticultural characteristics and disease resistance. More than 100 elite resistant lines have been obtained and a number of new cultivars have been released. Results indicate good potential to develop new cultivars resistant to all three major diseases in caladium production. 3aCaladium 3aFusarium 3aPythium 3aXanthomonas 3ablight 3abreeding 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3aleaf spot 3aparents 3apesticides 3aprogeny 3aroot rot1 aPeres, N.A.1 aHarbaugh, B.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 886 p.69-76dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/886/886_7.htm 7aarticle01856naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001600197500011200213500002400325520075600349650002401105650002601129650000901155650000901164650001601173650001401189650001401203650001201217650001701229650001201246651002101258700001701279773014001296852000901436856004901445655001201494IND4456628820221117210805.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolat, A.A.14aThe Effect of Winter Cold on Flowering of Various Loquat Cultivars  ap. 321-325.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aA study on the effect of winter cold on flowering of various cultivars of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) was carried out at the Mustafa Kemal University, Agriculture Faculty, Dörtyol Research Station in Hatay, Turkey, in the 2007/2008 season.

A diffusion-based Cu(II) influx and permeability can be calculated using physiological and allometric-related parameters. Simulations indicate that Cu(II) bioconcentration factor of gills was 42. Estimated steady-state Cu(II) gill uptake influx and permeability were 0.097 nmol cm⁻² s⁻¹ and 0.48 cm s⁻¹, respectively. The proposed simple allometric diffusion-based biokinetic model meets the need for describing nonequilibrium aspects of biouptake mechanisms in bivalve gills. 3aCorbicula fluminea 3aallometry 3abioaccumulation factor 3aclams 3acopper 3aenzyme kinetics 3afreshwater 3agills 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apermeability 2aAnimals 2aCopperxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aCorbiculaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDiffusion 2aFresh Water 2aGillsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aTissue Distribution 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 0aFreshwater clam 0aBiouptake 0aCu(II)1 aLin, C.-M. 1 aJu, Y.-R. 1 aLiao, C.-M. 0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.703-707dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0011-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01895naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001600206500011200222500002400334520076100358650002401119650001401143650001401157650001201171650001701183650001001200650001101210700001301221700001501234700001201249700001301261700001201274700001401286700001101300773014001311852000901451856004901460655001201509IND4456627820221117211227.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Q.X.10aStyle Morphology In Situ Pollen Germination and Pollen Tube Growth of Loquat  ap. 275-279.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aStyle characteristics, stigma receptivity, in situ pollen germination, and pollen tube growth from styles with different length were studied in ‘Longquan No.5’ and ‘Chuannong No.1’ loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), a line derived from small seeds of ‘Longquan No.5’.

Here, we show that meltwater is extremely important in the Indus basin and important for the Brahmaputra basin, but plays only a modest role for the Ganges, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security.

On lactose alone, Ln. lactis has a growth rate double that of Ln. cremoris and Ln. mesenteroides. The pH is a more critical parameter for Ln. mesenteroides than for Ln. lactis or Ln. cremoris; without pH control Ln. mesenteroides is unable to acidify the medium under pH 4.5, while with pH control and as a consequence of a high Y(ATP) its growth is greater than Ln. lactis and Ln. cremoris. In general, lactose-citrate co-metabolism increases the growth rate, the biomass synthesis, the lactose utilisation ratio, and the production of lactate and acetate from lactose catabolism. The combined effect of the pH and the co-metabolism lactose-citrate on the two components of the proton motive force (deltap = deltapsi - ZdeltapH) has been studied using resting-cell experiments. At neutral pH deltap is nearly entirely due to the deltaphi, whereas at acidic pH the deltapH is the major component. On lactose alone, strains have a different aptitude to regulate their intracellular pH value, for Ln. mesenteroides it drastically decreases at acidic pH values (pH(i) = 5.2 for pH 4), while for Ln. lactis and Ln. cremoris it remains above pH 6. Lactose-citrate co-metabolism allows a better control of pH homeostasis in Ln. mesenteroides, consequently the pH(i) becomes homogeneous between the three strains studied, for pH4 it is in an interval of 0.3 pH unit (from pH(i) = 6.4 to pH(i) = 6.7). In this metabolic state, and as a consequence of the variation in deltapH, and to some extent in the deltaphi, the difference of deltap between the three strains is restricted to an interval of 20 mV. 3alactose 3aenergy metabolism 3apH 3acitric acid 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris 3aLeuconostoc lactis 3amembrane potential 0ametabolism 0aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 0agrowth1 aCachon, R.1 aWache, Y.1 aBelguendouz, T.1 aRiondet, C.1 aDeraedt, A.1 aDivies, C.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1999 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.507-513x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02320naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245016600129300001600295520121300311650002401524650002701548650001301575650001401588650001701602650003001619650001801649650003001667651001201697653002601709700001301735700001501748700002301763773009401786852000901880930003301889945001301922946001101935655001201946IND2204297020221117204001.0000504e199909  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220429702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucheryava, N.10aIsolation and characterization of epiphytic bacteria from the phyllosphere of apple, antagonistic in vitro to Venturia inaequalis, the causal agent of apple scab  ap. 472-478.  aBacteria from the phyllosphere of an apple orchard in North Germany ("Altes Land"), transferred to non-chemical pest management ten years ago, were obtained in June and September 1995. One hundred and fifty epiphytic isolates were tested for inhibition of mycelial growth and conidial germination of Venturia inaequalis, the causal agent of apple scab. Twenty seven epiphytes displayed a distinct antagonistic activity in vitro. However, more than one third of these antagonists induced necrotic lesions on apple seedlings and hypersensitive reaction on tobacco. The other were ranked as to their efficacy. The antagonistic epiphytes were also taxonomically characterized by a polyphasic approach based on polyamine and fatty acid profiles and biochemical reactions. Eighteen Gram-negative strains belong to the genus Pseudomonas and two strains to the genus Erwinia. Six Gram-positive strains were allocated to the genus Bacillus and one to the genus Curtobacterium. Due to their strong inhibition of mycelial growth and conidial germination five strains of P. fluorescens and one strain of B. pumilus which display no plant-deleterious effects are suggested as potential biocontrol agents of V. inaequalis. 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3abacteria 3aepiphytes 3aphyllosphere 3abiological control agents 3achemotaxonomy 3afungal diseases of plants 3aGermany 0abacterial antagonists1 aFiss, M.1 aAuling, G.1 aKroppenstedt, R.M.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1999 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.472-478x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03332naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001600178245012700194300001800321500002400339500001500363520163100378650001602009650002202025650002302047650001102070650002502081650002502106650002802131650001902159650002202178650002102200650002602221650002602247650001702273651001002290653002302300653001502323653002602338700001702364700001502381700001802396700001702414700001402431700001802445773012002463852000902583856009102592930003302683945002502716946001302741655001202754IND4414556220221117203425.0090105e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aP210 0aF1201 aQiu, Guo Yu10aWater use efficiency and evapotranspiration of winter wheat and its response to irrigation regime in the north China plain  ap. 1848-1859.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aImprovement of water use efficiency (WUE) in crops is important for almost all agricultural practices around the world. Numerous studies have addressed WUE on a grain yield basis, but few on a photosynthesis basis and a biomass basis. Based on a 2-year field experiment (2002-2004), we analyzed wheat WUE not only on grain yield basis, but also on photosynthesis basis and biomass basis, and then discussed the effects of irrigation regimes on wheat WUE. We found that: (1) irrigation regimes had considerable effects on wheat transpiration, total evapotranspiration, and canopy temperature; (2) wheat WUE ranged 2.1-3.3μmolCO₂/mmolH₂O on a photosynthesis basis, 1.0-2.6kgm⁻³ and 1.1-2.1kgm⁻³ on a biomass and a grain yield basis, respectively. The maximum WUE appeared during the jointing and the milking stage, when suitable water management could be crucial to improve wheat WUE; (3) it was hypothesized by farmers and local water managers that more water supply over the conventional irrigation regime during the growing season could significantly increase both WUE and grain yield of the winter wheat in the north China plain (NCP). However, our results showed that with the increase of irrigation times and amount of irrigation water per growing season, wheat WUE was generally decreased and grain yield was not increased, although the evapotranspiration was significantly increased. Reduction in irrigation times and amount of irrigation water could be considered for saving water in the NCP; (4) WUE of winter wheat at photosynthesis and biomass levels were positively related with WUE at grain yield level. 3atemperature 3aplant development 3aevapotranspiration 3acanopy 3awater use efficiency 3adevelopmental stages 3adry matter accumulation 3aphotosynthesis 3aTriticum aestivum 3airrigation rates 3afield experimentation 3airrigation scheduling 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0acanopy temperature 0airrigation 0aplant-water relations1 aWang, Liming1 aHe, Xinhua1 aZhang, Xiying1 aChen, Suyan.1 aChen, Jin1 aYang, Yonghui0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Oct., v. 148, no. 11 p.1848-1859dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle04121naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001500169245009000184300001800274500002400292500001500316520253300331650002802864650001902892650001602911650002202927650002302949650001902972650001302991650001103004650001103015650001503026650002203041650001803063650001603081650001403097651001103111653002103122653002703143653002703170653003003197700001403227700001903241700001603260773012003276852000903396856009103405930003303496945002503529946001303554655001203567IND4414556520221117203435.0090105e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aL1001 aBaum, K.A.10aSurface boundary layer of cattle feedlots: Implications for air emissions measurement  ap. 1882-1893.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAir quality issues at cattle feedlots are a growing concern, and micrometeorological techniques have potential for measuring air emissions from these operations. However, eddy covariance and related methods rely on assumptions about the boundary layer that might not hold above the complex, non-uniform, and fetch-limited surface of a feedlot. The objective of this study was to characterize the surface boundary layer of an open-air cattle feedlot to provide insight into how micrometeorological techniques might be applied to these non-ideal sites. An open-path eddy covariance system was used to collect high-frequency time-series data of wind speed, CO₂, and H₂O above a large commercial feedlot in central Kansas in 2006 and 2007. This site, like many High Plains locations, was characterized by windy conditions with daytime average wind speed of 5ms⁻¹, and near-neutral atmospheric stability was common, even at night. Using a modeled displacement height of 0.65m, the roughness length ranged from 2 to 6cm with a median of 3.6cm. Ogives showed no signs of low-frequency transport (i.e. periods> 30min). Eddy covariance measurements of CO₂ fluxes averaged 0.4kgm⁻² d⁻¹ while H₂O fluxes averaged 2.3kgm⁻² d⁻¹, both of which agreed with other studies measuring cattle respiration or water consumption. The tower was located along the north edge of a rectangular-shaped feedlot so the fetch was over 1600m when winds were southerly. However, the length of fetch encompassed by feedlot pens decreased as winds became more southeasterly or southwesterly. Using the sharp contrast in CO₂ fluxes from the pens versus the surrounding fields, the outer edge of the sampling footprint could be determined by observing abrupt changes in CO₂ flux as wind directions shifted to the southeast or southwest. This provided a way to measure the footprint requirement using the respired CO₂ from the cattle as a tracer. Under neutral atmospheric stability the required fetch was about 360m when the sensor height was 6m. The fetch requirements and the source area were predicted with a footprint model. Results showed that, on average, the three pens directly south of the tower contributed 61% of the measured flux. Roads, feeding bunks, and transfer alleys (i.e. surfaces within the footprint other than pens) accounted for 21% of the total area. Thus, accounting for the diluting effect of these spaces in the source area was important when attempting to compute a flux per unit animal or per unit pen area. 3aatmospheric circulation 3aturbulent flow 3aair quality 3asurface roughness 3atemporal variation 3acarbon dioxide 3afeedlots 3acattle 3aheight 3awind speed 3aspatial variation 3agas emissions 3awater vapor 3abreathing 3aKansas 0amicrometeorology 0aeddy covariance method 0asurface boundary layer 0ameteorological parameters1 aHam, J.M.1 aBrunsell, N.A.1 aCoyne, P.I.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Oct., v. 148, no. 11 p.1882-1893dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle02596naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001700157245008500174300001600259500002400275500001500299520110500314650001301419650002401432650001201456650001401468650001801482650001801500650001301518650001301531650001301544650001601557650001701573650002301590650002001613650001501633650004701648650001001695653001501705653001801720700002301738700001901761700002301780773009701803852000901900856008801909930003301997945002502030946001102055655001202066IND4414558420221117204140.0090105e20081210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aTomás, Anna12aA meta-analysis on experimental infections with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)  ap. 260-273.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA meta-analysis was performed with the aim to identify factors with a relevant influence on the expression of clinical postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) under experimental conditions. Data from 44 studies were included in the analysis. Several variables were studied: number of pigs in the experiment, intake of colostrum, serological status against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), strain of PCV2 used for inoculation, the route and dose of inoculation, and use of potential triggering factors (such as co-infections, vaccinations, or immunomodulator products). Multiple correspondence analysis and log-linear regression methods were used to establish the relationships between the studied variables and the number of PCV2 infected pigs that developed PMWS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, the most successful animal experiment aimed to develop PMWS should include: (1) colostrum-deprived pigs, (2) age of inoculation below 3 weeks, (3) high doses of PCV2 inoculum, (4) PCV2 strain from genotype 1, and (5) co-infection with another swine pathogen as a triggering factor. 3aimmunity 3ainoculation methods 3astrains 3acolostrum 3ameta-analysis 3ahealth status 3avalidity 3ainoculum 3agenotype 3avaccination 3apathogenesis 3aPorcine circovirus 3amixed infection 3aanimal age 3apostweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome 3aswine 0aimmunology 0acomplications1 aFernandes, Lana T.1 aValero, Oliver1 aSegalés, Joaquim.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Dec. 10, v. 132, no. 3-4 p.260-273dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02681naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002600176245010400202300001600306500002400322520120300346650001701549650000901566650001501575650001801590650002401608650002001632650001301652650001501665650001201680650001301692650002101705650002601726650002001752650002001772651002101792700002301813700001801836700002101854700002001875773010101895852000901996856008902005930003302094945002502127946001102152655001202163IND4414557420221117204154.0090105e20081104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aJ500 0aF5001 aİrget, Mehmet Eşref10aEffect of calcium based fertilization on dried fig (Ficus carica L. cv.

Surveys revealed that, however, quality is highly affected by nutrition especially N, K and Ca in fig production for commercial drying. This research work was initiated based on few studies performed on fertilization of fig. The experiment was performed between 2000 and 2002 in three fig orchards of cv. Sarılop (syn. Calimyrna) in Aydın-Turkey. Trees received seven types of fertilization as (i) untreated control; (ii) NPK (430g N, 200g P₂O₅ and 430g K₂O per tree); (iii) NPK+70gCa; (iv) NPK+140gCa; (v) NPK+280gCa; (vi) NPK+420gCa and (vii) N+420gCa, Ca(NO₃)₂ used as the Ca source. Tested fertilizer applications showed significant differences in respect to yield and quality of fig. Basic NPK fertilization with additional 280gCa treatment increased overall quality by reducing the number of fruit with ostiole-end crack and sunscald. Results showed that applied fertilizers exerted significantly in reduction of cull ratio and could alleviate the negative impact of yearly drought conditions. 3aFicus carica 3afigs 3acrop yield 3afruit quality 3acalcium fertilizers 3aplant nutrition 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3acalcium 3aorchards 3afertilizer rates 3anutrient requirements 3acalcium nitrate 3aNPK fertilizers 3aTurkey (country)1 aAksoy, U.q(Uygun)1 aOkur, Bülent1 aOngun, Ali Rıza1 aTepecik, Mahmut0 tScientia horticulturae.g2008 Nov. 4, v. 118, no. 4 p.308-313dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.06.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle01679naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245011000122300001600232520064900248650003000897650001900927650003200946650001100978650001000989650001500999650001801014650002201032653002701054700001601081700001701097700001601114700001601130773009301146852000901239930003301248945001301281946001101294655001201305IND2045209720221117203302.0950322e199411  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204520972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, C.10aTaxon specific hybridization probes for fiber-digesting bacteria suggest novel gut-associated Fibrobacter  ap. 418-424.  aSix oligonucleotide probes complementary to the 16S rRNAs of members of the genus Fibrobacter were designed for identification at the levels of genus, species and subspecies.

Among the 30 genera isolated, the Mucedinacea (44%) were the most frequent, followed by Dematiaceae (26%) and Ascomycetes (10%). 20 strains were potential producers of OTA: Penicillium aurantiogriseum (10 strains), P. chrysogenum (1 strain), P. variabile (6 strains) and Aspergillus ochraceus (3 strains). Only 8 of these strains produced OTA in vitro when cultured in liquid complex medium, indicating that they are rather adapted to solid phase. These findings are to be related to the OTA contamination of human blood in these areas and in other parts of France. 3afoods 3afeeds 3aochratoxins 3ayeasts 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3aFrance 0acontaminants 0acontamination 0afungi1 aSeigle-Murandi, F.1 aSteiman, R.1 aCreppy, E.E.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1995 Nov., v. 18, no. 3 p.455-459x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02053naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001600203500001500219520084800234650002101082650003001103650001501133650001301148650002301161650001101184650003601195650001101231650001501242653002301257653002201280653002401302653001201326653002101338653002301359653002701382700002301409700001601432773009301448852000901541930003301550945001301583946001101596655001201607IND2052192520221117203248.0960719e199511  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205219252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewis, E.A.14aThe utilization of aromatic, cyclic and heterocyclic nitriles by yeasts  ap. 338-342.  a2019-12-05  aThe ability of endomycetalial yeast strains representing Candida fabianii, Candida famata, Candida guilliermondii and Williopsis saturnus to utilize a series of aromatic, cyclic and heterocyclic nitriles as nitrogen source was examined. Varying degrees of utilization of these compounds were noted. Sterically hindered nitrile groups were apparently not utilized. C. fabianii demonstrated the highest rate of 3-cyanopyridine conversion by the four yeasts and within 24 h, 100% molar conversion was achieved. The cultivation of C. fabianii with aromatic and heterocyclic nitriles and ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source resulted in a low apparently constitutive nitrile- and amide-hydrolyzing activity. With aliphatic nitriles, a considerably higher specific activity was induced against olefinic aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic nitriles. 3aCandida saitoana 3aMeyerozyma guilliermondii 3asoil fungi 3anitriles 3aaromatic compounds 3ayeasts 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aamides 3ahydrolysis 0aTorulopsis candida 0aSaccharomycetales 0awilliopsis saturnus 0aCandida 0acandida fabianii 0aaliphatic nitriles 0aCandida guilliermondii1 aVan der Walt, J.P.1 aPrior, B.A.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1995 Nov., v. 18, no. 3 p.338-342x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01661naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006500126300001400191500001500205520077000220650002300990650002401013650002401037653001701061653002501078653001501103653002701118653003401145773008801179852000901267930003301276945001301309946001301322655001201335IND2041701720221117203054.0940830e199401  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204170172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, F.C.10aCooperative learning through simulation of regulated markets  ap. 83-91.  a2019-12-05  aTeaching agricultural policy is challenging in that the operations of markets are complicated by government intervention. Many students need practical experience in formulating decision strategies in the presence of government programs to adequately understand consequences of government actions. This article shows how cooperative learning and simulation can effectively be combined in agricultural policy. With cooperative learning in small groups, complicated problems related to government intervention can be addressed. Economic simulation provides realistic problems for the small groups to consider. The approach helps students understand how abstract economic models can be used to improve economic decision-making in the presence of government regulations. 3amarket regulations 3aagricultural policy 3aeducational methods 0aintervention 0alearning experiences 0asimulation 0aeducational objectives 0agovernment and administration0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.83-91x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01820naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010600127300001600233520067600249650002200925650001300947650002500960650001600985650002301001650002101024650001901045650002301064650002401087651001801111651001101129651001201140653003501152653002001187653003001207700001601237773008901253852000901342930003301351945001301384946001301397655001201410IND2042726320221117203107.0941020e199405  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204272632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, R.J.12aA cost function analysis to estimate the effects of fertilizer policy on the supply of wheat and corn  ap. 215-230.  aCost functions by crop (U.S. and French wheat and corn, and English wheat) are estimated and marginal costs derived. Fertilizer input demand and output supply elasticities, estimated via marginal cost, are computed capturing the effect of fertilizer-reducing policies (a tax and a quota). Supply and fertilizer demand effects are compared within and across countries. The results generally support the hypothesis that fertilizer-reducing policies have a greater effect on crop supplies that use fertilizer more intensively, and that fertilizer policy multilaterally imposed will give U.S. producers a relative competitive advantage vis-a-vis French and English producers. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aenvironmental policy 3afertilizers 3amarket competition 3aproduction costs 3aEuropean Union 3aeconometric models 3ademand elasticities 3aUnited States 3aFrance 3aEngland 0asimultaneous equation analysis 0asupply response 0aagro-environmental policy1 aRandall, A.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 May, v. 16, no. 2 p.215-230x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03064naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006800128300001600196500001500212520198500227650002202212650001202234650002202246650002502268650001002293650001802303650002302321650001202344650002302356651001802379653001102397653001002408653001202418653002602430653001202456700001702468773008902485852000902574930003302583945001302616946001302629655001202642IND2055051220221117202725.0970125e199505  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205505122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, D.D.10aEvaluation of price/dockage strategies for U.S. wheat exporters  ap. 102-158.  a2019-12-05  aDockage is one of many quality attributes that affects U.S. wheat competitiveness in international trade.

Dockage is a non-grade-determining factor in the U.S. system, meaning that its level in export shipments is a negotiable contract term. This article presents methods for assessing the impacts of cleanliness on foreign demand for U.S. wheat and for evaluating costs and benefits of cleaning prior to export. Two optimization models are developed-the first from the perspective of an import firm, and the second from the perspective of a U.S. export firm. The two models are linked and jointly solved, permitting an interpretation of dockage as an instrument of U.S. commercial strategy and policy. Results were used to demonstrate impacts of critical variables on the demand for cleaner wheat exported from the United States. In general, the value of cleaner wheat from the United States (from the buyer's perspective) is positively related to cleaning costs in the importing country, ocean shipping costs and tariffs, and the importer's cleanliness requirements before milling. The demand for cleaner wheat is negatively related to the screening value. To the extent that these factors vary across importing countries, the impact of providing cleaner wheat (in terms of U.S. export sales) will vary. The heterogeneity in demand for clean wheat makes policy prescriptions difficult. If import demands were homogeneous, then the optimal policy would be to establish a uniform limit for dockage in export shipments. However, applying restrictive factor limits in a world of heterogeneous market demands would result in a higher cost for all exports, even though only selected importers are willing to pay the premium necessary to induce commercial cleaning. An alternative policy is to facilitate the evolution of unique and varying quality requirements for individual buyers. 3asimulation models 3aexports 3acosts and returns 3avertical integration 3awheat 3amarket prices 3aeconometric models 3ahygiene 3amarket competition 3aUnited States 0ademand 0atrade 0agrading 0aagricultural products 0aquality1 aWilson, W.W.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 17, no. 2 p.102-158x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03152naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004400127300001600171520195000187650001002137650002202147650002202169650001402191650001602205650002402221650001102245650001902256650002502275650002702300651001802327653002702345653002502372653002202397653002602419653002402445653002402469653002502493653003102518773008902549852000902638930003302647945001302680946001302693655001202706IND2055050920221117202802.0970125e199505  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205505092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhodes, V.J.14aThe industrialization of hog production  ap. 101-108.  aWhat is changing the structure of hog production and where will it lead? Hog production is a major agricultural enterprise in the North Central states and more recently in North Carolina and Arkansas. Hog production has been a major enterprise in hundreds of thousands of diversified family farms and has been known, affectionately, as the mortgage burner. There now exists widespread concern that large corporations will soon dominate hog production. This article is based on 20 years of research and observation by the author and others. The information is analyzed in a competitive-market framework to help readers understand the forces driving change and the speed and extent of change in structure. U.S. hog production has been industrialized in the past 25 years. Much further concentration of ownership and control is in process. Each of the largest producers generally controls many production units through ownership of some and contract production in others. Production through multiple units allows a firm to attain great size; 13 percent of national slaughter in 1993 came from only 57 producers. Diseconomies of size do not appear to exist for several firms that have each surpassed a volume of 90,000 sows in production. The volume of production controlled by contractors has been rising and may be as large as 20 percent of national slaughter in 1995. However, contrary to public perception, only a minority of the contractual volume is vertical- between growers and packers and/or growers and feed companies, while a majority is horizontal- between contractor-producers and growers. The driving force of structural change has been the dynamic exploitation of profit opportunities associated with new technologies and managerial techniques. While trying to save family farms by anticorporate legislation at the state level has not worked, a new force for regulation is the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) reaction of rural neighbors. 3aswine 3aanimal production 3aindustrialization 3amarketing 3arural areas 3atraditional farming 3azoning 3amacroeconomics 3alaws and regulations 3aattitudes and opinions 3aUnited States 0alocation of production 0aagricultural regions 0astructural change 0alivestock enterprises 0aspecialized farming 0acontract production 0acontractor marketing 0anot in my backyard (nimby)0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 17, no. 2 p.101-108x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02732naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005200124300001600176520175700192650002001949650001601969650001901985650002402004650001402028650002302042651001802065653002202083653002002105653002502125653001502150700001702165700001702182773009102199852000902290930003302299945001302332946001302345655001202358IND2054721020221117202757.0970102e199509  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205472102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, C.H.10aAnalysis of seasonal milk price incentive plans  ap. 244-393.  aSeasonality in milk production throughout the year is costly to dairy product processors because plants and equipment used to satisfy production in peak season may operate at less than capacity for much of the year. Seasonal price incentive plans deal with this problem by assessing the milk price in the spring, when milk production is highest, and adding back the proceeds and interest in the fall, when production is lowest. This article examines the impacts of several hypothetical seasonal price differentials on milk production seasonality in the United States. To better understand the impact of seasonal price differentials on milk production a dynamic milk supply-response model with biological constraints is developed using quarterly time-series data for the United States from 1970 through 1992. A system of nonlinear equations for heifer and cow numbers and production per cow is specified according to constraints on the age structure of the cohort and farmers' seasonal adjustment decisions on culling and replacing cows. Seasonality in milk production could be lowered substantially by implementing seasonal price differentials. Seasonality is mainly due to seasonal milk yields. Therefore, to level out seasonal milk production, farmers will have to concentrate mainly on altering seasonal milk yields. This study also finds that there is less responsiveness to seasonal price differentials than previous research. The main reason for this is that constraints on herd dynamics are used in the model, which means that when a producer changes herd size in a particular quarter, there will be a carryover effect on herd size in subsequent quarters. These carryover effects lessen the ultimate impact of price differentials on seasonality. 3amilk production 3amilk prices 3adynamic models 3asupply elasticities 3aequations 3aseasonal variation 3aUnited States 0alivestock numbers 0asupply response 0adifferential pricing 0aincentives1 aKaiser, H.M.1 aForker, O.D.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.244-393x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01592naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245004700130300001600177500001500193520059900208650002400807650001100831650002400842650002000866650002600886650001400912650001600926650001300942650002300955650002000978651001300998653001801011653001901029773009001048852000901138930003301147945001301180946001301193655001201206IND2041703420221117202737.0940830e199401  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204170342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrihfield, J.B.10aModeling land-use decisions in rural areas  ap. 103-112.  a2019-12-05  aA model of land-use choice in rural areas is developed in this article.

Several scenarios were analyzed, including those that reflect market distortions caused by both air and water pollution and Federal subsidies to agriculture. Results from these evaluations provide the basis for cost-benefit analysis of rural land-use decisions when distortions cause markets to allocate land inefficiently. 3amathematical models 3amining 3aresource allocation 3afarming systems 3acost benefit analysis 3asubsidies 3arural areas 3aland use 3afederal government 3adecision making 3aIllinois 0aexternalities 0aland resources0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.103-112x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03079naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001600221500001500237520184100252650002502093650001302118650002302131650001702154650001602171650001302187650000902200650001602209650000902225650002202234650001002256650002002266651001402286651001302300653001602313653001102329653002402340653001702364653002302381700001902404700001502423773009102438852000902529930003302538945001302571946001302584655001202597IND2054720720221117202712.0970102e199509  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205472072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwinton, S.M.14aThe effect of local triazine restriction policies on recommended weed management in corn  ap. 243-367.  a2019-12-05  aAs the herbicide most frequently detected in water supplies, atrazine is under intense public scrutiny and its use could become sharply restricted. Since atrazine is the primary herbicide used in corn production, this could have a significant impact on how weeds are managed in the largest U.S. crop. This study examines the impact of restrictions on atrazine and the chemically related triazine herbicides on profit-maximizing corn production practices at the field level. The analysis employs two bioeconomic models that are highly discriminating at matching weed management tactics to the weed density and species composition in a given field. Results for corn production under irrigation in eastern Colorado and natural rainfall in southern Minnesota indicate that responses to restrictions on atrazine would vary according to the nature of weed infestations in individual fields. Weed management maps show that an atrazine ban would induce greater reliance on the triazine herbicides, cyanazine in particular. Ban-equivalent taxes also depend on weed infestations. To remove all triazine herbicides from the profit-maximizing set would require input taxes of 0 to 230 percent in Minnesota continuous corn, 0 to 30 percent in a Minnesota corn-soybean rotation, and 0 to 111 percent in Colorado continuous corn. The field-level cost of atrazine bans runs $0 to $8.50/acre in Minnesota and $0 to $8.25/acre in eastern Colorado, while triazine bans would cost $0 to $9.40/acre and $0 to $10.00/acre, respectively. Since field-level impacts of herbicide bans depend upon weed density and species mix, outright bans could impose high costs on those producers facing weed problems that are best controlled with the banned substances. Flexible alternative policies could accomplish similar public safety goals at a lower cost to producers. 3alaws and regulations 3aatrazine 3abioeconomic models 3aweed control 3afarm inputs 3asoybeans 3acorn 3afarm income 3arain 3airrigated farming 3ataxes 3aeconomic impact 3aMinnesota 3aColorado 0acomparisons 0amodels 0atriazine herbicides 0asubstitution 0aherbicide taxation1 aLybecker, D.W.1 aKing, R.P.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.243-367x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02220naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008500124300001800209500001500227520111400242650002401356650002101380650001001401650001301411650002601424650003501450650001501485650001301500650001401513650002201527650001101549650002501560653001101585653001201596653002501608700001501633700001301648773008201661852000901743939003301752946001301785655001201798IND9204445020221117202737.0920715s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsfan, D.10aGenetic variation of the physiological efficiency index of nitrogen in triticale  ap. 1381-1390.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to determine the genetic variation of the physiological efficiency index of nitrogen (PEN) in triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) and to what extent grain yield per plant is related to PEN. In this study the PEN is defined as the ratio of grain yield to the amount of nitrogen (N) absorbed by the above-ground plant parts (grain and straw) at maturity. Twelve spring triticale genotypes were studied under greenhouse conditions with two levels of N applied: no N (control) and 150 mg N/kg of dry soil. There was a highly significant variation among genotypes in both yield per pot (F = 6.3) and PEN (F = 12.4). The latter varied from 36.9 to 49.9 and from 27.4 to 33.9 g grain/g of absorbed N in the control and N fertilized treatment respectively. Grain yield was positively and significantly related to PEN both in control (r2 = 0.85) and in fertilized treatment (r2 = 0.72). The results suggest that PEN may be used in a plant breeding program to detect the potentially high yielding triticale genotypes and to evaluate those capable of exploiting N input most efficiently. 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrogen content 3astems 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3acrop yield 3agenotype 3atriticale 3agenetic variation 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 0agrains 0aindexes 0anutrition physiology1 aCserni, I.1 aTabi, M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1991, v. 14, no. 12 p.1381-1390x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02315naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006700128300001600195500001500211520135800226650002501584650001201609650001301621650003901634650002601673650002401699651001801723653002701741653005201768773008901820852000901909930003301918945001301951946001301964655001201977IND2060384620221117202741.0971031e199605  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206038462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, B.L.10aAgricultural economics in the policy arena: the 1995 Farm Bill  ap. 155-165.  a2019-12-05  aThe Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act, the outcome of the 1995 Congressional farm bill debate, has unique features from the perspective of agricultural economics. The Act underscored the political salience of budgetary issues, and budget projections have given agricultural economics a central role. More fundamentally, the Act embraces the idea that some economists have long recommended of replacing policies that attempt to manage markets by lump-sum payments. This recommendation is an outcome of cost-benefit analysis of commodity programs. Cost-benefit analysis has been criticized by agricultural economists for improperly ignoring income distribution issues, and for giving too little attention to dynamics and market failures. Not only is income distribution central in political debate, but well-known theoretical problems cause distributional considerations to undermine the conceptual basis for cost-benefit assessments. And, measurable static efficiency losses resulting from intervention in markets may be less important than the social losses from less easily measured market failures that occur in the absence of intervention. While these caveats to cost-benefit analysis require serious attention, farm commodity programs provide an instance where compensation principles can be applied, and now have been, to good effect. 3alaws and regulations 3afunding 3apolitics 3agovernmental programs and projects 3acost benefit analysis 3aagricultural policy 3aUnited States 0aagricultural economics 0afederal agricultural improvement and reform act0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 May, v. 18, no. 2 p.155-165x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03047naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011600127300001600243500001500259520194200274650001202216650001202228650001002240650003902250650001802289650001302307650002002320651001302340653002602353653002402379653001002403653003202413653002502445700002002470773009102490852000902581930003302590945001302623946001302636655001202649IND2054720320221117202948.0970102e199509  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205472032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpplin, F.M.10aRisk-efficient tillage systems and program participation strategies for land subject to conservation compliance  ap. 242-321.  a2019-12-05  aThose who farm highly-erodible land have been required to implement soil-conserving production practices to maintain eligibility for agricultural payments and other federal programs. In Oklahoma, approximately three million acres of cropland, classified as highly erodible, are used for continuous wheat. Most compliance plans prepared for these acres include the use of a conservation tillage system designed to retain plant residue on the soil surface. However, tillage systems studies have found that wheat yield is inversely related to the amount of surface residue. Increasing surface residue to achieve conservation compliance may result in lower yields in the region. The objective of this study is to determine risk-efficient tillage program participation and grazing strategies for a representative wheat farm with land subject to conservation compliance. Wheat yield data for six tillage methods, ranging from a low residue moldboard plow system to a high residue no-till system, were obtained from an experiment station study. Target MOTAD and stochastic dominance were used to determine production strategies for four types of producers (risk-preferring, risk-neutral, slightly risk-averse, and strongly risk-averse). Differences in wheat forage yield and long-run soil productivity across tillage systems were not considered. The results indicate that high residue sweep tillage and no-till systems are not economically efficient. The greatest expected return is generated by participation and using a disk tillage system. The expected cost of noncompliance is approximately $4 per acre. Nonparticipation plans that use the moldboard plow are not appropriate for risk-preferring or risk-averse producers. The 0/92 provision is important for risk-averse producers. The diversification strategy of grazing wheat forage during the winter and spring is included in the risk-efficient plans for all four types of decision makers. 3atillage 3agrazing 3awheat 3agovernmental programs and projects 3arisk behavior 3aland use 3aeconomic impact 3aOklahoma 0aeconomic consequences 0afeasibility studies 0amotad 0anatural resource management 0aprogram participants1 aAl-Sakkaf, G.A.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.242-321x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03052naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245009100172300001400263500001500277520186600292650001602158650002002174650002502194650001702219650002502236650001902261650002502280650001402305650002302319653001502342653001202357653001602369653003602385700002002421773005802441852000902499856007802508939003302586946001102619655001202630IND9204446220221117202956.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444622DNAL7 a241779702pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnhalt, S.10aSubcellular localization of luteolin glucuronides and related enzymes in rye mesophyll  ap. 83-88.  a2019-12-04  aVacuoles were isolated by osmotic rupture of mesophyll protoplasts from the primary leaves of 4-d-and 7-d-old plants of rye (Secate cereale L.). Their content of two flavones, luteolin 7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1 leads to 2) beta-D-glucuronide] (R2) and luteolin 7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl (1 leads to 2) beta-D-glucuronide]-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide (R1), as well as that of three specific flavone-glucuronosyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis and of a specific beta-glucuronidase was determined in comparison to the parent protoplasts. The two flavonoids were found to be entirely located in the vacuolar fraction, together with 70% of the activity of UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide-4'-O-glucuronosyl-transferase (LDT; EC 2.4.1.), the third enzyme of the sequence of three transferases in the anabolic pathway. The activities of the first and second anabolic enzymes, UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase (LGT; EC 2.4.1.) and UDP-glucuronate: luteolin 7-O-glucuronide-glucuronosyltransferase (LMT; EC 2.4.1.) could not be found in the vacuolar fraction in appreciable amounts. The specific beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.), catalyzing the deglucuronidation of luteolin triglucuronide to luteolin diglucuronide, was present with 90% of its activity in the digestion medium after isolation of mesophyll protoplasts, indicating an apoplastic localization of this enzyme. The data presented indicate a directed anabolic and subsequent catabolic pathway for the luteolin glucuronides in the mesophyll cells of rye primary leaves. This includes two cytosolic and a last vacuolar step of glucuronidation of luteolin, and the vacuolar storage of the luteolin triglucuronide. We propose the transport of the latter into the cell wall, after which the triglucuronide is deglucuronidated, this being the first step for further turnover. 3aprotoplasts 3aglucuronic acid 3achemical composition 3abiosynthesis 3aspatial distribution 3aSecale cereale 3abiochemical pathways 3amesophyll 3abeta-glucuronidase 0ametabolism 0aenzymes 0aderivatives 0aflavone-glucuronosyltransferase1 aWeissenbock, G.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.83-88x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016273Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03116naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245013100174300001600305500001500321520207100336650001902407650002602426650002602452650001802478650001902496650002502515650002202540653001302562773006002575852000902635856007802644939003302722946001102755655001202766IND9204446920221117202958.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444692DNAL7 a241779772pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnyder, H.10aLong-term steady-state labelling of wheat plants by use of natural 13CO2/12CO2 mixtures in an open, rapidly turned-over system  ap. 128-135.  a2019-12-04  aA photosynthate labelling method is presented which takes advantage of the natural difference in carbon-isotope composition which exists between atmospheric CO2 (carbon isotope composition approximately equal to -8(0/00)) and commercially available compressed CO2. Carbon dioxide with carbon-istope composition--4.0 and 27.9(0/00), respectively, has been used for labelling. A plant growth cabinet served as the labelling compartment. CO2-free air was continuously injected at a rate of up to 54 m3.h-1. Dilution of cabinet CO2 by CO2-free air was counterbalanced by addition of CO2 with known constant carbon-isotope composition. Since the labelling-cabinet atmosphere was continuously exchanged at a high rate, photosynthetic carbon-isotope discrimination was fully expressed. In order to study the distribution of carbon acquired by the plant during a defined growth period, the carbon-isotope composition of CO2 was modified by replacing, for example, atmospheric CO2 by CO2 with carbon-isotope composition--27.9(0/00), and the weight and carbon-isotope composition of plant carbon pools was monitored over time. In such an experiment the carbon-isotope composition change of CO2 was followed by a rapid change of the carbon-isotope composition of sucrose in mature flag-leaf blades of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The carbon-isotope composition of sucrose stabilized near--51(0/00), indicating complete exchange by current photosynthate. In contrast 83% of the total carbon in mature flag-leaf blades was not exchanged after 14 d continuous labelling. Differential labelling of pre- and post-anthesis photosynthate indicated that 13% of grain carbon originated from pre-anthesis photosynthesis. Carbon-isotope discrimination and its consideration in experimentation and labelling data evaluation are discussed in detail. Since the air supplied to the labelling cabinet is dry and free of CO2, carbon-isotope discrimination and carbon turnover and partitioning can be studied over a wide range of CO2 concentrations (0-2600 cm3.m-3) and vapor-pressure deficits. 3acarbon dioxide 3aquantitative analysis 3alaboratory techniques 3aradiolabeling 3aphotosynthates 3alaboratory equipment 3aTriticum aestivum 0alabeling0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.128-135x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016343Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04226naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245012600172300001400298500001500312520305600327650002403383650002503407650002503432650002003457650002503477650001803502650001103520653001903531653002803550653002403578653002103602700001603623773005803639852000903697856007803706939003303784946001103817655001203828IND9204445620221117203010.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444562DNAL7 a241779642pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlovik, S.10aCompartmental distribution and redistribution of abscisic acid in intact leaves. III. Analysis of the stress-signal chain  ap. 37-47.  a2019-12-04  aUsing a computer model written for whole leaves (Slovik et al. 1992, Planta 187, 14-25) we present in this paper calculations of abscisic acid (ABA) redistribution among different leaf tissues and their compartments in relation to stomatal regulation under drought stress. The model calculations are based on experimental data and biophysical laws. They yield the following results and postulates: (i) Under stress, compartmental pH-shifts come about as a consequence of the inhibition of the pH component of proton-motive forces at the plasmalemma. There is a decrease of net proton fluxes by about 8.6 nmol.s-1.m-2. (ii) Using stress-induced pH-shifts we demonstrate how 'stress intensities' can be quantified on a molecular basis. (iii) As the weak acid ABA is the only phytohormone which behaves in vivo and in vitro ideally according to the Henderson-Hassel-balch equation, pH-shifts induce a complicated redistribution amongst compartments in the model leaf. (iv) The final accumulation of ABA in guard-cell walls is intensive: up to 16.1-fold compared with only up to 3.4-fold in the guard-cell cytosol. We propose that the binding site of the guard-cell ABA receptor faces the apoplasm. (v) A two- to three-fold ABA accumulation in guard-cell walls is sufficient to induce closure of stomata. (vi) The minimum time lag until stomata start to close is 1-5 min; it depends on the stress intensity and on the guard-cell sensitivity to ABA: the more moderate the stress is, the later stomata start to close or they do not close at all. (vii) In the short term, there is almost no influence of the velocity of pH-shifts on the velocity of the ABA redistribution. (viii) Six hours after the termination of stress there is still an ABA concentration 1.4-fold the initial level in the guard-cell cytosol (delay of ABA relaxation, 'aftereffect'). (ix) The observed 'induction' of net ABA synthesis after onset of stress may be explained by a decrease in cytosolic ABA degradation. About 1 h after onset of stress the model leaf would start to synthesise ABA (and its conjugates) automatically. (x) This ABA net synthesis serves to 'inform roots' via an increased ABA concentration in the phloem sap. The stress-induced ABA redistribution is per se not sufficient to feed the ploem sap with ABA. (xi) The primary target membrane of 'stress' is the plasmalemma, not thylakoids. (xii) The effective 'stress sensor', which induces the proposed signal chain finally leading to stomatal closure, is located in epidermal cells. Mesophyll cells are not capable of creating a significant ABA signal to guard cells if the epidermal plasmalemma conductance to undissociated molecular species of ABA (HABA) is indeed higher than the plasmalemma conductance of the mesophyll (plasmodesmata open). (xiii) All model conclusions which can be compared with independent experimental data quantitatively fit to them. We conclude that the basic experimental data of the model are consistent. A stress-induced ABA redistribution in the leaf lamina elicits stomatal closure. 3amathematical models 3astomatal conductance 3aspatial distribution 3astress response 3aValerianella locusta 3aabscisic acid 3aleaves 0astress factors 0aplant growth substances 0acomputer simulation 0aplant physiology1 aHartung, W.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.37-47x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02675naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006100125300001600186520164100202650001401843650001601857650001801873650002301891650002001914650001601934650001501950653001901965653001501984653002301999653003202022653001602054700001702070700001502087700001602102773009102118852000902209930003302218945001302251946001302264655001202277IND2061828620221117203223.0980213e199609  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206182862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, C.E.10aPrice discovery in an experimental market for fed cattle  ap. 449-466.  aConcerns about price discovery in the fed cattle market stem in part from structural and behavioral changes in meatpacking. One concern is reduced access to data. The Fed Cattle Market Simulator (FCMS), developed at Oklahoma State University, can be used to conduct research on data collected in a simulated market environment. This article reports on a study of individual firm and aggregate market behavior. In the FCMS, eight feedlot teams and four meatpacking teams generate transactions during repeated trading periods. Transaction sheets are scanned into a computer for record keeping and analysis. Continuous market information is provided during the trading period, both for cash and futures markets. Decisions by participants largely determine the direction of market prices and the profitability of cattle feeding and meatpacking. Data were collected from a semester-long course at Oklahoma State University in 1994. Data consisted of 2,682 observations (i.e., an average of 37 transactions per trading period for 72 trading periods). Models were specified to explain the variation in transaction prices for fed cattle. Models estimated by Generalized Least Squares explained over 90 percent of the variation in transaction prices. The results were generally consistent with prior research on transaction prices using data collected from came feedlots, confirmed the importance of the total inventory of market-ready cattle in price discovery, raised questions about pricing strategies of cattle feedlots and meatpackers, and highlighted the importance of negotiating skills in effectively marketing and purchasing fed cattle. 3apackaging 3abeef cattle 3amarket prices 3aeconometric models 3afutures trading 3abody weight 3aboxed beef 0aaverage prices 0asimulation 0atransaction prices 0afed cattle market simulator 0ameatpacking1 aKoontz, S.R.1 aPeel, D.S.1 aTrapp, J.N.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Sept., v. 18, no. 3 p.449-466x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245015400174300001600328520148100344650001601825650002801841650002901869650002101898650002701919650001101946650001701957650002001974650001201994650002702006650002002033650002002053653001502073700001402088773006002102852000902162856007802171939003302249946001102282655001202293IND9204447020221117203243.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444702DNAL7 a241779782pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwacke, R.10aFungal elicitors induce a transient release of active oxygen species from cultured spruce cells that is dependent on Ca2+ and protein-kinase activity  ap. 136-141.  aCell-wall components from the ectomycorrhizal fungi Amanita muscaria and Hebeloma crustuliniforme and from the spruce pathogen Heterobasidion annosum elicited a transient release of active oxygen species from cultured spruce cells (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Since the detection of active oxygen was suppressed by catalase, H2O2 was assumed to be the prevailing O2 species. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase enhanced the concentration of detectable H2O2 indicating that the superoxide anion was formed before dismutating to H2O2. The elicitors induced the formation of active oxygen in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, elicitors from mycorrhizal fungi had a lower H2O2-inducing activity than equal amounts of cell-wall preparations from the pathogen H. annosum. In Ca2+ -depleted medium the production of active oxygen by elicitor-treated spruce cells was suppressed. Additionally, the ionophore A 23187 induced active oxygen formation in a medium with Ca2+ but not in a Ca2+ -depleted medium. Furthermore, the protein-kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited the oxidative burst. At a concentration of 34 nM the effect was diminished to 50%. From these results it is suggested that the release of active oxygen species from cultured spruce cells triggered by cell-wall-derived fungal elicitors depends on external Ca2+ and a protein-kinase activity. In these respects the effect shows similarities with the well-studied respiratory burst of mammalian neutrophils. 3aPicea abies 3acell suspension culture 3aHebeloma crustuliniforme 3aAmanita muscaria 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aoxygen 3agas exchange 3aenzyme activity 3acalcium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aectomycorrhizae 3astress response 0aregulation1 aHager, A.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.136-141x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016353Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007600129300001600205500001500221520180100236650003202037650002402069650001302093650001302106650001802119650001602137650001002153653001402163653002102177653001402198700001902212700001402231773009102245852000902336930003302345945001302378946001302391655001202404IND2061828320221117203250.0980213e199609  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206182832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlgran, R.A.10aImputting values for directly- or contractually-transferred feeder pigs  ap. 423-436.  a2019-12-05  aThis study addresses the problem of valuing contractually-transferred feeder pigs. This is a significant problem because the majority of feeder pig transfers take place under private contract, and it is likely that contracting will become increasingly important with the industrialization of the hog industry. To test the feeder pig growers' hypothesis that public feeder-pig auction markets undervalue pigs possessing high-performing genetics, a valuation model is derived from a short-run indirect profit function. In the profit function, expected slaughter hog prices are assumed to govern decision making and are derived from live-hog futures prices. The profit function is estimated by applying regression analysis to cross-sectional, time-series accounting data from feeders feeding pigs with uniform, high-quality genetic backgrounds in the upper Midwest. Imputed feeder pig values are derived from the regression estimates. The model and methodology are validated by comparing imputed values against prices actually paid in the central Iowa feeder pig market. The imputed values closely track the Iowa feeder pig price series. The average imputed value for the high-quality pigs studied is $3.99 per head above the price paid for average-quality feeder pigs in Iowa public feeder-pig auction markets. The dispersion of the imputed values both among farms and among facilities on farms leads to the conclusion that farmers need to adjust feeding intensity to equalize feeder pig values among the facilities under a producer's control before condemning the Iowa markets for under-pricing feeder pigs. The authors conclude that the methodology is valid and provides helpful guidelines in pricing non-marketed feeder pigs as well as other non-marketed inputs such as chicks and feeder cattle. 3alivestock and meat industry 3amathematical models 3agenetics 3aauctions 3amarket prices 3amethodology 3aswine 0avaluation 0aprofit functions 0amarketing1 aDiPietre, D.D.1 aTubbs, R.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Sept., v. 18, no. 3 p.423-436x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011100123300001600234520164900250650002401899650002101923650002201944650002201966650002001988650002302008650002602031650002402057650001502081651001802096653002502114653002402139653002702163653003002190700001402220700001702234700001702251773009102268852000902359930003302368945001302401946001302414655001202427IND2061829420221117203153.0980213e199609  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206182942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aU.S. consumer demand for alcoholic beverages: cross-section estimation of demographic and economic effects  ap. 477-489.  aConsumption of alcoholic beverages has been historically viewed not only in terms of its effect on individuals' utility maximization, but also in terms of its bearing on social concerns and government revenue. The estimation of demand elasticities and the effects of household characteristic variables on alcohol demand provide important information for the formulation of public policies. This article discusses the specification and estimation of a two-stage consumer demand for alcoholic beverages using the most recent United States Department of Agriculture household food consumption survey data. The upper-level first-stage budgeting decision is estimated using a double-hurdle model, where consumer decisions on whether to consume alcoholic beverages and how much to consume are defined separately. The lower-level second-stage budgeting decision allocates alcohol expenditure via a conditional synthetic demand system for beer, spirits, and wine. For the second stage, a level version synthetic system is constructed using a normalized linear combination of level Rotterdam, a Central Bureau of Statistics model, and an Almost Ideal Demand System equivalent model. The prices, calculated by dividing value by quantities, are quality adjusted, and selection biases are corrected. Results show that some household characteristic variables, as well as economic variables, have significant impacts on consumer demand for alcoholic beverages. Results of the two-stage budgeting model indicate that as a revenue generator, increasing excise taxes on alcoholic beverages is feasible. But, they are not necessarily reliable sources of revenue. 3aalcoholic beverages 3afood consumption 3aconsumer behavior 3ahousehold surveys 3adecision making 3aeconometric models 3ahousehold expenditure 3ademand elasticities 3ademography 3aUnited States 0aconsumption patterns 0adouble-hurdle model 0asynthetic demand model 0aperfect price aggregation1 aGao, X.M.1 aWailes, E.J.1 aCramer, G.L.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Sept., v. 18, no. 3 p.477-489x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02463naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006700129300001600196520134100212650001601553650002501569650001801594650002201612650001401634650001601648650001901664650001101683651001801694653001901712653001601731653002001747653001801767700002501785700001701810700001501827700001201842700001801854773008901872852000901961930003301970945001302003946001302016655001202029IND2060385720221117202345.0971031e199605  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206038572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, D.P.10aChoice of functional form for agricultural production analysis  ap. 223-231.  aChoice of functional form in economic analysis is not a trivial matter. Empirical estimates, including own-price elasticities, elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, and model specification test conclusions are often sensitive to choice of functional form. Unfortunately, theory is seldom sufficient to prescribe a functional form. And, using an inferior functional form may bias results which can, in turn, lead to inaccurate policy analyses and prescriptions. Preferred functional form is generally both problem and data specific. This article uses two methods for choosing between the three most commonly used forms (translog, generalized Leontief, and quadratic) for production analysis. The first method, the nested test, uses the quadratic Box-Cox functional form to nest each of these three forms. The second method, the likelihood dominance criterion, is a nonnested procedure recently developed by Pollak and Wales. The reader of this article will learn what is involved in using both methods as specification pretests. Ease of application and empirical performance is evaluated using four aggregate agricultural production data sets. The simplicity of implementation and the ability to provide unambiguous rankings of alternatives recommends the likelihood dominance criterion for more use by agricultural economists. 3aagriculture 3aproduction economics 3adata analysis 3aeconomic analysis 3aequations 3amethodology 3asupply balance 3aprices 3aUnited States 0aaggregate data 0acomparisons 0aoutput supplies 0ainput demands1 aChaisantikulawat, T.1 aGuan, A.T.K.1 aKebbeh, M.1 aLin, N.1 aShumway, C.R.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 May, v. 18, no. 2 p.223-231x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03084naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010300125300001600228520193500244650002402179650002102203650002302224650001202247650001902259653003502278653002102313653002002334653003702354653003102391653003402422653003202456653003002488700002202518773009002540852000902630930003302639945001302672946001302685655001202698IND2061003820221117202327.0971222e199601  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, D.T.10aFarm price response to supply shocks: a comparison of alternative inverse demand structural models  ap. 137-146.  aPrice-dependent demand functions are commonly used in structural models. This is largely because these models are easy to solve. The same structural model can be expressed in alternative price-dependent forms depending on the inverse demand function chosen. These alternative models generate different price impacts in simulations. The major concern of this study was how and why the alternative models generate different price impacts. The conceptual framework developed here reveals that the price flexibility, price elasticities, and demand shares play major roles in price determination. Since each model has a unique combination of these parameters, each model generates a different price impact. The price impact is determined by a single-equation component that is partially offset by a feedback effect. The simulation results of three alternative specifications of a wheat model, namely price-dependent domestic demand, price-dependent export demand, and price-dependent stock demand, are compared. The three models generated different price impacts. When the ratio of demand share to price flexibility is lower, the impact of the single-equation price is larger. On the other hand, the feedback effect is influenced by two factors. First is the feedback component itself, which is the sum of the product of price elasticities and the respective demand shares of the other demand functions in the model. Second is the single-equation price impact, which amplifies the offsetting effect of this feedback component. This implies that for a given feedback component, the larger the single-equation price impact, the larger the feedback or offsetting effect. When using price-dependent models, alternative specifications should be considered before selecting one. Criteria generally used, such as researcher's experience or performance of previous models, and the share of a particular demand component may not be appropriate. 3ademand elasticities 3ademand functions 3aeconometric models 3aexports 3asupply balance 0asimultaneous equation analysis 0adomestic markets 0aproducer prices 0aprice-dependent structural model 0ainverse stock demand model 0ainverse domestic demand model 0ainverse export demand model 0amarket clearance identity1 aDharmaratne, G.S.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.137-146x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245010400122300001600226500001500242520164500257650003001902650001601932650002801948650001801976650002201994650001102016650002702027650002102054650002102075650001302096650001302109651001002122653001402132700001602146700001902162700002902181700001402210773009302224852000902317930003302326945001302359946001102372655001202383IND2124283920221117202822.0980727e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBel, Y.10aDistribution, frequency and diversity of Bacillus thuringiensis in olive tree environments in Spain  ap. 652-658.  a2019-12-05  aBacillus thuringiensis was isolated from samples collected from olive tree related habitats (olive groves, olive storage facilities and oil mills) of different olive producing regions in Spain. This bacterium was found in a high percentage (92%) of samples. From 72 samples analysed, 2244 sporulating colonies were selected and observed under phase contrast microscopy. From these, 414 colonies (18%) were classified as B. thuringiensis based on the production of parasporal crystals. A great variability of spore, crystal size and morphology was observed. The results indicate that olive groves are as rich as soil olive mills and olive storage facilities regarding the B. thuringiensis population. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the proteins in the parasporal crystal showed a considerable heterogeneity between B. thuringiensis strains. This was especially relevant in samples obtained from oil mills and storage centers, indicating the high polymorphism in this species. Strains isolated from the same sample showing the same SDS-PAGE profile were not considered different, and just one of them was selected for further tests. A total of 188 out of the 414 B. thuringiensis isolates were shown to be different strains and tested for their toxicity against adult animals of the olive fly Bactrocera oleae. Approximately 40% of the strains caused similar or higher mortality than the dipteran active strain B. thuringiensis israelensis (45% mortality). Most strains (71%) producing a toxicity higher than 65% came from olive mills and olive storage facilities. Three of these strains exhibited a mortality higher than 70% in our test conditions. 3ageographical distribution 3acorrelation 3ainsecticidal properties 3aOlea europaea 3agenetic variation 3aolives 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3aBactrocera oleae 3atoxicity 3ahabitats 3aSpain 0aisolation1 aGranero, F.1 aAlberola, T.M.1 aMartinez-Sebastian, M.J.1 aFerre, J.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.652-658x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03603naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012700143300001600270520199000286650002202276650001202298650002302310650000902333650002202342650001202364650002802376650001602404650001502420650005102435650001102486650001102497650001302508650002402521650002702545650001902572650000902591650003802600650001402638650000902652650002502661650001702686650002402703653002002727653001602747700001502763700001802778700001902796700001502815700001802830700002202848773009002870852000902960939003302969946001103002655001203013IND9204464620221117203235.0920716e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920446462DNAL7 a13163242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKava, R.A.14aThe effects of gonadectomy on glucose tolerance of genetically obese (fa/fa) rats: influence of sex and genetic background  ap. 103-111.  aIn both humans and rodents the occurrence and severity of obesity-associated non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) may be influenced by both gonadal hormones and genetic background. Early gonadectomy (at 3-5 days of age) of female and male Wistar diabetic fatty (WDF) rats and of male Zucker rats allowed us to examine these effects in genetically obese rats carrying the fatty (fa) gene. Impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by obesity, and amelioration or exacerbation (in the case of female rats) of this impairment by gonadectomy were assessed by intragastric glucose tolerance tests when the rats reached adulthood. Both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were significantly deranged in obese WDF rats of both sexes and in obese male Zucker rats compared to lean controls of the same sex and strain. Obese male WDF rats were less glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive than were obese male Zucker rats. Glucose intolerance was not ameliorated by castration in lean or obese male WDF or Zucker rats. Insulin sensitivity was significantly improved by castration in obese male rats of both strains, as fasting plasma insulin levels and total areas under the insulin curves were significantly reduced compared to obese sham-operated controls. This effect was greater in the Zucker than in the WDF male rats. Castration significantly decreased the insulin response areas in obese male Zucker rats, but did not alter those of the obese male WDF rats. Ovariectomy did not alter glucose homeostasis of obese female WDF rats. In summary, these data establish that the sexual dimorphism of obesity-associated glucose intolerance/insulin insensitivity of WDF rats is not primarily determined by gonadal hormones.

Inhibition of the proliferative response to concanavalin A was observed in mice exposed to 100 ppm of Cu for 8 weeks and to 200 ppm of Cu for either 3 or 8 weeks. Conversely, a significant increase in the proliferative response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was observed in mice exposed to 50 or 100 ppm of Cu for 3 weeks. However, the response to LPS was also significantly inhibited following prolonged Cu administration. In contrast. mice exposed to low or high Cu doses during short or long periods showed increased production of autoantibodies directed to bromelain-treated mouse erythrocytes. The DTH response to sheep red blood cells was not modified following short-term administration of 100 ppm of Cu, but was depressed after prolonged exposure to this dose of the metal. Significant inhibition of the DTH response was observed in mice exposed to 300 ppm of Cu for 5 or 10 weeks. Thus, oral administration of excess Cu altered the immune response in a fashion related to the dose and duration of treatment. 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3adietary minerals 3aoral administration 3adose response 3aduration 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3aantibody formation 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aT-lymphocytes 3aB-lymphocytes 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formationxdrug effects 2aAutoantibodiesxbiosynthesis 2aCopperxpoisoning 2aCopper Sulfate 2aErythrocytesximmunology 2aFemale 2aHypersensitivity, Delayedximmunology 2aImmune Systemxdrug effects 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMitogensxpharmacology 0amitogens 0amineral excess1 aBaute, L.1 aMalave, I.0 tFundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology.g1991 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.249-256x0272-05907nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01361naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012100124300001600245500001500261520036600276650000900642650002400651650002500675650000900700650002400709650002300733650001200756653001100768653002000779653002200799700002100821773008900842852000900931930003300940945001300973946001300986655001200999IND2036062620221117202632.0931202e199305  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203606262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, X.M.10aCharacterizing taste change in a model of U.S. meat demand: correcting for spurious regression and measuremnt errors  ap. 313-324.  a2019-12-05  aTaste or preferences comprise an unobservable latent variable in utility and demand functions.

A population genetic model is made in an attempt to find out under which conditions evolution from one system to the other is conceivable. Analysis shows that evolution from hetero- to homothallism is possible but evolution from homo- to heterothallism is improbable. As in these haploid fungi self-fertilization has other consequences than in diploid organisms, homothallism seems to have little disadvantage. It is found that polymorphism in homo- and heterothallism can be stable, although this has not yet been found in Sordariaceae in nature. 3aevolution 3aheterothallism 3asexual reproduction 3apopulation genetics 3aSordariaceae 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amating behavior 0aSordariales 0agenetic models 0ahomothallism1 aHoekstra, R.F.0 tHeredity.g1992 May, v. 68, no. pt.5 p.405-410x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01972naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006800125300001600193500001500209520085600224650001701080650002001097650001001117650001301127650001401140650001601154650001901170650001301189650002201202650001401224653002301238653002101261653001401282653001401296653002301310653001301333653001801346653002301364700001801387773006801405852000901473939003301482946001101515655001201526IND9204447720221117202843.0920715e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomiuk, J.10aEvolution of parthenogenesis in the Otiorhynchus scaber complex  ap. 391-397.  a2019-12-04  aA new approach for estimating genetic identity values was applied to a data set on allozyme variation in the weevil, Otiorhynchus scaber (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). This species complex contains sexuals and different races of polyploid asexuals. The results were used to reanalyse the phylogenetic relationship among races and to discuss the monophyletic versus the polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis. A polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis was suggested based on the assumption of hybridization between related species, and the extinction of an ancestral species. The genetic diversity among the different races was compared. A decreased number of new mutations with increased ploidy level was found among current populations. This correlation was explained by a lower evolutionary rate in polyploid asexual races than in diploid sexual races. 3aOtiorhynchus 3aparthenogenesis 3araces 3adiploidy 3atriploidy 3atetraploidy 3aheterozygosity 3amutation 3agenetic variation 3apolyphyly 0ageographical races 0agenetic identity 0aevolution 0aphylogeny 0agenetic parameters 0agenotype 0aasexual races 0aenvolutionary rate1 aLoeschcke, V.0 tHeredity.g1992 May, v. 68, no. pt.5 p.391-397x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02214naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001600199500001500215520115700230650002201387650001901409650001901428650001501447650001701462650002101479653001601500653002401516653001001540653001101550653001301561653002401574653001901598653002201617653002301639653002101662773006801683852000901751939003301760946001101793655001201804IND9204448320221117202847.0920715e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, S.H.10aInbreeding, self-fertilization, lethal genes and genomic coalescence  ap. 449-456.  a2019-12-04  aA deterministic computer model was used to investigate the elevation in frequency of coalesced genomic heterozygotes, i.e. heterozygotes with reduced numbers of independently assorting supergenic units at meiosis, in inbred populations in which every supergenic unit carried a recessive lethal gene. Inbreeding was manipulated in terms of s, the proportion of self-fertilizations per generation, and F, Wright's Inbreeding Coefficient which measures the degree of relatedness between individuals within a population. It was found that where F was greater than about 0.19, coalesced heterozygotes were lifted to high frequencies (>50 per cent) in the population in the absence of self-fertilization. Coalesced heterozygotes were lifted to high frequencies in populations with F less than 0.19 by appropriate levels of self-fertilization. Populations with fewer independently segregating supergenic units at meiosis were more sensitive to the effects of inbreeding than those with larger numbers of such units. The possible significance of these observations in terms of the evolution of genetic systems and in conservation practice is briefly discussed. 3asimulation models 3alinkage groups 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3alethal genes 3aself-pollination 0asegregation 0acomputer simulation 0agenes 0aplants 0agenotype 0apopulation genetics 0agenetic models 0arecessive lethals 0aself compatibility 0asupergenic units0 tHeredity.g1992 May, v. 68, no. pt.5 p.449-456x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02175naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011900125300001600244520097800260650003001238650002901268650002901297650001901326650001501345650002201360650002101382650002101403650001001424650001301434650002401447651001101471651002001482653001801502653002301520653002301543653001601566653002201582700001601604773006801620852000901688939003301697946001101730655001201741IND9204448220221117202915.0920715e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobo, J.A.10aMaximum likelihood estimates of good frequencies and racial admixture in Apis mellifera L.

A probabilistic model of segregation is presented which allows for maximum-likelihood estimates of genetic parameters in the reproductive individuals using the genotypic segregations of workers and drones from different colonies. Marginal probabilities of these segregations are calculated for each queen genotype by assuming a Dirichlet distribution for the fertilization frequencies of the different male alleles stored in the spermathecae, Estimates of gene frequencies and racial proportions in Africanized honey bees from different localities in Brazil and Central America reveal geographical heterogeneity in these parameters, possibly as a result of different levels of gene flow from European races. 3aApis mellifera scutellata 3aApis mellifera mellifera 3aApis mellifera ligustica 3agene frequency 3aestimation 3aworker honey bees 3adrone honey bees 3aqueen honey bees 3araces 3agenotype 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aBrazil 3aCentral America 0aheterogeneity 0agenetic parameters 0amaximum likelihood 0asegregation 0agenetic structure1 aKrieger, H.0 tHeredity.g1992 May, v. 68, no. pt.5 p.441-448x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02870naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010600142300001600248520157500264650001501839650001001854650001701864650002601881650001601907650001401923650002601937650001201963650001101975650004601986650001102032650005302043650005602096650004802152653002802200653001302228653001602241700001802257773008302275852000902358930003302367945001302400946001102413655001202424IND2053870620221117202357.0961104e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205387062DNAL7 a88649332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, L.K.10aRelationship between thickness, chapping and Staphylococcus aureus colonization of bovine teat tissue  ap. 369-375.  aPost-milking measurements of teat skin chapping score, teat thickness and colonization by Staphylococcus aureus were determined for 11.5 d.

Measures were initiated with the milking following the last Staph. aureus challenges. Tissue thickness of the lateral side of the teat (barrel) and colonization by Staph. aureus declined with time. Thickness of the teat end varied more erratically. Teat skin chapping score was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with tissue thickness of the barrel and Staph. aureus colonization. Thickness of the barrel was not significantly correlated with Staph. aureus colonization. Barrel thickness as a covariate had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on teat skin colonization of Staph. aureus, whereas teat skin score and teat end thickness had no significant effect. Thus, thickness of the lateral side of the teat explained the greatest variation in Staph. aureus teat skin colonization in the model tested. 3adairy cows 3ateats 3askin lesions 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aplate count 3athickness 3abiological resistance 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aFemale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aSkin Diseasesxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgrowth & development 0aexperimental infections 0ateat end 0ateat barrel1 aCumming, M.S.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1996 Aug., v. 63, no. 3 p.369-375x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03090naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009900143300001400242500001500256520159800271650001301869650002101882650000901903650002301912650001201935650001101947650001501958650003001973650001102003650002202014650002102036650003102057650002802088651002502116653002102141653002202162653002802184653001802212653002902230653003002259653001402289653001602303700001802319700001602337700001802353700001802371773008102389852000902470930003302479945001302512946001102525655001202536IND2061073020221117202336.0980105e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206107302DNAL7 a91200722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, T.10aEvaluation of low cost in-line milk samplers for estimating individual cow somatic cell counts  ap. 13-22.  a2019-12-05  aThe Dairy Herd Improvement Fund of Victoria recently identified a requirement for a simple and inexpensive in-line sampler to enable dairy farmers to collect representative milk samples for counting somatic cells. We found that the currently available simple in-line milk samplers, when connected to standard 35 ml collection vessels, terminate sampling early in a milking, and thus provide samples that are unrepresentative of the whole milking. We showed that cell count during a milking varies greatly, tending to be high for the first 1-2 l. Analyses of resulting samples will thus tend to overestimate cell counts if samplers are used in their traditional way. We found greater sampling rates in high-line compared with low-line milking systems, and consequently developed modified samplers suitable for both situations. Our samplers utilize low sampling rates (approximately 1-3%) and large collection vessels (450 ml). Compared with currently available simple in-line samplers, our type of sampler provided milk samples considerably more representative of the entire milking for the majority of cows. In conjunction with subsampling, they provided samples of appropriate size (12.5 ml minimum to 25 ml maximum) for testing fat, protein, lactose and cell count. Cell count results indicated that errors associated with the use of currently available simple in-line samplers could frequently be > 200%. In contrast, we found that use of our samplers gave an estimate for cell count that was only slightly higher (mean 20%) than that from samples collected by an approved Tru-Test sampler. 3asamplers 3amilking machines 3amilk 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aDairyingxinstrumentation 2aFemale 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 3aVictoria (Australia) 0amilking portions 0adairy engineering 0arepresentative sampling 0acell counting 0alow-line milking systems 0ahigh-line milking systems 0amilk flow 0asubsampling1 aAndrews, S.P.1 aMoate, P.J.1 aPollino, C.A.1 aSchmidt, W.L.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1997 Feb., v. 64, no. 1 p.13-22x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03066naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012600184300001600310500002400326520144100350650002401791650002401815650002701839650003001866650001401896650001801910650001201928650001201940650001201952650006701964650005202031650006302083650004402146650005602190650002702246650004702273650004102320650003802361700001802399773009702417852000902514856008502523655001202608IND4416690220221117202623.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441669022DNAL7 a189896992pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1252-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Gavendra10aEfficacy of Bacillus sphaericus against larvae of malaria and filarial vectors: an analysis of early resistance detection  ap. 763-766.  aIncludes references  aWe are reporting in this paper the control of Anopheles stephensi Liston and Culex quinquefasciatus Say using Bacillus sphaericus. These have been now considered with a practical solution because of its specific and prolonged killing action against mosquito larvae. The efficacy of B. sphaericus were assessed against all instars of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus separately. During the experiments, the mortalities were not found highly effective in dose concentration of LC₉₀ 0.01 mg/l. It is recommended by the World Health Organizations in all instars of larvae of A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. Thereafter, six different concentrations were used in laboratory bioassays (05, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/l) for A. stephensi. Similarly, in the case of C. quinquefasciatus, six statistically significant different concentrations were used (0.01, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/l) of B. sphaericus. It was recorded after exposure of 24 h. The percentages of mortalities were different for the different instars of C. quinquefasciatus and A. stephensi. The probit equations were drawn by the probit method. The result of the study distinctly showed that B. sphaericus is not effective on selected defined doses against A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. This probably indicates an initiation of resistance. This efficacy study can be useful while detecting early resistance phenomena in environment specific zones. 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aBacillus sphaericus 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aWorld Health Organization 3abioassays 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3amalaria 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aBacillusxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aCulexxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aFilariasisxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aInsect Vectorsxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aMalariaxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods1 aPrakash, Soam0 tParasitology research.g2009 Mar., v. 104, no. 4 p.763-766dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-1252-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03624naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245013000182300001600312500002400328520139700352650001801749650002701767650000801794650001801802650001401820650002701834650002801861650001301889650001901902650002201921650001001943650002401953650001101977650001501988650001902003650002202022650002502044650001402069650001302083650002202096650006402118650002402182650001202206650003202218650007502250650002302325650005502348650001102403650001702414650001102431650002802442650000902470650000902479650002402488650005302512650002802565650005202593650002702645700002202672700002902694773009702723852000902820856008502829655001202914IND4416690120221117202605.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441669012DNAL7 a190024982pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1251-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Meghna10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a novel immunoreactive ATPase/RNA helicase in human filarial parasite Brugia malayi  ap. 753-761.  aIncludes references  aDEAD box proteins are putative RNA unwinding proteins found in organisms ranging from mammals to bacteria. We have identified a novel immunodominant cDNA clone, BmL3-helicase, encoding DEAD box RNA helicase by immunoscreening of a larval stage cDNA library of Brugia malayi. The cDNA sequence exhibited strong sequence homology to Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae RNA helicase, a prototypic member of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein family. The clone also showed similarity with RNA helicase of Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium of filarial parasite. It was overexpressed as ~50 kDa His-tag fusion protein, and ATP hydrolysis assay of recombinant enzyme showed that either ATP or dATP was required for the unwinding activity, indicating BmL3-helicase as an ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase. The recombinant protein also demonstrated cross-seroreactivity with human bancroftian sera. The presence of BmL3-helicase in various life stages of B. malayi was confirmed by immunoblotting of parasite-life-cycle extracts with polyclonal sera against the BmL3-helicase, which showed high levels of expression in microfilaria, L₃, and adult (both male and female) stages. In the absence of an effective macrofilaricidal agent and validated anti-filarial drug targets, RNA helicases could be utilized as a rational drug target for developing agents against the human filarial parasite. 3aBrugia malayi 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aRNA 3aRNA helicases 3aWolbachia 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abacteria 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3adrugs 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aimmunoblotting 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3aproteins 3asequence homology 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aBrugia malayixenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aElephantiasis, Filarialximmunologyxparasitology. 2aFemale 2aGene Library 2aHumans 2aImmunodominant Epitopes 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMicrofilariaexenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA Helicasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aSrivastava, K.

Recent studies using flow cytometry have also shown increased expression of TLR-9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients. In this study, we performed quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of PBMCs from 21 SLE patients and 21 healthy subjects, to estimate TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, IFN-α and LY6E (a type I IFN-inducible gene) mRNA expression levels. Expression levels of TLR2, TLR7, TLR9, IFN-α and LY6E mRNAs in SLE patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Expression levels of TLR7 and TLR9 mRNAs correlated with that of IFN-α mRNA in SLE patients. These results suggest that up-regulated expression of TLR7 and TLR9 mRNAs together with increased expression of IFN-α mRNA in PBMCs may also contribute to the pathogenesis of human lupus. 3amononuclear leukocytes 0ainterferon-α 0areal-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 0asystemic lupus erythematosus 0aToll-like receptors1 aWakui, H.1 aIwamoto, K.1 aOzawa, M.1 aTogashi, M.1 aMasai, R.1 aMaki, N.1 aHatakeyama, T.1 aSawada, K.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 June, v. 152, no. 3 p.482-487dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03646.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245009800180300001800278520146400296650002201760650002001782650002001802650000801822650001401830650001401844650001401858650002601872650001101898650001201909651001001921653002301931653002301954653001601977700002101993773011802014852000902132856009202141930003302233946001102266655001202277IND4408946620221117202742.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440894662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02008.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobón-Cerviá, Javier.10aLong-term numerical changes and regulation in a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla  ap. 1832-1844.  a1. The objective was to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying the numerical dynamics of a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla based on a purely observational study. We used a 21-year data set on the Rio Esva (Asturias, northwestern Spain) stock of eels, encompassing eel density at an estuary site and at nine sites distributed among three tributaries selected to differ in the distance from the tidal limit and fishery data on glass eels from the nearby Rio Nalón estuary. 2. The abundance of glass eels and estuarine and in-stream densities declined simultaneously over a 15-year period. However, following a historical minimum in the abundance of glass eels around the year 2000, the density continued to decline in the estuary whereas density in the streams began an increase that has continued to the present. 3. In-stream cohort mortality rate (Z) varied from 0.0016 day⁻¹ to only 0.0003 day⁻¹ (on an annual basis from 0.57 to 0.099 year⁻¹). The negative effects of intra-cohort and inter-cohort densities on mortality rate emphasized the responses of the riverine stock to compensatory density-dependence. As a consequence, the number of eels surviving to commence the silvering stage was similar in magnitude in the strongest and weakest cohorts. 4. These results suggest that, even if the low abundance of glass eels persists, in-stream density may increase towards a stable value regulated by in-stream density-dependence. 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aadverse effects 3adata collection 3aeel 3aestuaries 3afisheries 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3arivers 3astreams 3aSpain 0adensity-dependence 0along-term dynamics 0ariver stock1 aIglesias, Tania.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 Sept., v. 53, no. 9 p.1832-1844dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02008.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02752naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010300163300001600266520118100282650002301463650001501486650002501501650001201526650001701538650001301555650001201568650001901580650002701599650001601626650002201642650002101664650002601685650000901711650001701720650001501737650001501752650001301767650001401780650001501794650001701809650001001826650000901836650001101845651001001856653002701866700002101893700001401914773012001928852000902048856008502057930003302142946001102175655001202186IND4403420920221117202651.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440342092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-007-9219-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yongjian 10aApplication of Gracilaria lichenoides (Rhodophyta) for alleviating excess nutrients in aquaculture  ap. 199-203.  aA study was conducted in Xiangshan Bay, Ningbo, China, using red alga Gracilaria lichenoides to alleviate nutrient pollution in shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and fish (Epinephelus awoara) culture ponds.

A total of 506.5 kg (1,013 kg ha⁻¹) of shrimp and 210.5 kg (421 kg ha⁻¹) of fish were harvested from the shrimp/algae (SA) and fish/algae (FA) ponds, respectively. Only 53.5 kg shrimp were harvested from the shrimp pond without Gracilaria (S) due to anoxic asphyxia, and 163 kg fish were harvested from the fish culture pond without Gracilaria (F). Compared with using microalgae, bioremediation by macroalgae has no risk of harmful algal blooms (HABs), and it is easy to control seaweed biomass. During the experiment, there was a better environmental condition (lower chemical oxygen demand, IN, IP and chlorophyll a concentrations) in the ponds with Gracilaria. Furthermore, Gracilaria spp. can be used as food for abalone or other aquacultured animals and thus enhance economic return. 3aEpinephelus awoara 3aGracilaria 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aabalone 3aalgal blooms 3aasphyxia 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorophyll 3acosts and returns 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3afish culture 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3apond culture 3aponds 3arisk 3ashrimp 3aChina 0aGracilaria lichenoides1 aFang, Jianguang 1 aWei, Wei 0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2008 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.199-203dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-007-9219-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02615naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005200174300001600226520121100242650001501453650001701468650002301485650001201508650003301520650001601553650001301569650001501582650001801597650001701615650000901632650001901641650002601660653002001686653001701706653001501723653003401738653003101772700002101803700002201824700001601846700001701862773009501879852000901974856009201983930003302075946001302108655001202121IND4409263020221117203152.0080822e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440926302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2008.00414.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelsinne, Thibaut10aRainfall Influences Ant Sampling in Dry Forests  ap. 590-596.  aThe standardized 'Ants of the Leaf Litter' protocol aims to facilitate the use of ground-foraging and litter-dwelling ants in biodiversity assessment and monitoring programs. It was initially developed to characterize assemblages from tropical rain forests and is based on two main techniques: Winkler extractions and pitfall traps. Here, we tested to what extent this protocol was adapted to tropical dry forests and affected by the rainfall regime. Our 10 study sites were located along an aridity gradient (average annual rainfall: 350-1300mm) in the Gran Chaco. The number of species collected per sampling effort increased with aridity for pitfalls but followed an opposite trend for Winkler samples. This trend could be explained by the low daytime foraging activity in the leaf litter during drought periods. In arid and semiarid regions the good performance of pitfalls was probably related to their 24-h operation and to the attractiveness of the water they contained. Our results stress that the Winkler method used in the Ants of the Leaf Litter protocol may not be cost-effective during periods of drought and may lead to severe underestimations of litter ant diversity in tropical dry forests. 3aFormicidae 3abiodiversity 3acost effectiveness 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3adry forests 3aforaging 3amonitoring 3apitfall traps 3aplant litter 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3atropical rain forests 0aA.L.L. protocol 0aconservation 0aGran Chaco 0arapid biodiversity assessment 0asampling method evaluation1 aLeponce, Maurice1 aTheunis, Laurence1 aBraet, Yves1 aRoisin, Yves0 tBiotropica.g2008 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.590-596dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2008.00414.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03581naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010100185300001600286500001500302520177600317650001902093650004002112650001502152650001002167650001702177650001902194650001002213650002102223650001902244650005602263650005202319650001102371650002202382650001102404650001102415650002002426650002502446650000902471650005002480650001702530651002602547653002002573653003302593653001702626700002102643700001802664700001702682700002002699700001502719773010702734852000902841856008502850930003302935946001102968655001202979IND4401491620221117203203.0080217e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440149162DNAL7 a163657242pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-005-0082-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkrivarhaug, T. 10aLong-term mortality in a nationwide cohort of childhood-onset type 1 diabetic patients in Norway  ap. 298-305.  a2019-12-04  aAims/hypothesis We examined long-term total and cause-specific mortality in a nationwide, population-based Norwegian cohort of patients with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. Materials and methods All Norwegian type 1 diabetic patients who were diagnosed between 1973 and 1982 and were under 15 years of age at diagnosis were included (n=1,906). Mortality was recorded from diabetes onset until 31 December 2002 and represented 46,147 person-years. The greatest age attained among deceased subjects was 40 years and the maximum diabetes duration was 30 years. Cause of death was ascertained by reviews of death certificates, autopsy protocols and medical records. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was based on national background statistics. Results During follow-up 103 individuals died. The mortality rate was 2.2/1000 person-years. The overall SMR was 4.0 (95% CI 3.2-4.8) and was similar for males and females. For ischaemic heart disease the SMR was 20.2 (7.3-39.8) for men and 20.6 (1.8-54.1) for women. Acute metabolic complications of diabetes were the most common cause of death under 30 years of age (32%). Cardiovascular disease was responsible for the largest proportion of deaths from the age of 30 years onwards (30%). Violent death accounted for 28% of the deaths in the total cohort (35% among men and 11% among women). Conclusions/interpretation Childhood-onset type 1 diabetes still carries an increased mortality risk when compared with the general population, particularly for cardiovascular disease. To reduce these deaths, attention should be directed to the prevention of acute metabolic complications, the identification of psychiatric vulnerability and the early detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. 3acohort studies 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aCause of Death 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xepidemiologyxmortality. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMyocardial Ischemiaxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aRisk Factors 0aNorwayxepidemiology. 0aCauses of death 0aStandardised mortality ratio 0aepidemiology1 aBangstad, H.-J. 1 aStene, L.

Candida parapsilosis isolates originating from blood (n = 66) and other clinical specimens (n = 48) were tested by Etest against amphotericin B (AP), caspofungin (CS), 5-flucytosine (FC), fluconazole (FL) and voriconazole (VO). The plates were incubated at 35 °C and readings for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were recorded after 24 and 48 h of incubation. The MIC ranges and MIC₉₀ read after 48 h were as follows: 0.064-1 and 0.5 μg ml⁻¹ for AP; 0.125-4 and 1.5 μg ml⁻¹ for CS; 0.047 to >256 and 1 μg ml⁻¹ for FL; 0.023 to >32 and 0.125 μg ml⁻¹ for FC and <0.002-1 and 0.047 μg ml⁻¹ for VO respectively. According to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute criteria, all the isolates were susceptible to VO, and resistance against FC and FL was <2%. Eight (7%) isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility (MIC >1 μg ml⁻¹) to CS including six isolates with MIC of >=2 μg ml⁻¹ at 48 h reading. The antifungal resistance among bloodstream isolates of C. parapsilosis against AP, FL, FC and VO in Kuwait is rare. This is the first report on CS susceptibility of C. parapsilosis isolates from Arabian Gulf region. 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aantifungal agents 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCandidaxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aCandidiasisxmicrobiology 2aDrug Resistance, Fungal 2aHumans 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aKuwait 0aAntifungal susceptibility 0aEtest 0acaspofungin1 aAl-Sweih, Noura A.1 aAḥmad, Suhail.1 aKhan, Zia U.0 tMycoses diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of fungal diseases.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.318-323dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0933-74077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01492.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02794naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011000144300001600254500001500270520123200285650001101517650002801528650001401556650001801570650001301588650001301601650001201614650001001626650001101636650001301647650001401660650001401674650002101688650001201709650001101721650002101732650004101753650001901794650001101813650001801824650001001842650001101852650002001863650001401883650002001897650002501917653002401942653002001966653001101986700001401997700002102011773008202032852000902114930003302123945001302156946001102169655001202180IND2196106220221117202712.0981221e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219610622DNAL7 a96278442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanfili, G.10aInfluence of thermal and other manufacturing stresses on retinol isomerization in milk and dairy products  ap. 253-260.  a2019-12-05  aAn analytical procedure, based upon HPLC, has been used to determine the degree of isomerization of retinol (vitamin A) in various dairy products. In raw milks, which are not subjected to thermal processing, there was no conversion of the predominant all-trans-isomers to cis-isomers in samples from various species. Pasteurized milks with mild heat treatment (high quality milk) had an average 13-cis:all-trans ratio of 2.6%, while pasteurized milk treated for 15 s at temperatures ranging from 72 to 76 degrees C had an average ratio of 6.4%. Milk subjected to more severe heat treatments had a higher degree of isomerization (UHT milk, 15.7%; sterilized milk, 33.5%), consistent with increased thermal conversion of the retinol isomers. In pasteurized and UHT cream, the increase in 13-cis-isomer was also a consequence of heat treatment (pasteurized cream, 3.0%; UHT cream, 14.4%). The presence of cis isomers in fermented milk suggests that fermentation processes, directly or indirectly, can induce cis-trans isomerization. In the cheeses analysed, the extent of retinol isomerization ranged from 7.6 to 35.0%. Our results confirm the importance of individual isomers in evaluating the vitamin A status of dairy products. 3abutter 3ainterspecific variation 3amare milk 3aisomerization 3aUHT milk 3araw milk 3acheeses 3acream 3ayogurt 3aewe milk 3agoat milk 3avitamin A 3apasteurized milk 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCheesexanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDairy Products 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aGoats 2aHorses 2aHot Temperature 2aIsomerism 2aMilkxchemistry 2aVitamin Axchemistry 0aspecies differences 0asterilized milk 0aratios1 aManzi, P.1 aPizzoferrato, L.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1998 May, v. 65, no. 2 p.253-260x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02240naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245017700169300001600346520120000362653002401562653002501586653003101611700002401642700002801666773011601694852000901810856008501819930003301904946001301937655001201950IND4405502020221117202655.0080509e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440550202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00239-008-9078-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelvin, Richard G. 12aA Candidate Complex Approach to Study Functional Mitochondrial DNA Changes: Sequence Variation and Quaternary Structure Modeling of Drosophila simulans Cytochrome c Oxidase  ap. 232-242.  aA problem with studying evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial (mt) DNA is that classical population genetic techniques cannot identify selected substitutions because of genetic hitchhiking. We circumvented this problem by employing a candidate complex approach to study sequence variation in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) genes within and among three distinct Drosophila simulans mtDNA haplogroups. First, we determined sequence variation in complete coding regions for all COX mtDNA and nuclear loci and their isoforms. Second, we constructed a quaternary structure model of D. simulans COX. Third, we predicted that six of nine amino acid changes in D. simulans mtDNA are likely to be functionally important. Of these seven, genetic crosses can experimentally determine the functional significance of three. Fourth, we identified two single amino acid changes and a deletion of two consecutive amino acids in nuclear encoded COX loci that are likely to influence cytochrome c oxidase activity. These data show that linking population genetics and quaternary structure modeling can lead to functional predictions of specific mtDNA amino acid mutations and validate the candidate complex approach. 0aGenetic hitchhiking 0aCytochrome c oxidase 0aCandidate complex approach1 aKatewa, Subhash D. 1 aBallard, J.

Although the simulated warming makes snow season to shorten from its both ends in all of Eurasia and North America, SWE at the height of the winter generally increases in the coldest areas. Elsewhere, snow decreases throughout the winter. The average borderline between increasing and decreasing midwinter SWE coincides broadly with the -20°C isotherm in late 20th century November-March mean temperature, although with some variability between different areas. On the colder side of this isotherm, an increase in total precipitation generally dominates over reduced fraction of solid precipitation and more efficient melting, and SWE therefore increases. On the warmer side, where the phase of winter precipitation and snowmelt are more sensitive to the simulated warming, the reverse happens. The strong temperature dependence of the simulated SWE changes suggests that projections of SWE change could be potentially improved by taking into account biases in simulated present-day winter temperatures. A probabilistic cross verification exercise supports this suggestion. 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3amelting 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3awinter 3aEurasia 3aNorth America 0aClimate projection 0aSnow water equivalent 0aSnow depth0 tClimate dynamics.g2008 Feb., v. 30, no. 2-3 p.307-319dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-007-0289-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03911naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245012000148300001400268520205600282650001502338650001902353650001102372650001902383650002402402650001402426650001202440650001402452650001302466650002802479650002202507650002002529650003302549650001802582650001202600650002302612650003002635650003202665650002302697650002202720650004202742650001102784650005502795650002702850650003302877650002602910650002702936650002602963650003102989650002803020650002503048700002003073700001703093700001603110773008103126852000903207930003303216945001303249946001103262655001203273IND2200855620221117202656.0990930e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220085562DNAL7 a101914702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendry, K.A.K.10aEffect of endocrine and paracrine factors on protein synthesis and cell proliferation in bovine hoof tissue culture  ap. 23-33.  aLaminitis is a major cause of lameness in dairy cattle, and is widely attributed to a defect in the horny tissue that gives the hoof its mechanical strength. Defective horn associated with, and may be preceded by, impaired keratin deposition in the hoof epidermis. The cause of abnormal keratin deposition is not easily identified but, like epidermal keratinization in other tissues, is likely to be controlled by hormones and the paracrine action of locally produced growth factors. The hormonal regulation of keratin synthesis and cell proliferation in the bovine hoof was studied using tissue explants in organ culture. As the highest incidence of laminitis is in early lactation, the study focused on insulin, cortisol and prolactin, three hormones implicated in lactogenesis and galactopoiesis. Incubation of tissue explants for 24 h in medium containing insulin (10-5000 ng/ml) stimulated protein synthesis measured by incorporation of (35)S-labelled amino acids. Histochemical examination showed that insulin binding co-localized with the site of protein synthesis. Insulin also stimulated DNA synthesis, an index of cell proliferation, which was measured by incorporation of [(3)H]methyl thymidine. Cortisol (10-5000 ng/ml) decreased protein synthesis, whereas prolactin (10-5000 ng/ml) had no significant effect on protein or DNA synthesis. Epidermal growth factor (10-200 ng/ml), a potent inhibitor of keratinization in other tissues, stimulated protein synthesis compared with untreated controls. Epidermal growth factor binding was located microscopically to the germinal and differentiating epidermal layers. SDS-PAGE and fluorography showed that the population of proteins synthesized in the presence of any hormone or growth factor combination did not differ from that in untreated controls and included the keratins involved in horn deposition. The results show that bovine hoof keratinization is under endocrine and growth factor control, and suggest that systemic changes in lactogenic hormones may act to inhibit keratin deposition. 3adairy cows 3atissue culture 3ahooves 3akeratinization 3ahormonal regulation 3alaminitis 3ainsulin 3aprolactin 3acortisol 3aepidermal growth factor 3aprotein synthesis 3aDNA replication 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCattle Diseasesxetiology 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCulture Techniques 2aDNAxbiosynthesis 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aHoof and Clawxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHormonesxpharmacology 2aHydrocortisonexpharmacology 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aKeratinsxbiosynthesis 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLameness, Animalxetiology 2aProlactinxpharmacology 2aProtein Biosynthesis1 aMacCallum, A.J.1 aKnight, C.H.1 aWilde, C.J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1999 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.23-33x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011500127300001600242520112800258650001301386650001401399650001001413650001601423650001101439650002501450650001601475650001801491650001701509650002301526653001701549653001401566653001401580653002101594700002001615773008301635852000901718930003301727945001301760946001101773655001201784IND2197011120221117203136.0990216e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219701112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorredig, M.10aCharacterization of the interface of an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by milk fat globule membrane material  ap. 465-477.  aA fraction derived from the membrane of milk fat globules (MFGM) was isolated from fresh raw cream. The adsorption of MFGM at the interface of oil-in-water emulsions was studied as well as the stability of the emulsions under different conditions (pH, temperature treatment) and the surface potential. The emulsions prepared with MFGM isolates were stable at neutral pH and were destabilized at low pH. By analysis of the protein adsorbed at the interface by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we also determined that the MFGM that covered the surface of the oil-in-water emulsion could not be displaced by surfactants such as Tweens and Triton X-100 and was not affected by the presence of other proteins such as caseins and beta-lactoglobulin added to the emulsion. A strong molecular interaction between the adsorbed MFGM, composed of phospholipid and protein, may exist at the interface, rendering the newly formed membrane very little affected by the presence of other surfactants. This MFGM-stabilized emulsion was characterized by a behaviour very different from that of emulsions stabilized by other milk proteins. 3amilk fat 3aemulsions 3acream 3asurfactants 3acasein 3asurface interactions 3asoybean oil 3aparticle size 3adroplet size 3abeta-lactoglobulin 0adistribution 0astability 0ainterface 0aglobule membrane1 aDalgleish, D.G.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1998 Aug., v. 65, no. 3 p.465-477x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03167naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008000143300001600223500001500239520176600254650001102020650001902031650001102050650002302061650000902084650001402093650001102107650001302118650001202131650002302143650002302166650004102189650001002230650001102240650002502251650002402276650002002300650002602320650002002346650001202366651001402378651001402392653001002406653001802416700001502434700001502449773008302464852000902547930003302556945001302589946001102602655001202613IND2197011820221117203149.0990216e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219701182DNAL7 a97184972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, R.A.10aAssessment of isoflavonoid concentrations in Australian bovine milk samples  ap. 479-489.  a2019-12-05  aThere is considerable interest in the possibility that diet-derived isoflavonoids may help in protection against a number of chronic diseases common in Western society. Based on animal studies, however, concerns have been raised that consumption of isoflavonoids by infants and young children may be undesirable. Clover contains isoflavonoids and therefore may represent, via milk, a source of isoflavonoids in the human diet. In this study the concentrations of daidzein (7,4'-dihydroxyisoflavone), genistein (5,7, 4'-trihydroxyisoflavone) and equol (7-hydroxy-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)chroman) were measured using HPLC in cows' milk samples obtained from 76 farms in three Australian states. In addition, concentrations were measured in samples collected from one South Australian factory both before and after pasteurization. Concentrations in all samples were found to be extremely low. The mean daidzein concentration was <5 ng/ml. Mean genistein concentrations ranged from just detectable (approximately 2 ng/ml) in Victorian samples collected during summer to 20-30 ng/ml in samples from all states collected during spring when isoflavonoid-containing clover is most dominant in pasture. Mean equol concentrations ranged from 45 +/- 10 ng/ml in Victorian farm samples collected during summer to 293 +/- 52 ng/ml in Western Australian samples collected in spring. The mean concentrations of genistein and equol in post-pasteurization samples collected in spring were approximately double those for samples collected in autumn. Pasteurization had no effect on isoflavonoid concentrations. We conclude that the concentrations of isoflavonoids in Australian cows' milk are low and are therefore unlikely to have any pronounced biological effects in human consumers. 3aautumn 3apasteurization 3aspring 3aseasonal variation 3amilk 3agenistein 3asummer 3adaidzein 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aChromansxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEquol 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aGenisteinxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aIsoflavonesxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSeasons 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aequol 0aisoflavonoids1 aMano, M.M.1 aHead, R.J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1998 Aug., v. 65, no. 3 p.479-489x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02874naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245017300187300001600360520103500376650001701411650001401428650001301442650003001455650002101485650002201506650002701528650001001555650001601565650002101581650001701602650002701619650001201646650002501658650001101683650001401694650000901708650001201717650002301729650002801752650003701780650001901817650002501836651000901861653000901870653003001879653002101909653000901930653001401939700001801953700001601971773012801987852000902115856009202124930003302216946001102249655001202260IND4401247620221117203138.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440124762DNAL7 a182057742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01499.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIRWIN, D.E.10aCall divergence is correlated with geographic and genetic distance in greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides): a strong role for stochasticity in signal evolution  ap. 435-448.  aDivergence in signalling systems might play a central role in speciation. To assess the importance of possible causes of signal divergence, we examine two types of vocalizations within a geographically variable species complex, the greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides Sundevall). Calls, which are used by both sexes throughout the year, and songs, which are sung primarily by breeding males, differ distinctly between two distinct Siberian forms. Through a ring of southern populations that connect the northern forms, signal divergence is correlated with both geographic distance and genetic divergence. Calls and songs differ in their particular patterns of geographic variation, probably because of the larger influence of sexual selection on songs than on calls. These patterns are supportive of neither acoustic adaptation nor morphology being major drivers of divergence in vocalizations. Rather, these results support the importance of stochastic evolution of communication systems in the evolution of new species. 3aPhylloscopus 3aacoustics 3abreeding 3acommunications technology 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3amales 3anew species 3asexual selection 3avocalization 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSongbirdsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTerritoriality 2aVocalization, Animal 0aAsia 0acall 0aPhylloscopus trochiloides 0asignal evolution 0asong 0aSylviidae1 aTHIMGAN, M.P.1 aIRWIN, J.H.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.435-448dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01499.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245007600143300001600219520129200235650001501527650001701542650001201559650001801571650001701589650001701606650001501623650002801638650001201666650003001678650002301708650001401731650001101745650002001756650005601776650005901832650005901891650002901950650005701979653001302036700001302049700001802062700001802080700001402098773008302112852000902195930003302204945001302237946001102250655001202261IND2197009420221117203135.0990216e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219700942DNAL7 a97184952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRose, M.T.10aInsulin-independent glucose uptake in growth hormone treated dairy cows  ap. 423-431.  aOur aim was to determine the effect of growth hormone on non-insulin-mediated glucose disposal in lactating dairy cows. Following 5 d of subcutaneous injections of either saline or growth hormone, insulin, somatostatin or insulin plus somatostatin were infused for 2 h each, in a series of experiments. Coincident with this, unlabelled glucose was infused at a variable rate to maintain a constant plasma glucose concentration. Glucose, doubly labelled with deuterium, was also infused for the calculations of glucose turnover. Plasma insulin levels were reduced to nearly zero by the infusion of somatostatin; under such conditions whole body glucose disposal should be non-insulin-mediated. Dairy cows treated with growth hormone, which had significantly increased milk yields on the day before the experimental infusions, did not have different levels of whole body non-insulin-mediated glucose disposal when expressed in absolute terms. Growth hormone did not affect non-mammary non-insulin- mediated glucose uptake estimated by calculation. Growth hormone significantly inhibited insulin-mediated glucose uptake when plasma insulin levels were elevated. Glucose uptake during insulin plus somatostatin infusion was not significantly different from that of the insulin only infusion. 3adairy cows 3asomatotropin 3ainsulin 3ablood glucose 3asomatostatin 3ablood plasma 3amilk yield 3acarbohydrate metabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDeuterium 2aFemale 2aGlucagonxblood 2aGlucosexadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aSomatostatinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0ainfusion1 aItoh, F.1 aMatsumoto, M.1 aTakahashi, Y.1 aObara, Y.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1998 Aug., v. 65, no. 3 p.423-431x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03061naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012100141300001600262500001500278520137700293650001601670650001101686650002001697650001801717650001101735650001601746650001901762650001501781650001301796650000901809650001301818650001601831650002501847650001201872650002401884650000901908650002401917650002601941650001101967650003601978650004002014650002002054650002802074650002202102650002202124650002802146651001002174653001502184653000802199653001602207700001602223700002002239700001502259773008302274852000902357930003302366945001302399946001102412655001202423IND2197008820221117203206.0990216e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219700882DNAL7 a97184942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevi, A.10aRumen-protected methionine or lysine supplementation of Comisana ewe's diets: effects on milk fatty acid composition  ap. 413-422.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of graded levels of dietary rumen-protected methionine (rp-Met) or lysine (rp-Lys) on the fatty acid composition of Comisana ewes' milk was investigated. The animals lambed in autumn and were separated from their lambs 7 weeks after parturition; they were divided into five groups of nine which were given different rations. The control group was fed on a mixture of vetch and oat hay with a pelleted concentrate; the other groups were given the control ration supplemented with rp-Met (3.5 or 7.0 g/kg) or rp-Lys (10.5 or 21.0 g/kg). Milk fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography, and these values were subjected to principal components analysis. A correlation was found between fatty acid composition and diet. We demonstrated that giving the experimental diets significantly affected milk fat, to an extent that was independent of the levels of the supplementary amino acids. The milk fat of the control group contained largely caprylic, capric and lauric acids, whereas that of the groups given the supplementary amino acids contained largely palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids. Thus supplementation resulted in an increase in the proportion of 16:0-18:3 (primarily palmitic and stearic) and a reduction in the proportion of 4:0-12:0 fatty acids. There was also a modest increase in the unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio. 3afatty acids 3alysine 3alactation stage 3afiber content 3adosage 3alipogenesis 3aprotein intake 3amethionine 3amilk fat 3aewes 3aewe milk 3afeed intake 3ametabolizable energy 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gas 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLysinexadministration & dosage 2aMethioninexadministration & dosage 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPalmitic Acidxanalysis 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aStearic Acidsxanalysis 3aItaly 0adry matter 0aash 0aewe feeding1 aBotunno, T.1 aDi Caterina, R.1 aMuscio, A.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1998 Aug., v. 65, no. 3 p.413-422x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle01395naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010300145300001600248520019700264650000900461650002200470650001400492650001500506650001600521650001200537650001100549650002800560650003000588650002800618650001100646650001400657650002300671650001400694650001700708653001300725700001800738700001600756700001600772773008300788852000900871930003300880945001300913946001100926655001200937IND2200858620221117203214.0990930e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220085862DNAL7 a101914772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrost, A.R.10aInfluence of milking interval on the total bacterial count in a simulated automatic milking system  ap. 125-129.  awould produce results that varied widely.

Their concentrations in the butter itself were calculated by determination of the distribution coefficient (K) through spiking butter samples with known quantities of methanethiol and dimethyldisulphide. The K values obtained suggest that the dimethyldisulphide had a greater affinity than methanethiol for the lipid phase of the butter. Solid phase microextraction used in conjunction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been shown to be an effective method for headspace analysis and was used for quantifying the butter headspace concentrations of the reduced sulphur compounds. Seasonal variation of both methanethiol and dimethyldisulphide were found in a series of butter samples, the highest concentration being in spring with an overall decrease through the New Zealand summer. Grass type and condition appeared to influence the concentrations of these compounds in the butter. Storage of the series of butter samples at 4 degrees C for 5 weeks resulted in a significant decrease in the concentrations of both methanethiol and dimethyldisulphide. The dimethylsulphide concentration in all butter samples was below the detection limit of the analytical system used. 3abutter 3aflavor compounds 3avolatile compounds 3athiols 3aseasonal variation 0asulfides (organic) 0amethanethiol 0adimethyldisulfide1 aJayatissa, N.1 aRenner, N.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1999 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.115-123x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02447naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013800127300001500265520145000280650001601730650002301746650001801769650001901787650002001806650001401826650004501840650001401885650001201899650002001911700001801931773008201949852000902031930003302040945001302073946001102086655001202097IND2200857820221117203120.0990930e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220085782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrlinger, F.10aUse of conventional biochemical tests and analyses of ribotype patterns for classification of micrococci isolated from dairy products  ap. 91-103.  aVarious methods were used to study 42 Gram-positive cocci belonging to the family of Micrococcaceae and isolated from dairy products. Only a few strains could be identified using the ATB 32 biochemical micromethod rapid gallery system (API). All strains were subjected to conventional biochemical tests. The results were then analysed by a numerical method using the Sokal-Michener similarity coefficient. The 42 strains were distributed into 10 clusters at the Euclidean distance of 3(.)2. Most (75%) of the isolates were identified at the species level, but Micrococcus luteus could not be differentiated from Mc. lylae within the Micrococcus genus. An identification method based on the analysis of ribotype patterns was then applied to the isolates and these were compared with the patterns of collection strains. Cellular DNA was cleaved by the restriction enzymes SacI and KpnI and probed with the peroxidase-labelled 16S+23S rRNA of Escherichia coli. Ribotype patterns were analysed using a Dice coefficient and the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages, making dendrogram construction possible. Of the strains investigated, > 84% were characterized to the species level. The remaining strains were found to belong to the Arthrobacter group or were atypical Micrococcus species. Of the isolates, 52% belonged to Micrococcus luteus, 17% were identified as Kocuria varians and 7% were assigned to the Brachybacterium genus. 3aMicrococcus 3astrain differences 3aribosomal DNA 3adairy products 3aenzyme activity 3aphylogeny 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aphenotype 3aKocuria 3aBrachybacterium1 aBergere, J.L.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1999 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.91-103x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001600221520164500237650001801882650002001900650001901920650000901939650000701948650001201955650001301967650001201980650001101992650001602003650001902019650001302038650001902051650001602070650001902086653000902105653001402114653001502128653000902143653002102152700001802173700001902191700001802210773008302228852000902311930003302320945001302353946001102366655001202377IND2061284920221117203133.0980114e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206128492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamkumar, C.10aEffect of pH and time on the quantity of readily available water within fresh cheese curd  ap. 123-134.  aSome of the textural changes that occur early in cheese maturation may be related to the redistribution of water within the cheese matrix. To examine this, a model cheese curd system was devised and explored. Initially, cheese curd was prepared using starter and chymosin and the curd pH was controlled by varying the draining and salting pH values. The quantity of serum that could be centrifuged from the resultant curd was less for lower pH curd and decreased in volume with time. The curd pH decreased with time. In the protocol finally adopted, milk was acidified with lactic acid and coagulated with Rennilase 46L. After cheddaring, salting and light pressing, the samples of this curd were finely diced and mixed with glucono-delta-lactone to give curd samples with comparable moisture contents, similar casein proteolysis rates but different pH values. The quantity of serum that could be centrifuged from these samples was greater for pH 5.6 curd than for pH 5.2 curd and decreased faster for the lower pH curd. Neither the curd moisture nor the pH changed significantly during curd storage and the casein proteolysis was low. These results for the model curd system are consistent with known water absorption characteristics of casein curd under 'equilibrium' conditions and the effects of pH and mineral salts on this absorption. It was concluded that, during the early stages of cheese ripening, there may be a redistribution of moisture within the cheese, related to the basic properties of the protein matrix and the transient effects of curd salting, rather than as a direct consequence of glycolytic and proteolytic changes. 3awater content 3acheese ripening 3acentrifugation 3awhey 3apH 3asalting 3amilk fat 3acalcium 3asodium 3abeta-casein 3aalphaS1-casein 3aduration 3agluconolactone 3aproteolysis 3aCheddar cheese 0asalt 0asyneresis 0acheddaring 0acurd 0aalphas1-1-casein1 aCreamer, L.K.1 aJohnston, K.A.1 aBennett, R.J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1997 Feb., v. 64, no. 1 p.123-134x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02408naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009500168300001600263520124800279650001701527650001201544650000901556650002201565650002101587650001101608650001601619650001101635650001201646653001601658653001901674653001701693653002201710700001801732773011501750852000901865856009201874930003301966946001101999655001202010IND4403295620221117203016.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440329562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01367.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanet, A.I.10aDo placental species abort offspring? Testing an assumption of the Trexler-DeAngelis model  ap. 323-331.  a1. We investigate how resource level affects reproduction in matrotrophic (Poeciliopsis prolifica) and lecithotrophic (P. monacha) fishes. 2. One of our goals was to test an assumption of the Trexler-DeAngelis model for the evolution of matrotrophy, which was that matrotrophic species can adjust litter size by aborting offspring in low food conditions. Our more general goal was to elucidate other differences between the reproductive modes. 3. Both species have superfetation and c. 30-day development time. Females of each species were assigned to high or low food availability for 30 days, or one gestation period. Any young born during that time interval would have initiated development before the initiation of the experiment. If embryos are aborted, then this would be seen as a reduction in brood size in the low food treatment relative to the high food treatment within this period. 4. Our results suggest P. monacha responds to low food by sacrificing reproduction to maintain lipids, while P. prolifica maintains reproduction at the expense of lipids. Neither species showed a significant reduction in offspring number over the course of the experiment, suggesting that these species do not abort offspring in low food conditions. 3aPoeciliopsis 3afemales 3afish 3afood availability 3agestation period 3alipids 3alitter size 3amodels 3aprogeny 0amatrotrophy 0aoffspring size 0aPoeciliopsis 0aTrexler-DeAngelis1 aReznick, D.N.0 tFunctional ecology.g2008 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.323-331dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01367.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01750naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005800164300001600222520072600238650001700964650001400981650001100995650001401006653001701020700001901037700002301056700003001079700001401109700002301123773011601146852000901262856008501271930003301356946001101389655001201400IND4402188820221117203048.0080302e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440218882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0831-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakida, F.

The inducing effect of volatiles was both intra- and interspecific. Chemical profiles of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the nonconidiated colonies grown in the dark and by the conidiating colonies were compared using solid-phase microextraction of headspace samples followed by tandem GC-MS. The conidiation was accompanied by increased production of eight-carbon compounds 1-octen-3-ol and its analogs 3-octanol and 3-octanone. When vapors of these compounds were applied individually to dark-grown colonies, they elicited their conidiation already at submicromolar concentrations. It is concluded that the eight-carbon VOCs act as signaling molecules regulating development and mediating intercolony communication in Trichoderma. 3avolatile organic compounds 3afungi 3aTrichoderma 3asporulation 0aconidiation 0asignaling1 aJakubíková, Lucia1 aViđen, Ivan.1 aFarkaš, Vladimír0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 July, v. 284, no. 2 p.231-236dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01202.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02434naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012200168300001600290520121700306653002901523653002301552653001801575653001901593653001701612653003301629653002701662653002401689653001501713653003901728700002001767700002201787773010601809852000901915856009201924930003302016946001102049655001202060IND4403902020221117203012.0080404e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440390202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.01963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGARDI, J.E.10aAutomatic sampling for unbiased and efficient stereological estimation using the proportionator in biological studies  ap. 108-120.  aQuantification of tissue properties is improved using the general proportionator sampling and estimation procedure: automatic image analysis and non-uniform sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS). The complete region of interest is partitioned into fields of view, and every field of view is given a weight (the size) proportional to the total amount of requested image analysis features in it. The fields of view sampled with known probabilities proportional to individual weight are the only ones seen by the observer who provides the correct count. Even though the image analysis and feature detection is clearly biased, the estimator is strictly unbiased. The proportionator is compared to the commonly applied sampling technique (systematic uniform random sampling in 2D space or so-called meander sampling) using three biological examples: estimating total number of granule cells in rat cerebellum, total number of orexin positive neurons in transgenic mice brain, and estimating the absolute area and the areal fraction of β islet cells in dog pancreas. The proportionator was at least eight times more efficient (precision and time combined) than traditional computer controlled sampling. 0aAutomatic image analysis 0aGFP positive cells 0ainsulin cells 0aorexin neurons 0aPPS-sampling 0arat cerebellar granule cells 0asimple random sampling 0asmooth fractionator 0astereology 0asystematic uniform random sampling1 aNYENGAARD, J.R.1 aGUNDERSEN, H.J.G.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2008 Apr., v. 230, no. 1 p.108-120dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.01963.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080404b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02368naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008900170300001600259520096800275650002001243650002101263650001401284650001601298650001201314650002301326650002401349650001701373650001001390650001501400650001701415650001201432650001701444653001701461653001801478700002101496700002101517700002201538700001801560700002001578700001801598773012501616852000901741856009201750930003301842946001101875655001201886IND4408669920221117203010.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440866992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01595.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAMANO, Haruna10aPurification and characterization of lipovitellin from Pacific saury Cololabis saira  ap. 830-836.  aLipovitellin (Lv), the major yolk protein derived from vitellogenin (Vg), was purified from vitellogenic ovaries of Pacific saury Cololabis saira using hydroxylapatite column chromatography followed by gel filtration. The apparent native mass of purified Lv was approximately 420 kDa, while the tertiary structure of Lv revealed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was typical of teleost Lvs, consisting of a heavy chain (~99 kDa) and a light chain (~34 kDa). Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against Pacific saury Lv revealed a specific reaction with a polypeptide (~194 kDa) that is present in serum from female Pacific saury but not in male serum, suggesting the approximately 194-kDa polypeptide to be the Vg monomer.

However, conventional procedures for evaluation of stover quality are expensive and thus limit the full exploitation of the available genetic variability. Our objective was to assess the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with a new sample presentation unit to determine feeding quality of maize stover. The plant material comprised maize inbreds and hybrids. The sample presentation unit was equipped with a near-infrared diode-array spectrometer. Coefficient of determination in cross-validation ranged between 0.77 and 0.94 for contents of dry matter, nitrogen, neutral detergent fibre and in vitro fermentability expressed as gas volume after 24h incubation time, but it was lower for ash content. It was concluded that NIRS with the new sample presentation unit was less accurate than laboratory NIRS to predict the standard reference methods. However, the new sample presentation unit might be used as a fast and efficient technique to perform large screenings of maize stover accessions in breeding programmes. 3aZea mays 3aash content 3abreeding 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acultivars 3adry matter content 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3aspectrometers 0afeeding quality 0asample presentation unit1 aMirdita, V.1 aKō.

All quarters of 18 cows were inoculated with 2 X 10(5) cfu Streptococcus agalactiae (Trial 1) and 20 cows with 10(5) cfu Str. uberis (Trial 2) 3-4 mm into the teat canal every 3 d for 12 d. Incidence of quarter infection was similar for both pathogens, 30/72 (42%) in Trial 1 and 32/80 (40 %) in Trial 2. Logistic regression analysis showed that probability of infection by Str. agalactiae increased significantly with an increase in quarter peak flow rate (P < 0.05) whereas probability of infection increased for Str. uberis with a decrease in teat canal length (P < 0.05). A significantly higher (P < 0.001) incidence of infection by Str. uberis was observed in quarters that contained a low wet weight (< 1.8 mg) of removable keratin compared with those that contained > 1.8 mg keratin, but there was no correlation between weight of keratin and length of the teat canal. Infections by Str. uberis took significantly less (P < 0.05) time to show a rise in somatic cell count above 7.5 X 10(5) cells/ml than Str. agalactiae. The results provide evidence that these pathogens use different mechanisms to pass through the teat canal. 3adairy cows 3ateats 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aStreptococcus uberis 3akeratin 3alength 3abovine mastitis 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDisease Susceptibilityxveterinary 2aFemale 2aKeratinsxanalysis 2aKinetics 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aRegression Analysis 2aStreptococcal Infections 2aStreptococcus agalactiae 0amachine milking 0amilk flow 0aexperimental infection 0ateat canal length1 aHillerton, J.E.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1995 Aug., v. 62, no. 3 p.395-404x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012400167300001400291520112900305650000801434650001301442650001501455650002801470650002401498650001501522650001501537650002001552650002001572650001301592650002301605650001401628650001401642653002101656653003701677653001301714653004101727653001801768700002201786773011801808852000901926856008501935930003302020946001102053655001202064IND4400496420221117203316.0080127e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440049642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-007-9180-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoubert, Yolaine 10aSimultaneous extraction of proteins and DNA by an enzymatic treatment of the cell wall of Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta)  ap. 55-61.  aThe extraction of proteins and DNA from seaweed tissue is difficult due to the presence of cell wall anionic polysaccharides that, after cell disruption, remain in the extraction medium as hydrocolloidal compounds. These compounds increase medium viscosity, thus limiting access to and, consequently, quantification of the soluble macromolecules such as proteins or DNA. This study describes a protocol that enables the simultaneous isolation of proteins and DNA from the red seaweed Palmaria palmata. It is based upon a specific form of hydrolysis using a mixture of cellulase and xylanase at different concentrations. This approach was carried out on samples collected during April and July, seasons in which differences in protein content have previously been reported. Our results confirm this report and also show that protein yield depends on the enzyme concentration used. As for DNA, this enzymatic digestion results in a much higher yield compared with the control. However, no seasonal differences are found for DNA and there is no clear link between the increase in DNA yield and the enzyme mixture concentration. 3aDNA 3aPalmaria 3acell walls 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahydrolysis 3amacroalgae 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aseasonal variation 3aviscosity 3axylanases 0aPalmaria palmata 0aEnzymatic digestion of cell wall 0aXylanase 0aProtein and phycoerythrin extraction 0aDNA isolation1 aFleurence, Joël 0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2008 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.55-61dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-007-9180-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080127b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03304naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245013400184300001600318520141800334650002801752650001301780650001201793650001401805650001401819650003601833650002201869650001401891650001001905650002401915650001001939650000901949650002201958650005401980650005602034650001102090650001102101650000902112650001602121650001402137650004202151650001702193650002002210700001802230700001902248700001602267700001502283700002102298700001402319700001802333700001802351700002202369700001902391773011102410852000902521856009202530930003302622946001102655655001202666IND4406763520221117203257.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440676352DNAL7 a179565442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00411.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, R.10aDoes the relationship between waist circumference, morbidity and mortality depend on measurement protocol for waist circumference  ap. 312-325.  aThere is currently no consensus regarding the optimal protocol for measurement of waist circumference (WC), and no scientific rationale is provided for any of the WC protocols recommended by leading health authorities. A panel of experts conducted a systematic review of 120 studies (236 samples) to determine whether measurement protocol influenced the relationship of WC with morbidity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes and with mortality from all causes and from CVD. Statistically significant associations with WC were reported for 65% (152) of the samples across all outcomes combined. Common WC protocols performed measurement at the minimal waist (33%), midpoint (26%) and umbilicus (27%). Non-significant associations were reported for 27% (64) of the samples. Most of these protocols measured WC at the midpoint (36%), umbilicus (28%) or minimal waist (25%). Significant associations were observed for 17 of the remaining 20 samples, but these were not significant when adjustment was made for covariates. For these samples, the most common WC protocols were the midpoint (35%) and umbilicus (30%). Similar patterns of association between the outcomes and all WC protocols were observed across sample size, sex, age, race and ethnicity. Our findings suggest that WC measurement protocol has no substantial influence on the association between WC, all-cause and CVD mortality, CVD and diabetes. 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3aexperts 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3asystematic review 3aumbilicus 3awaist 3awaist circumference 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiologyxmortality. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMorbidity 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aRisk Factors 2aWaist-Hip Ratio1 aBerentzen, T.1 aBradshaw, A.J.1 aJanssen, I.1 aKahn, H.S.1 aKatzmarzyk, P.T.1 aKuk, J.L.1 aSeidell, J.C.1 aSnijder, M.B.1 aSørensen, T.I.A.1 aDesprés, J-P.0 tObesity reviews.g2008 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.312-325dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00411.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02035naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008300144300001600227500001500243520055100258650001900809650002500828650003900853650001500892650002000907650001400927650002000941650002400961650004100985650002101026650003101047650003501078650006101113650002801174650002101202650002601223650001601249653001701265653001401282653003901296653002801335700001701363773008301380852000901463930003301472945001301505946001101518655001201529IND2052941220221117203308.0960910e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205294122DNAL7 a86557382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, R.10aPurification of tributyrin esterase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris E8  ap. 131-140.  a2019-12-05  aA tributyrin esterase was purified from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris E8 using FPLC chromatography.

After heating milk at 85 degrees C for 10 min, and storing for 22 h at 4, 20 or 30 degrees C, there was a marked increase in the concentration of kappa-casein in the serum. At 4 and 20 degrees C there was also slightly more beta-casein in the serum from heat-treated milk than in that from the corresponding raw milk. The whey proteins were extensively denatured, and were almost equally distributed between the supernatants and micellar pellets. After storage for 22 h the distribution of Ca and Pi between soluble and colloidal phases in heat-treated milk was similar to that in raw milk. After acidifying heat-treated milk by the addition of glucono-delta-lactone and storing for 22 h at 4, 20 or 30 degrees C there was progressive solubilization of colloidal calcium phosphate with decreasing pH, and at pH 5.0 almost all of the Ca and Pi was present in the serum. At 20 degrees C, and even more so at 4 degrees C, serum concentrations of the individual caseins increased considerably with decreasing pH, reaching maximum levels of about 25 and 40% of the total casein at pH 5.7 and 5.5 respectively, and then decreasing rapidly at lower pH. Compared with raw milk, maximum dissociation in heat-treated milks stored at 4 and 20 degrees C occurred at higher pH, and the overall levels of dissociation of individual caseins from the micelles were lower. At 30 degrees C, the concentrations of individual caseins in the serum of heat-treated milk decreased steadily as the pH was reduced, and did not show the slight increase found previously for raw milk. The role of the denatured whey proteins in interacting with kappa-casein and in promoting aggregation of the micelles on acidification is discussed. 3atemperature 3amicelles 3akappa-casein 3araw milk 3acalcium 3askim milk 3acolloids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3abeta-casein 3aalphaS1-casein 3awhey 3aduration 3apH 3astorage 3aheat treatment 3aacid treatment 0adenatured whey proteins 0amilk proteins 0aphosphates (salts) 0acasein0 tJournal of dairy research.g1996 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.35-48x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02615naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006300145300001400208520113200222650001301354650001901367650002501386650002101411650001901432650002001451650002901471650001201500650002201512650004101534650004201575650004001617650001101657650003101668650001901699650002501718650002201743650002001765650001001785651001001795651001001805653002101815700001401836700001801850700001501868700001701883700001401900773008101914852000901995930003302004945001302037946001102050655001202061IND2052939720221117203301.0960910e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205293972DNAL7 a86557422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChianese, L.10aOccurrence of five alpha(s1)-casein variants in ovine milk  ap. 49-59.  aFive ovine alpha s1-casein variants (A-E) were identified in an Italian population sample using gel electrophoresis at alkaline pH, gel isoelectric focusing, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against alpha s1-casein. Each casein sample produced two peaks by fast reversed-phase HPLC. Gel isoelectric focusing and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate that the first HPLC peak contained the 191 residue alpha s1-casein molecular species and the second the 199 residue species, in proportions of approximately 20:80. Only in the case of the sample containing alpha s1-casein CE was the method for the separation of the single short and long forms of each variant unsuccessful. Both two dimensional electrophoresis followed by staining with polyclonal antibodies against alpha s1-casein and electrospray mass spectrometry showed a heterogeneity consistent with that expected from a protein chain with three levels of phosphorylation and two different lengths. However, especially for alpha s1-caseins D and E, a further uncharacterized heterogeneity was detected. 3aewe milk 3aalphaS1-casein 3agenetic polymorphism 3amolecular weight 3agene frequency 3aphosphorylation 3abiochemical polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aImmunoblotting 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSheep 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aprotein analysis1 aGarro, G.1 aMauriello, R.1 aLaezza, P.1 aFerranti, P.1 aAddeo, F.0 tJournal of dairy research.g1996 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.49-59x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle01826naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016000126300001600286520081400302650003001116650001801146650001601164650000701180650002301187650001601210650002001226650002501246651001101271653003101282700001401313773008301327852000901410930003301419945001301452946001101465655001201476IND2048338820221117194759.0951019e199508  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204833882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirci, Y.10aAcidification test based on the use of biomass for screening of Leuconostoc.

Proteasome activity can be suppressed by specific peptide derivatives and by N‐tosyl‐lysine‐chloromethyl‐ketone (TLCK) and N‐tosyl‐phenylalanine‐chloromethyl‐ketone (TPCK), which affect the trypsine‐ and chymotrypsine‐like activities of the proteasome, respectively. Particularly TLCK and TPCK caused necrotic cell death in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a control, the effects of these protease inhibitors on the survival of human WISH cells were also studied. Bleaching of the Chlamydomonas cells after addition of TLCK or TPCK indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in this process. Indeed, increased levels of ROS were detected in Chlamydomonas cells treated with TLCK or TPCK. Furthermore, cell death induced by these protease inhibitors was accelerated by illumination and prevented or slowed down by scavengers of ROS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aapoptosis 3ableaching 3ahumans 3alighting 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areactive oxygen species1 aWoestemeyer, Johannes0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2015 Nov., v. 62, no. 6 p.711-721dSociety of Protozoologistsx1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.122243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015800204300001200362520183000374592002802204650001302232650003402245650002502279650001302304650001302317650001902330650001002349650002002359650001002379650002502389650000902414650001102423650002202434650002302456700006102479700002502540700006002565700005802625700006002683700006102743700006002804700005902864700006102923773014702984856008303131852000903214655001203223IND60777110520221120224539.0220916e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077711052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04317-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Loy, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2524-726410aStimulation of the atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) by a small-molecule agonist attenuates fibrosis in a preclinical liver but not lung injury model  ap. 293.  aAtypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3, formerly CXC chemokine receptor 7) is a G protein-coupled receptor that recruits β-arrestins, but is devoid of functional G protein signaling after receptor stimulation. In preclinical models of liver and lung fibrosis, ACKR3 was previously shown to be upregulated after acute injury in liver sinusoidal and pulmonary capillary endothelial cells, respectively. This upregulation was linked with a pro-regenerative and anti-fibrotic role for ACKR3. A recently described ACKR3-targeting small molecule agonist protected mice from isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis. Here, we aimed to evaluate its protective role in preclinical models of liver and lung fibrosis. After confirming its in vitro pharmacological activity (i.e., ACKR3-mediated β-arrestin recruitment and receptor binding), in vivo administration of this ACKR3 agonist led to increased mouse CXCL12 plasma levels, indicating in vivo interaction of the agonist with ACKR3. Whereas twice daily in vivo administration of the ACKR3 agonist lacked inhibitory effect on bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, it had a modest, but significant anti-fibrotic effect in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced liver fibrosis model. In the latter model, ACKR3 stimulation affected the expression of several fibrosis-related genes and led to reduced collagen content as determined by picro-sirius red staining and hydroxyproline quantification. These data confirm that ACKR3 agonism, at least to some extent, attenuates fibrosis, although this effect is rather modest and heterogeneous across various tissue types. Stimulating ACKR3 alone without intervening in other signaling pathways involved in the multicellular crosstalk leading to fibrosis will, therefore, most likely not be sufficient to deliver a satisfactory clinical outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aatypical chemokine receptor 3 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acollagen 3afibrosis 3ahydroxyproline 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3alungs 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3amodels 3aprotective effect 3apulmonary fibrosis1 aDe Jonghe, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3872-65581 aCastermans, Karolien1 aDheedene, Wouter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8798-03951 aStoop, Reinout1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8773-82481 aVerschuren, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7847-90371 aVersele, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9274-65791 aChaltin, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6692-50041 aLuttun, Aernout1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7902-95241 aSchols, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3256-58500 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.293-293dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04317-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245007300167300001800240520162100258592002801879650001301907650001701920650002801937650001601965650001201981650001101993650001102004650002202015650001002037650001102047650001902058650001202077650001002089653002002099653001802119653001602137653002502153653002302178653001502201653001202216653001602228700002002244700002302264700001902287773011302306856008002419852000902499655001202508IND60616561220221119063843.0181017e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061656122DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175155734052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Kok, Margreet10aFailure modes of conducting yarns in electronic-textile applications  ap. 1749-1760.  aIntegration of electronic functionalities into textiles adds to the value of textiles. It allows measuring, detecting, actuating and treating or communicating with a body or object. These added values can render the smart textiles very useful, fun, supporting, protecting or even lifesaving. It is, however, important for the comfort, acceptance and functionality to have integration of electronics as unobtrusive as possible. One elegant unobtrusive method of integration is to have circuitry included in the textile and mount components to this circuitry. Conducting yarns introduced by weaving, knitting or embroidery are attractive candidates to compose the circuitry as they do not disturb the textile nature of the system and are processable by the mentioned conventional textile technologies. In the case that these smart textiles are worn by humans under dynamic circumstances, the system is exposed to mechanical stress. In this paper we report the results of studies on the failure modes of Ag-coated nylon yarns, which are applied on textile carriers by means of stitching or soutache embroidery. The test methods varied in combinations of mechanical stress, such as shearing, bending and tension, and support to better understand the process of deterioration of the yarns when these are mechanically stressed. The delamination of the Ag coating from the yarns leads to unstable resistance values in non-static conditions. The mechanical forces, such as shearing, bending and tension, cause progressively more damage to the filaments of the yarns. This leads to a reduction of the electrical conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adelamination 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronics 3afabrics 3aforces 3ahumans 3amechanical stress 3anylon 3asilver 3atextile fibers 3aweaving 3ayarns 0aconducting yarn 0afailure modes 0areliability 0aAg-coated nylon yarn 0adelamination of Ag 0astretching 0aflexing 0apercolation1 aVries, Hans de,1 aPacheco, Katharine1 avan Heck, Gert0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 85, no. 16 p.1749-1760dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175155734053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245014000175520178100315592002802096650002302124650001802147650001502165650001402180650001102194650001302205650002302218650001502241650001402256650002502270650002202295650001002317651001102327653001502338653002102353653001302374653002702387653003002414700002202444700003302466700006602499773012402565856008402689852000902773655001202782IND60733447320221123030103.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073344732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Serrano, Diana10aMesquite management in the Mezquital Valley: A sustainability assessment based on the view point of the Hñähñú indigenous community  aThe indigenous community of El Alberto (Ixmiquilpan, Mexico), in the Mezquital Valley, has applied numerous uses of the mesquite (Prosopis laevigata) resources in their daily life for decades. Our objective was to understand the relationship between the rural community and this leguminous tree, to determine how sustainable their management is. For this purpose, we applied the Framework for the Evaluation of Management Systems using Indicators (MESMIS, Spanish acronym). Twenty-one indicators were identified, and a qualitative index was established to assign a sustainability value. The results identified fuelwood, fertility, forage and shade as the principal uses of mesquite nowadays. The local indigenous community does not promote the propagation of this leguminous tree but rather rely on its natural regeneration. However, the rate at which they cut down and exploit mesquite is higher than the natural regeneration rate, reflecting a low level of sustainable management. Strong equity was registered. First, there is a passive process associated with the construction of irrigation channels for agriculture, which resulted in the deforestation of the mesquite. Second, there is evidence of an active process where members of the community decide to migrate abandoning their indigenous worldview, which, consequently, has impacted negatively on the mesquite resource. Change processes caused a shift in the community’s worldview and led to cultural erosion. In conclusion, changes must be made to the community’s current social ecological system to achieve sustainable management, such as building a strong feeling of community identity, evolution of the community’s uses, customs, quality and lifestyle, and their collaboration with the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis laevigata 3adeforestation 3aecosystems 3aevolution 3aforage 3afuelwood 3aindigenous peoples 3airrigation 3alifestyle 3anatural regeneration 3arural communities 3atrees 3aMexico 0aHñähñú 0aMESMIS framework 0aMesquite 0aRural socio-ecosystems 0aSustainability indicators1 aCabirol, Nathalie1 aMartínez-Cervantes, Celeste1 aRojas-Oropeza, Marcelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8357-26740 tEnvironmental and sustainability indicators.g2021 June, v. 10 p.100113-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27272x2665-97277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245005200167500002200219520093800241592002801179650001401207650001301221650002001234700001401254700002201268700001501290700001401305700001601319700001501335700001701350700001901367700001601386700002101402700001801423700005601441773005101497856008401548852000901632655001201641IND60568998820221120183047.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056899882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Quang, T.10aEpitaxial electrical contact to graphene on SiC  aPre-press version  aEstablishing good electrical contacts to nanoscale devices is a major issue for modern technology and contacting 2D materials is no exception to the rule. One-dimensional edge-contacts to graphene were recently shown to outperform surface contacts but the method remains difficult to scale up. We report a resist-free and scalable method to fabricate few graphene layers with electrical contacts in a single growth step. This method derives from the discovery reported here of the growth of few graphene layers on a metallic carbide by thermal annealing of a carbide forming metallic film on SiC in high vacuum. We exploit the combined effect of edge-contact and partially-covalent surface epitaxy between graphene and the metallic carbide to fabricate devices in which low contact-resistance and Josephson effect are observed. Implementing this approach could significantly simplify the realization of large-scale graphene circuits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3agraphene 3asilicon carbide1 aHuder, L.1 aBregolin, F.

The structure of each copolymer was confirmed by ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance. The molecular weight was determined directly by gel permeation chromatography and indirectly by the intrinsic viscosity. The results of thermal tests revealed that both melting temperature (Tₘ) and crystallization temperature (Tc) decreased as the aliphatic segment content increased. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) that were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis followed the same trend as did Tₘ. Moreover, the thermal stability, determined from thermogravimetric analysis, declined as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and AA were incorporated into the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) main chains. All of the polymers that were synthesized herein were spun into fibers and then physically characterized. The tenacity of the fibers decreased as the soft-segment content increased. The crystalline structures, revealed by wide-angle X-ray scattering, indicated that the crystallinity decreased with increasing AA content because of the reduction of regularity of the PET chains. Most importantly, the tests that were carried out on the knitted fabric demonstrated that the moisture regain and cool feeling (qₘₐₓ) of the copolymer fabrics were better than those of fabrics that comprised neat PET chains, owing to the incorporation of soft PEG segments. Finally, the copolymer fabric exhibited better hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation than did neat PET fabric.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipic acid 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3afabrics 3agel chromatography 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrolysis 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3atextile fibers 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0aaliphatic/aromatic copolyesters 0aadipic acid 0apolyethylene glycol 0afiber1 aLin, Wei-Peng0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 85, no. 16 p.1691-1703dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175155734063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013900163300001600302520138900318592002801707650001501735650002201750650001801772650001001790650002501800650001401825650001901839650001801858650003301876650001301909651001101922700002401933700002301957700002901980773012002009856007302129852000902202655001202211IND60438722420221118044249.0151023e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043872242DNAL7 a10.1111/jeu.122282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Noemi M.10aRedescription and Phylogenetic Position of Condylostoma arenarium Spiegel, 1926 (Ciliophora, Heterotrichea) from Guanabara Bay, Brazil  ap. 722-732.  aDetails on Condylostoma arenarium infraciliature have not been described; therefore, it is considered a poorly known species. The lack of detailed description on C. arenarium morphology caused several misidentifications that have accumulated in the literature. In this study, we present the first complete description of C. arenarium infraciliature based on protargol‐impregnated organisms and scanning electron microscopy. We also have inferred the phylogenetic position of this species based on 18S rRNA sequences. The main characteristics of C. arenarium population from Guanabara Bay are as follows: in vivo elongated body shape with 350–600 μm length × 70–220 μm width, they are highly contractile when subjected to disturbances, green‐yellowish cortical granules are present, contractile vacuoles absent, V‐shaped peristome comprises approximately 1/5 of the total length, adoral zone with 83–145 membranelles, 1–2 small frontal cirrus observed only in impregnated specimens, 10–15 fiber‐like stripes arranged transversely on the inner wall of the oral cavity, 30–45 somatic kineties, moniliform macronucleus with 15–20 nodules. Some observations on morphogenesis of C. arenarium were also included. In phylogenetic analyses, C. arenarium clustered with Condylostoma sp. within a clade composed of three C. curva sequences with high support values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3acortical granules 3amorphogenesis 3amouth 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aredescriptions 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3avacuoles 3aBrazil1 aDias, Roberto J.

Compared to the soil background values of Shanghai, 31 soil samples out of 33 were highly contaminated with Cd, and 76% were moderately contaminated by Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Principal component analysis and clustering analysis indicated that Pb and Cd mainly originated from anthropogenic sources, while Zn, Cr, Ni, and Cu were mainly from natural sources. Relatively high concentrations of Cd and Pb were observed at sampling points near the landing or take-off sites or a close-by highway. Both air and highway traffic affected the quality of the soils at PIA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aairports 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acopper 3alead 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil sampling 3atraffic 3azinc 3aChina 0ametals 0arisk assessment 0asources analysis 0asoil 0aairport1 aZhu, Aiyun1 aYao, Wei1 aZhang, Wenqi1 aMen, Yong1 aDing, Guoyu0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2014 Sept. 14, v. 96, no. 8 p.1153-1161dTaylor & Francisx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2015.10198853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158300001800269500001400287520107400301592002801375650001501403650001901418650001801437650001301455650001601468650002201484650001801506650001801524650002101542650001401563650002301577650001801600650001001618653001101628653004401639653002401683700002201707700001801729700001801747700002401765700002001789700002001809700001901829700002001848773018601868856007402054852000902128655001202137IND60692157320221119132934.0200502e20111223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069215732DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1104522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMATSUDA, Yuji10aCoffee and Caffeine Improve Insulin Sensitivity and Glucose Tolerance in C57BL/6J Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet  ap. 2309-2315.  aNAL-light  aWe have previously demonstrated that coffee and caffeine ameliorated hyperglycemia in spontaneously diabetic KK-Aʸ mice. This present study evaluates the antidiabetic effects of coffee and caffeine on high-fat-diet-induced impaired glucose tolerance in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet were given regular drinking water (control group), or a 2.5-fold-diluted coffee or caffeine solution (200 mg/L) for 17 weeks. The ingestion of coffee or caffeine improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hyperinsulinemia when compared with mice in the control group. The adipose tissue mRNA levels of inflammatory adipocytokines (MCP-1 and IL-6) and the liver mRNA levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis were lower in the coffee and caffeine groups than those in the control group. These results suggest that coffee and caffeine exerted an ameliorative effect on high-fat-diet-induced impaired glucose tolerance by improving insulin sensitivity. This effect might be attributable in part to the reduction of inflammatory adipocytokine expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipokines 3aadipose tissue 3abiotechnology 3acaffeine 3afatty acids 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperinsulinemia 3aingestion 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 0acoffee 0adiet-induced impaired glucose tolerance 0aantidiabetic effect1 aKOBAYASHI, Misato1 aYAMAUCHI, Rie1 aOJIKA, Makoto1 aHIRAMITSU, Masanori1 aInoue, Takashi,1 aKATAGIRI, Takao1 aMURAI, Atsushi1 aHORIO, Fumihiko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2011 Dec. 23, v. 75, no. 12 p.2309-2315dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1104523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245008400181300001600265520130200281592002801583650001601611650001201627650002001639650002101659650001701680650000901697650002601706650001201732650000701744650002001751650001901771650001901790653004001809653001801849653002001867653001501887653001001902653001701912653002101929700001601950700005701966773011402023856009402137852000902231655001202240IND60609956420221118033205.0190628e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060995642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPornwannachai, W.10aFire-resistant natural fibre-reinforced composites from flame retarded textiles  ap. 115-123.  aThermoplastic composites were prepared by melt pressing fabrics from commingled natural (flax) –thermoplastic (polypropylene (PP) and polylactic acid (PLA)) polymeric fibres. Fabrics were treated with a number of commercial flame retardants (FRs) used for textiles prior to composite preparation. Their flammabilities and mechanical performances have been evaluated in terms of FR types effective on each fibre type. The fire performances of the composite laminates evaluated using UL-94 showed that flax/PP control and all flame retarded composite samples failed the UL-94 test, except for one treated with organophosphonate FR. On the other hand all flame retarded flax/PLA samples achieved V0 rating. Cone calorimetric results obtained at 35 kW/m2 also showed that all FRs significantly reduced the flammability of the composites and that their efficiencies were more pronounced in flax/PLA than in flax/PP composites. The mechanical performances of composites evaluated in tensile, flexural and impact modes indicated that all flame retardants reduced the mechanical properties of the composites, with the extent of reduction dependent on the pH of the flame retardant solution used. The reduction in mechanical properties was more severe in flax/PLA composites than in flax/PP composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3afabrics 3afire resistance 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aflax 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3apH 3apolylactic acid 3apolypropylenes 3athermoplastics 0aNatural fibre-reinforced composites 0aPolypropylene 0aPolylactic acid 0aFlax fibre 0aUL-94 0aFlammability 0aCone calorimetry1 aEbdon, J.R.1 aKandola, B.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3621-37240 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2018 Aug., v. 154 p.115-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012000168300002000288520147400308592002801782650002001810650002001830650002001850650001701870650001601887653003101903653003001934653003001964653002401994700001602018700002102034700001202055700001902067700002002086700001702106700005602123700005602179773014602235856008602381852000902467655001202476IND60759810820221120153414.0211213e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075981082DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c065722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fangke10aStructural Design for Controlling the Lattice Strain Relaxation Process in TiO₂/SiO₂ Core–Shell Nanoparticles  ap. 16796-16807.  aSubstantial lattice strain arising from lattice misfit of the components of core–shell nanomaterials used to accommodate lanthanide emitters usually significantly results in an inhomogeneous shell, which substantially degrades the luminescence performance. We systematically studied the epitaxial habit, crystallization process, and interfacial energy transfer behavior of Tb³⁺- and Eu³⁺-doped TiO₂/SiO₂ multilayer core–shell and hollow multishell nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that lattice strain relaxation leads to shell reconstruction and the formation of interfacial defects and facilitates phase transformation for the first time. We also demonstrate that the lattice strain relaxation mode is determined by the structure. In particular, this is the first report of a unique shell reconstruction mode that decreases the size of C@SiO₂@TiO₂@SiO₂ hollow triple-shell nanospheres with the consequent formation of wrinkles. By exploiting a rational structural design, the adverse effects of misfit strain can be minimized. Two types of “defect-free” interfaces and the resulting two types of interfacial energy transfer are integrated into one system, which are achieved by an alloyed interface and a sharp interface with high lattice strain. Our investigation on the strain relaxation process and the strain engineering approach is expected to shed more light on precise control of the fabrication and functionality of nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aenergy transfer 3agreen chemistry 3aluminescence 3ananospheres 0arare earth-doped TiO2/SiO2 0alattice strain relaxation 0ashell reconstruction mode 0ainterfacial defects1 aLi, Jingyao1 aZhang, Xiangting1 aSun, Qi1 aZheng, Baofeng1 aZhang, Xiaozhen1 aZhu, Haiyuan1 aSong, Yanhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3322-75381 aZou, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1331-27380 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 9, no. 49 p.16796-16807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c065723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245010200173300001400275520074300289592002801032650002001060650000801080650001901088650002201107650001401129650000901143650001901152650001001171650001101181650001101192650001601203650002001219650002601239650001201265650002901277650001001306650001101316700002001327700002501347773009701372856008001469852000901549655001201558IND60083008720221122215356.0141101e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, G.

We focused on thermoholophilic Rhodothermus marinus JCM9785 as a CE producer, since a CE-like gene was found in the genome of R. marinus DSM4252. CE activity was detected in the cell extract of R. marinus JCM9785. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CE gene from R. marinus JCM9785 (RmCE) was 94.2% identical to that from R. marinus DSM4252. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and tryptic peptide masses of the native enzyme matched those of RmCE. The recombinant RmCE was most active at 80 °C at pH 6.3, and stable in a range of pH 3.2–10.8 and below 80 °C.

Moreover to support biological indicators an hydromorphological analysis is also requested for each river type. The rationale for including an habitat assessment in biomonitoring study is that a biological community can be influenced by habitat quality just as water chemistry. In the present work benthic macroinvertebrates were analysed in a specific river type of Central Italy (small-sized streams, volcanic-siliceous), to identify taxa assemblages at the mesohabitat scale and to test how common measures of benthic community used in biomonitoring differ between riffles and pools in order to evaluate if differences may influence water quality classification. Macroinvertebrates were collected in 10 selected streams, covering the whole quality range present in the geographic area from ‘reference sites’ to human-impacted sites, along a pool–riffle sequence following a multihabitat sampling protocol. We compared assemblage of macroinvertebrates found in different mesohabitats using principal component analysis (PCA). Similar site grouping was obtained in riffle, pool and abiotic analysis. The measures of diversity and abundance were used as replicates in ANOVA analysis to test differences between pools and riffles within the groups of sites. There were no significant differences in terms of taxa richness and total abundance. When we compared the abundance of each taxon we found significant differences only in the group of reference sites with 18 taxa (about 25%) that showed a significant habitat preference. Our findings support that macroinvertebrates assemblages reflected primarily the environmental conditions and differences at mesohabitat scale are strongly correlated to hydromorphological condition and are maximized in reference sites. However such differences do not influence the ecological status assessment in this typology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aenvironmental factors 3aguidelines 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahydrochemistry 3aindicator species 3amacroinvertebrates 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3awater quality 3aItaly1 aAndreani, Paolo1 aBarile, Mariachiara1 aBuffagni, Andrea1 aErba, Stefania1 aMancini, Laura1 aBelfiore, Carlo0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.688-696dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245013700175300001400312520092500326592002801251650001201279650001501291650001301306650001601319650001301335650000901348650001101357650001001368653002201378653001301400653002301413653002001436653002201456700001901478700001701497700001101514700001401525773011201539856009401651852000901745655001201754IND60609956620221118033229.0190628e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060995662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wenzong10aImproving fire safety of epoxy filled with graphene hybrid incorporated with zeolitic imidazolate framework/layered double hydroxide  ap. 27-36.  aIn this work, a novel graphene (RGO) hybrid added with Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework/Layered Double Hydroxide (ZIF/LDH) was prepared to obtain a synergistic system (RGO-LDH/ZIF-67). Subsequently, RGO-LDH/ZIF-67 was mixed into epoxy resin (EP) by physical blending for the purpose of improving its fire safety. Based on a series of tests and analyses, it was found that RGO-LDH/ZIF-67 was beneficial to reducing the heat release of EP during its burning process. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) of the composite with 2 wt% RGO-LDH/ZIF-67 were reduced to 464 kW m−2 and 37.9 MJ m−2, respectively. Simultaneously, the smoke production in its flame and flameless combustion were also reduced significantly. According to the char analysis of different composites, the main mechanism is discussed. This work provided a new type of modified RGO for improving the fire safety of EP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acombustion 3aepoxides 3afire safety 3agraphene 3aheat 3amixing 3asmoke 0aHybrid composites 0aGraphene 0aLayered structures 0aFlame retardant 0aSmoke suppression1 aWang, Xiaoling1 aLiu, Yucheng1 aLi, Wu1 aChen, Rui0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2018 Aug., v. 154 p.27-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012800163300001800291520125300309592002801562650002301590650001101613650001401624650001501638650001601653650002101669650002801690650001301718650001201731650001001743650001001753650001301763650000901776650001701785653001001802653001501812653001301827653001701840653002301857700001801880700001701898700001701915700002301932700001801955773015401973856007802127852000902205655001202214IND60539601320221116192408.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053960132DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-93922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Brien, K.V.14aThe effects of postexercise consumption of a kefir beverage on performance and recovery during intensive endurance training  ap. 7446-7449.  aThis study was designed to determine whether kefir accentuates the positive health benefits assessed by measures in fitness, body composition, or both, as a measure of cardiovascular disease risk as well as the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Sixty-seven adult males and females aged 18 to 24 yr were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: (1) endurance training + control beverage, (2) endurance training +kefir beverage,(3) active control + control beverage, or (4) active control + kefir beverage. The exercise groups completed 15wk of structured endurancetraining while the active control groups maintained their usual exercise routine. Additionally, each group was assigned to either a kefir or a calorie/macronutrient matched placebo beverage that was consumed twice per week. No significant interactions were found among groups with respect to outcome variables with the exception of serum CRP. The endurance training was effective in improving 1.5-mile (2.41km) times and kefir supplementation may have been a factor in attenuating the increase in CRP that was observed over the course of the intervention period. This preliminary study suggests that kefir may be involved in improving the risk profile for cardiovascular disease as defined by CRP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadults 3abeverages 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody composition 3acardiovascular diseases 3aexercise 3afemales 3akefir 3amales 3aplacebos 3arisk 3arisk profile 0akefir 0aprobiotics 0aexercise 0ainflammation 0aC-reactive protein1 aStewart, L.K.1 aForney, L.A.1 aAryana, K.J.1 aPrinyawiwatkul, W.1 aBoeneke, C.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Nov., v. 98, no. 11 p.7446-7449dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-93923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014600157300002000303500001900323520127100342592002801613650001301641650001901654650002401673650001001697650002401707650001401731650001901745650001901764650001701783650000901800700002401809773012501833856007401958852000902032655001202041IND60689153420221123033216.0200419e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068915342DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01725f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeli, Babak10aAtomic-scale synthesis of nanoporous gallium–zinc oxynitride-reduced graphene oxide photocatalyst with tailored carrier transport mechanism  ap. 14906-14914.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface modified gallium–zinc oxynitride solid solution exhibited outstanding stability and visible-light activity for water splitting. However, the considerable rate of photo-induced charge recombination and the low surface area of the bulk photocatalyst limited its performance. Here, an efficient technique is proposed for the synthesis of a nanoporous oxynitride photocatalyst and its graphene-hybridized material. The nanoporous oxynitride photocatalyst was prepared via a nanoscale solid-state route, using microwave irradiation as an intermolecular-state activation method, Ga³⁺/Zn²⁺ layered double hydroxide as an atomic-level uniform mixed-metal precursor, and urea as a non-toxic ammonolysis soft-template. The graphene-hybridized photocatalyst was fabricated using a facile electrostatic self-assembly technique. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized graphene hybridized nanoporous oxynitride photocatalyst was systematically improved through shortening the majority-carrier diffusion length and enhancing the density of active hydrogen evolution sites within the quasi-three-dimensional nanostructure, reaching 7.5-fold sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, compared to the conventional 1 wt% Rh-loaded oxynitride photocatalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3alight 3amicrowave radiation 3ananopores 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asurface area 3aurea1 aTaghipour, Fariborz0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 10, no. 25 p.14906-14914dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01725f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017100168300001200339520159000351592002801941650002401969650001301993650003102006650002002037650001402057650001902071650001402090650002002104650003102124650001002155650001302165650002002178650001702198650001302215650001502228650002202243650001702265700002002282700001902302700001902321700002402340700002802364700005902392773010902451856008302560852000902643655001202652IND60777111220221120213757.0220628e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077711122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-022-02880-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahbobi, Ramina10aHelicobacter pylori Infection Mediates Inflammation and Tumorigenesis-Associated Genes Through miR-155-5p: An Integrative Omics and Bioinformatics-Based Investigation  ap. 192.  aHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major human pathogenic bacterium that survives in the gastric mucosa. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of the target gene network of miR-155-5p in H. pylori-related gastritis using a combination of public gene expression datasets and web-based platforms. To evaluate the expression of genes related to gastritis, we used two datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we determined the overlaps between the predicted miR-155-5p target genes and gastritis-dysregulated GEO datasets genes; in the next step, we identified the possible miR-155-5p target-DEGs (Target-Differentially Expressed Genes). Also, we performed multiple bioinformatics analyses to identify the most important targets and downstream pathways associated with this miRNA. Using the UCSC cancer genomic browser analysis tool, we investigated the expression of hub genes in relation to gastric cancer and H. pylori infection, as well as the potential role of hub genes in gastritis, inflammation, and cancer. In this regard, 28 differentially expressed target genes of miR-155-5p were identified. Most of the captured target genes were correlated with the host immune response and inflammation. Based on the specific patterns of expression in gastritis and cancer, CD9, MST1R, and ADAM10 were candidates for the most probable targets of miR-155-5p. Although the focus of this study is primarily on bioinformatics, we think that our findings should be experimentally validated before they can be used as potential therapeutic and diagnostic tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aInternet 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agastric mucosa 3agastritis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amicroRNA 3amultiomics 3astomach neoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aFallah, Fatemeh1 aBehmanesh, Ali1 aYadegar, Abbas1 aHakemi-Vala, Mojdeh1 aEhsanzadeh, Seyed Jafar1 aShams, Roshanak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7141-57350 tCurrent microbiology.g2022 July, v. 79, no. 7 p.192-192dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-022-02880-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245012800205300002000333520113600353592002801489650001501517650001401532650001101546650001601557650001301573650002201586700002201608700001901630700002001649700002201669773013701691856008001828852000901908655001201917IND60606152920180918000000.0180724e20180507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060615292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b023482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Amaresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1048-794610aLow Energy Gap Triphenylamine–Heteropentacene–Dicyanovinyl Triad for Solution-Processed Bulk-Heterojunction Solar Cells  ap. 11262-11269.  aA low bandgap D–D–A (D = donor; A = acceptor) type conjugated molecular triad TPA-SN5-DCV has been implemented in solution-processed organic solar cells using PC₇₁BM as acceptor. The molecule showed a narrow optical energy gap of 1.59 eV, and a broad absorption spectrum ranging from 350 to 750 nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were used to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels and are −5.10 and −3.53 eV, respectively. After the optimization of the donor and acceptor (PC₇₁BM) weight ratio, the device based on as cast TPA-SN5-DCV:PC₇₁BM (1:2) active layer exhibited overall PCE of 3.34%, which was improved to 6.31% using 0.3 vol % 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as solvent additive (SA). Further optimization of the DIO-treated active layer via thermal annealing (TA) resulted in a markedly improved PCE of 7.26%. The enhancement in PCE after either SA or SA + TA treatment is largely accredited to the increase in both JSC and FF, which is associated with the superior nanoscale morphology, broadening of absorption, and balanced charge transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aannealing 3aenergy 3asolar cells 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis1 aWetzel, Christoph1 aSinghal, Rahul1 aBäuerle, Peter1 aSharma, Ganesh D.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 07, v. 122, no. 21 p.11262-11269dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b023483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011100172300001800283520049600301592002800797650001600825650002300841650002300864650001100887650001600898650001800914650001400932650003000946700001700976700002100993700002601014700001801040700003801058700002001096700006101116700006001177773012001237856008301357852000901440655001201449IND60685761520200413000000.0200306e20200219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068576152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b045252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalo-Nieto, Carlos10aCopper Reactivity Can Be Tuned to Catalyze the Stereoselective Synthesis of 2-Deoxyglycosides from Glycals  ap. 1991-1996.  aWe demonstrate that tuning the reactivity of Cu by the choice of oxidation state and counterion leads to the activation of both “armed” and “disarmed” type glycals toward direct glycosylation leading to the α-stereoselective synthesis of deoxyglycosides in good to excellent yields.

The rats were assigned to 3 groups 10 d after the colitis induction, and fed for 24 d on a control diet or diet including 60 g of DP4 or DP8/kg. The fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and IgA concentration were monitored every 7 d. The colonic MPO activities and cecal concentrations of organic acids, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, mucin and IgA were measured at the end of the study. DP4, but not DP8, significantly reduced the colonic inflammation accompanied by higher cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, propionate in particular, and lactic acid-producing bacteria. DP4 therefore accelerated the healing process of TNBS-induced colitis, even when the treatment was initiated after inducing colitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3abiotechnology 3acolitis 3adiet 3afructans 3ainflammation 3amucins 3amyeloperoxidase 3apolymerization 3apropionic acid 3asulfonic acids 0ashort-chain inulin-like fructans 0ashort-chain fatty acids 0alactobacilli 0atrinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis 0arats1 aITO, Hiroyuki1 aBITO, Hiroyuki1 aKAWAGISHI, Hirokazu1 aMorita, Tatsuya,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2011 Nov. 23, v. 75, no. 11 p.2169-2174dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1104603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245009000208300002000298520114300318592002801461650002301489650002101512650002101533650001401554650002501568650002101593650002001614650002601634650001901660650002001679650001301699650001501712650001901727653004001746653000901786653001001795700006201805700005801867773014601925856008602071852000902157655001202166IND60759811020221120153342.0211213e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075981102DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c066852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFularz, Agata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7794-617710aSERS Enhancement of Porphyrin-Type Molecules on Metal-Free Cellulose-Based Substrates  ap. 16808-16819.  aThe detection of analytes using spectroscopy methods, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), is crucial in the fields of medical diagnostics, forensics, security, and environmental monitoring. In recent years, a lot of focus has been directed toward organic polymer material-based SERS platforms due to their lower cost, controllable synthesis and fabrication, structural versatility, as well as biocompatibility and biodegradability. Here, we report that cellulose nanofiber-based substrates can be used as a metal-free SERS platform for the detection of porphyrin-type molecules. We report SERS signal enhancement for five different porphyrin molecules with exceptional 2 orders of magnitude peak intensity enhancement observed resulting in a detection limit of 10–⁵ M. We show that the cellulose-based platform is more suitable for porphyrin molecule detection than traditionally used semiconductor materials like graphene oxide. The observed enhancement is attributed to the disturbed growth of self-assembled structures on the cellulose nanofibers and the generation of disordered 3D clusters of porphyrin molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3agraphene oxide 3agreen chemistry 3apolymers 3aporphyrins 3asemiconductors 0asurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy 0aSERS 0aRaman1 aAlmohammed, Sawsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5990-50881 aRice, James H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1035-57080 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 02, v. 9, no. 49 p.16808-16819dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c066853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245009600181300001600277520098100293592002801274650001501302650001901317650001501336650000901351650001201360650000901372653001901381653002501400653002501425700003201450700002101482700001701503773011201520856008401632852000901716655001201725IND60125793320221117071701.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012579332DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2014.9773832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEchterling-Savage, Kristyn10aEffects of Caregiver-Implemented Aggression Reduction Procedure on Problem Behavior of Dogs  ap. 181-197.  aProblem behavior of companion animals poses a threat to caregivers, other targets of problem behavior (e.g., strangers, other nonhuman animals), and those animals engaging in problem behavior. This study examined the effects of an aggression reduction procedure (ARP) on dog problem behavior. After a baseline condition showing caregivers were unsuccessful in reducing dog aggression and the behaviors preceding aggression, caregivers were trained to implement a procedure to address dog problem behavior in relatively simple contexts. Generalization programming then was used to target caregiver plan implementation and dog problem behavior in more complex contexts. The ARP effectively reduced dog aggression for all dogs. A slight reduction and increased variability in dog precursor behavior was observed when the ARP was implemented. In addition, caregivers and experts rated the goals, procedures, and effects as acceptable. Implications of these findings are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal welfare 3acaregivers 3adogs 3aexperts 3apets 0adog aggression 0abehavioral treatment 0aaggression reduction1 aDiGennaro Reed, Florence D.1 aMiller, L.

In this study, the reduced extensibility/embrittlement of unstabilized PA6 under DLO conditions was understood by revealing DLO-induced fracture behavior. The DLO was induced by thermally ageing PA6 samples at 180 °C; the built-up of the thin oxidized layer by ageing was revealed by infrared microscopy. Notably, the formation of the thin oxidized layer significantly reduced the strain-at-break. Depending on whether the oxidized layer was brittle, two types of surface behavior (voiding and cracking) occurred during the tensile tests, which in turn lead to three types (stages) of tensile fracture behavior. In particular, in the early stage (Stage I) of ageing, the fracture was caused by a long crack formed by the coalescence of adjacent surface voids, leading to a decrease in the strain-at-break from 300% to 30%. In Stage II, multiple surface cracks, which initiated in the oxidized layer, was arrested by the interface between the oxidized and unoxidized material, leading to an almost constant strain-at-break (at or close to the necking strain). Maximum brittleness occurred in Stage III, where a more extensive oxidation of the oxidized layer initiated cracks with high propagation rate, causing the interface to be unable to arrest the cracks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acracking 3aextensibility 3amicroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyamides 3atemperature 0aDiffusion-limited oxidation 0aPolyamide 0aSurface-induced embrittlement 0aFracture behavior 0aCracks 0aMechanical properties1 aKallio, Kai J.1 aBruder, Stefan1 aBellander, Martin1 aKausch, H.

The enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a key intermediate for the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids. In Leishmania, FPPS is considered the main target of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, yet the essentiality of this enzyme remains untested. Using a facilitated knockout approach, we carried out the genetic analysis of FPPS in Leishmania major. Our data indicated that chromosomal null mutants for FPPS could only be generated in presence of an episomally expressed FPPS. Long-term retention of the episome by the chromosomal FPPS-null mutants in culture and in infected BALB/c mice suggests that FPPS is indispensable.In addition, applying negative selection pressure failed to induce the loss of ectopic FPPS in the chromosomal FPPS-null mutants, although it led to significant growth delay in culture and in mice. Together, our findings have confirmed the essentiality of FPPS in both promastigotes and amastigotes in L. major and thus validate its potential as a drug target for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania major 3aamastigotes 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adolichols 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3agenetic analysis 3amice 3amoieties 3amutants 3anitrogen 3apromastigotes 3aselection pressure 3asterols 3aubiquinones 0aLeishmania 0aIsoprenoid 0aEssentiality 0aDrug 0aTarget 0aLipid 0aAmastigote1 aBasu, Somrita1 aZhang, Kai0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2019 June, v. 230 p.8-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2019.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007600162300001800238500002000256520097800276592002801254596011801282596003201400650002001432650001901452650001501471650001101486650001401497650001501511650001201526650002401538700002201562700002301584700002401607700002301631700001901654773013201673856007501805852000901880655001201889IND60787126620221121113603.0220807e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712662DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoman, Zachary G.10aLandscape capability predicts upland game bird abundance and occurrence  ap. 1110-1116.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLandscape capability (LC) models are a spatial tool with potential applications in conservation planning. We used survey data to validate LC models as predictors of occurrence and abundance at broad and fine scales for American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Landscape capability models were reliable predictors of occurrence but were less indicative of relative abundance at route (11.5–14.6 km) and point scales (0.5–1 km). As predictors of occurrence, LC models had high sensitivity (0.71–0.93) and were accurate (0.71–0.88) and precise (0.88 and 0.92 for woodcock and grouse, respectively). Models did not predict point‐scale abundance independent of the ability to predict occurrence of either species. The LC models are useful predictors of patterns of occurrences in the northeastern United States, but they have limited utility as predictors of fine‐scale or route‐specific abundances. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  aW‐173‐GcNY DEC Ruffed Grouse Drumming Survey data was supported by Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Grant  cScience Support Partnership 3aBonasa umbellus 3aScolopax minor 3agame birds 3agrouse 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3asurveys 3awildlife management1 aBlomberg, Erik J.1 aDeluca, William V.1 aHarrison, Daniel J.1 aLoftin, Cynthia S.1 aWood, Petra B.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 Aug., v. 81, no. 6 p.1110-1116dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245012000162300001800282520054600300592002800846650002300874650002300897650002300920650001100943650001600954650003100970650002301001650002701024650001101051650001201062650001301074650001001087650001101097650001101108700001301119700001301132700002001145700005801165773012001223856008301343852000901426655001201435IND60685761620221116204059.0200306e20200219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068576162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b045552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kai10aEnantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Copper-Catalyzed Thiolation of Cyclic Diaryliodonium Salts  ap. 1709-1713.  aHere, we report a chiral copper(II)-bisoxazoline-catalyzed enantioselective ring opening of cyclic diaryliodonium salts with heteroaryl thiols.

One of the main barriers to the development of rGO is its poor dispersibility in water and polar solvents. Nevertheless, the rGO synthesized in this study exhibits high dispersibility in water. In this research, we prepared GO by oxidizing graphite using the Hummers method, and it was functionalized by 4-pyridine moiety using 4-hydrazinylpyridine graphene (rGO-4Py). The rGO-4Py was further functionalized by methylation using methylpyridinium iodide, producing reduced graphene oxide (rGO-4Py-MeI). The resulting rGO-4Py-MeI exhibited good dispersion in water due to the effect of the pyridinium. The rGO-4Py-MeI's potential as a nanocomposite filler was evaluated by mixing it into water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The tensile strength and modulus of the resulting rGO-4Py-MeI/PVA nanocomposites were measured for different loadings of rGO-4Py-Me. The PVA nanocomposite embedded with 1 wt % of rGO-4Py-MeI showed increases of 69% (88.77 MPa) and 86% (4.36 GPa) in tensile strength and tensile modulus compared to neat PVA, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersibility 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aiodides 3amethylation 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asolvents 3atensile strength1 aYeo, Hyeonuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2629-43531 aKu, Bon-Cheol1 aGoh, Munju1 aYou, Nam-Ho0 tCarbon.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.05.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010200163300001800265500001900283520059900302592002800901650001900929650001000948650002500958650001800983650001401001650001501015653002601030653001701056653002301073653002701096700001901123700002201142700002301164700002001187773018601207856007401393852000901467655001201476IND60692158120221119133328.0200502e20111123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069215812DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1104662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNINOMIYA, Masayuki10aAntioxidative Activity and Chemical Constituents of Edible Terrestrial Alga Nostoc commune Vauch.  ap. 2175-2177.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe extract of terrestrial alga Nostoc commune Vauch. has high antioxidative activity.

We aimed to comprehensively examine the associations of intakes of specific types (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans) and sources (animal, dairy, and vegetable) of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with CRC risk. DESIGN: We prospectively followed 65,550 women from the Nurses’ Health Study (1986–2014) and 45,684 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986–2014). Dietary intake was assessed every 4 years using food frequency questionnaires. Self-reported CRC cases were confirmed through medical record review. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for intakes of dietary fats and fatty acids and CRC risk. RESULTS: During 2,705,560 person-years of follow-up, 2726 incident CRC cases were confirmed. Intake of monounsaturated fat tended to be positively associated with the risk of CRC (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.22; 95% CI 1.01, 1.47; p = 0.06 for trend). This positive association was mainly driven by monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources (MUFA-As) (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.23; 95% CI 1.02, 1.49; p = 0.02 for trend). The positive association between MUFA-As and CRC was attenuated after adjusting for red and processed meat consumption (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.17; 95% CI 0.95, 1.44; p = 0.13 for trend). We did not find clear associations between other types and sources of dietary fat or individual fatty acid and CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of MUFA-As was associated with higher CRC risk. This could be partly explained by confounding due to other components of red and processed meat.  aPublisher supplied data  aUM1 CA186107cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  aP01 CA87969cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  aU01 CA167552cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health 3aanimals 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adietary fat 3ameat consumption 3amedical records 3aprocessed meat 3arisk 3avegetables1 aWu, Kana1 aWang, Liang1 aYin, Kanhua1 aSong, Mingyang1 aGiovannucci, Edward L.1 aWillett, Walter,0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2022 June, v. 61, no. 4 p.1863-1873dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02777-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010300169300001800272520038900290592002800679650001400707650001300721650001500734650002300749650001200772650001300784650001200797700002000809700002200829700002300851700007100874773012000945856008301065852000901148655001201157IND60685761920221116205055.0200306e20200217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068576192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b046122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradhan, Sourav10aWeak Coordination Enabled Switchable C4-Alkenylation and Alkylation of Indoles with Allyl Alcohols  ap. 1720-1725.  aA weak carbonyl coordination facilitated tunable reactivity between alkenylation and alkylation of indoles at the C4 C–H site is presented using readily accessible allylic alcohols in the presence of Rh catalysis by switching the additives or directing group.

Using a case study from Alberta, Canada, this paper compares bird diversity measures at the farm scale and examines their consistency across different habitat types to test for design, output, and end use validation. Based on 2005 point count data (two types) from 178 sites at 22 farms, we calculated bird species richness, abundance, Shannon index, and Inverse Simpson index. The 50m radius data produced species richness and abundance measures about half the size as those produced by the unlimited radius data. The bird diversity measures were consistent across habitat types. The 50m radius data showed differences among 3–5 habitat types, whereas the unlimited radius data showed differences between only two habitat types. Using any bird diversity measure, the wetland/riparian habitat scored highest, followed by homestead, upland forest, native prairie, tame pasture, and cultivated land habitats. Bird monitoring methods should favor fixed over unlimited radius point counts, because of the former's greater discriminating ability. Given that diversity measures are consistent across habitats and are highly correlated, the species richness measure, which is simple and easy to understand, can be used in conversations with landowners and policy-makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acase studies 3afarms 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandowners 3amonitoring 3apastures 3apopulation size 3aprairies 3ariparian areas 3aspecies diversity 3awetlands 3aAlberta0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.741-744dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024001700113024002100130024002500151024001100176040001800187100002300205245013600228300001800364506017300382520130100555650002401856650002801880650001701908650002001925650001001945650001101955650001501966650001401981650001101995650002702006650001502033650001702048650001102065650001202076650002402088650004402112650002202156650001502178650001102193650001902204650000902223650002302232650002102255650004402276650001602320650001202336700002102348700001802369700002102387700002502408700002402433773013802457856011202595856003802707956013002745961000902875852000902884655001202893IND50068018120221214225840.0130621s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801812DNAL7 a238651712pmid7 a2891422aris7 a10113/568992hdl7 a10.1603/EC124872doi8 ans2233  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Meghan M.10aEffects of Extended Prepupal Storage Duration on Adult Flight Physiology of the Alfalfa Leafcutting Bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)  ap. 1089-1097.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.), is a solitary, cavity-nesting bee and is the primary pollinator for alfalfa seed production. Bee management practices include cold storage during the prepupal stage. Fluctuating thermal regimes during cold storage increases survival of cold storage and allows a doubling of the cold storage period with no decrease in survival. However, survival, characterized as successful adult emergence, is not qualitative. In this study, we determined whether extended storage affects adult bee respiration or flight physiology. We overwintered bees for a single winter (current management protocol) or for 12 mo longer (extended storage). We used resting and tethered flight metabolic rates and resting critical PO2 (the oxygen partial pressure below which metabolism can no longer be sustained) as indices of adult bee quality. We found no significant differences in body mass, resting or flight metabolic rates, or critical PO2 between the two groups. Together these data indicate that extended storage of M. rotundata produces bees of similar respiratory capacity and flight ability. These findings could increase the use of M. rotundata as an alternative pollinator, allowing for extended storage to time adult emergence with early blooming crops. 3aMegachile rotundata 3aalternative pollinators 3acold storage 3acrop production 3acrops 3aflight 3ametabolism 3amortality 3aoxygen 3aresting metabolic rate 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3awinter 2aAnimals 2aBeekeepingxmethods 2aBeesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aEstivation 2aFemale 2aFlight, Animal 2aMale 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPartial Pressure 2aPupaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aRespiration 2aSeasons1 aPetersen, Kelsey1 aYocum, George1 aRinehart, Joseph1 aKemp, W.q(William),1 aGreenlee, Kendra J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2013, v. 106, no. 3 p.1089-1097dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x1938-291X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/568993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC12487  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2013%20J%20Econ%20Entomol%20106%283%29%201089-1097.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016300174300001600337520148100353592002801834650002101862650002001883650001901903650001701922650001401939650001201953650001101965650003201976650001502008650002602023650001802049650001402067650001902081650001502100650001602115650001602131700002402147700002202171700002502193700001902218700002002237773009102257856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60125793720221117070812.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012579372DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2015.10026252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, Cláudia,14aThe Chemopreventive Effect of the Dietary Compound Kaempferol on the MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line Is Dependent on Inhibition of Glucose Cellular Uptake  ap. 504-513.  aOur aim was to investigate the effect of several dietary polyphenols on glucose uptake by breast cancer cells. Uptake of ³H-deoxy-D-glucose (³H-DG) by MCF-7 cells was time-dependent, saturable, and inhibited by cytochalasin B plus phloridzin. In the short-term (26 min), myricetin, chrysin, genistein, resveratrol, kaempferol, and xanthohumol (10–100 µM) inhibited ³H-DG uptake. Kaempferol was found to be the most potent inhibitor of ³H-DG uptake [IC ₅₀ of 4 µM (1.6–9.8)], behaving as a mixed-type inhibitor. In the long-term (24 h), kaempferol (30 µM) was also able to inhibit ³H-DG uptake, associated with a 40% decrease in GLUT1 mRNA levels. Interestingly enough, kaempferol (100 µM) revealed antiproliferative (sulforhodamine B and ³H-thymidine incorporation assays) and cytotoxic (extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity determination) properties, which were mimicked by low extracellular (1 mM) glucose conditions and reversed by high extracellular (20 mM) glucose conditions. Finally, exposure of cells to kaempferol (30 µM) induced an increase in extracellular lactate levels over time (to 731 ± 32% of control after a 24 h exposure), due to inhibition of MCT1-mediated lactate cellular uptake. In conclusion, kaempferol potently inhibits glucose uptake by MCF-7 cells, apparently by decreasing GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of kaempferol in these cells appears to be dependent on this effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3achemoprevention 3acytochalasin B 3acytotoxicity 3agenistein 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akaempferol 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amessenger RNA 3amyricetin 3aneoplasm cells 3aphloridzin 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol1 aCorreia-Branco, Ana1 aAraújo, João R.1 aGuimarães, João T.1 aKeating, Elisa1 aMartel, Fátima0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 67, no. 3 p.504-513dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.10026253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245010500159300001800264520084600282592002801128650001501156650001501171650001101186650001901197650001701216650001201233650002201245650001901267650001001286650001101296650001501307650001901322650000901341650001001350653001401360653002301374653001501397653004701412700002101459700002101480700002301501700002101524773011301545856008001658852000901738655001201747IND60616562220221119063939.0181017e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061656222DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175155763252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Lei10aMeasuring textile adsorption of body odor compounds using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry  ap. 1817-1826.  aThis paper describes a method for determining the differential adsorption of body odor compounds by three types of yarn/fiber (cotton, polyester, wool) using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Each type exhibited different adsorption profiles. Decanal and cyclohexanone adsorbed more to wool than to either cotton or polyester. Ethylbenzene and butanoic acid methyl ester adsorbed more to polyester than to either cotton or wool. Cotton was a weaker adsorbent than polyester and wool for all odor compounds tested. Phenol was adsorbed highly by all three yarns. The study validated the use of PTR-MS to assess the adsorption of volatile compounds by textile fibers/yarns, and demonstrated its potential to be used as a rapid means of assessing the kinetics of odor adsorption and release by existing and modified materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acotton 3acyclohexanones 3aethylbenzene 3afabrics 3amass spectrometry 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aphenol 3apolyesters 3atextile fibers 3awool 3ayarns 0abody odor 0atextile fiber/yarn 0aadsorption 0aproton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry1 aLaing, Raechel M1 aBremer, Philip J1 aSilcock, Patrick J1 aLeus, Michelle J0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 85, no. 17 p.1817-1826dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175155763253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014300163300001400306520147500320592002801795650002101823650001001844650001101854650001301865650004501878650001301923650001801936650001401954650001301968650001501981650001201996700001802008700002202026700001902048700001802067700002102085700001802106700002202124700001602146700001902162700001602181700002102197773009702218856008002315852000902395655001202404IND60083009520221122130838.0141101e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hong-Ren10aGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a reliable internal control in Western blot analysis of leukocyte subpopulations from children  ap. 24-29.  aTo study differences in the development of immunity, leukocytes from cord blood are often compared with those from adult peripheral blood. Western blot analysis is a common method for detecting proteins. In this study, we investigated the reliability of using different housekeeping proteins (β-actin, β-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) as internal controls for different leukocyte subpopulations from infants, children, and adults. Our results showed that the expression levels of β-actin and β-tubulin were much lower in cord blood leukocytes than in adult leukocytes, and this expression pattern persisted in children up to 3years old. Further study revealed that the β-actin expression level in newborns was especially lower in CD14-positive monocytes. However, cord blood and adult peripheral blood monocytes had similar expression levels of β-actin messenger RNA (mRNA). Further experiments showed that posttranslational regulation was responsible for the low β-actin expression level in neonatal monocytes. Thus, researchers should carefully assess the appropriate use of housekeeping gene-encoded proteins as internal standards to normalize samples for comparisons of different leukocyte populations from subjects of different ages. In this study, we determined that GAPDH was a more reliable internal control than others in Western blot analysis for comparing the development of immunity among infants, children, and adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3aadults 3achildren 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aimmunity 3amessenger RNA 3amonocytes 3aneonates 3apopulation 3atubulin1 aKuo, Ho-Chang1 aHuang, Hsin-chun,1 aHuang, Li-Tung1 aTain, You-Lin1 aChen, Chih-Cheng1 aLiang, Chi-Di1 aSheen, Jiunn-Ming1 aLin, I-Chun1 aWu, Chi-Chiang1 aOu, Chia-Yu1 aYang, Kuender D.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 June 1, v. 413, no. 1 p.24-29dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010600170520097200276592002801248653003901276653001001315653001901325653001101344653003701355700002201392773010201414856008201516852000901598655001201607IND60733448620221120063539.0220207s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073344862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wss.2021.1000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinlay, Jessica M.10aClinical geography: A proposal to embrace space, place and wellbeing through person-centered practice  aThis essay envisions how geography can operationalize nuanced understandings of space and place to enrich the lives of individuals across the lifespan.

Our proposal integrates spatial modifications to facilitate access and utility, behavioral interventions to maximize effectiveness in using space, and therapeutic engagement to nurture a deeper sense of ‘being in place’ that enhances wellbeing and quality of life. This focus is timely given societal instability and precariousness resulting from incongruous person-environment situations. In addition to investigating, explaining, and critiquing hazardous and inappropriate conditions, geographers might also directly and more immediately intervene with people who find themselves in such situations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPerson-in-environment intervention 0aSpace 0aBeing in place 0aHealth 0aGeographic knowledge translation1 aRowles, Graham D.0 tWellbeing, space and society.g2021, v. 2 p.100035-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27938x2666-55817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2021.1000353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245022600167300002000393520189700413592002802310650002102338650002902359650001802388650001802406650002002424650002102444650001502465650001302480650001602493650002302509650002102532653001902553653003702572653002002609653002002629653003102649653002702680700002102707700005702728700005502785773015102840856008002991852000903071655001203080IND60672097820221121024651.0191009e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067209782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b027892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildiz, Zehra I.10aMolecular Encapsulation of Cinnamaldehyde within Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complex Electrospun Nanofibers: Fast-Dissolution, Enhanced Water Solubility, High Temperature Stability, and Antibacterial Activity of Cinnamaldehyde  ap. 11066-11076.  aThe electrospinning of nanofibers (NFs) of cinnamaldehyde inclusion complexes (ICs) with two different hydroxypropylated cyclodextrins (CDs), hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HP-γ-CD), was successfully performed in order to produce cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NFs without using an additional polymer matrix. The inclusion complexation between cinnamaldehyde and hydroxypropylated CDs was studied by computational molecular modeling, and the results suggested that HP-β-CD and HP-γ-CD can be inclusion complexed with cinnamaldehyde at 1:1 and 2:1 (cinnamaldehyde/CD) molar ratios. Additionally, molecular modeling and phase solubility studies showed that water solubility of cinnamaldehyde dramatically increases with cyclodextrin inclusion complex (CD-IC) formation. The HP-β-CD has shown slightly stronger binding with cinnamaldehyde when compared to HP-γ-CD for cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC. Although cinnamaldehyde is a highly volatile compound, it was effectively preserved with high loading by the cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NFs. It was also observed that cinnamaldehyde has shown much higher temperature stability in cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NFs compared to uncomplexed cinnamaldehyde because of the inclusion complexation state of cinnamaldehyde within the hydroxypropylated CD cavity. Moreover, cinnamaldehyde still has kept its antibacterial activity in cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NF samples when tested against Escherichia coli. In addition, cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NF mats were fast-dissolving in water, even though pure cinnamaldehyde has a water-insoluble nature. In brief, self-standing nanofibrous mats of electrospun cinnamaldehyde/CD-IC NFs are potentially applicable in food, oral-care, healthcare, and pharmaceutics because of their fast-dissolving character, enhanced water solubility, stability at elevated temperature, and promising antibacterial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3acyclodextrins 3aencapsulation 3ahealth services 3amolecular models 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3atemperature 3avolatile compounds 3awater solubility 0acinnamaldehyde 0acyclodextrin inclusion complexes 0aelectrospinning 0afast-dissolving 0ahigh temperature stability 0aantibacterial activity1 aKilic, Mehmet E.1 aDurgun, Engin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0639-58621 aUyar, Tamer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3989-44810 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Sept. 11, v. 67, no. 40 p.11066-11076dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b027893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014600167300001400313520129800327592002801625650002301653650002901676650002701705650001501732650001401747650002001761650001101781650001501792650001301807650001901820650003001839650002801869650001701897650001201914653002901926653004101955653002201996653003102018653003002049700005502079700002502134700001902159773011302178856008502291852000902376655001202385IND60733448720221120063524.0210518e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073344872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geosus.2021.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Caichun10aIntegrate ecosystem services into socio-economic development to enhance achievement of sustainable development goals in the post-pandemic era  ap. 68-73.  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has stalled and rolled back progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ecosystem services (ESs), defined as the contributions of ecosystems to human well-being, underpin the achievement of SDGs. To promote SDG achievement in post-pandemic era, we teased out the links between ESs and SDGs while examining the impact of COVID-19. We found that ESs benefited all SDGs, yet man-made pressures led to degradation of ecosystems and their services. There is broad consensus that the virus lurks in degraded ecosystems and generates spillover due to human interference. The pandemic and global lockdown/restriction disrupted the flow of ESs and altered human ESs demand, threatening the efforts for the SDGs. We suggested: 1) to study the association and traceability of ESs-SDGs under the pandemic; 2) to prioritize pressing issues such as health care, livelihood, and resource security and in the long run, we should promote human-nature harmony to achieve the SDGs; and 3) to enhance ESs and to promote the SDGs through local community efforts, ESs accounting, and ecosystem restoration. This paper provides insights into the importance of ESs to the SDGs and the ways to integrate ESs into socio-economic development to promote the SDG achievement after the pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3ageography 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3apandemic 3asocial welfare 3asocioeconomic development 3asustainable development 3atraceability 3aviruses 0aEcosystem services (ESs) 0aSustainable development goals (SDGs) 0aCOVID-19 pandemic 0aSocio-economic development 0aHuman-nature relationship1 aZhao, Wenwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5342-354X1 aCherubini, Francesco1 aPereira, Paulo0 tGeography and sustainability.g2021 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.68-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27387x2666-68397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2021.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009700176300001600273520200000289592002802289650002902317650001202346650001902358650001402377650001602391650001202407650001002419650000902429650001002438650002302448650001302471650001102484650002202495650001502517650002302532650001202555650001202567650002102579650001502600651001402615700002102629700001802650773009302668856008502761852000902846655001202855IND60084444520221119074704.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008444452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlacher, Thomas A.10aVegetation and ghost crabs in coastal dunes as indicators of putative stressors from tourism  ap. 284-294.  aCoastal dunes provide important ecosystem services and are susceptible to human disturbance such as vehicle traffic and human trampling. Notwithstanding, on several Australian beaches dunes serves as camping areas, where camping sites are located on the primary dunes landwards of the foredunes. Because these activities have the potential to impact on the biota of the foredunes directly adjoining the camping zones, sustainable management of dunes for multiple uses requires that putative impacts are identified. Consequently, we quantified: (1) effects of dune camping on the vegetation in the foredunes abutting the camping zones, (2) ghost crab (Ocypode cordimana) abundance, distribution, body size, and body condition as biological indicators of human stressors, and (3) the degree to which habitat attributes are correlated with ghost crab abundance. Two percent of the foredune surface was disturbed by human activity (vehicle tracks, trampling, dog prints, litter). Camping in the primary dunes had some minor effects on the vegetation of the foredunes, but widespread changes in plant assemblages were not detected. Ghost crabs were attracted to camp sites, significantly changing their distribution across the dune field and increasing their body condition near camp sites—presumably a trophic subsidy from food scraps. Except for vegetation height which had a positive influence on crab density, there were no other strong and consistent predictors of ghost crab density either in terms of physical habitat attributes (e.g. dune width and height) or vegetation characteristics (e.g. plant cover, diversity). Because coastal managers must increasingly reconcile multiple uses of the environment with its protection, robust data on the type, extent and magnitude of impacts are critical to formulate efficient management strategies for dunes. Monitoring the efficacy of such strategies requires robust indicators, and we show that ghost crabs may be good candidate species for this.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abeaches 3abody condition 3abody size 3acampgrounds 3acamping 3acrabs 3adogs 3adunes 3aecosystem services 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3apopulation density 3atourism 3atraffic 3atrampling damage 3avegetation 3aAustralia1 ade Jager, Rudolf1 aNielsen, Tara0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.284-294dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012900168300001600297520096800313592002801281650002501309650001801334650001201352650001501364650001301379653002001392653001601412653002101428653006301449653004101512700001501553700001601568700001801584700001701602773012301619856008501742852000901827655001201836IND60685762320221116204930.0200307e20200318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068576232DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14996412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwaoka, Yuji10aAntioxidant activity and Neurite outgrowth-enhancing activity of scorbamic acid and a red pigment derived from ascorbic acid  ap. 838-842.  aL-Ascorbic acid (AA), known as vitamin C, can form browning products by a non-enzymatic process during storage and the browning products cause deterioration of agricultural products.

In this study, we assayed the antioxidant activities of SCA and NDA using ABTS radical cation and their neurite outgrowth-enhancing activities in PC12 cells. SCA showed stronger radical-scavenging activity than that of AA, while NDA hardly showed any activity. SCA and NDA enhanced the neurite outgrowth induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP after their incorporation into cells in the same manner as that of AA. The results indicated that SCA has antioxidant activity and that SCA and NDA have neurite outgrowth-enhancing activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acations 3acyclic AMP 3aneurites 0aL-ascorbic acid 0ared pigment 0aL-scorbamic acid 0a2,2´-nitrilodi-2(2´)-deoxy-L-ascorbic acid ammonium salt 0aneurite outgrowth-enhancing activity1 aIkeda, Nao1 aOhno, Asako1 aIto, Hideyuki1 aTai, Akihiro0 tNatural product research.g2020 Mar. 18, v. 34, no. 6 p.838-842dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14996413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04526naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002700132040001800159100001900177245011900196300001800315500002000333506017300353520216200526592002802688650003002716650001202746650001902758650003302777650001102810650003902821650001502860650002602875650001102901700001602912700002102928700001802949700001702967700002302984700001903007700002003026700002203046700001703068700002703085700002803112700002903140700002603169700001703195700002603212700002003238700002103258700002603279700002303305700002303328700002003351700002203371773012303393856011203516856007303628956012903701961001303830852000903843655001203852IND60523315320221214225319.0160611e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052331532DNAL7 a3055512aris7 a10113/631462hdl7 a10.1111/gcb.132692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstiarte, Marc10aFew multiyear precipitation–reduction experiments find a shift in the productivity–precipitation relationship  ap. 2570-2581.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWell‐defined productivity–precipitation relationships of ecosystems are needed as benchmarks for the validation of land models used for future projections. The productivity–precipitation relationship may be studied in two ways: the spatial approach relates differences in productivity to those in precipitation among sites along a precipitation gradient (the spatial fit, with a steeper slope); the temporal approach relates interannual productivity changes to variation in precipitation within sites (the temporal fits, with flatter slopes). Precipitation–reduction experiments in natural ecosystems represent a complement to the fits, because they can reduce precipitation below the natural range and are thus well suited to study potential effects of climate drying. Here, we analyse the effects of dry treatments in eleven multiyear precipitation–manipulation experiments, focusing on changes in the temporal fit. We expected that structural changes in the dry treatments would occur in some experiments, thereby reducing the intercept of the temporal fit and displacing the productivity–precipitation relationship downward the spatial fit. The majority of experiments (72%) showed that dry treatments did not alter the temporal fit. This implies that current temporal fits are to be preferred over the spatial fit to benchmark land‐model projections of productivity under future climate within the precipitation ranges covered by the experiments. Moreover, in two experiments, the intercept of the temporal fit unexpectedly increased due to mechanisms that reduced either water loss or nutrient loss. The expected decrease of the intercept was observed in only one experiment, and only when distinguishing between the late and the early phases of the experiment. This implies that we currently do not know at which precipitation–reduction level or at which experimental duration structural changes will start to alter ecosystem productivity. Our study highlights the need for experiments with multiple, including more extreme, dry treatments, to identify the precipitation boundaries within which the current temporal fits remain valid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3adrying 3aecological processes and phenomena 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3amodels1 aVicca, Sara1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aBahn, Michael1 aBeier, Claus1 aEmmett, Bridget A.1 aFay, Philip A.1 aHanson, Paul J.1 aHasibeder, Roland1 aKigel, Jaime1 aKröel‐Dulay, Gyorgy1 aLarsen, Klaus Steenberg1 aLellei‐Kovács, Eszter1 aLimousin, Jean‐Marc1 aOgaya, Romà1 aOurcival, Jean‐Marc1 aReinsch, Sabine1 aSala, Osvaldo E.1 aSchmidt, Inger Kappel1 aSternberg, Marcelo1 aTielbörger, Katja1 aTietema, Albert1 aJanssens, Ivan A.0 tGlobal change biology.g2016 July, v. 22, no. 7 p.2570-2581dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/631463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.132693Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Estiarte-2016-Few%20multiyear%20precipitation-redu.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03878naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010400170520219000274592002802464650001302492650002102505650001402526650002302540650002302563650001102586650002002597650002402617650002802641650001702669650001102686650001702697650001402714650001802728650001002746650001102756650001202767650002102779650001602800650001302816653001602829653002002845653000802865653004302873653001902916700001902935700001402954700001902968700001402987700001703001700001403018700001503032700002103047773011303068856008603181852000903267655001203276IND60655375820221118005853.0200809e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065537582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1176672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin-yan, Zhang10aGreen synthesis of Cu-SSZ-13 zeolite by seed-assisted route for effective reduction of nitric oxide  aOne of the main technologies to solve NOₓ pollution in vehicle exhaust is selective catalytic reduction. The Cu loaded SSZ-13 zeolites catalyst material is one of the most attractive catalytic materials used in this technology. Moreover, green synthesis route of copper based SSZ-13 without or less organic template agent using in order to promote its practical industrial application is a promising and meaningful research hotpot. In this paper, low-cost Cu-SSZ-13 zeolites were successfully synthesized by seed orientation method and evaluated for its catalytic properties of NOₓ reduction. The crystallization conditions and crystallization mechanism were systematically investigated. The results show that the amount of seed, the ratio of Si to Al, crystallization temperature, crystallization time and seed state (calcined or unroasted) all have effect on the synthesis of molecular sieve. With 10–20% SSZ-13 seeds adding, SSZ-13 zeolites at Si/Al ratio of 17.5–25 can be successfully prepared for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C–120 °C for 2–6 days. And the optimum conditions for the synthesis of SSZ-13 zeolites by seed orientation method are as follows: using silica sol, aluminum sulfate, sodium hydroxide and deionized water as raw materials, and mixing them with the molar ratio of SiO₂:Al₂O₃:Na₂O:H₂O = 40:1:16:900; taking the 15% unroasted SSZ-13 as seed, high purity SSZ-13 molecular sieve can be obtained by crystallization at 100 °C for 4 days. The results of crystallization mechanism investigations show that the synthesis of zeolites by seed-guided method is in accordance with the “core-shell” growth mechanism that the Si source and Al source continue to grow on the seed substrate in the Crystallization process. The copper loaded SSZ-13 zeolites by ion exchange method showed good selective catalytic reduction performance of NOₓ, which is compared to the activity of Cu-SSZ-13 zeolites prepared using traditional organic template agent. Thus, the low-cost seed-assisted, organic template agent-free synthesis of Cu-SSZ-13 zeolite has very promising application prospect in future NOₓ purification in vehicle exhaust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum sulfate 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3acrystallization 3ahot water treatment 3aindustrial applications 3aion exchange 3amixing 3anitric oxide 3apollution 3araw materials 3aseeds 3asilica 3asilicon 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aCu zeolites 0aSSZ-13 zeolites 0aNOx 0aSelective catalytic reduction with NH3 0aDiesel exhaust1 aTing-ting, Dou1 aYao, Wang1 aJing-yue, Yang1 aXue, Wang1 aYan-yan, Guo1 aQun, Shen1 aXin, Zhang1 aShao-qing, Zhang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 236 p.117667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1176673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014300165500001900308520138400327592002801711650002001739650001601759650001201775650000901787650001601796650002201812650001301834650001901847650001801866650002001884650002001904653001701924653002301941653002701964653002401991700001802015700001502033700001602048700001402064700001702078773010202095856008602197852000902283655001202292IND60701356120221119183911.0201023e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070135612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Pei10aComparison of the structure and properties of hydroxypropylated acid-hydrolysed maize starches with different amylose/amylopectin contents  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDually modified regular maize starch (RMS) and high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) were successfully prepared by first acid hydrolysis and subsequently hydroxypropylation. The effects of hydrolysis time (0–24 h) and propylene oxide (PO) content (10–30%) on the structure and physicochemical properties were investigated. The molar substitution (MS) of HAMS samples (up to 0.163) was generally higher than that of RMS samples (up to 0.149), suggesting the higher reactivity of amylose for hydroxypropylation. Besides, PO content had a greater influence on MS whereas the effect of acid hydrolysis time was minor. For both starches, the dual modifications did not cause apparent changes to the granule morphology but reduced gelatinisation temperatures and enthalpy; and a higher PO content led to higher relative crystallinity. These results suggest that hydroxypropylation occurred mainly on the surface of HAMS granules and had little influence on the compact granular structure, whereas this reaction impacted the internal structure of RMS much more. The rheological study shows the introduced hydroxypropyl bulky groups weakened the entanglements between amylose chains or amylopectin chains with long branches. Thus, this work provides insights into the rational design of modified starch products containing different amylose/amylopectin contents with tailored properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acorn 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3ahydrocolloids 3amodified starch 3apropylene oxide 0aMaize starch 0aHydroxypropylation 0aRheological properties 0aIntrinsic viscosity1 aZhang, Yiling1 aQiao, Qian1 aTao, Xiaoqi1 aLiu, Peng1 aXie, Fengwei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Jan., v. 110 p.106134-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009500166300001800261500001900279520104800298592002801346650001701374650001101391650001401402650001001416650001501426650002001441650001401461650001401475650001601489653002101505653003101526653003101557653001901588653001701607700001201624700002001636700005401656773014401710856008501854852000901939655001201948IND60732519920221116171048.0210329e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073251992DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c091542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chen10aSupported Ni@Ni₂P Core–Shell Nanotube Arrays on Ni Foam for Hydrazine Electrooxidation  ap. 4564-4570.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDevelopment of high-performance electrocatalysts requires a judicious selection of intrinsically highly active materials and smart structure engineering of electrodes to maximize active site density and to construct electronically conductive networks.

The Ni@Ni₂P NTA/NF catalyst is fabricated using a sacrificial template (ZnO) method followed by phosphatization treatment at elevated temperature. The thus-prepared catalyst exhibits unprecedented activity, good stability, and nearly 100% selectivity toward hydrazine electrooxidation following the four-electron pathway under an alkaline condition, outperforming the hydrazine electrooxidation catalysts hitherto reported. The impressive activity observed in this new catalyst would encourage future exploration of DHFCs as viable power sources for vehicular and portable applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aanodes 3acatalysts 3afoams 3afuel cells 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrazine 3ananotubes 3atemperature 0aelectrocatalysis 0adirect hydrazine fuel cell 0ahydrazine electrooxidation 0ananotube array 0aNi phosphide1 aWen, He1 aTang, Piao-Ping1 aWang, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7704-25380 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 9, no. 12 p.4564-4570dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c091543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014300168520119900311592002801510650001101538650001501549650000901564650001701573653001901590653002901609653002301638653002601661653002701687653002201714700001701736700002001753773011301773856008601886852000901972655001201981IND60655376020221118005755.0200809e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065537602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1176762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoel, Ashish10aSustainability integration in the management of construction projects: A morphological analysis of over two decades’ research literature  aSustainability integration in the processes of managing and delivering projects is essential to ensure the sustainability of the projects and that of the assets created. This research synthesises over two decades of published research on sustainability integration in management of construction projects (SIMCP). A three stage research process is used for searching and shortlisting, systematically reviewing, and Morphological Analysis (MA) of 130 selected journal articles. The use of MA here, perhaps the first such attempt in sustainable construction literature, has enabled compact tabular-visual representation of the large body of knowledge on SIMCP by categorising it under 7 dimensions, viz., Motivations, Stakeholder Orientation, Organizational Context, Temporal Orientation, Benefits, Barriers, and Risks, and 31 variants. MA has confirmed significant future research scope and revealed at least 236 specific research gaps. The study has significant implications for practitioners and academicians. While the former can use it to understand the state-of-the-art in SIMCP, the latter can utilize the identified gaps to decide their future lines of academic and intellectual inquiries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3amotivation 3arisk 3astakeholders 0aSustainability 0aSustainable construction 0aProject management 0aConstruction projects 0aMorphological analysis 0aSystematic review1 aGanesh, L.S.1 aArshinder Kaur,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 236 p.117676-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1176763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002900149245010700178300001600285520184000301592002802141650002402169650001502193650001902208650001902227650000902246650001702255650002402272650001702296650002102313651000902334700001902343700001802362700001802380773009302398856008502491852000902576655001202585IND4467000720221121062850.0141110e20120702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446700072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Seyed Hamidreza10aSoil erosion assessment and prioritization of affecting factors at plot scale using the Taguchi method  ap. 174-180.  aAssessment of factors affecting soil erosion processes is very important for managerial activities. However, full factorial design of an experiment is time consuming and expensive when there are a large number of factors and corresponding levels. Using the Taguchi method, this study assessed several factors affecting soil erosion. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to apply the Taguchi method in order to investigate the effects of different factors on soil erosion or sediment yield. The factors used in this study consisted of silt content, slope, aspect and vegetation cover, each of which had four levels in the study area in Lar Township, Iran. A Lââ orthogonal array was selected according to the aforementioned factors and levels and experimental tests were performed according to the Taguchiâs orthogonal array. Analysis of the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was used to evaluate the experimental results. The optimum conditions for quantifying soil erosion were determined. A test experiment was also conducted in small-sized plots under the optimum conditions, and the prediction of other combinations of factors/levels was evaluated. The results showed that the Taguchi method could predict soil erosion with an average relative error of 12.4%. The percentage contribution of each factor was also determined. Silt and slope aspect made the greatest (49.4%) and the lowest (1.3%) contribution, respectively. The results showed that the Taguchi method is able to model the soil erosion process well (RÂ²>0.95) and can therefore be applied in future studies conducted in various fields. Additionally, comprehensive conclusions can be drawn if this method is applied under different plot sizes and considering further potential affective factors with different agroclimatic circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3aprediction 3aprioritization 3asediment yield 3asilt 3asoil erosion 3asoil erosion models 3asoil quality 3avegetation cover 3aIran1 aMoosavi, Vahid1 aKarami, Ayoob1 aBehnia, Negin0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 July 2, v. 448-449 p.174-180dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013600169300001800305500001900323520155600342592002801898650001501926650001101941650001701952650002301969650001701992650002102009650001002030650001502040650002002055650001102075650001902086650001302105650002102118650001302139650001002152650002202162650001702184653002702201653002702228653001602255700002902271700001602300700001402316700001802330700005502348700005602403773014402459856008502603852000902688655001202697IND60732520120221116172037.0210329e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073252012DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c091772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinghang10aBiomass-Derived Carbonaceous Materials with Multichannel Waterways for Solar-Driven Clean Water and Thermoelectric Power Generation  ap. 4571-4582.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoping with the shortage of fresh water and electricity in off-grid and resource-constrained areas through sustainable strategies has become the most urgent challenge facing the development of human society. Herein, we propose a low-cost and sustainable way of repurposing discarded pomelo peel by converting it into 3D porous carbon foam (i.e., carbonized pomelo peel, referred to as CPP) with multichannel waterways for synergetic coupling of solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) and low-grade heat-to-electricity generation. The superhydrophilic 3D porous CPP with multichannel waterways utilizes its powerful water supply capability to avoid salt accumulation during continuous seawater desalination. By cautiously weighing the water transport and thermal management of CPP-based evaporators, CPP with three-channel waterways (CPP3) can achieve efficient solar-driven evaporation (the evaporation rate of 1.37 kg m–² h–¹, one sun) on the premise of salt resistance through its superior light absorption and ultrafast solar-thermal response. Besides, a collaborative device integrating CPP3 and a commercial thermoelectric (TE) generator is designed for synchronous generation of solar steam and thermoelectricity, which can simultaneously achieve an evaporation rate of 1.39 kg m–² h–¹ and a power output of 0.5 W m–² under one sun illumination. Such a cost-effective and easy-to-manufacture strategy can provide potential opportunities for satisfying the demand for fresh water and electricity in resource-constrained areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acitrus peels 3acost effectiveness 3adesalination 3aevaporation rate 3afoams 3afreshwater 3agreen chemistry 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3alighting 3apower generation 3aseawater 3asteam 3athermoelectricity 3awater supply 0acarbonized pomelo peel 0amultichannel waterways 0asolar steam1 aMishra, Debesh Devadutta1 aLi, Yuankai1 aGao, Long1 aPeng, Hongyan1 aZhang, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5511-11361 aHu, Chaoquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3965-04920 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 9, no. 12 p.4571-4582dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c091773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009900170500001900269520157900288592002801867650002101895650002301916650001601939650002301955650001401978650001401992650000702006650002002013653001802033653002102051653003402072653003002106653001802136700001802154700001502172700001402187773011902201856008802320852000902408655001202417IND60714900720221120201820.0210305e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071490072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chuanwei12aA review of the characteristics of Fenton and ozonation systems in landfill leachate treatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe development and application of Fenton and ozonation systems in landfill leachate treatment over the last 20 years, and the current research status are reviewed in this paper, with an emphasis on the technical and economic characteristics of Fenton and ozonation systems used to treat different types of landfill leachate. To date, a total of 101 and 78 articles have been published regarding leachate treatment by Fenton and ozonation systems, respectively. These articles considered the use of two systems to treat aged leachate, biologically treated leachate and leachate comprising the concentrated solution resulting from reverse osmosis (RO). The oxidization mechanisms of the two systems used to treat landfill leachate significantly differed in terms of their optimal process parameters (e.g., initial pH value, reagent dosage, and reaction time) and removal efficiency. The Fenton and ozonation systems outperformed persulfate-based advanced oxidation technology in terms of their improved biodegradability of landfill leachate and engineering practicability. The cost of the reagents required to treat landfill leachate by Fenton and ozonation systems accounted for at least 85% of the total operating cost. In contrast to the ozonation system, the Fenton system was more cost-effective when both systems were used to treat the same type of landfill leachate. This study provides a theoretical basis for the operation of Fenton and ozonation systems and also offers technical support for landfill leachate disposal companies that opt to use these technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironment 3alandfill leachates 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3apH 3areverse osmosis 0aFenton system 0aOzonation system 0aWater quality characteristics 0aTechnical characteristics 0aEconomic cost1 aChen, Weiming1 aGu, Zhepei1 aLi, Qibin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143131-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245014400188300001800332520090000350592002801250650002101278650002101299650001401320650001401334650001501348650002301363650001501386650001901401650001901420650002201439650002801461650008901489650004101578650004701619650002101666650002201687650005601709650005701765650001101822650007301833650006001906700002001966700002401986700002102010700001702031700001902048700001602067700001502083700001802098700001702116700002102133700002002154700001702174773009202191856008602283852000902369655001202378IND4465665620221122200409.0141111e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446566562DNAL7 a229808652pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.06.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kwang Il10aInduction of the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by flavonoids isolated from Korean Citrus aurantium L. in non-small-cell lung cancer cells  ap. 2728-2735.  aThis study investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of flavonoids isolated from Korean Citrus aurantium L. using A549 lung cancer cells. Flavonoids potently inhibited of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas flavonoids had a weak inhibitory effect on proliferation of WI-38 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis showed that flavonoids induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint by controlling the proteins expression level of cyclin B1, cdc2, cdc25c and p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹. Also, flavonoids induced apoptosis through the regulation of the expression of caspases, cleaved PARP and Bax/Bcl-xL ratio. The activity of caspase-3 on A549 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner.

Therefore, we conducted a 3‐yr field study to evaluate the potential role of controlled‐release urea in improving productivity and resource use efficiency of maize in semiarid areas in China. Treatments were established as two mulching modes (plastic film mulching [FM] and no mulching [NM]) and three nitrogen application modes (no nitrogen fertilizer [CK], a 1:2 ratio of controlled‐release urea to common urea [CRU], and common urea only [U]). Higher temperature and soil water content under FM treatments significantly accelerated maize growth and development, as indicated in terms of a larger leaf area index before silking, greater biomass accumulation, and greater grain yield. More robust plants with controlled‐release urea under mulching can better absorb and utilize deep soil water to increase water use efficiency (WUE). Mean shoot biomass, grain yield, and WUE during the three experimental years were 35.3, 19.0, and 12.4% higher in mulching with CRU treatments than in NM with controlled‐release urea treatments, respectively. Significant interactions existed for yield and WUE among surface mulching (SM), nitrogen fertilizer (NF), and sampling year (Y) in the three experimental years, except for SM × NF for WUE. These results demonstrate that a mixture of controlled‐release urea and U at an appropriate ratio under SM can provide a better water/temperature/nitrogen conditions for maize growth to realize relatively high yield with labor and time savings in semiarid farmland. Core Ideas Film mulching benefits topsoil temperature, soil moisture, and utilization of deeper soil water. Combining controlled‐release urea (CRU) and urea increased yield and resource use. Combing CRU and urea under plastic film increased yield and WUE. One‐time application of CRU + urea at an appropriate ratio will satisfy spring maize in dryland farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a41671307cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51279197cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0201807cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2017JM3011cNatural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China  aA314021402-1605cOpen Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau 3aZea mays 3aagricultural land 3aagronomy 3aarid lands 3abiomass production 3acorn 3agrain yield 3agrowth and development 3alabor 3aleaf area index 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplastic film 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aurea 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aZhou, Junxi1 aZhai, Xiaofang1 aSun, Haoran1 aYue, Shanchao1 aGuo, Zining,1 aLi, Shiqing1 aShen, Yufang0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Nov., v. 111, no. 6 p.3194-3206dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.03.02153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014800182300001800330520184300348592002802191650001402219650001002233650001902243650001002262650001202272650001202284650002102296650001402317650001202331650003902343650002202382650004702404650001002451650001402461650002702475650002602502650003802528650003802566650001802604650002602622650002602648650004302674650002702717650003502744650002002779650004702799700001802846700001802864700001502882773012202897856004803019852000903067655001203076IND4474559020221121062926.0121003e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447455902DNAL7 a228061882pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-012-1072-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jianzhong14aThe novel role of fungal intracellular laccase: used to screen hybrids between Hypsizigus marmoreus and Clitocybe maxima by protoplasmic fusion  ap. 2625-2633.  aLaccase has been proved important in decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), oxidation of 2, 2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, lignin degradation and fruiting-body formation. The decolorization of RBBR by laccase was firstly used to screen protoplast fusants. Fusants were obtained by protoplast fusion between the strains of Hypsizigus marmoreus and Clitocybe maxima, and two fusants (IM1 and IIIM5) were screened on PDA medium containing RBBR. These fusants were significant higher in laccase activity than H. marmoreus, nearly 413 and 395 times, respectively. Their hyphal growth rates were also remarkable higher than H. marmoreus, nearly 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed these fusants contained the laccase, and the molecular mass of the laccase was consistent with the laccase of C. maxima, nearly 62 kDa. The pileus color of the IM1 and IIIM5 also showed partial recombined characteristics comparing to the parental strains, while biological efficiency ratios were prominent higher than that of H. marmoreus, up to 14.58 and 10.87 %, respectively. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA bands of fusants not only were similar to parental bands, but presented new non-parental bands. Using the Unweighted pair-group method together with mathematic averages method to gain a dendrogram, in which the fusants showed intra-cluster variations. Significantly, H. marmoreus was the dominant parent, while C. maxima were distant from the fusants. The differences among IM1, IIIM5 and H. marmoreus, and the similarities among IM1, IIIM5 and C. maxima indicated IM1 and IIIM5 were somatic hybrids of H. marmoreus and C. maxima. Accordingly, it is feasible to use laccase to screen fusants of H. marmoreus and C. maxima.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClitocybe 3acolor 3adecolorization 3afungi 3ahybrids 3alaccase 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3aparents 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotoplast fusion 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3asalts 3ascreening 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asomatic hybridization 2aAgaricalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArmillariaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCytoplasmxenzymology 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aLaccasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Fusion 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique1 aZhang, Junlan1 aZhang, Weiguo1 aHu, Kaihui0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.2625-2633dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1072-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245014100219506011700360506007600477520135400553592002801907506003701935650002901972650001002001650001202011650001002023650001302033650001502046650001602061650001802077653002202095653002002117653002602137653001202163653001002175700003302185700008202218700002302300773012502323856008102448852000902529655001202538IND60773558020221215143618.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima Martins, Alisson Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7787-414210aUse of ultrasound and ethanol to improve the drying of yacon potato (Smallanthus sonchifolius): Effect of chemical and thermal bleaching  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aYacon is a prebiotic food, rich in insoluble fibers, however, highly perishable because of its high moisture content and unstable coloration after peeling, due to enzymatic browning. To overcome such challenges, this study evaluated the effects of two types of bleaching (chemical and thermal) to precede the pretreatment with ultrasound (US) and ethanol, to study the influence of these methods on drying kinetics, and on changes in product color. Yacon cylinders were dried in a tray oven at 50 °C and it was found that the drying time until final moisture content was reduced after the application of pretreatments. Particularly, pretreatment with ethanol combined with ultrasound provided the greatest reduction in drying time to reach 25% moisture content for both the chemically bleached vegetable (30.1% reduction), and the thermally bleached vegetable (61.2% reduction). The best drying rate was observed for pretreatment with US, yet the water which permeated into the internal matrix during this pretreatment likely limited great reduction in drying time. Regarding product color, chemical bleaching was more efficient in preserving the color characteristics of the product. These results show new perspectives regarding the use of ethanol and ultrasound associated with different pretreatments to improve the convective drying of yacon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3acolor 3aethanol 3aovens 3apotatoes 3aprebiotics 3aultrasonics 3awater content 0aConvective drying 0aDrying kinetics 0aUltrasound technology 0aEthanol 0aColor1 aVieira, Érica Nascif Rufino1 aLeite Júnior, Bruno Ricardo Castro de1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9030-28191 aRamos, Afonso Mota0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113448-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01285naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011200162300001800274520030400292592002800596650001400624650001300638650001100651650001900662650002800681650002000709650001100729700002300740773012500763856007400888852000900962655001200971IND60662698920221119113011.0190906e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066269892DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc40401c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaig, R.

Bison are infected with brucellosis (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian state‐space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the Yellowstone bison population. A frequency‐dependent model of brucellosis transmission was superior to a density‐dependent model in predicting out‐of‐sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency‐dependent model, brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr⁻¹. The median of the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R₀) was 1.75. Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60% over two decades, but only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed recruitment; estimated population growth rate λ averaged 1.07 for an infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five‐year forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200 seropositive female bison increased by 30‐fold the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40% and increased by a factor of 120 the probability of achieving a 50% reduction in transmission probability relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals increased the likelihood of a 50% reduction in transmission probability by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short‐term commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data and model forecasts. We believe our approach has broad applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBison bison 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aadaptive management 3aadults 3abison 3abrucellosis 3aconservation areas 3adisease transmission 3aecosystems 3afemales 3alivestock 3amanagers 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3anational parks 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aseroprevalence 3auncertainty 3aUnited States1 aGeremia, Chris1 aTreanor, John1 aWallen, Rick1 aWhite, P.

A typical stratigraphic sequence in this area consists of: (i) post-Cary loess, (ii) Cary till or mixed zone (14,000 years B.P.), (iii) Rockian till (30,000 years B.P.), and (iv) Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The Cary drift is thin over much of the uplands in this area; thus, current soil profiles are developed in both the Cary and Rockian drifts. Morphological data indicate the presence of a paleosol on the Rockian till. This was substantiated by various physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses. Characteristics of the paleosol include the accumulation of clay in the B horizon, translocated iron, and a strongly leached solum. The CaO/ZrO₂ and Fe₂O₃/ZrO₂ molar ratios of selected size fractions also indicate a weathering interval between deposition of the Cary and Rockian sediments. Clay-mineral analyses showed variation in lithology and weathering of the drifts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB horizons 3aPaleozoic era 3acalcium oxide 3aclay 3aferric oxide 3aglacial deposits 3ahighlands 3airon 3alithology 3aloess 3apaleosolic soil types 3asedimentary rocks 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3aweathering 3azirconium oxide 3aWisconsin1 aRust, R.

I. Calibration of soil water  ap. 183-193.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil water supply plays a key role in driving switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) yield, and therefore is an important parameter for crop‐model accuracy. ALMANAC (Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria) model has been applied to simulating switchgrass growth with mixed results. The objective was to develop and test a calibration for ALMANAC simulating soil water dynamics in a switchgrass (‘Alamo’) stand under Arkansas conditions. Soil volumetric water content (SW) profiles were measured daily in switchgrass from May 2009 to February 2013. Soil, crop, and weather input data were developed based on in situ measurements. After identifying the most sensitive parameters in SW simulation, a calibration method was proposed, and the parameters initial soil water (FFC), permanent wilting point (U), field capacity (FC), sand content (SAN), silt content (SIL), pH, and maximum stomatal conductance (GSI) were modified. Daily SW simulation outputs from default and calibrated runs were compared to SW observations. Default Willmott agreement d‐index values were lower than the calibrated d‐index values in all years. Therefore, calibration improved simulation accuracy. Calibration accuracy was greater in 2009 and 2010 than in 2011 and 2012. Lower root mean square error of calibrated versus observed SW data confirmed the elevated d‐index values. Lower accuracy in the latter years was related to drought periods when ALMANAC was unable to mimic switchgrass drought adaption by lowering GSI. Calibration of SW in ALMANAC was aided by using site‐specific soil data. Improvement of SW calibration for drought‐resistant plants may be achieved by quantifying GSI dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  cDivision of Agriculture, University of Arkansas System  cDOE Mid-South Consortium 3aPanicum virgatum 3aagricultural land 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3acalibration 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afield capacity 3aland management 3apH 3asand fraction 3asilt fraction 3asoil water 3astomatal conductance 3avolumetric water content 3awater supply 3aArkansas1 aAshworth, A.

However, since Pb gasoline has been phased out globally, questions about whether there was a decrease in seawater Pb concentration, or if there are other sources taking over remains unclear in Southeast Asia. Here, combining Pb concentrations in seawater from Singapore Strait in 2010–2017; trap sediment in 2018–2019; and the previously published coral reconstruction covering 1975–2010; we found that the seawater Pb concentration in Singapore Strait over past decades followed the regional gasoline emissions, and no additional major source had contributed the Pb in the seawater since ~2010. The present-day Pb in Singapore Straits' water mainly follows the monsoonal current reversals, with variable degrees of scavenging that peak in inter-monsoon season. Minor Pb sources still contribute to some local-scale variabilities, despite a decadal-scale decreasing trend of Pb in seawater.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSingapore 3acorals 3agasoline 3alead 3amarine pollution 3aoceans 3aseawater 3asediments 0aPb 0aCoastal scavenging 0aTrace metal 0aTrap sediment 0aSoutheast Asia 0aSeawater1 aCarrasco, Gonzalo1 aPark, Edward1 aMorgan, Kyle1 aTay, Serene Hui Xin1 aTanzil, Jani1 aOoi, Seng Keat1 aZhou, Kuanbo1 aBoyle, Edward A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 June, v. 179 p.113654-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1136543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245008900177300001800266500000900284520236900293592002802662650002202690650000902712650001802721650002602739650002402765650001702789650001502806650000902821650001002830650000902840650002602849650001702875650001702892651001402909700001602923773015002939856009603089852000903185655001203194IND60668403920221120222608.0191125e198611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066840392DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000060026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrum, J. R.10aCharacterization and Stratigraphy of Soil Parent Materials of West-central Minnesota  ap. 1509-1515.  aepub  aWithin the Alexandria Moraine Complex in west-central Minnesota there are “islands” of fine textured soils and parent materials embedded within a matrix of coarser textured soils. To study the soils and the stratigraphic relationships of the parent materials, deep borings were made along two transects perpendicular to the Alexandria Moraine. A total of 27 sites were investigated. Particlesize distribution, CaCO₃ equivalent, clay-sized carbonate, and the dominant mineralogy of the >2 mm, 1 to 2 mm very coarse sand (vcos), and <2-µm fractions were determined. Four glacial materials were identified in this study: New Ulm till, Kandiyohi till, Granite Falls till, and a “mixed” drift of mainly New Ulm and Granite Falls materials. The average clay content of the glacial materials ranges from about 370 g kg⁻¹ in the Kandiyohi to about 130 g kg⁻¹ in the Granite Falls and mixed drifts. The average shale content in the vcos fraction ranges from about 620 g kg⁻¹ in the Kandiyohi till to about 60 g kg⁻¹ in the Granite Falls till. The average CaCO₃ equivalent ranges from about 220 g kg⁻¹ in Granite Falls till to about 170 g kg⁻¹ in the mixed drift. Statistically significant differences occur among the glacial materials in the concentration of sand, silt, clay, concentration of shale, carbonate, and crystalline pebbles in the vcos fraction, and the concentration of coarse fragments. A stepwise discriminant analysis was made and the four glacial materials were numerically defined by the first two canonical variables. The stratigraphic relationships of the two areas of Kandiyohi till outcrop studied seem to be quite different. The data from the western part of the county indicate much mixing of New Ulm and Granite Falls tills. Data from the eastern transect indicate the Kandiyohi till is an older till that has been thrust to the surface. It is suggested that the Kandiyohi till is a distinctly different glacial till in that: (i) the soils developed on this till are taxonomically distinct from soils on adjacent tills; (ii) the shale concentrations within the four defined glacial materials in the study region are statistically different; (iii) no other areas of this glacial till have been observed except in the Alexandria Moraine; and (iv) the glacial till outcrops are characteristically narrow linear features.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3adiscriminant analysis 3afine-textured soils 3aglacial till 3amineralogy 3asand 3ashale 3asilt 3asoil parent materials 3asoil texture 3astratigraphy 3aMinnesota1 aRust, R.

First, conditions for the enzymatic reaction were optimized by determining the polymerization degree of lignin along the incubation time. Next, using rheological characteristics as a response function, the Kraft lignin amount and incubation time were optimized to get the best characteristics of functionalized Kraft lignin to be used as a thickener in castor oil oleogels. In both cases, response surface methodology (RSM) with a factorial design 2³ was applied. The results obtained demonstrated that Kraft lignin was oxidized by recombinant laccase from S. ipomoeae (SilA) increasing its reactivity and, as consequence, the molecular weight average. It was estimated that the highest polymerization occurred with a Kraft lignin concentration of 1.25 g/L and an incubation time of 24.0 min. Moreover, the maximum values of the “plateau modulus” for the oleogels within the limits of the studied region were reached with 66.6 g/L of Kraft lignin and a reaction time of 1.98 h. In conclusion, eco-friendly oleogels obtained in this work fulfil the industrial requirements concerning their rheological properties to be considered as an efficient and biodegradable alternative to traditional lubricants containing lithium as the thickener.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces ipomoeae 3abiodegradability 3acastor oil 3aenzymatic reactions 3agreen chemistry 3alaccase 3alignin 3alithium 3amolecular weight 3aoleogels 3apolymerization 3aresponse surface methodology 3athickeners 0aStreptomyces laccase 0aresidual lignin valorization 0aresponse surface methodology (RSM) 0asustainable oleogels 0arheological characterization 0acircular economy1 aBlánquez, Alba1 aBorrero-López, Antonio M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9483-37131 aValencia, Concepción1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9197-46061 aEugenio, María Eugenia1 aArias, María Enriqueta1 aRodríguez, Juana,1 aHernández, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1430-99520 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 9, no. 12 p.4611-4616dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c001133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245012700155300001600282500002000298520235100318592002802669650002502697650002802722650001602750650001202766650001902778650000902797650003002806650001102836650001802847650002202865650001502887650000902902650001602911650001102927651001102938651002602949700002302975773010302998856007203101852000903173655001203182IND60569913920221116213258.0170626e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056991392DNAL7 a10.1002/ecm.12252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoland, Jens10aPivotal effect of early‐winter temperatures and snowfall on population growth of alpine Parnassius smintheus butterflies  ap. 412-428.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGeographic range shifts in species’ distributions, due to climate change, imply altered dynamics at both their northern and southern range limits, or at upper and lower elevational limits. There is therefore a need to identify specific weather or climate variable(s), and life stages or cohorts on which they act, and how these affect population growth. Identifying such variables permits prediction of population increase or decline under a changing climate, and shifts in a species’ geographic range. For relatively well studied groups, such as butterflies, geographic range shifts are well documented, but weather variables and mechanisms causing those shifts are not well known. The Holarctic butterfly genus Parnassius (Papilionidae) inhabits northern and alpine environments subject to variable and extreme weather. As such, Parnassius species are vulnerable not only to long‐term changes in average conditions but especially to short‐term extreme weather events. We use population growth estimates for the alpine butterfly, Parnassius smintheus, from 21 populations in the Rocky Mountains of Canada over a 20‐yr interval combined with techniques of machine learning (randomForests) and parametric modeling to identify the important weather variables determining population growth. We do this to determine the seasons and life stages of P. smintheus most affected by climate change. Extreme minimum and maximum temperatures in November, in combination with November snowfall, affect annual population growth most, more so than do mean temperatures in November, and more so than weather at any other time of year. Populations decline both in years with low extreme minimum temperatures in November and especially in years with high extreme maximum temperatures in November, indicating that overwintering eggs are particularly vulnerable to early‐winter weather. Snowfall ameliorates the negative effects of extreme temperatures, particularly for extreme warm events. Results provide insight into biological mechanisms by which overwintering eggs might be affected by early winter weather. Short‐term extreme weather in November, acting on a single pivotal life stage (egg) is a far better predictor of population change of alpine P. smintheus butterflies than is the general index of climate, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParnassius smintheus 3aartificial intelligence 3abutterflies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeggs 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3asnow 3atemperature 3awinter 3aCanada 3aRocky Mountain region1 aMatter, Stephen F.0 tEcological monographs.g2016 Nov., v. 86, no. 4 p.412-428dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.12253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245011800199300002000317520153100337592002801868650001701896650002501913650001701938650001401955650001401969650001901983650002802002650001102030650001502041650002302056650001502079650002902094650001802123650001402141653002702155653001402182653001502196700001802211700001802229700001902247700001502266700001702281700001802298773015002316856008102466852000902547655001202556IND60753919320221119220955.0211020e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075391932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c027032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Suwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5876-881910aIntegrative Analyses of Metabolomes and Transcriptomes Provide Insights into Flavonoid Variation in Grape Berries  ap. 12354-12367.  aFlavonoids in grapes contribute the quality of the berry, but the flavonoid diversity and the regulatory networks underlying the variation require a further investigation. In this study, we integrated multi-omics data to systematically explore the global metabolic and transcriptional profiles in the skins and pulps of three grape cultivars. The results revealed large-scale differences involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway. A total of 133 flavonoids, including flavone and flavone C-glycosides, were identified. Beyond the visible differences of anthocyanins, there was large variation in other sub-branched flavonoids, most of which were positively correlated with anthocyanins in grapes. The expressions of most flavonoid biosynthetic genes and the major regulators MYBA1 were strongly consistent with the changes in flavonoids. Integrative analysis identified two novel transcription factors (MYB24 and MADS5) and two ubiquitin proteins (RHA2) as promising regulatory candidates for flavonoid biosynthesis in grapes. Further verification in various grape accessions indicated that five major genes including flavonol 3′5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyl-transferase, anthocyanin O-methyltransferase, acyltransferase (3AT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST4) controlled flavonoid variation in grape berries. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in grape berries and the further development of grape health products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3aflavonols 3afood chemistry 3aglutathione transferase 3agrapes 3ametabolome 3amethyltransferases 3amultiomics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3aubiquitin 0agrape (Vitis vinifera) 0aflavonoid 0askin color1 aWang, Jiayang1 aZhuge, Yaxian1 aZhang, Mengwei1 aLiu, Chang1 aJia, Haifeng1 aFang, Jinggui0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 69, no. 41 p.12354-12367dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c027033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009700156300001600253500001900269520110100288592002801389650001901417650001401436650001501450650002901465650001601494700001401510700001501524700001801539773013201557856007401689852000901763655001201772IND60661438520221122162339.0190829e20131216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066143852DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60323g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Jinli12aA review of catalysts for the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to produce low-carbon fuels  ap. 631-675.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper reviews recent progress made in identifying electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction to produce low-carbon fuels, including CO, HCOOH/HCOO⁻, CH₂O, CH₄, H₂C₂O₄/HC₂O₄⁻, C₂H₄, CH₃OH, CH₃CH₂OH and others.

The catalyts' activity, product selectivity, Faradaic efficiency, catalytic stability and reduction mechanisms during CO₂ electroreduction have received detailed treatment. In particular, we review the effects of electrode potential, solution–electrolyte type and composition, temperature, pressure, and other conditions on these catalyst properties. The challenges in achieving highly active and stable CO₂ reduction electrocatalysts are analyzed, and several research directions for practical applications are proposed, with the aim of mitigating performance degradation, overcoming additional challenges, and facilitating research and development in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectrodes 3aresearch and development 3atemperature1 aLiu, Yuyu1 aHong, Feng1 aZhang, Jiujun0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Dec. 16, v. 43, no. 2 p.631-675dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60323g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016600166520117200332592002801504650001501532650001801547653002501565653002901590653001601619653000901635653002001644773009501664856008501759852000901844655001201853IND60773558620221120175600.0220522e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077355862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pedobi.2022.1508082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Taiki10aGreater impacts of phosphorus fertilization on soil phosphatase activity in tropical forests than in non-tropical natural terrestrial ecosystems: A meta-analysis  aIn phosphorus (P)-poor tropical forests, soil microorganisms are hypothesized to depend on organic P sources more intensively than in other natural terrestrial ecosystems. I tested this hypothesis by conducting a meta-analysis to compare soil phosphatase activity responses to experimental P fertilization between tropical forests and other natural terrestrial ecosystems. I found that P fertilization significantly reduced soil phosphatase activity in tropical forests, and to a significantly greater extent than in non-tropical natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, supporting the above hypothesis. I suggest three potential mechanisms for this result. First, inorganic P supply may be lower in tropical forests; however, this mechanism is less likely because inorganic P input into tropical forests soils via biological processes is not necessarily small. Second, the strong P adsorption capacity of tropical soils may substantially reduce inorganic P availability, thereby enhancing microbial organic P dependence. Third, higher P demand due to higher biological productivity in tropical forests may intensify microbial organic P dependence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ameta-analysis 0aextracellular enzyme 0aphosphorus fertilization 0aphosphatase 0asoil 0atropical forest0 tPedobiologia.g2022 June, v. 91-92 p.150808-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1957x0031-40567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2022.1508083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008100163300001600244500002000260520147200280592002801752596003701780650002201817650002501839650001301864650001601877650001201893650001201905650001101917650001801928650001701946650001701963650001301980650001401993650001402007650002802021650001302049650001502062650001402077650001902091650001102110650000902121700006002130700002402190773011702214856007502331852000902406655001202415IND60786306420221119155544.0220803e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078630642DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.200502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoursakhi, Nazanin10aNutritional qualities, chemical compositions, and yield of chicory genotypes  ap. 344-351.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChicory (Cichorium intybus L.) has been used as a forage crop in some parts of the world. Forage chicory is a highly digestible, nonbloating feed source which is characterized by high nutritive and mineral contents. However, limited information is available on nutritional qualities, chemical compositions, and yield of different genotypes of chicory. Therefore, a 2‐yr study was conducted to evaluate the qualitative traits and forage yield of chicory genotypes. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications using eight chicory genotypes (‘Ardestan,’ ‘Hamadan,’ ‘Shiraz,’ ‘Mazandaran,’ ‘Sanandaj,’ ‘Kashan,’ ‘Yazd,’ and ‘Mashhad’). The crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ash content (ASH), non‐fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and dry herbage yield (DHY) were significantly influenced by genotypes. Yazd was the superior chicory genotype compared to tested genotypes in terms of high CP, ASH, NFC, N, K, Cu, and Zn and low NDF and ADF contents, while Sanandaj showed the highest forage yield. Our results indicate that chicory can be considered as a promising forage crop in a semi‐arid environment and also allows for the selection of better genotype for direct cultivation or breeding purpose.  aPublisher supplied data  cIsfahan University of Technology 3aCichorium intybus 3aacid detergent fiber 3aagronomy 3aash content 3acalcium 3achicory 3acopper 3acrude protein 3aforage crops 3aforage yield 3agenotype 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asemiarid zones 3asodium 3azinc1 aRazmjoo, Jamshid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6060-29171 aKarimmojeni, Hassan0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.344-351dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.200503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013800167300001400305520110800319592002801427650002601455650003401481650002401515650002501539650001001564650001701574650001301591650001501604650001601619653004401635653002701679653000901706653001601715700001701731700001701748700001401765700001701779700001801796700001701814773008701831856008401918852000902002655001202011IND60612620420221122030513.0180905e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061262042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aggene.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Xiaosu10aGenetic and environmental effect on the growth characteristics and bioactive components of eight-year-old Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch  ap. 57-62.  aLicorice derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch is an important traditional Chinese medicine. The cultivated licorice has gradually replaced the wild licorice, becoming the main source, while its quality is unstable. To explore the influence of genetic and environment on the quality of cultivated licorice, the growth characteristics and the contents of glycyrrhizin and liquiritin of eight-year-old licorice were analyzed. The growth characteristics and contents of glycyrrhizin and liquiritin of eight-year-old licorice varied in different provenances. Especially, the contents of lycyrrhizin and liquiritin of different sources existed significant variation owing to genetic expression. Further, the growth characteristics were negatively correlated with temperature and moisture, while the contents of glycyrrhizin and liquiritin were positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with moisture. It indicated that there were significant geographic variations in the growth of eight-year-old licorice, which was associated with genetic expression and the ecological environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abioactive compounds 3aenvironmental impact 3agenes 3aglycyrrhizin 3alicorice 3aprovenance 3atemperature 0aLicorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) 0agrowth characteristics 0agene 0aenvironment1 aLiu, Rongxiu1 aLiu, Hongpei1 aYu, Fulai1 aWang, Jiyong1 aWang, Wenquan1 aWei, Shengli0 tAgri Gene.g2017 Mar., v. 3 p.57-62dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23356x2352-21517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aggene.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009100165520167000256592002801926650001901954650001801973650001701991650001102008650000902019650001502028650001402043650001102057650002902068650002002097650001802117650001102135650001902146650001602165650003102181651001002212653002302222653002102245700001702266700001602283700001602299773011302315856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60655377320221118005810.0190801e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065537732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1177312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xinli12aA factorial environment-oriented input-output model for diagnosing urban air pollution  aThe excessive emissions of various air pollutants seriously hinder the sustainability of cities. It is imperative to conduct a thorough diagnose of urban emission systems. The objective of this study is to develop a factorial environment-oriented input-output (FEIO) model to reveal the urban emission system's structural characteristics and possible internal interactions. Through constructing urban emissions networks regarding multiple air pollutants, the crucial transfer sectors and their relevant transactions are identified. Based on the results of identification, factorial analysis (FA) is further introduced to explore the effects of designed factors and their combinations. The results of the case study for Guangdong Province, China demonstrate that the urban emission system differs from the natural ecosystem because of its complex structure. The impact of various air pollutants on the urban ecosystem is different from what they are expected, both the emitting sectors and their energy consumption structures are decisive. In Guangdong province, Manufacture of Metal and Non-metallic Mineral Products (MMN), Electric Power (EP), Electronic and Telecommunications Equipment (ETE) and Chemical Products (CP) are identified as transfer centers in the emission network. The contribution of air pollution derived from coal consumption is more than 48.30%. Both in 2012 and 2015, the contribution of interactions exceeded 17.46%. The VOCs emissions emitted by MMN and SO2 emissions emitted by EP have the greatest impact on the regional ecosystem. These findings can provide reliable information for ensuring regional air environmental protection targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acase studies 3acities 3acoal 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3afactor analysis 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3asulfur dioxide 3aurban areas 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aNetwork centrality 0aFactorial design1 aHuang, Guohe1 aLiu, Lirong1 aHe, Chengyu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Nov. 10, v. 237 p.117731-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1177313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009400161300001800255500001900273520046200292592002800754650001500782650001300797650001900810700002600829700002800855773013400883856007401017852000901091655001201100IND60661438720221122162418.0190829e20140224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066143872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60326a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlack, Samuel P.10aDisulfide exchange: exposing supramolecular reactivity through dynamic covalent chemistry  ap. 1861-1872.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA Tutorial Review of the subtle supramolecular interactions influencing the outcomes of equilibrating systems, focusing on the dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) of disulfide exchange reactions, is presented.

With regard to experimental methods the need of the use of radionuclides to detect small quantities of positive adsorption is discussed.

Strain W303‐1A, which carries the ade2‐1 mutation, is widely used in physiological and genetic research. Yeast extract‐based rich medium contains a low level of adenine, so that adenine is often depleted before glucose. This could affect the cell physiology of adenine auxotrophs grown in rich medium. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of adenine auxotrophy on cell morphology and stress physiology. Our results show that adenine depletion halts cell division, but that culture optical density continues to increase due to cell swelling. Accumulation of trehalose and a coincident 10‐fold increase in desiccation stress tolerance is observed in adenine auxotrophs after adenine depletion, when compared to prototrophs. Under adenine starvation, long‐term survival of W303‐1A is lower than during carbon starvation, but higher than during leucine starvation. We observed drastic adenine‐dependent changes in cell stress physiology, suggesting that results may be biased when adenine auxotrophs are grown in rich media without adenine supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aabsorbance 3aadenine 3aauxotrophs 3acarbon 3acell division 3agenetic markers 3aglucose 3ahaploidy 3aleucine 3amutation 3aphysiology 3astarvation 3astress tolerance 3atrehalose 3ayeasts1 aKibilds, Juris1 aLiepin̦š, Jānis,0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.697-707dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.121543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011200175500001900287520153700306592002801843650002101871650002701892650001401919650002901933650001201962650001001974650002001984650001802004650001702022650001802039650001902057650000902076650001902085650001102104650002102115650001802136650001602154653002502170653001302195653002102208653002802229700001702257700002002274773010202294856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60701357420221119190425.0201023e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070135742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyadarshi, Ruchir10aEffect of sulfur nanoparticles on properties of alginate-based films for active food packaging applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) were prepared and embedded in calcium cross-linked alginate films in varying concentration, and their effect on the functional properties of the films were studied. The FE-SEM image showed uniform dispersion of up to 2 wt% of SNPs, above which aggregation was observed. The addition of 2 wt% of SNPs showed the best results of the tensile and water vapor barrier properties, with an increase in 12% and 41%, respectively. The surface color of the films changed significantly by the addition of SNPs with a decrease in transparency. However, the UV barrier properties showed a considerable increase of 99%. In addition, the incorporation of SNPs increased the hydrophobicity of the film, which was evident by the increased water contact angle and decreased moisture content of the film, as indicated by the thermal analysis results. The antimicrobial activity of alginate/SNPs composite film was tested against foodborne pathogenic bacteria, E. coli and L. monocytogenes. The nanocomposite film did not completely destroy E. coli but showed a bacteriostatic activity to reduce the 60% of bacterial colonies. However, the activity against L. monocytogenes was found to be highly bactericidal at the highest nanoparticle concentration, where a 100% bacterial elimination was observed after 12 h of exposure. Thus, the alginate/SNPs composite film can be used for the packaging of frozen foods with high moisture content that are susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, such as meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aalginates 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium 3acolor 3acomposite films 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3ameat 3ananocomposites 3asulfur 3athermal analysis 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aSulfur nanoparticles 0aAlginate 0aActive packaging 0aAntimicrobial packaging1 aKim, Hyun-Ji1 aRhim, Jong-Whan0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Jan., v. 110 p.106155-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1061553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245009700168300001800265520144600283592002801729650002101757650001301778650001101791650002201802650001201824650001301836650001201849650001401861650002301875650002401898650002001922650001501942650001801957650001501975650003301990650001002023650001602033700002102049700002002070700002602090773012502116856007402241852000902315655001202324IND60662699820221119113213.0190906e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066269982DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc40437d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCláudio, Ana Filipa M.10aEnhanced extraction of caffeine from guaraná seeds using aqueous solutions of ionic liquids  ap. 2002-2010.  aThe extraction of caffeine from bioresources using more benign and cost-effective processes is of fundamental relevance towards the finding of alternative (bio)pesticides. Classically, the best attempts to extract caffeine from biomass have resulted in low efficiency and in a large consumption of hazardous organic solvents and/or energy requirements. Here, we report an enhanced and selective extraction of caffeine from guaraná (Paullinia cupana, Sapindaceae) seeds using aqueous solutions of ionic liquids. Several ionic liquids composed of imidazolium or pyrrolidinium cations combined with the chloride, acetate and tosylate anions were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the cation alkyl side chain length and the presence of functionalized groups were also addressed. Additional conditions such as the ionic liquid concentration, the contact time, the solid–liquid ratio and temperature were further optimized by a response surface methodology. Outstanding extraction yields (up to 9 wt% of caffeine per guaraná dry weight) were obtained at a moderate temperature and in a short-time. The recyclability and reusability of the ionic liquids were also confirmed. For the first time it is shown that aqueous solutions of ionic liquids are superior alternatives for the solid–liquid extraction of caffeine from biomass samples and, as a result, the development of an ionic-liquid-based process is straightforwardly envisaged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaullinia cupana 3aacetates 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomass 3acaffeine 3acations 3achlorides 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy requirements 3agreen chemistry 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3apesticides 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseeds 3atemperature1 aFerreira, Ana M.1 aFreire, Mara G.1 aCoutinho, João A.

The temporal and spatial variations in stable isotopic compositions of precipitation during the typhoon Lekima (2019) were investigated, based on rainwater samples collected at four sampling sites along its track between August 10 and August 12, 2019. Results showed that the δ¹⁸O and δD values of rainwater samples varied from −15.5‰ to −2.9‰ and from −112.4‰ to −17.3‰, respectively. The large ranges of δ¹⁸O and δD values in rainwater from the typhoon Lekima were most likely caused by the changes in rainfall intensity and its complex interaction with local water vapor. In addition, it was observed that the δ¹⁸O and δD values gradually decreased from the outer rainbands to the inner rainbands, and their values were more depleted of heavy isotopes than those of local rain. We speculated that both the high stratiform precipitation fractions and the deep convection system may be responsible for the isotopic depletion of rainwater related with the typhoon Lekima. It reveals that the rain type fractions and the intensity of convection should be considered in the elucidation of δ¹⁸O signals in extreme precipitation events. This study also has important implications for understanding atmospheric moisture cycles in tropical cyclones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aenvironment 3ahydrologic models 3arain 3arain intensity 3atyphoons 3awater vapor 3aChina 0aOxygen isotopes 0aPrecipitation 0aTropical cyclones 0aStratiform fractions 0aDeep convection1 aLang, Yunchao1 aWang, Tiejun1 aLiu, Cong-Qiang1 aLi, Feili1 aWang, Fushun1 aGuo, Qingjun1 aLi, Siliang1 aLiu, Mingxuan1 aWang, Yue1 aXu, Aizhe0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143143-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170500001900296520176700315592002802082650001902110650001902129650001602148650001802164650002102182650001502203650000902218650002002227650001702247650001102264650003002275650001902305650001702324653001502341653001802356653002102374653002202395700001502417700001702432700001702449773011902466856008802585852000902673655001202682IND60714901920221120201549.0210305e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071490192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoli10aUrbanization and climate change impacts on future flood risk in the Pearl River Delta under shared socioeconomic pathways  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate change and urbanization are converging to challenge the flood control in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) due to their adverse impacts on precipitation extremes and the urban areas environment. Previous studies have investigated temporal changes in flood risk with various single factor, few have considered the joint effects of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Here, based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of future (2030–2050) flood risk over the PRD combined with a thorough investigation of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Precipitation extremes were projected using the regional climate model RegCM4.6, and urbanization growth was projected based on the CA-Markov model. The economic and population development was estimated by the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Flood risk mapping with different RCPs-urbanization-SSPs scenarios was developed for the PRD based on the set pair analyze theory. The results show that climate change and urbanization are expected to exacerbate flood risk in most parts of the PRD during the next few decades, concurrently with more intense extreme precipitation events. The high flood risk areas are projected mainly in the urban regions with unfavorable terrain and dense population. The highest flood risk areas are expected to increase by 8.72% and 19.80% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions may effectively mitigate the flood risk over the PRD. This study highlight the links between flood risk and changing environment, suggesting that flood risk management and preventative actions should be included in regional adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aenvironment 3aflood control 3agreenhouse gases 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arisk management 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3aurbanization 0aFlood risk 0aSSP scenarios 0aSet pair analyze 0aPearl River Delta1 aZhang, Han1 aChen, Wenjie1 aHuang, Guoru0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143144-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168300001800281500001900299520144800318592002801766650001901794650001601813650002701829650002001856650001701876650003301893650002001926650001301946650002401959650002201983650001302005653002002018653001902038653001802057653001602075653001402091700001902105700001302124700001602137700005302153700005802206773014402264856008502408852000902493655001202502IND60732521320221116171757.0210329e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073252132DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c005542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Zizhao10aAmidation Way of Diphenolic Acid for Preparing Biopolybenzoxazine Resin with Outstanding Thermal Performance  ap. 4668-4680.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDiphenolic acid (DPA) is a renewable chemical attracting great interest in biobased polymer science. Despite their low toxicity and high recyclability, the undesirable decarboxylation of DPA-based polymers generally leads to poor thermal stability and material failure restricting their practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of amide groups into a benzoxazine molecule can effectively avoid this problem while improving the thermally mechanical performance of the polybenzoxazine resin. We first synthesized a tetra-phenolic compound via a condensation reaction of DPA with hexanediamine through an ammonium salt route and then prepared a tetrafunctional benzoxazine, denominating as DHDA-fa, by a further reaction with furfurylamine and formaldehyde in a polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG-200) medium. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and decomposition temperature (Td₅) of the resulting poly(DHDA-fa) were found to be 326 and 384 °C by DMA and TGA, respectively, which outperformed many biobased benzoxazine resins previously reported. Experimental results revealed that the enhanced hydrogen bonding and doubled oxazine functionary are the important contributors for the improved thermal and mechanical performances. This work confirmed a novel way to perfect DPA-based benzoxazine resins resulting in an effective strategy for developing biobased materials with high performance for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium salts 3abiopolymers 3acondensation reactions 3adecarboxylation 3aformaldehyde 3aglass transition temperature 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3apolyethylene glycol 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aDiphenolic acid 0aLevulinic acid 0aFurfurylamine 0aBenzoxazine 0aAmidation1 aZheng, Yanglei1 aLi, Qing1 aWang, Lujie1 aFu, Feiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4900-12371 aLiu, Xiangdong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5262-00310 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 9, no. 12 p.4668-4680dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c005543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245023500155300001800390520100300408592002801411650004401439650002201483650001501505650001901520650001401539650003701553650002001590650002201610650002101632650004401653650001301697650001401710650000701724650001401731650001101745650001201756650001301768650001801781650002101799650003701820700001601857700001801873700001801891700002601909773012501935856007402060852000902134655001202143IND60662700020221120034143.0190906e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066270002DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc40441b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, Suman12aA new MCM-41 supported HPF₆ catalyst for the library synthesis of highly substituted 1,4-dihydropyridines and oxidation to pyridines: report of one-dimensional packing towards LMSOMs and studies on their photophysical properties  ap. 1910-1924.  aA new heterogeneous MCM-41 silica supported HPF₆ catalyst has been synthesized and characterized using an array of sophisticated analytical techniques like BET, XRD, HRTEM, EDX, ²⁹Si MAS NMR, TGA, FTIR, and pH measurement. The broad applicability of silica-HPF₆ was probed through a library synthesis of highly substituted 1,4-dihydropyridines (1,4-DHPs). The 1,4-DHPs are further oxidized to pyridines with aqueous H₂O₂ as stoichiometric oxidant which is considered as an abundant and green oxidant. The pyridines spontaneously generate low molecular mass self-aggregated organic materials (LMSOMs). Their one-dimensional packing and interesting photophysical properties are reported. Synthesis using water as a solvent is of paramount importance for its sustainable green impact. Further, carbon dioxide and water were the only by-products, which added to its attractiveness.

Quantifying the reservoir sedimentation rate is essential for better water resources management. Conventional techniques such as hydrographic survey have limitations including time-consuming, cumbersome and costly. On the contrary, the availability of high resolution (both spatial and temporal) in public domain overcomes all these constraints. This study assessed Jayakwadi reservoir sedimentation using Landsat 8 OLI satellite data combined with ancillary data. Multi-date remotely sensed data were used to produce the water spread area of the reservoir, which was applied to compute the sedimentation rate. The revised live storage capacity of the reservoir between maximum and minimum levels observed under the period of analysis (2015–2017) was assessed utilizing the trapezoidal formula. The revised live storage capacity is assessed as 1942.258 against the designed capacity of 2170.935 Mm³ at full reservoir level. The total loss of reservoir capacity due to the sediment deposition during the period of 41 years (1975–2017) was estimated as 228.677 Mm³ (10.53%) which provided the average sedimentation rate of 5.58 Mm³ year¹. As this technique also provides the capacity of the reservoir at the different elevation on the date of the satellite pass, the revised elevation–capacity curve was also developed. The sedimentation analysis usually provides the volume of sediment deposited and rate of the deposition. However, the interest of the reservoir authorities and water resources planner’s lies in sub-watershed-wise sediment yield, and the critical sub-watersheds upstream reservoir requires conservation, etc. Therefore, in the present study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for the estimation of sediment yield of the reservoir. The average annual sediment yield obtained from the SWAT model using 36 years of data (1979–2014) was 13.144 Mm³ year⁻¹ with the density of the soil (loamy and clay) of 1.44 ton m⁻³. The findings revealed that the rate of sedimentation obtained from the remote sensing-based methods is in agreement with the results of the hydrographic survey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclay 3aremote sensing 3asediment yield 3asedimentation rate 3asediments 3asoil 3asubwatersheds 3asurveys 3awater management 3awater resources1 aGarg, Vaibhav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8264-74891 aNikam, Bhaskar Ramchandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7617-57611 aKhadatare, Madhusudan Y.1 aAggarwal, Shiv Prasad1 aKumar, A.

(2006) according to which, watersheds of Madagascar with headwaters at high altitude respond differently to drought from those with headwaters confined to relatively low elevations, with possibly profound effects on the biodiversity patterns of the island, we analyzed multi-year basin-specific observations of soil moisture and vegetation water content (derived from NRL's WindSat radiometer) and their response to precipitation departures (derived from TRMM 3B42 V7) from its local mean. These datasets were analyzed to investigate the hydrologic properties at the basin scale, including the speed with which vegetation and soil moisture respond to precipitation anomalies. We also looked at the basin-specific normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA's QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes of the various Malagasy basins. Finally, we correlated the basin response to the precipitation forcing, and compared the amplitude and time lag of the correlations across watersheds with high elevation headwaters versus those with low elevation headwaters in the aim of evaluating the drought-response hypothesis of Wilmé et al. (2006). Our results indicate that the vegetation water content time series exhibit several features that are consistent with those of the majority of the bioclimatic zones of the island. Specifically, although the speed of the response of the vegetation water content varies significantly among the different basins, it is inter-annually consistent for each watershed, while the soil–moisture time series are less consistent than the vegetation water content time series. This study is a first step in the quantification of the hydrologic properties derived from microwave remote sensing, and which could potentially shed new light on the different intra-annual responses of watersheds to precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis offers important insights into the hydro-geomorphologic drivers associated with biodiversity patterns in Madagascar, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine biotic diversification across the various bioclimatic regions of the island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3adrought 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awater content 3awatersheds 3aMadagascar 0aRemote sensing 0aHydrology 0aBiodiversity1 aHaddad, Ziad S.1 aAnagnostou, Emmanouil N.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 May 25, v. 148 p.1-15dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245009000169300001600259520114800275592002801423650002901451650002701480650002501507650002101532650001201553650001101565650001301576650001401589650001401603650002401617650001401641650001101655700002301666773017901689856007901868852000901947655001201956IND60080806120221119085425.0150218e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008080612DNAL7 a10.1111/1567-1364.121572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRødkær, Steven V.10aGlucose‐ and nitrogen sensing and regulatory mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 683-696.  aPro‐ and eukaryotic cells are constantly challenged by varying concentrations of nutrients in their environment. Perceiving and adapting to such changes are therefore crucial for cellular viability. Thus, numerous specialized cellular receptors continuously sense and react to the availability of nutrients such as glucose and nitrogen. When stimulated, these receptors initiate various cellular signaling pathways, which in concert constitute a complex regulatory network. To ensure a highly specific response, these pathways and networks cross‐communicate with each other and are regulated at several steps and by numerous different regulators. As numerous of these regulating proteins, biochemical mechanisms, and cellular pathways are evolutionary conserved, complex biochemical information relevant to humans can be obtained by studying simple organisms. Thus, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been recognized as a powerful model system to study fundamental biochemical processes. In the present review, we highlight central signaling pathways and molecular circuits conferring nitrogen‐ and glucose sensing in S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiochemical pathways 3aeukaryotic cells 3aglucose 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3aviability 3ayeasts1 aFærgeman, Nils J.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Aug., v. 14, no. 5 p.683-696dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.121573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015400165300002000319520115900339592002801498650004401526650001501570650001701585650001201602650002201614650002001636650001501656650001901671650001501690650002001705650001101725650001701736650002001753650001901773650004401792650002401836650001001860653001601870653002301886653002601909653002901935653002401964700001401988700005102002700001802053700005602071700001302127700005602140700005402196773014602250856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60759808620221122063008.0211213e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075980862DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c047312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan13aAn Integrated Absorption–Mineralization Process for CO₂ Capture and Sequestration: Reaction Mechanism, Recycling Stability, and Energy Evaluation  ap. 16577-16587.  aAn integrated absorption–mineralization process (IAM) was proposed to desorb and mineralize CO₂ captured by amine solvents using the semidry desulfurization slag (DFS). Four typical amine solvents (monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, methyl-diethanolamine, and 2-amine-2-methyl-1-propanol) were investigated in the IAM process to evaluate the working capacity, recycling stability, and regeneration ability of the amine solvents. The reaction mechanism between CO₂-saturated amine solutions and the DFS was interpreted with characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results indicated that bicarbonates were more beneficial to CO₂ chemical desorption than carbamates. Calcium hydroxide could mineralize bicarbonate and regenerate protonated amines, while calcium sulfate could only desorb bicarbonates and carbamates. By adjusting the solid–liquid ratio to prevent calcium from participating in mineralization, 2-amine-2-methyl-1-propanol showed the best recycling performance among all the amines because of its fast absorption rate, high CO₂ desorption efficiency, and excellent stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium sulfate 3acarbamates 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3adesulfurization 3aenergy 3aethanolamine 3agreen chemistry 3amineralization 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areaction mechanisms 3aslags 0aCO2 capture 0areaction mechanism 0achemical regeneration 0athe desulfurization slag 0arecycling stability1 aSong, Lei1 aMa, Kui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5667-47551 aLiu, Changjun1 aTang, Siyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4757-39921 aYan, Zhi1 aYue, Hairong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9558-05161 aLiang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2942-46860 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 9, no. 49 p.16577-16587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c047313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245011700214520182700331592002802158650002002186650001402206650002202220653004802242653001802290653002402308653001902332653001902351653003202370700002702402700006802429700002602497700001802523700002502541773009302566856008602659852000902745655001202754IND60727963220221118030243.0220315e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072796322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e062302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSison, Stephanie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3894-721910aMortality outcomes of patients on chronic mechanical ventilation in different care settings: A systematic review  aTo determine the outcomes of chronically ventilated patients outside the setting of intensive care units. Systematic review. Studies evaluating patients on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in different care settings. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS and Scopus databases from inception to March 27, 2020. Studies reporting mortality outcomes of patients ≥18 years of age on chronic invasive mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and other care settings were eligible for inclusion. Sixty studies were included in the systematic review. Mortality rates ranged from 13.7% to 77.8% in ICUs (n = 17 studies), 7.8%–51.0% in non-ICUs including step-down units and inpatient wards (n = 26 studies), and 12.0%–91.8% in home or nursing home settings (n = 19 studies). Age was associated with mortality in all care settings. Weaning rates ranged from 10.0% to 78.2% across non-ICU studies. Studies reporting weaning as their primary outcome demonstrated higher success rates in weaning. Home care studies reported low incidences of ventilator failure. None of the studies reported ventilator malfunction as the primary cause of death. Mortality outcomes across various settings were disparate due to methodological and clinical heterogeneity among studies. However, there is evidence to suggest non-ICU venues of care as a comparable alternative to ICUs for stable, chronically ventilated patients, with the additional benefit of providing specialized weaning programs. By synthesizing the global data on managing chronically ventilated patients in various care settings, this study provides health care systems and providers alternative venue options for the delivery of prolonged ventilatory care in the context of limited ICU resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahealth services 3amortality 3asystematic review 0aChronic or prolonged mechanical ventilation 0aCare settings 0aIntensive care unit 0aLong-term care 0aStep-down unit 0aHome mechanical ventilation1 aSivakumar, Gayathri K.1 aCaufield-Noll, Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5637-37171 aGreenough, William B.1 aOh, Esther S.1 aGaliatsatos, Panagis0 tHeliyon.g2021 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.e06230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e062303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011700171300001600288520069900304592002801003650001401031650003001045650001701075650001101092650004401103650001701147653002401164653002001188653003001208653001301238700002101251700001801272700002501290700002401315700002001339700002701359773010301386856008401489852000901573655001201582IND60125790920221117071713.0150428e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012579092DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9595192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwamou, Guy M.N.10aUnprecedented new nonadecyl para-hydroperoxycinnamate isolated from Erythrina excelsa and its cytotoxic activity  ap. 921-925.  aA new unprecedented cinnamate derivative (1) was obtained from Erythrina excelsa (Leguminosae) and identified as nonadecyl para -hydroperoxycinnamate.

Azizur12aA new spatial multi-criteria decision support tool for site selection for implementation of managed aquifer recharge  ap. 61-75.  aThis study reports the development of a new spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA) software tool for selecting suitable sites for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) systems. The new SMCDA software tool functions based on the combination of existing multi-criteria evaluation methods with modern decision analysis techniques. More specifically, non-compensatory screening, criteria standardization and weighting, and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) have been combined with Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA). This SMCDA tool may be implemented with a wide range of decision maker’s preferences. The tool’s user-friendly interface helps guide the decision maker through the sequential steps for site selection, those steps namely being constraint mapping, criteria hierarchy, criteria standardization and weighting, and criteria overlay. The tool offers some predetermined default criteria and standard methods to increase the trade-off between ease-of-use and efficiency. Integrated into ArcGIS, the tool has the advantage of using GIS tools for spatial analysis, and herein data may be processed and displayed. The tool is non-site specific, adaptive, and comprehensive, and may be applied to any type of site-selection problem. For demonstrating the robustness of the new tool, a case study was planned and executed at Algarve Region, Portugal. The efficiency of the SMCDA tool in the decision making process for selecting suitable sites for MAR was also demonstrated. Specific aspects of the tool such as built-in default criteria, explicit decision steps, and flexibility in choosing different options were key features, which benefited the study. The new SMCDA tool can be augmented by groundwater flow and transport modeling so as to achieve a more comprehensive approach to the selection process for the best locations of the MAR infiltration basins, as well as the locations of recovery wells and areas of groundwater protection. The new spatial multicriteria analysis tool has already been implemented within the GIS based Gabardine decision support system as an innovative MAR planning tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adecision support systems 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3ascreening 3awells 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aGroundwater 2aSoftware 2aWater Supply 3aPortugal1 aRusteberg, Bernd1 aGogu, R.C.1 aLobo Ferreira, J.P.1 aSauter, Martin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 May 30, v. 99 p.61-75dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002600187245011900213300001400332506007600346520092800422592002801350506003701378650001501415650001201430650001801442650003501460650001501495650001401510650002401524650000901548650000901557650001501566700002501581773009601606856008001702852000901782655001201791IND60083006520221207130012.0141101e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008300652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0202doi7 aPMC30534412pmcid7 a212555512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Gertraud W.10aMMTV-Cre transgenes can adversely affect lactation: Considerations for conditional gene deletion in mammary tissue  ap. 92-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCRE-loxP-mediated inactivation and activation of genes in mouse mammary epithelium have been widely used to study genetic pathways in normal development and neoplastic transformation in vivo. In 1997, we generated three distinct mouse lines carrying an identical MMTV-Cre transgene (lines A, D, and F). Because the presence of CRE recombinase can adversely affect the physiology of nonmammary cells, we explored whether transgenic females display lactational defects. Whereas dams from line D nurse their pups and display overtly normal mammary development, line A shows some impairment during lactation and females from line F completely fail to nurse their litters. The ability to nurse a litter correlates with the extent of alveolar development and differentiation. This study demonstrates the importance of including appropriate “Cre-only” controls and provides guidelines to avoid problems in data interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepithelium 3afemales 3agene deletion 3agenetically modified organisms 3aguidelines 3alactation 3amammary development 3amice 3apups 3atransgenes1 aHennighausen, Lothar0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 412, no. 1 p.92-95dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2011.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014100165300001800306520164700324592002801971650001301999650001202012650001202024650001202036650003602048650001202084650001402096650001602110650001902126650002102145650000902166651001402175651001002189653001702199653001502216653001202231653001202243653002202255653001802277653001202295653000902307653001302316653001102329653001402340653001602354653001302370653001502383653001902398700002002417700002402437700002402461700001802485773011302503856008002616852000902696655001202705IND60616559820221119071536.0181017e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061655982DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175145661032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeijers, Jane10aSkin comfort of base layer wool garments. Part 3: The effect of ethnicity on perceptions of comfort using Chinese and Australian wearers  ap. 1167-1180.  aThere is commercial interest in designing wool next-to-skin garments specifically for the domestic Chinese market. However, the current understanding of comfort has largely been obtained from studies with Caucasian wearers and its applicability to Chinese wearers is unknown. A study was undertaken that examined the tactile, thermal and moisture-based sensations of two groups of untrained female wearers drawn from an urban population in Australia: 25 Chinese wearers who had been born in China to Chinese parents and 23 control wearers. Sensations were recorded during a series of activities in a range of controlled climatic environments while wearing next-to-skin garments made from different fiber types (wool and cashmere) and different fiber diameters (15.5–20.3 µm). There is no evidence from this experiment to conclude that Chinese wearers are more sensitive in their discomfort, prickle and scratch response than the control wearers. They recorded lower scores and smaller increases in scores in response to activity, environment and garment type than the control wearers. For sensations that relate to the feel of garments against the skin, the Chinese group experienced increased sensation in comparison to the control group during a range of motion activities, for the 20.3 µm wool garment only. For sensations that relate to the thermophysiological state of the body, the control group experienced increased sensation as temperature and activity rose in comparison to the Chinese group. These differences in the sensational responses to activity and environment were associated with similar responses in discomfort scores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3afabrics 3afemales 3amarkets 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aparents 3asensation 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3aurban population 3awool 3aAustralia 3aChina 0anext-to-skin 0adiscomfort 0acomfort 0aprickle 0aChinese ethnicity 0atest protocol 0agarment 0awool 0acashmere 0awearer 0asensation 0aenvironment 0aactivity 0afiber type 0afiber diameter1 aStanton, John H1 aNaylor, Geoffrey RS1 aRamankutty, Padmaja1 aTester, David0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 85, no. 11 p.1167-1180dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175145661033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245010800157300001800265520124500283592002801528650002101556650002601577650002101603650002801624650002501652650002601677650001301703650001301716650001501729650001801744650001001762650001901772650001501791650001801806650000901824650000701833650001501840650002301855650001101878653002801889653003001917653002101947653002501968700001801993700001702011700001602028700001502044700001302059700001802072700001402090700001302104700002202117773015402139856007802293852000902371655001202380IND60539599520221120220940.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053959952DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-97612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Kan10aIn vitro and in vivo examination of anticolonization of pathogens by Lactobacillus paracasei FJ861111.1  ap. 6759-6766.  aVery limited information exists on the exclusion of pathogens by probiotics in the gut of the host challenged with pathogens. In this study, we tested probiotic characteristics in vitro and anticolonization ability of Lactobacillus paracasei FJ861111.1 in mice infected with selected pathogenic microorganisms. The in vitro results indicated that L. paracasei FJ861111.1 had a high survival in acidic conditions at pH 2.5 and bile salt concentration at 0.3%, and strong inhibition ability against common pathogens including Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The cell adhesion assays showed that L. paracasei FJ861111.1 exhibited strong adherence to HT-29 cells and excluded the adhesion of selected food-borne pathogens to HT-29 cells. The in vivo results showed that fermented milk with L. paracasei and viili (a Nordic yogurt product) significantly improved the population of total bacteria and of Lactobacillus in the feces of mice, and significantly inhibited the colonization of C. albicans to the intestines of mice post-C. albicans infection. Thus, it appears that this strain could be used as a probiotic organism for manufacturing functional fermented milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aShigella dysenteriae 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abile salts 3acell adhesion 3afeces 3afood pathogens 3aintestines 3amanufacturing 3amice 3apH 3aprobiotics 3asalt concentration 3ayogurt 0aLactobacillus paracasei 0aprobiotic characteristics 0aanticolonization 0apathogenic infection1 aChen, Tingtao1 aWu, Qinglong1 aXin, Hongbo1 aWei, Qiang1 aHu, Ping1 aWang, Xiaolei1 aWang, Xin1 aWei, Hua1 aShah, Nagendra P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Oct., v. 98, no. 10 p.6759-6766dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-97613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008200170300001600252520143700268592002801705650001701733650002301750650002001773650002901793650001501822650001901837650002401856653002001880653001701900653001401917653001701931653001601948700001601964700002001980700001702000700002502017700001902042700001502061700001802076773010702094856008502201852000902286655001202295IND60568997020221120034510.0190214e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056899702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafra-Calvo, N.10aTowards an indicator system to assess equitable management in protected areas  ap. 134-141.  aAichi Target 11 (AT11), adopted by 193 Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010, states that protected areas (PAs) must be equitably managed by 2020. However, significant challenges remain in terms of actual implementation of equitable management in PAs. These challenges include, among others, the lack of a standardized approach to assess and monitor social equity and the difficulty of reducing social equity to a series of metrics. This perspective addresses these challenges and it proposes a minimum set of ten indicators for assessing and monitoring the three dimensions of social equity in protected areas: recognition, procedure and distribution. The indicators target information on social equity regarding cultural identity, statutory and customary rights, knowledge diversity; free, prior and informed consent mechanisms, full participation and transparency in decision-making, access to justice, accountability over decisions, distribution of conservation burdens, and sharing of conservation benefits. The proposed indicator system is a first step in advancing an approach to facilitate our understanding of how the different dimensions of social equity are denied or recognized in PAs globally. The proposed system would be used by practitioners to mainstream social equity indicators in PAs assessments at the site level and to report to the CBD on the ‘equitably managed’ element of AT11.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3aenvironmental indicators 3amonitoring 3asocial justice 3awildlife management 0aAichi target 11 0aDistribution 0aProcedure 0aPAs managers 0aRecognition1 aPascual, U.1 aBrockington, D.1 aCoolsaet, B.1 aCortes-Vazquez, J.A.1 aGross-Camp, N.1 aPalomo, I.1 aBurgess, N.D.0 tBiological conservation.g2017 July, v. 211 p.134-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012100162300001600283500001500299520168700314592002802001650002502029650004902054650001302103650001002116650003102126650001602157650001402173650000902187650002002196650001402216650001002230650001202240650002102252653001302273653001002286700002302296700001802319700001902337700002102356700003002377700001802407700002302425700002302448700002302471700002302494700003202517773019202549856007302741852000902814655001202823IND60438721020221118044103.0151023e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043872102DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.130242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimault, Aurélie10aZmZHOUPI, an endosperm‐specific basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor involved in maize seed development  ap. 574-586.  a2019-12-06  aIn angiosperm seeds the embryo is embedded within the endosperm, which is in turn enveloped by the seed coat, making inter‐compartmental communication essential for coordinated seed growth. In this context the basic helix–loop–helix domain transcription factor AtZHOUPI (AtZOU) fulfils a key role in both the lysis of the transient endosperm and in embryo cuticle formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. In maize (Zea mays), a cereal with a persistent endosperm, a single gene, ZmZOU, falls into the same phylogenetic clade as AtZOU. Its expression is limited to the endosperm where it peaks during the filling stage. In ZmZOU‐RNA interference knock‐down lines embryo size is slightly reduced and the embryonic suspensor and the adjacent embryo surrounding region show retarded breakdown. Ectopic expression of ZmZOU reduces stomatal number, possibly due to inappropriate protein interactions. ZmZOU forms functional heterodimers with AtICE/AtSCREAM and the closely related maize proteins ZmICEb and ZmICEc, but its interaction is more efficient with the ZmICEa protein, which shows sequence divergence and only has close homologues in other monocotyledonous species. Consistent with the observation that these complexes can trans‐activate target gene promoters from Arabidopsis, ZmZOU partially complements the Atzou‐4 mutant. However, structural, trans‐activation and gene expression data support the hypothesis that ZmZOU and ZmICEa may have coevolved to form a functional complex unique to monocot seeds. This divergence may explain the reduced functionality of ZmZOU in Arabidopsis, and reflect functional specificities which are unique to the monocotyledon lineage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3aZea mays 3atesta 3atranscriptional activation 3acoevolution 3aphylogeny 3acorn 3agene expression 3aendosperm 3agenes 3amutants 3aseed development 0aproteins 0aseeds1 aGendrot, Ghislaine1 aChamot, Sophy1 aWidiez, Thomas1 aRabillé, Hervé1 aGérentes, Marie‐France1 aCreff, Audrey1 aThévenin, Johanne1 aDubreucq, Bertrand1 aIngram, Gwyneth C.1 aRogowsky, Peter M.1 aDepège‐Fargeix, Nathalie0 tplant journal.g2015 Nov., v. 84, no. 3 p.574-586dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.130243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245015600168300002000324520106900344592002801413650002301441650001501464650002201479650002601501650002201527650001101549650001301560650001101573700002101584700001801605700002001623700002101643700002401664700006001688700006501748700005901813773013801872856008002010852000902090655001202099IND60606151120221117060512.0180724e20180416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060615112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b022562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzolini, Martina10aAnisotropic Approach for Simulating Electron Transport in Layered Materials: Computational and Experimental Study of Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite  ap. 10159-10166.  aIn this work, we propose a theoretical and computational model for taking into account the anisotropic structure of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) in the Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport. In particular, the dielectric characteristics, such as the inelastic mean free path and energy losses, are treated by linearly combining the contributions to these observables along the two main orthogonal directions identifying the layered crystalline structure of HOPG (along the layer plane and perpendicular to it). Energy losses are evaluated from ab initio calculations of the dielectric function of the system along these two perpendicular directions. Monte Carlo simulated spectra, obtained with our anisotropic approach, are compared with acquired experimental data of reflection electron energy loss and secondary electron spectra, showing a good agreement. These findings validate the idea of the importance of considering properly weighted interplanar and intraplanar interactions in the simulation of electron transport in layered materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aanisotropy 3acrystal structure 3adielectric properties 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amodels1 aMorresi, Tommaso1 aAbrams, Kerry1 aMasters, Robert1 aStehling, Nicola1 aRodenburg, Cornelia1 aPugno, Nicola M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2136-23961 aTaioli, S.q(Simone),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4010-80001 aDapor, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6855-01890 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 16, v. 122, no. 18 p.10159-10166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b022563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007000170300001800240520057100258592002800829650001600857650001600873650002200889650002300911650002300934650002100957650004400978650002201022650001301044700001401057700005401071773012001125856008301245852000901328655001201337IND60685759620221121234911.0200306e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068575962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c004052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiao-Guang10aElectrophilic Hypervalent Trifluoromethylthio-Iodine(III) Reagent  ap. 2026-2031.  aHerein we report the design and synthesis of hypervalent trifluoromethylthio-iodine(III) reagent 1 and the elucidation of its structure by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.

We conducted surveys of participants in the City Nature Challenge, an international event in which participants engaged in monitoring wildlife and plants in their neighbourhoods. We received responses from 361 participants representing 12 countries including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia. There were significant differences in terms of socio-demographic attributes and participants’ perceptions of citizen/community science activities. Regression analysis revealed that the more participants learned about the animals and plants in their areas, the more they self-reported their intention to participate in similar activities in the future in both the United States and Japan. This suggests that managers of citizen/community science projects could tailor the message and contents of the activities to enhance participants’ learning about local biodiversity to increase their continued involvement in future events. Key policy insightsIn both the United States and Japan, the more participants learned about the animals and plants in their local area through citizen/community science activities, the more they were willing to participate in similar activities in the future. Cross-cultural comparison of participants in citizen/community science activities revealed significant differences in terms of socio-demographic attributes (e.g. participants in Japan and Malaysia were younger than those in the United States and the United Kingdom). Survey results revealed differences in participants’ perceptions of the citizen/community science activities (e.g. participants from Malaysia were more likely to be aware of the threats to animals and plants in their neighbourhood than those in the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom).  aThis work was supported by JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [Grant Number JP18H01073].  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18H01073 3aJapan 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3acitizen science 3across cultural studies 3aeducation 3aissues and policy 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aMalaysia 3aUnited Kingdom 0across-cultural comparison 0asurvey 0aperceptions 0awillingness to join future events 0aCity Nature Challenge1 aKobori, Hiromi1 aTogane, Dai1 aHiggins, Lila1 aYoung, Alison1 aKishimoto, Keidai1 aAgnello, Gaia1 aCutajar, Simone1 aHam, Young-Sik0 tBiodiversity.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 23, no. 1 p.21-29dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19681x2160-06517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2022.20548603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007100146245014300217300002000360520109700380592002801477650001601505650001501521650001501536650001401551650001701565650001601582650001301598650001801611650001701629650001501646650002601661650002001687650001901707650002301726650001601749700007801765700007501843700007001918773017401988856008002162852000902242655001202251IND60672095220200117000000.0191009e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067209522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b031842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravália, Beatriz Medeiros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4039-825810aAdsorption of Fermentation Inhibitors by Layered Double Hydroxides in Synthetic Hemicellulose Hydrolysate: A Batch Multicomponent Analysis  ap. 18822-18828.  aStudies have been conducted on detoxification of hemicellulose hydrolysates, but an effective detoxification method remains to be developed. The use of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as adsorbents may be a solution to this problem. In this study, LDHs composed of 30, 63, or 70% MgO were used in their uncalcined and calcined states to adsorb acetic acid, formic acid, hydroxymethylfurfural, and furfural from a synthetic hemicellulose hydrolysate. Kinetic studies revealed that calcined LDH composed of 70% MgO (MG70c) had the best performance: it was able to remove 73% of acetic acid and 90% of formic acid in 6 h of incubation at 50 °C. Hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural were not adsorbed (C/C₀ ≈ 1) by calcined or uncalcined LDHs under the studied conditions. The adsorption equilibrium was determined at different temperatures. Adsorption isotherms were best described by the Langmuir–Freundlich model. These results show the potential of MG70c to remove acetic and formic acids from hemicellulose hydrolysates, thereby increasing their suitability as fermentation substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aequations 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxides 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amagnesium oxide 3aprocess design 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aSantos, Nilza Tatiane das Grac̨as1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0091-713X1 aVieira, Melissa Gurgel Adeodato1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3487-799X1 aForte, Marcus Bruno Soares1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2263-43920 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Sept. 03, v. 58, no. 40 p.18822-18828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b031843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245006800167300001600235500002000251520189900271592002802170596006602198596003302264650001602297650001402313650001302327650001502340650001402355650001502369650002402384650001102408651001202419651001102431651001502442651001002457700002102467700001902488773013002507856007502637852000902712655001202721IND60787124920221122064839.0220807e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078712492DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.212522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeffelfinger, James R.10aClarifying historical range to aid recovery of the Mexican wolf  ap. 766-777.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe assessed historical, morphological, and genetic information on the range of the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) to plan the recovery of this endangered subspecies. Early accounts of its range included the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico, and southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and sometimes western Texas, USA. Such accounts are supported by ecological, physiographic, and morphological data. Recent suggestions to depict a more extensive northern periphery have been based primarily on a fragmented geographic sampling of genetic markers assumed to be diagnostic at subspecies level. Some of these genetic markers, found in extant Mexican wolves, reportedly also occur in a few individuals far to the north of the range defined in early accounts. Extending the historical range northward would necessitate drawing that line far north of transitions in wolf phenotype, breaks in vegetation associations, barriers to gene flow, and differences in prey base. We review morphologic, genetic, and ecological information to illustrate why such historical range extensions are not supported. The historical distribution of the Mexican wolf likely does not correspond to the detected distribution of certain molecular markers. The historical range of the Mexican wolf should not be altered through the identification of similar habitat in other locations, the distribution of inadequately sampled molecular markers, or by theoretical arguments about movement capacity. Rather, it should respect the original descriptions that were made when the animal was still present on the landscape, and which are concordant with ecological relationships, physiography, morphology, and the principles of population genetics. Clarifying the historical range of the Mexican wolf accurately will be foundational to developing a scientifically defensible recovery plan. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cFederal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman‐Robertson)  cArizona State Wildlife Grant 3aCanis lupus 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aphenotype 3avegetation 3awildlife management 3awolves 3aArizona 3aMexico 3aNew Mexico 3aTexas1 aNowak, Ronald M.1 aPaetkau, David0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2017 July, v. 81, no. 5 p.766-777dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.212523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001300269520117000282592002801452650001701480650002001497650001501517650002301532650003301555650001401588650001001602650001101612650002201623650001001645650001901655651001201674653001401686653001201700653003201712700001901744700001901763700001701782773010301799856008601902852000901988655001201997IND60777109420221122032727.0220514e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077710942DNAL7 a10.1080/14888386.2022.20586132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMailumo, S.

A multistage sampling technique was used to choose 302 crop farmers, and a well-structured questionnaire was used to generate the data. The information gathered was analysed using the Shannon and Simpson indices and the Poisson and Tobit regression models. The results show that crop production was dominated by male farmers on plots averaging 1.8 ha in size, with an average number of three crops grown per plot. The average values for the Shannon index and Simpson index are 0.34 and 0.85, respectively. The socio-economic factors explaining crop diversity in the area were the farmers’ age, level of education, household size, farm size and income. This study indicates policy strategies are needed that enhance technical knowledge and raise awareness of agro-crop biodiversity management. It also reveals a need for an increase in rural farm household incomes and greater investment in land reforms at both local and national levels in Nigeria.

Mulberry leaf components, for example 1-deoxynojirimycin (1-DNJ), inhibit the activity of α-glucosidase and prevent increased blood glucose levels, and they are highly toxic to caterpillars other than silkworms. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of mulberry leaves changes with the season, but it is unknown which environmental conditions influence the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. We investigated in this study the relationship between the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and environmental conditions of temperature and photoperiod. The results demonstrate that low temperatures induced decreasing α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, while the induction of newly grown shoots by the scission of branches induced increasing α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. These results suggest that the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was related to the defense mechanism of mulberry plants against insect herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3ablood glucose 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adeoxynojirimycin 3adiabetes 3aleaves 3amulberries 3asericulture 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 0aα-glucosidase inhibitor 0a1-deoxynojirimycine 0amulberry 0aresistance to insect herbivore1 aONOSE, Shinji1 aKITAHARA, Eriko1 aCHUMCHUEN, Sukunya1 aTAKASAKI, Midori1 aKONISHI, Hajime1 aKANEKATSU, Rensuke0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2011 Dec. 23, v. 75, no. 12 p.2293-2296dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1104073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166300001600273520143900289592002801728650002401756650002301780650002201803650001101825650002501836650001401861650001701875650002401892650001101916650001301927651001001940700001701950700001301967700001801980700001801998773009302016856008502109852000902194655001202203IND60084441620221119074958.0141101e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008444162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linjun10aEmergy evaluations of three aquaculture systems on wetlands surrounding the Pearl River Estuary, China  ap. 526-534.  aEmergy and economic analysis, accompanied by sensitivity analysis, were used to evaluate the ecological economic characteristics of three fish aquaculture systems on wetlands surrounding the Pearl River Estuary in China. The sustainability of these systems was compared to two aquaculture systems and two wetland systems, to provide reference conditions for the best use of limited wetland areas. We found that the three systems studied had similar emergy characteristics, despite their very different economic characteristics. Counter intuitively, the high economic input and output mode did not have higher environmental impact or lower sustainability compared with low economic input and output mode. Apparently, the sustainability of an intensive aquaculture system is determined mainly by how many natural renewable resources are exploited. The large differences in economic benefit and environmental impacts between the mangrove reserve and the aquaculture systems demonstrated the important role of nature reserves on preserving the sustainability of an estuary. Transformity (TR) and Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) are both indicators of system efficiency, but from different points of view, and they produced opposite results in assessing the efficiency of the same system in this study. The ratio of EYR to TR might be used in addition to the EYR and transformity as a discreet perspective on overall system production efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture systems 3aconservation areas 3aeconomic analysis 3aemergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3afish culture 3arenewable resources 3arivers 3awetlands 3aChina1 aLu, Hongfang1 aRen, Hai1 aKang, Wenling1 aChen, Feipeng0 tEcological indicators.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.526-534dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013800160300002000298520103300318592002801351650001301379650001301392650002101405650001701426650002401443650002201467650001901489700005201508700001901560700001401579700001601593700001701609700001401626773017301640856008001813852000901893655001201902IND60672095420221120185840.0191009e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067209542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b032762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao10aRock Salt-Type LiTiO₂@LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ as Cathode Materials with High Capacity Retention Rate and Stable Structure  ap. 18498-18507.  aHerein, a strategy is presented for improving the electrochemical performance of a LiNiₓCoyMn₁–ₓ–yO₂ layered oxide involving the coating of rock salt-type LiTiO₂ on the surface via a hydrothermal method followed by a calcination process. A thickness of approximately 10 nm of LiTiO₂ coated on the surface of LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ (NCM523) has been achieved, and the optimal molar ratio (LiTiO₂/NCM523) is found to be 1.0 mol %. The LiTiO₂@LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ when used as a cathode material exhibits not only a higher capacity retention but also a more enhanced rate performance in comparison with that of pristine NCM523. The LiTiO₂ layer protects the NCM523 active particles from being eroded by the electrolyte and reduces the volume change of the electrode active particles before and after lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation during cycling. These new findings contribute toward the design of a stable structured nickel-based cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ahot water treatment 3alithium batteries 3aprocess design1 aXiao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2709-57431 aLiu, Pengcheng1 aChen, Han1 aXia, Zhimei1 aYe, Longgang1 aHu, Yujie0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Aug. 28, v. 58, no. 40 p.18498-18507dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b032763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012700165300002000292500001900312520125500331592002801586650002201614650002101636650002101657650001201678650002201690650001501712700002001727700001901747700002501766700002101791700001901812700001901831700002101850773012501871856007401996852000902070655001202079IND60689151720221123045348.0200419e20200414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068915172DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00939c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Mohammad I.10aAtomic layer deposition of metal oxides for efficient perovskite single-junction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells  ap. 14856-14866.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAluminum-doped and undoped zinc oxide films were investigated as potential front and rear contacts of perovskite single and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. The films were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at low (<200 °C) substrate temperatures. The deposited films were crystalline with a single-phase wurtzite structure and exhibit excellent uniformity and low surface roughness which was confirmed by XRD and SEM measurements. Necessary material characterizations allow for realizing high-quality films with low resistivity and high optical transparency at the standard growth rate. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were carried out to extract the complex refractive index of the deposited films, which were used to study the optics of perovskite single junction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. The optics was investigated by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations. Guidelines are provided on how to realize perovskite solar cells exhibiting high short-circuit current densities. Furthermore, detailed guidelines are given for realizing perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with short-circuit current densities exceeding 20 mA cm⁻² and potential energy conversion efficiencies beyond 31%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3apotential energy 3arefractive index 3asilicon 3asurface roughness 3azinc oxide1 aAdnan Mohammad,1 aQarony, Wayesh1 aIlhom, Saidjafarzoda1 aShukla, Deepa R.1 aKnipp, Dietmar1 aBiyikli, Necmi1 aTsang, Yuen Hong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 14, v. 10, no. 25 p.14856-14866dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00939c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001300286520112200299592002801421650001901449650002901468650002301497650002501520650001601545650002001561650002201581650001001603650001001613650001101623650002501634650001801659650001401677650001401691651001101705651001701716653002401733653002301757653002101780653002101801700002701822700002101849700001601870773011201886856008601998852000902084655001202093IND60777109620221122012848.0220514e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077710962DNAL7 a10.2989/20702620.2021.20054542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolís, Myriam12aA serious shoot and leaf disease caused by Colletotrichum theobromicola discovered on eucalypts in South Africa  ap. 8-20.  aEucalypt plantations in South Africa make up an important part of the local forestry industry. Recently, one-year-old nursery plants of a Eucalyptus grandis × Eucalyptus urophylla variety displayed symptoms of leaf and shoot anthracnose disease. Samples were collected from these plants and isolations were made from the disease symptoms. Isolates were identified based on their morphological characteristics and DNA sequence data for eight gene regions. Phylogenetic analyses led to the isolates being identified as Colletotrichum theobromicola and the reduction of Colletotrichum pseudotheobromicola to synonymy with the former species. Pathogenicity trials with isolates of C. theobromicola were conducted on clones of E. grandis and hybrids of E. grandis × E. urophylla and E. grandis × Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Resulting symptoms were similar to those found on naturally infected plants and the fungus was re-isolated from the infections. Colletotrichum theobromicola is known to cause anthracnose on various plants including eucalypts in Brazil, but this is the first record of the pathogen in South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aanthracnose 3afoliar diseases 3aforest industries 3afungi 3agenes 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aBrazil 3aSouth Africa 0aanthracnose disease 0aEucalyptus hybrids 0afungal pathogens 0anursery diseases1 aWingfield, Michael J.,1 aGreyling, Izette1 aPham, Nam Q0 tSouthern forests.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 84, no. 1 p.8-20dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000154x2070-26397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/20702620.2021.20054543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003100129300001600160520149600176650001901672650001401691650001801705650001701723650001801740650001901758650001201777650002101789650001301810650002401823650001901847650001301866650001201879650001601891650001501907650001901922650001101941650001701952650002301969650001601992650001402008650002102022650001102043650001502054650002202069650001102091650001402102700002102116700001802137773007402155852000902229856010502238939003302343946001302376655001202389IND4479224320221120022614.0140328e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447922432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasdev, Sudesh10aNutrition and hypertension  ap. 111-123.  aNutritional supplementation with anti-oxidant vitamins such as Vitamin C and E or with B vitamins such as Vitamin B6, can lower blood pressure in persons with essential hypertension. These nutritional supplements may act to prevent one of the underlying causes of essential hypertension, elevated tissue aldehydes. In essential hypertension, excess endogenous aldehydes bind sulfhydryl groups of membrane proteins, altering membrane Ca2+ channels and increasing cytosolic free calcium and blood pressure. Abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism may underlie the etiology of the clinical course of hypertension. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance is a common feature of hypertension in human and in animal models. Elevated endogenous aldehydes in hypertension may be due to increased production of reactive aldehydes such as methylglyoxal, when the glycolytic pathway of glucose metabolism is impaired. In hypertension there is increased oxidative stress which can lead to a further increase in reactive aldehydes. The thiol compound, N-acetylcysteine, normalizes elevated blood pressure by binding excess endogenous aldehydes and normalizing vascular Ca2+ channels and cytosolic free calcium. Vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin B6 and lipoic acid are nutrients which can increase endogenous cysteine and glutathione. Dietary supplementation with these nutrients may improve carbohydrate metabolism, lower blood pressure and normalize associated biochemical and histopathological changes. 3aacetylcysteine 3aaldehydes 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3ablood pressure 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3acysteine 3adietary supplements 3adisease course 3aetiology 3aglucose 3aglutathione 3aglycolysis 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3ainsulin resistance 3alipoic acid 3anutrients 3aoxidative stress 3apeople 3apyridoxine 3asulfhydryl groups 3athiols 3avitamin E1 aLongerich, Linda1 aSingal, Pawan0 tNutrition research.g2002 , v. 22, no. 1-2 p.111-123x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0081-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140328  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245011700190300001800307520098900325650001701314650001501331650001801346650002601364650003201390650003901422650001701461650003701478650001301515650003101528650005201559650004901611650003001660653001801690653002501708653004001733653002901773653000801802700002101810700001801831700001901849700002301868773015001891852000902041856008502050930003302135946001102168655001202179IND4441258720221120022737.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444125872DNAL7 a203583682pmid7 a10.1007/s00249-010-0599-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrascosa, Laura G. 10aUnderstanding the role of thiol and disulfide self-assembled DNA receptor monolayers for biosensing applications  ap. 1433-1444.  aA detailed study of the immobilization of three differently sulfur-modified DNA receptors for biosensing applications is presented. The three receptors are DNA-(CH)n-SH-, DNA-(CH)n-SS-(CH)n-DNA, and DNA-(CH)n-SS-DMTO. Nanomechanical and surface plasmon resonance biosensors and fluorescence and radiolabelling techniques were used for the experimental evaluation. The results highlight the critical role of sulfur linker type in DNA self-assembly, affecting the kinetic adsorption and spatial distribution of DNA chains within the monolayer and the extent of chemisorption and physisorption. A spacer (mercaptohexanol, MCH) is used to evaluate the relative efficiencies of chemisorption of the three receptors by analysing the extent to which MCH can remove physisorbed molecules from each type of monolayer. It is demonstrated that -SH derivatization is the most suitable for biosensing purposes as it results in densely packed monolayers with the lowest ratio of physisorbed probes. 3afluorescence 2aAdsorption 2aBase Sequence 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aDNAxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDisulfidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFluorescence 2aHexanolsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aPhotoelectron Spectroscopy 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSurface Plasmon Resonance 0aThiolated DNA 0aBiofunctionalization 0aSurface plasmon resonance biosensor 0aNanomechanical biosensor 0aXPS1 aMartinez, Lidia.1 aHuttel, Yves 1 aRomán, Elisa 1 aLechuga, Laura M. 0 tEuropean biophysics journal with biophysics letters.g2010 Sept., v. 39, no. 10 p.1433-1444dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00249-010-0599-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100813b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01370naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245007600133300001600209300002600225500001500251520052700266650002300793650001500816650001700831650002000848653002100868653003000889773007400919852000900993939003301002945000801035946001301043655001201056991610531420742620221117172123.0860520e198511  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860103332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlton, D.K.10aPlant sensory evaluation within a multiplant international organization  ap. 130-134.  ap. 130-134, 142. ill.  a2019-12-05  aAn overview article discusses how and where an overall sensory evaluation program fits within a multi-plant international food processing organization, specifically addressing the functions and corporate contributions of the sensory evaluation group at the plant level.

Subjects were 188 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Overnight urine was collected for all subjects, and 24-hour urine was collected for 16% of the subjects. Daily sodium intake ranged from 8.5 to 10 g. Mean amount of sodium excreted in 24-hour urine was 83% of the mean intake calculated by dietary records. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two methods of assessment of urinary excretion of sodium was r = 0.71 (P < 0.001). However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the 95% limits of agreement varied widely, thus providing evidence of the large difference between the two methods. Bland-Altman analysis could be considered an important improvement over the use of correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between two methods. Estimation of sodium intake by means of dietary records was inaccurate when compared with urine collections (r = −0.41; P < 0.05 (24h) and r = 0.09; P = 0.175 (overnight). 3aadolescents 3achildren 3acorrelation 3aexcretion 3asodium 3aurine 3aBrazil1 aRosa, Alberto A.0 tNutrition research.g2003 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1477-1487x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0102-93Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140331  aOther US 7aarticle03806naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245018700182300001600369500002400385500001500409520135000424650003801774650001701812650001101829650001401840650001801854650002001872650001701892650001201909650001401921650002801935650001701963650001901980650001101999650001502010650002502025650002402050650001002074650001502084650002902099650003102128650002802159650007402187650006802261650001402329650004002343650001302383650001002396650004702406650001202453650003802465650004702503650004902550650004802599650004002647650004502687650003902732650002202771653001702793700001402810700001802824700001802842700001302860700001702873773010102890852000902991856004803000655001203048IND4424935320221117172128.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442493532DNAL7 a195217462pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-009-0247-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yanhong10aGrafting of Cucumis sativus onto Cucurbita ficifolia leads to improved plant growth, increased light utilization and reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in chilled plants  ap. 529-540.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of chilling at 14 and 7°C on plant growth, CO₂ assimilation, light allocation, photosynthetic electron flux and antioxidant metabolism were examined in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Jinyan No. 4, CS) plants with figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché, CF) and cucumber as rootstocks, respectively. Growth inhibition by chilling at 7°C was characterized by irreversible inhibition of CO₂ assimilation in grafted plants with cucumber as rootstock and scion (CS/CS) but this effect was significantly alleviated by grafting onto CF roots (CS/CF). Chilled CS/CF plants exhibited a higher photosynthetic activity and lower proportion of energy dissipation than chilled CS/CS plants. Chilling resulted in a greater decrease in the electron flux in photosystem (PS) II (J PSII) than the rate of energy dissipation either via light-dependent (J NPQ) or via constitutive thermal dissipation and fluorescence (J f,D) in CS/CS plants. In parallel with the reduction in J PSII, electron flux to oxygenation (J o) and carboxylation by Rubisco (J c) all decreased significantly whilst alternative electron flux in PS II (J a) increased, especially in CS/CS plants. Moreover, CS/CF plants exhibited higher activity of antioxidant enzymes, lower antioxidant content and less membrane peroxidation relative to CS/CS plants after chilling. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aplant growth 3aenergy 3aelectrons 3acarboxylation 3aCucumis sativus 3afluorescence 3acooling 3acucumbers 3areactive oxygen species 3aperoxidation 3aphotosystem II 3ascions 3arootstocks 3aantioxidant activity 3aCucurbita ficifolia 3aroots 2aAbsorption 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCucumis sativusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aCucurbitaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aElectrons 2aFree Radical Scavengersxmetabolism 2aFreezing 2aLight 2aPhotochemical Processesxradiation effects 2aPhotons 2aPhotosynthesisxradiation effects 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiologicalxradiation effects 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aantioxidants1 aZhou, Jie1 aHuang, Lifeng1 aDing, Xiaotao1 aShi, Kai1 aYu, Jingquan0 tJournal of plant research.g2009 Sept., v. 122, no. 5 p.529-540dSpringer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-009-0247-3 7aarticle03096naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245009400195300001600289500001500305520157400320650001401894650001301908650001301921650001301934650001801947650001501965650001501980650002301995650002202018650001902040650001202059650002002071650001502091650002502106650001702131650002102148650002402169653001902193700001502212700001502227700001802242700001702260700002202277700001802299700001802317700001402335773007702349852000902426930003302435945002502468946001302493655001202506IND4377158520221123040506.0060111e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437715852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in a group of professional handball players, the effects of short-term dietary supplementation with a standardized red orange extract (containing anthocyanins, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid; Red Orange Complex [ROC]) on some noninvasive biomarkers of oxidative stress. Eighteen professional handball players and 17 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The supplementation consisted of 50 mg ROC per capsule in micronized form; all subjects were recommended to take 1 capsule twice a day for 2 months. The end points of oxidative stress taken in consideration were the serum total antioxidant status, the serum level of thiol groups, lipid hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde, and the frequency of spontaneous sister chromatide exchanges in peripheral lymphocytes. The results obtained clearly reflect an overall lower level of oxidative stress in the athletes examined after short-term dietary supplementation with the ROC. Dietary supplementation with the ROC (which is endowed with strong antioxidant capacity) is able to decrease oxidative stress and thus might protect against its short- and long-term health consequences in athletes engaged in regular training programs. 3acultivars 3aexercise 3aathletes 3acyanidin 3afree radicals 3abiomarkers 3aDNA damage 3alipid peroxidation 3along term effects 3afruit extracts 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3aglucosides 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3adietary supplements 0aplant pigments1 aPuglia, C.1 aCimino, F.1 aTrombetta, D.1 aTringali, G.1 aRoccazzello, A.M.1 aInsirello, E.1 aRapisarda, P.1 aSaija, A.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.917-924x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060127b20060202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle02602naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010600166300001600272520132300288650001001611650001401621650002201635650001201657650001501669650002601684650001301710650001701723650001901740650001301759650001501772650002501787650001401812653002401826653002101850700002401871700002301895773011201918852000902030856008502039939003302124946001102157655001202168IND4449569420221123040549.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444956942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9417-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllmer, Maarten 14aThe structuring of quantitative genetic variation in a fragmented population of Briza media (Poaceae)  ap. 509-523.  aThe structuring of quantitative genetic variation can have a significant impact on the adaptive potential and long-term viability of species in changing landscapes. The present study of the grass Briza media investigated the relationships between patterns of heritable variation in phenotypic characters and descriptors of landscape structure, land-use history and local habitat conditions in a landscape known to have undergone a progressive and massive loss of semi-natural grassland habitat over the past 300 years. Our analyses revealed significant levels of heritable variation for characters related to overall plant size and spikelet size-number ratio, with estimates of broad-sense heritability ranging between 29 and 34%. Differences between demes accounted for a minor fraction of the total variation. In contrast to previous allozyme results from the same plant material, which suggest significant impacts of both neutral and selective processes, neither the deme-specific means nor the heritabilities for the phenotypic characters were consistently associated with landscape structure or land-use history. The results of the study indicate that the structuring of quantitative variation has been relatively insensitive to habitat fragmentation, at least over the time frame considered in this study system. 3aBriza 3aallozymes 3agenetic variation 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aheritability 3ainflorescences 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aphenotypic variation 3aviability 0aLandscape structure 0aLocal adaptation1 aPrentice, Honor C. 1 aAndersson, Stefan 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2011 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.509-523dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9417-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02280naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245007100196300001800267500001500285520104800300650002001348650001901368650002301387650001901410650001001429650001001439650002601449650001501475650001801490650001101508650002601519650000901545650001401554650001801568653002301586700001501609700001501624773007901639852000901718930003301727945002501760946001301785655001201798IND4376999120221123040538.0060105e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study determined the bioavailability of theβ-carotene stereoisomers in rats that were vitamin A depleted and fed with either Dunaliella β-carotene powder or synthetic all-trans β-carotene, both at 1 g/kg diet. Weight gain and tissue weights of rats in all groups were not different. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis for the distribution of vitamin A and carotenes in tissues and plasma showed that the original algal stereoisomers ratio of .92 was reduced in the liver and spleen to .78 and .56, respectively. The 15-cis-to-all-trans ratio in synthetic β-carotene of .05 was increased in the liver and spleen to .54 and .21, respectively. The selective distribution of β-carotene stereoisomers in rat tissues was directed to the spleen, an organ involved in immune response. 3anutrient intake 3apowdered foods 3asynthetic products 3aplant pigments 3aliver 3aalgae 3anutrient availability 3aDunaliella 3abeta-carotene 3aspleen 3anutrient partitioning 3arats 3avitamin A 3astereoisomers 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aVolkis, B.1 aMokady, S.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Nov., v. 25, no. 11 p.1005-1012x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle03034naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245011700154300001800271500002300289520156100312650001701873650001301890650002601903650001101929650001901940650001901959650002201978650001202000650001102012650001702023650002202040650001702062650002002079650002102099651001202120653001602132653001202148653001402160700001802174700001702192700001902209700002002228700001802248773009702266852000902363856007502372930003302447945001302480946001102493655001202504IND2331673620221123040600.0030328e200208  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233167362DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaberg, P.G.10aEffects of chronic N fertilization on foliar membranes, cold tolerance, and carbon storage in montane red spruce  ap. 1351-1359.  aSummary in French.  aWe evaluated the influence of protracted low-level nitrogen (N) fertilization on foliar membrane-associated calcium (mCa), sugar and starch concentrations, membrane stability, winter cold tolerance, and freezing injury of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees growing in six experimental plots on Mount Ascutney, Vermont. For 12 consecutive years before this evaluation, each plot received one of three treatments: 0, 15.7, or 31.4 kg N(.)ha-1(.)year-1 supplied as NH4Cl. In comparison with trees from control plots, the current-year foliage of trees from N-addition plots had lower mCa concentrations, higher levels of electrolyte leakage, reduced cold tolerance, and greater freezing injury. Levels of mCa, membrane stability, and cold tolerance did not differ between N treatments, but trees in high-N treated plots experienced greater freezing injury. Although no differences in carbohydrate nutrition were detected in September, foliar sugar and starch concentrations from trees in N-treated plots were higher than control plot trees in January. We propose that foliar mCa deficiencies reduced cell membrane stability, decreased cold tolerance, and increased freezing injury for trees in N addition plots relative to controls. Declines in mCa may also help account for increases in respiration previously measured. Because soil, root, and mycorryhizal conditions were not evaluated, it is unknown how treatment-induced changes in these compartments may have influenced the alterations in foliar mCa and physiological parameters measured in this study. 3aPicea rubens 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aleaves 3acell membranes 3acold tolerance 3anutrient reserves 3acalcium 3asugars 3afrost injury 3aammonium chloride 3aelectrolytes 3aplant nutrition 3aapplication rate 3aVermont 0arespiration 0aleakage 0amembranes1 aDeHayes, D.H.1 aHawley, G.J.1 aMurakami, P.F.1 aStrimbeck, G.R.1 aMcnulty, S.G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1351-1359x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0593Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02133naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245011200194300001800306520069600324650001401020650003001034650001001064650001301074650001801087650002701105650001801132650002201150650001401172650002001186650000901206650001801215650004301233650002901276650002001305650002201325650001801347650001601365650001001381700001701391700001701408700001901425773007901444852000901523930003301532945002501565946001301590655001201603IND4376999620221123040520.0060105e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Diabetic rats lost weight but body weights were improved by feeding spent turmeric than fenugreek seed mucilage. In diabetic rats, a 30% improvement in urine sugar and urine volume profiles was observed with feeding fenugreek seed mucilage and spent turmeric. Fasting blood glucose showed a 26% and 18% improvement with fenugreek seed mucilage and spent turmeric feeding to diabetic rats, respectively. Fenugreek seed mucilage compared with tumeric was more effective in ameliorating diabetic state. 3afenugreek 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aseeds 3aturmeric 3aCurcuma longa 3afood processing wastes 3aseed extracts 3awaste utilization 3amucilages 3aglycemic effect 3arats 3aanimal models 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutritional intervention 3anutrient intake 3aglucose tolerance 3ablood glucose 3aweight loss 3aurine1 aShetty, A.K.1 aSambaiah, K.1 aSalimath, P.V.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Nov., v. 25, no. 11 p.1021-1028x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245009600151300001800247500002300265520178000288650001602068650002502084650001902109650001402128650001202142650002202154650002302176651001102199653001902210653002202229653001102251700001402262773009802276852000902374856007502383930003302458945001302491946001102504655001202515IND2331615020221123023528.0030326e200111  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233161502DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranhus, A.10aSpatial distribution of injuries to Norway spruce advance growth after selection harvesting  ap. 1903-1913.  aSummary in French.  aInjuries and mortality to advance growth (saplings) after selection harvesting was studied in 17 multistoried Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands. Harvest removals ranged from 33 to 67% of initial basal area. Four of the stands were harvested with a motor-manual method (chain saw and skidding with farm tractors; M-FT). The remaining stands were harvested with single-grip harvesters and forwarders (H-FW). In each stand, injury rates were evaluated on a 24 x 48 m plot, located between the centre lines of two parallel strip roads that were spaced 24 m apart. All logging teams had at least 5 years of experience in clear-cutting and thinning operations. The trees to be removed and the strip road centre lines were marked prior to harvest. Mortality varied from 5 to 51%, whereas total injury (injured + dead saplings) varied from 17 to 76%. Mortality and injury levels were generally highest on H-FW plots. Crown reduction and leaning stems were the most frequent types of injury, regardless of operating method. Injury rates increased with sapling height with the H-FW method, whereas the opposite was found on M-FT plots. Saplings without preharvest damage in the form of top or leader defects had a higher probability of being injured than saplings with such damage in stands harvested with the M-FT method. A similar difference was not found on H-FW plots. A logistic regression model shows that the spatial risk of injury depends on the interaction between forest condition factors and operational characteristics. Forest condition factors influencing the risk of injury are sapling height and the location of saplings relative to larger residual trees and strip roads. Corresponding operational characteristics are operating method and harvest intensity. 3aPicea abies 3aspatial distribution 3aabiotic stress 3amortality 3alogging 3amechanical damage 3aforestry equipment 3aNorway 0aadvance growth 0aselective felling 0agrowth1 aFjeld, D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 Nov., v. 31, no. 11 p.1903-1913x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-1033Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009900175300001400274500002400288520157800312650002601890650002201916650001201938650001501950650001901965650001301984650001601997650002202013650001802035650000902053650002202062650001202084700002502096773010302121852000902224856005502233655001202288IND4447984220221123023608.0110125e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444798422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00670.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiederman, Lori A.10aUsing Mounds to Create Microtopography Alters Plant Community Development Early in Restoration  ap. 53-61.  aIncludes references  aOne potential means of promoting diversity in restoration is to use microtopographic features to increase habitat heterogeneity and concentrate resources. In this study, small mounds of sand or topsoil mix were constructed. We hypothesized that these features would improve the establishment and survival of seeded prairie plants. After the first growing season both seeded and total (seeded plus unseeded) plant density/m² were greater on the mound features than other areas, although, in subsequent years, these differences were erased or reversed. Grass (seeded plus unseeded) density/m², however, was always larger on the mounded features. Position within the mound also affected plant community development; the base, followed by the top, improved both seeded and total plant density. Mound aspect also interacted with year; the lee and windward sides had similar seeded species richness in the first and third field seasons, but during the second year the lee side had higher seeded species richness and seeded plant density. Grasses (seeded plus unseeded) were also denser on the lee side of the mound in the second year. Finally, the material of the mound created differences in the community response. Sand mounds supported a greater proportion of seeded to total plant density compared with the topsoil mounds. There was also a larger proportion of grasses to total plant density on the sand mounds. This topographic heterogeneity plays an important role in improving the development of both temporal and spatial vegetation variability in grassland restoration. 3acommunity development 3aearly development 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3amicrorelief 3aplant communities 3aplant density 3asand 3aspecies diversity 3atopsoil1 aWhisenant, Steven G.0 tRestoration ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 19, no. 101 p.53-61dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00670.x 7aarticle02746naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245014100151300001800292500002300310500001500333520142700348650001201775650002201787650001701809650002101826650001101847650001301858650002501871650001401896650001901910650002101929650002001950650001501970650001201985651002101997653001602018700001502034773009802049852000902147856007502156930003302231945001302264946001102277655001202288IND2332213920221122060935.0030425e200211  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233221392DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntos, J.A.10aDynamics of an old-growth, fire-initiated, subalpine forest in southern interior British Columbia: tree size, age, and spatial structure  ap. 1935-1946.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe used dendrochronological analysis of over 2000 trees in four 50 x 50 m plots to reconstruct the history and dynamics of a 330-year-old, fire-initiated spruce-fir forest. All lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), half of the canopy Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), but less than 10% of the canopy subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) dated from the first 50 years of stand development. Tree-ring patterns of individual surviving trees showed no evidence of disturbance during the first 200 years after stand initiation; subsequently, episodes of disturbance are indicated by periods of release in understory fir. Although many fir owe their canopy position to release after disturbance, few canopy fir in the current stand established in response to either the stand-initiating event or subsequent partial disturbances. A seedling bank of long-lived fir appears critical to the dynamics of this forest. In contrast, establishment of almost all canopy spruce can be related to disturbance. This stand, although fire initiated, was structured primarily by a combination of partial disturbances and autogenic processes. We suspect that most old, fire-initiated stands in many forest regions are similarly structured and emphasize that the contribution of partial disturbances and autogenic processes should be fully assessed when examining their dynamics or managing such forests. 3ahistory 3aPicea engelmannii 3agrowth rings 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3acanopy 3atree age 3aspatial distribution 3aseedlings 3aPinus contorta 3adendrochronology 3astand structure 3aunderstory 3aforests 3aBritish Columbia 0arecruitment1 aParish, R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Nov., v. 32, no. 11 p.1935-1946x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-1163Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02525naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245010900151300001800260500002300278500001500301520118600316650001701502650002301519650002401542650001601566650001801582650001301600650001601613650002201629650001701651650002001668650001001688651001301698653002301711653002601734700001601760700002301776700001701799773009801816852000901914856007501923930003301998945001302031946001102044655001202055IND2332214320221122060947.0030425e200211  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233221432DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, T.H.10aGenetic resistance of Eucalyptus globulus to autumn gum moth defoliation and the role of cuticular waxes  ap. 1961-1969.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThis study investigated the association between resistance of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. to autumn gum moth (Mnesempala privata Guenee) defoliation and cuticular wax compounds. In a field trial consisting of clonally replicated F2 families of E. globulus, situated in Tasmania, Australia, significant genetic variation in resistance was detected in two of three F2 families. The broad-sense heritability for defoliation within families ranged from 0.24 to 0.33. The 15 most resistant and the 15 most susceptible genotypes within each variable family were compared for their relative levels of 26 cuticular wax compounds. While no significant correlation between resistance and total wax yield estimates was found, significant differences were detected between resistant and susceptible classes in the relative quantities of several aliphatic phenylethyl and benzyl wax esters within both families. This association does not appear to be a response induced by defoliation. The broad-sense heritabilities of the variation in these compounds were high (0.82-0.94). Our findings suggest that these wax compounds are a mechanism of genetic resistance to autumn gum moth in E. globulus. 3ainsect pests 3agenetic resistance 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aGeometridae 3aplant cuticle 3agenotype 3adefoliation 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3apest resistance 3awaxes 3aTasmania 0amnesemapal privata 0abiological resistance1 aPotts, B.M.1 aVaillancourt, R.E.1 aDavies, N.W.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Nov., v. 32, no. 11 p.1961-1969x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-1183Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245010800175300001600283520133800299650002001637650001701657650001701674650001601691650001301707650001401720650001901734650001201753650001801765650001501783650002701798650001701825650001601842650002101858650002801879650002901907700001101936700001201947700001901959700001401978773007701992852000902069930003302078945002502111946001302136655001202149IND4377158620221122061006.0060111e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437715862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Forty New Zealand White rabbits were divided into 5 groups and fed commercial rabbit chow with 0% oil (control), 2% corn oil, 2% fish oil, 2% oxidized oil, or 2% heated corn oil. Cholesterol (CHO, 1.5-g/kg diet) was added to all the experimental diets. The rabbits in the control and oxidized oil groups developed the highest scores for atherosclerotic lesions but those fed fish oil, corn oil, and the heated corn oil groups had the lowest lesion scores. Plasma triacylglycerol, total CHO, and low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein CHO levels (P < .05) in rabbits followed the trend of higher levels consistent with scores for atherosclerotic lesions. Plasma total CHO level was one factor closely related to the development of atherogenic lesions in the rabbit. Dietary CHO and oxidation status of dietary lipids significantly impacted lipid metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis in rabbits. Oxidized dietary oil accelerated the progress of atherosclerotic lesions, but polymerization of oils by heating lowered plasma CHO level and the development of atherogenic lesions in rabbits. Heating of oil appeared to reduce the absorption of CHO in the rabbit. 3aatherosclerosis 3arisk factors 3apathogenesis 3adietary fat 3acorn oil 3afish oils 3apolymerization 3arabbits 3aanimal models 3afat intake 3acholesterol metabolism 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3atriacylglycerols 3alow density lipoprotein 3ahigh density lipoprotein1 aDu, M.1 aNam, K.1 aWilliamson, M.1 aAhn, D.U.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.925-935x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060127b20060202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245005700207300001800264520111500282653002701397653002001424653002101444653002201465700002001487773014201507852000901649856008501658946001101743655001201754IND4442902420221122061012.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444290242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11517-010-0632-z2doi7 aPMC33738922pmcid7 a204909382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Tongcheng 10aMicro/nano-fabrication technologies for cell biology  ap. 1023-1032.  aMicro/nano-fabrication techniques, such as soft lithography and electrospinning, have been well-developed and widely applied in many research fields in the past decade. Due to the low costs and simple procedures, these techniques have become important and popular for biological studies. In this review, we focus on the studies integrating micro/nano-fabrication work to elucidate the molecular mechanism of signaling transduction in cell biology. We first describe different micro/nano-fabrication technologies, including techniques generating three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering. We then introduce the application of these technologies in manipulating the physical or chemical micro/nano-environment to regulate the cellular behavior and response, such as cell life and death, differentiation, proliferation, and cell migration. Recent advancement in integrating the micro/nano-technologies and live cell imaging are also discussed. Finally, potential schemes in cell biology involving micro/nano-fabrication technologies are proposed to provide perspectives on the future research activities. 0aMicro/nano-fabrication 0aSurface pattern 0aSoft lithography 0aLive cell imaging1 aWang, Yingxiao 0 tMedical & biological engineering & computing.g2010 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.1023-1032dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0140-01187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-010-0632-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02344naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245007700150300001800227500002300245500001500268520098900283650002301272650002201295650001101317650001301328650002501341650001101366650001801377650001601395650002101411650001401432650001001446651001301456651001901469653002601488653001001514653001501524653001101539653001301550700001901563700001801582773009701600852000901697856007501706930003301781945001301814946001101827655001201838IND2331674720221122061053.0030328e200208  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233167472DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, M.10aSpacing rectangularity effect on the growth of loblolly pine plantations  ap. 1451-1459.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of spacing rectangularity on tree growth and stand development was evaluated using tree data obtained annually from a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) spacing trial monitored through age 16 years. In this trial, plots with an initial planting density of 2240 trees/ha occur at slightly and highly rectangular spacings. Spacings with rectangularities 3:4 and 1:3 were used to evaluate the rectangularity effect. Survival and the development of height, diameter, volume per hectare, and basal area per hectare of loblolly pine trees were not affected by rectangularity. Diameter and height distributions were found to be a function of age but not a function of the rectangularity of initial spacing. Crown width, however, was affected by rectangularity. The crown width was larger at larger row or column distance than at smaller row or column distance, but the ratio of crown widths between and within rows was not equal to the rectangularity of the original planting spacing. 3aforest plantations 3aplant development 3avolume 3atree age 3aspatial distribution 3aheight 3astand density 3aPinus taeda 3astand basal area 3amortality 3awidth 3aVirginia 3aNorth Carolina 0aplant characteristics 0acrown 0abasal area 0agrowth 0apatterns1 aBurkhart, H.E.1 aAmateis, R.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1451-1459x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0793Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03003naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245013100175300001600306520147700322650000901799650001801808650002101826650001801847650001201865650003201877650001401909650001301923650002301936650001701959650002501976650001802001650001702019650001602036650001202052650001602064650003102080650001602111650001502127650002002142653004202162700001302204700001502217700001702232700001702249700001502266773007602281852000902357930003302366945002502399946001302424655001202437IND4375334820221122060938.0051020e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437533482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNolan, B.10aHigh vitamin E and selenium elevate, whereas diphenyl-para-phenylenediamine plus caffeine lowers liver fat in alcohol-fed rats  ap. 701-709.  aWe have previously produced a robust model of ethanol addiction in rats using a high-fat, alcohol-containing diet. Substitution of carbohydrate for fat in this diet greatly ameliorated the deleterious effect of alcohol, particularly the accompanying fatty liver. In the present study, we examined the role of certain antioxidants when added to the addictive, high-fat, alcohol-containing diet. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, diphenyl-para-phenylenediamine, and selenium, as well as cranberry powder and soy protein have been shown to prevent oxidative stress that can lead to cell death. The liver is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of excessive fat accumulation subsequent to insults such as high-fat diets and/or alcohol abuse. Because caffeine has been shown to reduce body fat accumulation in mice, this drug was also included in some experiments, either combined with or separate from antioxidant-enriched diets. It was observed that high doses of vitamin E and of selenium significantly increased liver fat accumulation in rats fed the alcohol-containing diet. Diphenyl-para-phenylenediamine combined with caffeine significantly reduced liver fat accumulation. Neither soy protein nor cranberry powder exerted significant effects on the alcohol-induced fatty liver. These observations indicate that high doses of vitamin E and selenium may be deleterious to liver function especially in the presence of high-fat diets and/or alcohol consumption. 3arats 3aanimal models 3aoxidative stress 3aalcohol abuse 3aethanol 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3avitamin E 3aselenium 3aexperimental diets 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3acaffeic acid 3acranberries 3apowders 3asoy protein 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3afatty liver 3ainfarction 3aliver cirrhosis 0adiphenyl-para-phenylenediamine (DPPD)1 aHess, M.1 aHowell, A.1 aMartin, J.V.1 aWagner, G.C.1 aFisher, H.0 tNutrition research.g2005 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.701-709x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02803naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245017400163300001600337500001500353520154200368650001901910650001101929650001801940650002601958650001701984650002402001650001102025650002202036650001802058650001702076650000902093650002102102650001602123653002902139700001602168700001702184773007602201852000902277930003302286945002502319946001302344655001202357IND4375332920221122061026.0051020e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437533292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We used the spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rat strain, a genetic model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the Long-Evans rat strain that does not develop heart disease genetically. Rats from both strains were fed either a control diet with adequate levels of copper (6.7 mg Cu/kg diet) or marginal in copper (2.8 mg Cu/kg diet) for 3, 6, or 10 months. At each time point, electrocardiographic measures were obtained from leads I and aVF, and hearts were processed for histological evaluation by transmission electron microscopy. There were no differences between strain or treatment in terms of mitochondrial or myofibrillar volume density. However, MC rats, regardless of strain and age, had increased lipid droplets in the myocardium. There were strain differences in electrocardiograms with SHHF rats, demonstrating abnormalities in traces, but they were not made any worse by MC intake. However, overall, the rats fed MC, regardless of strain, did demonstrate increased R-wave amplitude and duration in the QRS complex and some changes in P and T waves, which have been reported for severe copper deficiency. We conclude that MC intake over a protracted period is deleterious to cardiac health but that the genetic susceptibility of the heart to other forms of cardiac disease does not hasten or worsen the copper effect. 3acardiomyopathy 3acopper 3aheart failure 3anutrient deficiencies 3ahypertension 3aelectrocardiography 3alipids 3agenetic disorders 3aanimal models 3amitochondria 3arats 3adietary minerals 3ahypertrophy 0acongestive heart failure1 aShiry, L.J.1 aMcCune, S.A.0 tNutrition research.g2005 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.663-672x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02394naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245008100132300001600213500001500229520115900244650002501403650001601428650001601444650002001460650001601480650002101496650001601517650001101533650001201544650002101556650000901577653002001586700002601606700002501632700002401657700002301681700002001704773007601724852000901800856010501809939003301914946001301947655001201960IND4479218020221122050237.0140328e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447921802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilani, G.

Fat or protein type had a significant (P < 0.05) influence on serum triacylglycerols; protein type had a significant effect on serum total cholesterol; while fat level had no effect on these parameters. In general, the concentrations of serum triacylglycerols and total cholesterol were higher (P < 0.05) in rats fed casein diets compared to those fed gelatin diets. A pronounced effect of source of protein and fat was also observed on de novo fat synthesis and cholesterol kinetics. De novo fat synthesis was highest in animals fed gelatin-soybean oil diets. De novo cholesterol synthesis followed the same patterns observed for fat synthesis. Since overall serum cholesterol levels were lower in rats fed gelatin-soybean oil diets, cholesterol clearance rates must have been higher to compensate for the increased synthesis observed in rats fed these diets. 3alimiting amino acids 3ablood serum 3acoconut oil 3aprotein sources 3asoybean oil 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3acasein 3agelatin 3alipid metabolism 3arats 0adietary protein1 aRatnayake, W.M.

Mean energy and protein intakes for all strata were adequate. Mean intakes of micronutrients were low in comparison to reference standards. Mean energy distribution was 65% carbohydrate, 12% protein and 22% fat for the rural, farm, informal settlement and middle class urban strata and 57%, 13% and 31% for the upper class urban strata. Intakes of the staple, maize meal, decreased between the urban middle and upper class strata. Fruit and vegetable consumption was low throughout the sample.

BSP) forests established during the 19th century (1870) to that of young dominant black spruce seedlings newly regenerated following a 1983 fire on the same sites. The pattern was reconstructed by measuring the distance between terminal bud scars on young seedlings, and by precise counting of growth rings by cross-dating from the collar, which was identified by anatomical features, for mature trees. New seedlings growth was significantly higher than that of mature trees. Seedlings were almost twice as high as mature trees after 12 years of juvenile growth. Assuming that mature trees were dominant during their juvenile growth phase, we put forward the hypothesis that juvenile height growth of mature trees would have been affected by the combined action of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem)) and colder climatic conditions than those presently observed. Also, young seedlings juvenile height growth may have been favored by nitrogen soil enrichment along with more favourable climatic conditions. 3agrowth rings 3atree age 3aPicea mariana 3aseedlings 3anitrogen 3adendrochronology 3aheight 3asoil fertility 3aforest fires 3aclimatic factors 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aQuebec 0aplant characteristics 0agrowth 0apatterns1 aMorin, H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1478-1490wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0533Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02717naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245011600175300001600291520133800307650002001645650001701665650002001682650001501702650001501717650001701732650001601749650001501765650001601780650000801796650001701804650002101821650002901842650001701871650002801888650001501916700001701931700001401948700001301962700001401975700001201989700001402001700001502015773007702030852000902107930003302116945002502149946001302174655001202187IND4376106920221122050057.0051117e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437610692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Smokers had significantly greater plasma triglyceride level (P = .016) and significantly lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .004) than did nonsmokers. The mIMT and plasma homocysteine level of the smokers were significantly greater than those of the nonsmokers (P = .001 and P = .044, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the plasma folic acid concentration was a significant contributor to the plasma homocysteine level in the smoker group (P = .018), and age was a significant contributor to the plasma homocysteine level in the nonsmoker group (P = .024). Age is a significant contributor to the mIMT in both groups (P = .001), and plasma homocysteine level contributed significantly to the mIMT in the smoker group (P = .001). These data suggest that low plasma folic acid status contributed to the high-normal homocysteinemia found in smoker subjects, and this might partially explain the increased mIMT observed in the smoker group. 3aatherosclerosis 3arisk factors 3asmoking (habit) 3acigarettes 3abiomarkers 3ahomocysteine 3ablood serum 3afolic acid 3avitamin B12 3amen 3ablood lipids 3atriacylglycerols 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3apathogenesis 3alow density lipoprotein 3apyridoxine1 aChiang, T.H.1 aKuo, C.L.1 aOu, C.C.1 aLii, C.K.1 aI, S.H.1 aWei, Y.H.1 aChen, H.W.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.835-845x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/28  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245006000151300001800211500002300229520119300252650001601445650001701461650001301478650001701491650002301508650001401531650001301545650001401558651001201572653001101584653002301595653002001618700001801638700001801656700002101674773009701695852000901792856007501801930003301876945001301909946001101922655001201933IND2331674020221122040750.0030328e200208  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233167402DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwaze, D.P.10aOptimum selection age for wood density in loblolly pine  ap. 1393-1399.  aSummary in French.  aGenetic and phenotypic parameters for core wood density of Pinus taeda L. were estimated for ages ranging from 5 to 25 years at two sites in southern United States. Heritability estimates on an individual-tree basis for core density were lower than expected (0.20-0.31). Age-age genetic correlations were higher than phenotypic correlations, particularly those involving young ages. Age-age genetic correlations were high, being greater than 0.75. Age-age genetic correlations had a moderately linear relationship, while age-age phenotypic correlations had a strong linear relationship with natural logarithm of age ratio. Optimum selection age for core density was estimated to be 5 years when calculations were based on both genetic and phenotypic correlations. However, age 5 was the youngest examined in this study and optimum selection age may be younger than 5. Generally, the optimum selection age was robust to changes in breeding phase and assumptions concerning age-related variation in heritability estimates. Early selection for core density would result in a correlated increase in earlywood density but little progress in latewood density or latewood proportion at maturity. 3aPinus taeda 3awood density 3atree age 3aheritability 3aselection criteria 3aearlywood 3alatewood 3aphenotype 3aGeorgia 0aratios 0agenetic parameters 0aage differences1 aHarding, K.J.1 aPurnell, R.C.1 aBridgwater, F.E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1393-1399x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0643Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02323naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245015100156300001600307520127600323650001301599650001201612650002301624650001301647650002701660650001101687650001401698651001701712700001501729773008201744852000901826856007901835930003301914945001301947946001301960655001201973IND2040992520221122040655.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204099252DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.4312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvin, D.D.10aVariability in postdiapause development periods of geographically separate Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) populations in Pennsylvania  ap. 431-436.  aPostdiapause developmental periods of overwintering European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), larvae collected at five geographically separate locations in Pennsylvania (Bradford, Centre, Lancaster, Lycoming, and Mercer counties) were compared. Larvae were reared under constant 25 degrees C and 16-h light conditions in growth chambers after collection, and the days for each individual larva to complete the larval stage were recorded. Degree-days (DD) from 1 January to pupation were calculated. The Mercer and Lancaster populations completed the postdiapause developmental period within 450 DD; whereas the Centre and Lycoming populations required 650 DD, and the Bradford population required more than 900 DD. Although the termination day of a population's pupation period varied greatly between geographic locations, the degree-days for initiation of spring pupation among populations were very similar. The study results suggested that a mixture of univoltine and bivoltine individuals coexist in Centre, Lycoming, and Bradford counties, leading to a prolonged postdiapause developmental period and continual emergence over the growing season. The data also suggested that postdiapause developmental periods may be correlated with length of growing season. 3aZea mays 3astubble 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3adiapause 3abiological development 3alarvae 3aheat sums 3aPennsylvania1 aSong, P.Z.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.431-436x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.4313Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001400225520173100239650001301970650001201983650001001995650001002005650002702015650001702042650002002059650001802079650001802097650001402115650001802129650001302147650001102160650001702171650001602188700001502204700002802219700001502247700002002262773007202282852000902354856010502363939003302468946001302501655001202514IND4479222920221122031943.0140328e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447922292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuigoz, Y.10aEffects of oligosaccharide on the faecal flora and non-specific immune system in elderly people  ap. 13-25.  aAims: The primary objectives was to confirm the bifidogenic effects of fructooligosaccharides in elderly subjects (increase equal or higher than 1 log endogenous bifidobacteria per gram of faeces), and to make an exploratory investigation on non-specific immune defense parameters, such as phagocytosis and changes in lymphocyte subpopulations, in relation to the increase in endogenous bifidobacteria. Methods: The study was a pretest/posttest study of 19 elderly nursing home patients, with one period of 3 weeks of 8 g fructooligosaccharides (FOS) given in portions of 4 g, twice a day. Faecal bacteria composition was investigated using viable counts, lymphocyte subpopulation was analysed using a FACS scan, and relative expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by measuring levels of IL-6 mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes. Results: Bacterial counts for bifidobacteria increased by a mean of 2.8 ± 0.57 log10CFU/g faeces after 3 weeks of supplementation, and decreased by a mean of 1.1 log10CFU/g faeces after the period without FOS (post-test). Unexpected changes in non-specific immunity were observed: decreased phagocytic activity of granulocytes and monocytes, as well as a decreased expression of interleukin-6 mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes. These results suggest a possible decrease in inflammatory process in elderly subjects after FOS supplementation. Conclusion: The results confirm the bifidogenic effect of FOS with a 2 log increase in bifidobacteria counts and the frail elderly subjects showed low counts at the beginning of study. A diminution in inflammatory process is suggested by the decreased expression of IL-6 mRNA in peripheral blood monocytes. These results need confirmation in further studies. 3abacteria 3aelderly 3afeces 3aflora 3afructooligosaccharides 3agranulocytes 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amonocytes 3anursing homes 3apatients 3apeople 3aphagocytosis 3aplate count1 aRochat, F.1 aPerruisseau-Carrier, G.1 aRochat, I.1 aSchiffrin, E.J.0 tNutrition research.g2002 , v. 22, no. 1-2 p.13-25x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0081-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140328  aOther US 7aarticle02757naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245009800132300001400230520148000244650001701724650001301741650002801754650002901782650001101811650002001822650002301842650002301865650001201888650002401900650002801924700002601952700002301978700002202001700003102023700002802054700002102082773007202103852000902175856010502184939003302289946001302322655001202335IND4479223120221122031927.0140328e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447922312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdés-Ramos, R.10aAssociation of anthropometric birth measurements and blood pressure in the first year of life  ap. 39-44.  aIn order to identify associations between anthropometric condition at birth and blood pressure in the first year of life, we designed a cross-sectional study, where systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured in 438 children who attended a pediatric follow-up clinic in one year. Measurements at birth were obtained from the clinical files at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologı́a. Anthropometric data at birth were analyzed as crude values and values adjusted for gestational age at birth, while blood pressure values were also analyzed in crude form or adjusted for gender and age at time of evaluation. Intrauterine Growth Retardation was present in 61% of the children; all indicators evaluated with the exception of crude diastolic blood pressure were significantly different between growth-retarded and normal infants. All the anthropometric measurements showed a significantly positive correlation with crude blood pressure values, while all correlations were significantly negative with gender and age adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Stepwise regression analysis showed predictive associations of % head circumference at birth for diastolic blood pressure; % birth weight for adjusted diastolic blood pressure; and % head circumference at birth and birth length for crude as well as for adjusted systolic blood pressure. It can be concluded that anthropometric condition at birth may affect blood pressure during the first year of life. 3abirth weight 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adiastolic blood pressure 3agender 3agestational age 3agrowth retardation 3ahead circumference 3ainfants 3aregression analysis 3asystolic blood pressure1 aVillarreal-López, L.1 aKaufer-Horwitz, M.1 aBarrera-Reyes, R.1 aFernández-Carrocera, L.A.1 aCaraveo-Enrı́quez, V.1 aÁvila-Rosas, H.0 tNutrition research.g2002 , v. 22, no. 1-2 p.39-44x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0081-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140328  aOther US 7aarticle01421naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008800133300001500221300002900236520057900265650001500844650000800859650001400867650002300881650002800904653002300932653001700955773007200972852000901044939003301053945000801086946001301094655001201107991610524250742620221122031906.0850904e198503  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850077482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitts, Renee.10aDevelopment of A DNA-DNA Hybridization Test For The Presence of Salmonella in Foods  ap. 95-102.  ap. 95-102. ill., charts.  aMethodology and results are reported for the use of DNA probe technology in a hybridization assay for the selective detection of Salmonella in foods.

The compromised cellular immunity that occurs in many otherwise healthy older people includes impaired interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and anergy to skin test antigens. The latter has been associated prospectively with increased mortality in the elderly. We studied dietary and blood concentrations of vitamins A, B6, C and E, folate, β carotene, and zinc and their relationship to delayed hypersensitivity skin test responses (DHST) and serum soluble IL-2 receptor concentrations (IL-2R) in 65 healthy independently-living men and women aged 69.8 +/- 7.2 years. Serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and copper and dietary lycopene were also measured. Excluded were subjects who had used vitamin or mineral supplements in the preceding 3 months, since supplementation may improve DHST responses. IL-2R concentrations were positively (p < 0.05) associated with serum concentrations of homocysteine, vitamin B6 and BMI, and negatively associated with serum β-carotene and dietary lycopene. In a multiple regression model, these 5 variables explained 52% of the variability in IL-2R. The percentage of subjects with anergy to a panel of 7 skin test antigens was 25%. DHST responses were negatively associated with T helper cell numbers and serum retinol, T helper cell numbers were positively associated with serum copper, and natural killer cell numbers were positively associated with dietary folate and vitamin B6. Serum homocysteine concentrations were negatively associated with plasma concentrations of folate, and vitamin B12, as well as positively with serum IL-2R. In a multiple regression model, these 3 concentrations explained 27% of the variability in serum homocysteine. The results suggest that IL-2 metabolism may be influenced by several dietary antioxidants and B vitamins including those that alter homocysteine concentrations. 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acell-mediated immunity 3acopper 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3aelderly 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3ainterleukin-2 3alycopene 3amen 3ametabolism 3amortality 3anatural killer cells 3anutritional status 3apyridoxine 3aregression analysis 3avitamin A 3avitamin B12 3awomen 3azinc1 aDeCandia, Joanne1 aLi, Wenjie1 aBruening, Kay1 aBaker, Herman1 aRigassio, Diane1 aBendich, Adrianne1 aBogden, John D.0 tNutrition research.g2002 , v. 22, no. 1-2 p.45-53x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0081-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140328  aOther US 7aarticle01846naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245012200157300001600279520079400295650002501089650002601114650001401140650002701154650001101181650001401192650001401206653003001220700001701250773008201267852000901349856007901358930003301437945001301470946001301483655001201496IND2040989920221122031949.0940722e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204098992DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.2.3742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegaspi, J.C.10aDevelopmental response of nymphs of Podisus maculiventris (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) reared with low numbers of prey  ap. 374-380.  aEffects of maternal diet, maternal age, and nymphal diet on developmental time and survivorship of nymphs of Podisus maculiventris (Say) were studied using Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis Mulsant as prey.

Nymphal survival was related to nymphal diet. Well-fed nymphs showed higher survivorship than poorly fed nymphs. Nymphs supplied prey at the lowest rates failed to reach adulthood and died, usually in the act of molting. Body sizes of adults from well-fed nymphs were larger than those from poorly fed nymphs.

Where burlap bands were not present as barriers to larval dispersal, the percentage of loblolly pine with gypsy moth egg masses present was significantly greater than expected if oviposition occurred randomly. The loblolly pine and oak components of the forests also had more total egg masses per tree compared with the other tree genera or species. However, when adjusted for tree size, egg mass density was generally similar among tree groups within an infestation. Tree size (dbh) was positively correlated with the number of egg masses present on a tree. Pupal predation, measured using freeze-dried pupae, was significantly higher over the 5-d sample period for (1) females versus males, (2) pupae placed at 0 m on the tree bole versus at 2 m, and (3) pupae placed on oak versus pine. The differential predation on oak versus pine appears to be the result of heavier vertebrate predation of the pupae placed on oak. The high rate of pupal removal, beginning the first night of exposure, from all locations suggests that predators will not have to learn to accept gypsy moth in their diets. The higher survival of pupae on pine is suggested to be one of the factors influencing the high egg-mass density on pine. Implications of these results for gypsy moth population dynamics in southern pine-hardwood forests are discussed. 3aPinus taeda 3aQuercus 3aSalix 3aLymantria dispar 3aoviposition 3apupae 3amortality 3apredation 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3aNorth Carolina 3aVirginia1 aHain, F.P.1 aSmith, H.R.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.360-366x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.2.3603Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218500015500234500001500389520117700404650001701581650001201598650000901610650002401619650001001643650002201653650001901675650001201694651001801706651002001724653001101744700001501755773014501770856005101915852000901966655001201975IND4491204720221122005813.0141110e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449120472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoro, A.10aElevated temperature increased stomata size and leaf photosynthesis in shiraz grapevine  ap. 443-447.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops - Greensys 2012, held July 16-20, 2012, Geisenheim Germany  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the effect of elevated temperature, and its interaction with water supply, on stomata size and leaf photosynthesis in shiraz grapevine in Barossa Valley (South Australia) The experiment combined two thermal regimes (control and elevated day/night temperature) and two water regimes (irrigated and water deficit). Temperature regimes were control with background ambient temperature, and elevated day/night temperature achieved with an open-top heating system that combines passive heating on clear days, active heating on overcast days and during the night, and mobile panels that regulate the release of excess heat as necessary. Stomata size was measured in using the technique of nail polish and sticky-tape imprints from the abaxial epidermis. Stomatal length and width were measured s with at a magnification of × 200. Li-Cor 6400 was used (Li-Cor Environmental Sciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) to measure photosynthetic rate. We found that elevated temperature increased stomata size and leaf photosynthesis in Shiraz grapevine. This response likely contributes to evaporative cooling and adaptation to elevated temperature. 3awater supply 3acooling 3aheat 3aambient temperature 3aVitis 3anight temperature 3aphotosynthesis 3astomata 3aUnited States 3aSouth Australia 0aleaves1 aSadras, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 June 20, , no. 1038 p.443-447dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1038/1038_54.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014800127300001600275500015500291520198800446650001902434650001802453650001202471650001102483650002602494650001102520650001002531650002102541650001202562650000902574650001502583650002502598650001002623650001802633650002002651650001702671650002002688700001802708700001402726700001702740700001602757700001402773700001802787700001602805700002802821773014502849856005102994852000903045655001203054IND4491204520221122005704.0141110e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449120452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosciale, P.10aRootstock and water restriction effects on leaf performance and fruit growth in pear, cv. 'Abbé Fetel', grafted on different quince rootstocks  ap. 429-435.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops - Greensys 2012, held July 16-20, 2012, Geisenheim Germany  aThe availability of high quality water resources is becoming increasingly limited, and has been identified as a global problem. Agriculture must learn to operate under water scarcity, where insufficient supply will be the norm rather than the exception, developing more efficient water management practices that enable production under a limited supply. Under water restriction stomatal limitation reduces leaf photosynthesis. To compensate for energy imbalance, alternative electron pathways become increasingly active. These pathways reduce the photodamage risk while consuming energy and CO2 (e.g., photorespiration). For tree crops one agronomic strategy to cope with drought is to use water stress tolerant rootstocks. The aim of this study was to evaluate three pear root stocks subjected to water restriction. Leaf performance and tree productivity were evaluated on 'Abbé Fetel' pears grafted on three different quince root stocks (Adams, MH and Sydo), fully watered or irrigated with 50% of the recommended dosage. During the end of fruit cell division stage, leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and the alternative electron transports were unaffected by water restriction. However, differences were recorded between the three root stocks. MH showed the highest values of leaf photosynthesis but was less stomatal limited. During the following stage of fruit cell expansion the interaction between root stocks and water treatment was significant. Water restriction was more effective in the Sydo rootstock, which reduced photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, increasing the activity of the alternative electron transports. This behavior was reflected in fruit productivity, which was reduced in Sydo under water stress. These results suggest the possibility to improve irrigation management in pear via a better understanding of plant behavior at leaf and fruit level during its vegetative season, in combination with the choice of the most appropriate rootstock. 3acarbon dioxide 3acell division 3adrought 3aenergy 3airrigation management 3aleaves 3apears 3aphotorespiration 3aquinces 3arisk 3arootstocks 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3awater quality 3awater resources 3awater stress 3awater treatment1 aAnconelli, S.1 aGalli, F.1 aManfrini, L.1 aMorandi, B.1 aNovak, B.1 aPierpaoli, E.1 aZibordi, M.1 aCorelli Grappadelli, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 June 20, , no. 1038 p.429-435dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1038/1038_52.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011400167300001600281520142700297650002401724650001901748650002201767650002401789650001201813650001901825650002701844650001401871650002601885653001301911653001301924700002301937773009801960852000902058856009202067930003302159945001302192946001102205655001202216IND2163628320221122005646.0980826e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216362832DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1997.00058.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuff, E.N.12aA survey of nutrition knowledge, practice, attitudes and behavior of general practitioner trainees in Ireland  ap. 219-228.  aBackground: Medical research has acknowledged the relationship between nutrition and the development of chronic diseases, as well as the interaction between disease and nutritional status. However, nutrition education in the medical curriculum has been far from adequate. The present study was undertaken to examine the current status of nutrition awareness amongst general practitioner trainees throughout Ireland. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire (Q1) was used to assess the nutrition knowledge, attitudes, practice and behaviour of one hundred final year general practitioner trainees. A second questionnaire (Q2) was sent to the relevant medical faculties to ascertain the level of nutrition taught within the medical curricula. Results: The overall response rate to Q1 was 52% (34 females, 18 males). Respondents showed little awareness that nutrition had been included in their medical training. Q2 verified that nutrition mostly featured in the biochemistry component of the medical curricula. The results indicate the need to improve basic nutritional knowledge and its application in clinical practice. The disparity between the perceived importance of nutrition and personal lifestyle behaviours concurred with other studies. Conclusion: The general practitioner trainees were ill equipped to appreciate and value the extent of dietetic intervention for nutrition-related problems in clinical practice. 3anutrition knowledge 3ahuman behavior 3amedical education 3anutrition education 3asurveys 3ahealth beliefs 3aattitudes and opinions 3alifestyle 3ageneral practitioners 0apractice 0atraining1 aLivingston, M.B.E.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1997 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.219-228x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1997.00058.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01284naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004500132300001600177300002400193520040800217650001900625650001100644650002100655650002300676650002100699650001800720653001200738700001300750700001900763700001500782773007400797852000900871939003300880945000800913946001300921655001200934991610518180742620221121131532.0870424e198611  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870007642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoyama, H.10aBioregulation of essential oils of lemon  ap. 111-113.  ap. 111-113. charts.  aA study of the effect of bioregulatory compounds on the synthesis of essential oils of lemons revealed that such compounds can increase the levels of aldehydes and alcohols in these essential oils.

African elephants have the distinctive life history traits of a 22 month gestation and extended offspring investment, necessitating a long-term strategy of energy acquisition and reproductive expenditure to ensure successful offspring recruitment. We investigated the relationship between the reproductive phenology of a wild elephant population and resource availability using remotely sensed Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) data as a measure of time-specific primary productivity and hence forage quality. The initiation of female elephants' 3+yr reproductive bout was dependent on conditions during the season of conception but timed so parturition occurred during the most likely periods of high primary productivity 22 months later. Thus, the probability of conception is linked to the stochastic variation in seasonal quality and the phenology of parturition is related to the predictable seasonality of primary productivity, indicating elephants integrate information on known current and expected future conditions when reproducing. Juvenile mortality was not correlated with ecological variability, hence female fecundity rather than calf mortality appears to drive demographic processes in the study population. Extreme climatic events, such as those associated with the El Niño-Southern-Oscillation (ENSO), acted to synchronize female fecundity in the population. This study suggests that the relationship between fecundity and ecological variability instigates the characteristic demographic fluctuations in elephant populations, rather than the mortality-driven fluctuations observed in many ungulate populations. 3alife history 3aprimary productivity 3aenergy 3aprobability 3asociodemographic characteristics 3afecundity 3aconception 3aparturition 3aphenology 3apregnancy 3avegetation 3aforage quality 3aseasonal variation 3aprogeny 3aremote sensing 3aLoxodonta africana 3acalves 3amortality 0arecruitment1 aBarner Rasmussen, Henrik1 aDouglas-Hamilton, Iain0 tEcography.g2007 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.42-50dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04900.x 7aarticle01473naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245007900134300001600213300002100229500016600250520051000416650001700926650001100943650002000954650001100974650001400985650002400999773007301023852000901096939003301105945000801138946001301146655001201159991610514950742620221121060452.0861216e198607  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860115672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalascio, J.R.10aFoodservice product development problems encountered by the food scientist  ap. 114-119.  ap. 114-119. ill.  aBased on a paper presented during the IFT Foodservice Division Program, 45th Annual Meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists, June 9-12, 1985, Atlanta, GA.  aThe food service product development process is explained, and problems encountered at each stage of this process are discussed.

But the neural basis of the VOR conjugacy remains to be identified. In the present study, we measured the VOR conjugacy during single labyrinth stimulation to examine whether the VOR conjugacy depends on reciprocal stimulation of the two labyrinths. There are conflicting views on this issue. First, since the vestibular signals carried by the ascending tract of Deiters' are distributed exclusively to the motoneurons of the ipsilateral eye, the neural innervations after single labyrinth stimulation are not symmetrical for the two eyes. Thus, single labyrinth stimulation may generate disjunctive VOR responses. Second, the only published study on this issue was an electrooculography (EOG) study that reported disjunctive VOR responses during unilateral caloric irrigation (Wolfe in Ann Otol 88:79-85, 1979). Third, the VOR during unilateral caloric stimulation performed in clinical vestibular tests is routinely perceived to be conjugate. To resolve these conflicting views, the present study examined the VOR conjugacy during single labyrinth stimulation by recording binocular eye position signals in awake monkeys with a search coil technique. In contradiction to the previous EOG study and the prediction based on the asymmetry of the unilateral brainstem VOR circuits, we found that the VOR during unilateral caloric irrigation was conjugate over a wide range of conditions. We conclude that the net neural innervations received by the two eyes are symmetrical after single labyrinth stimulation, despite the apparent asymmetry in the unilateral VOR pathways. A novel role for the ascending tract of Deiters' in the VOR conjugacy is proposed. 0aVOR pathway 0aConjugacy 0aSingle labyrinth stimulation 0aUnilateral caloric stimulation1 aXu, Youguo 1 aSimpson, Ivra 1 aJeffcoat, Ben 1 aMustain, William 1 aZhou, Wu 0 tExperimental brain research.g2010 Oct., v. 206, no. 3 p.249-255dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0014-48197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-010-2403-33Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03107naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001600195245012400211300001800335500001500353520150700368650002701875650001201902650002301914650001201937650004301949650002101992650001402013650001602027650001802043650002202061650002002083650001202103650001602115650000902131650002502140650002002165650001702185650002502202650001602227650001802243650001602261650001802277653002302295700002202318700001802340773007902358852000902437930003302446945002502479946001302504655001202517IND4377177120221121035018.0060112e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437717712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Finger millet (FM; Eleusine coracana) and kodo millet (KM; Paspalum scrobiculatum) are rich sources of phenolics, tannins, and phytates, which can act as antioxidants. Hence, the beneficial role of a millet-based diet in protecting against oxidative stress and maintaining glucose levels in vivo in type II diabetes was investigated. Whole grain flour of finger millet and KM was incorporated at 55% by weight in the basal diet fed to alloxan-induced diabetic rats over a period of 28 days. Blood glucose, cholesterol, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants, lipid peroxides in blood plasma, and glycation of tail tendon collagen were measured. The rats fed the KM-enriched diet showed a greater reduction in blood glucose (42%) and cholesterol (27%) than those fed the finger millet (36% and 13%). The levels of enzymatic (glutathione, vitamins E and C) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) and lipid peroxides were significantly reduced in diabetic animals and restored to normal levels in the millet-fed groups. Glycation of tail tendon collagen was only 40% in the finger millet-fed rats and 47% in the KM-fed rats compared to the controls. Diets containing whole grain millet meal flour can protect against hyperglycemic and alloxan-induced oxidative stress in Wistar rats. 3aPaspalum scrobiculatum 3amillets 3alipid peroxidation 3aalloxan 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3acultivars 3aphytic acid 3ablood glucose 3aEleusine coracana 3aglycemic effect 3atannins 3afood grains 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical composition 3afood intake 3afree radicals 3acholesterol 3aanimal models 0aphenolic compounds1 aRajasekaran, N.S.1 aChandra, T.S.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Dec., v. 25, no. 12 p.1109-1120x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20060207b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle02187naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245021200164300001600376520098300392653001301375653003301388653003201421653003001453653003101483700001801514700001501532700001401547700001601561700001801577773010401595852000901699856008501708939003301793946001101826655001201837IND4449509520221121035104.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444950952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00604-010-0499-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Huanshun 10aElectrochemical oxidation behavior of guanosine-5´-monophosphate on a glassy carbon electrode modified with a composite film of graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and its amperometric determination  ap. 343-349.  aThe electrochemical oxidation of guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP) was studied with a glassy carbon electrode modified with a composite made from graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. GMP undergoes an irreversible oxidation process at an oxidation peak potential of 987 mV in phosphate buffer solution. Compared to other electrodes, the oxidation peak current of GMP with this electrode was significantly increased, and the corresponding oxidation peak potential negatively shifted, thereby indicating that the modified material exhibited electrochemical catalytic activity towards GMP. Chronocoulometry demonstrates that the material also effectively increases the surface area of the electrode and increases the amount of GMP adsorbed. Under the optimum conditions, the oxidation current is proportional to the GMP concentration in the range from 0.1 to 59.7 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9991. The detection limit is 0.025 μM (at S/N = 3).

In this context, a specific cross-sectional study was carried out in a randomly selected subpopulation. Aim: To identify anthropometric, nutritional and biochemical correlates of spontaneous use of 'light' foods and drinks in a free-living population. Design: Men (n = 2299) and women (n = 1979), 45-60 years, reported their food intakes over six non-consecutive days. Consumers of low-fat and low-sugar foods and drinks, and artificial sweeteners, were compared with non-consumers. Results: Users of low-sugar products were heavier than non-users; female consumers of low-fat products, but not males, had higher body weight and BMI than non-consumers. Users of low-sugar products had higher triacylglycerols and glycaemia than non-users while biochemical parameters were not different in users and nonusers of low-fat products. Use of low-sugar products led to increased diet density of a few micronutrients, including cholesterol. Low-fat product selection was associated with increased intake of most micronutrients, both in absolute value and in density. Conclusions: In mature adults, selection of fat-reduced products was associated with improved quality of the diet, while anthropometric and biological parameters appeared less favourable in consumers of low-sugar products vs. non-consumers. The longitudinal follow-up of the cohort in future years will help determine cause-and-effect relationships among these parameters. 3amen 3awomen 3abeverages 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aanthropometric measurements 3aartificial sweeteners 3atriacylglycerols 3abody weight 3agender differences 3ablood glucose 3anutrient intake 3acholesterol 3alow fat foods 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Constitution 2aBody Weight 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSweetening Agentsxadministration & dosage 3aFrance 0aFrance 0alow calorie foods1 aAltenburg de Assis, M.A.1 aFieux, B.1 aPreziosi, P.1 aGalán, P.1 aGuy-Grand, B.1 aHercberg, S.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2001 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.191-206x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00289.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03831naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012000189300001600309520202300325650002002348650001002368650003602378650001702414650001502431650001702446650001602463650002102479650002002500650001502520650004302535650001802578650003402596650001502630650002002645650003002665650005702695650003002752650003202782650001102814650001102825650003202836650003702868651001702905651001702922653000902939700001802948700001902966773009802985852000903083856009203092930003303184945001303217946001103230655001203241IND2321847820221120234019.0010701e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232184782DNAL7 a113302602pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00280.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaradas, A.A.13aAn ethnic comparison of eating attitudes and associated body image concerns in adolescent South African schoolgirls  ap. 111-120.  aObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differences exist in eating attitudes and body shape concerns amongst adolescent schoolgirls representing South Africa's ethnically and culturally diverse population currently undergoing epidemiological transition. Method: A questionnaire survey, including the Eating Attitudes Test, Body Shape Questionnaire and a Body Silhouette Chart, was administered to 228 South African schoolgirls (60 black, 83 mixed race and 85 white) aged 15-18 years from five secondary schools in the greater Cape Town area. Results: Black girls had significantly higher mean BMI values (24.1 (3.3)) than either white (21.9 (3.0)) or mixed race girls (22.1 (3.7)) (P < 0.05). Controlling for differences in BMI, white subjects scored significantly higher on the Body Shape Questionnaire than did mixed race or black subjects, whereas no ethnic differences were found for Eating Attitude Test scores. A comparable percentage (mean = 18.8%) of black, mixed race and white girls had scores indicative of eating disorder pathology on the Eating Attitudes Test, while a higher percentage of white, compared to mixed race and black, girls had abnormal scores on the Body Shape Questionnaire (33%, 26% and 20%, respectively; P < 0.05). The ideal body size desired by white girls was significantly smaller than that of the mixed race or black samples. Dissatisfaction with present body size was significantly higher in white, compared to black or mixed race girls (P < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the prevalence of abnormal eating attitudes is equally common in South African schoolgirls from different ethnic backgrounds. White girls exhibit greater body image concerns and body image dissatisfaction than mixed race or black individuals. These findings reinforce the notion that eating disorders are culture-reactive rather than culture-bound phenomena and provide insight into the extent of eating-related problems and body image issues in developing societies. 3aschool children 3agirls 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3afood beliefs 3abody image 3aepidemiology 3abody weight 3aeating disorders 3aself-perception 2aAdolescent 2aBlack or African Americanxpsychology. 2aBlack People. 2aAttitude to Healthxethnology 2aBody Image 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Cultural Comparison 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxethnologyxpsychology. 2aWhite Peoplexpsychology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxethnology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aThinnessxethnologyxpsychology. 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0asize1 aLambert, E.V.1 aCharlton, K.E.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2001 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.111-120x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00280.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01396naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004200134300001300176520055200189650002300741650001500764650002400779650002400803650002300827653002200850653002400872653002600896700002100922773006400943852000901007939003301016945000801049946001301057655001201070991610508600742620221120213054.0850429e198412  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850070242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIams, Donna R.14aThe Public's view of energy education  ap. 5-10.  aCommon qualitative methods are identified for program evaluation, a comparison of qualitative and quantitative data with a 7-step process for gathering and analyzing qualitative evaluation data is described, and 2 applications of this process to Extension programs are discussed.

To test if these profiles can be ascribed to endogenous factors or to decreased availability of cations in the soil, radial profiles of water-soluble, exchangeable, and total cations and of cation exchange capacity (CEC) of wood were determined. In both species, greater than or equal to 75% of K is in the water-soluble form so is of little use for dendrochemical monitoring. About 80% of Mg is adsorbed on wood exchange sites. For Ca, 30 (beech) to 60% (oak) of total content cannot be extracted by SrCl2 and is, thus, relatively immobile in wood. Wood CEC decreases from pith to bark in European beech and from pith to outer heartwood in pedunculate oak. Decreasing profiles of exchangeable Ca and Mg in pedunculate oak and exchangeable Ca in European beech are strongly constrained by CEC and, thus, are not related to environmental change. Base cation saturation rate shows no consistent radial change in either species. European beech maintained much higher base cation saturation rate than pedunculate oak, although both species had similar CEC. In conclusion, the results do not provide convincing evidence for a significant change in nutritional status of pedunculate oak and European beech in the Belgian Ardennes due to atmospheric pollution. 3amanganese 3achemical composition 3ainterspecific variation 3abase saturation 3anutritional status 3acation exchange capacity 3awood 3acalcium 3acations 3aheartwood 3amagnesium 3aQuercus robur 3apotassium 3aaluminum 3aspatial variation 3abark 3aFagus sylvatica 3aBelgium 0aspecies differences1 aPenninckx, V.1 aGruber, W.1 aMeerts, P.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2002 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1829-1837wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0973Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02927naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100005900152245009000211300001300301500001500314520152200329650002001851650002101871650001001892650001801902650001601920650002301936650001201959650001801971650001401989650001302003650002002016653001602036653001302052653002102065653001702086653001702103653001502120700001702135700001602152700001202168773009502180852000902275856009202284930003302376945001302409946001102422655001202433IND2180429320221120192441.0981013e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218042932DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.1998.00075.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolner, J.T.

However, patients often find the strict regimen difficult to follow resulting in poor compliance. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an alternative method of food re-introduction, a low-fibre, fat-limited exclusion diet or 'LOFFLEX' diet. Methods: Patients achieving remission on an elemental or peptide feed or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) chose to follow either an elimination or LOFFLEX diet. Their progress was assessed regularly and life-analysis tables used to calculate remission rates for the two groups at the end of a 2-year period. Results: In a series of 76 treatment episodes (74 patients having achieved remission on an enteral feed, two on TPN), 28 patients (37%) chose the elimination diet and 48 (63%) the LOFFLEX diet. Fourteen per cent failed to comply with the elimination diet and 8% failed to comply with the LOFFLEX diet. Eleven per cent of the elimination group and 12.5% of the LOFFLEX group relapsed immediately and were all found to have tight strictures. At 24 months, the proportion of compliant, non-strictured patients still in remission was 59% for the elimination diet and 56% for the LOFFLEX diet. Conclusion: This study suggests that the LOFFLEX diet has a similar efficacy to the elimination diet whilst being more acceptable to the patient. A randomized, prospective controlled study is now underway to further investigate these findings. 3anutrient intake 3afood intolerance 3afoods 3adietary fiber 3adietary fat 3apatient compliance 3arelapse 3aCrohn disease 3aremission 3apatients 3aenteral feeding 0adevelopment 0asymptoms 0aelimination diet 0alofflex diet 0adiet therapy 0aevaluation1 aParker, T.J.1 aKirby, G.A.1 aIvy Jo.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1998 Feb., v. 11, no. 1 p.1-11x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.1998.00075.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03231naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245011200150300001800262500002300280500001500303520169000318650001102008650001602019650001002035650002102045650001302066650001802079650002602097650002002123650001502143650002102158650002202179650001802201650001302219650001702232650002002249650001402269650001102283651001902294651001402313653001602327653001102343653001602354700002102370700001902391700001602410773009802426852000902524856007502533930003302608945001302641946001102654655001202665IND2332368520221120180711.0030502e200210  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233236852DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, M.10aVariation in overstory nitrogen uptake in a small, high-elevation southern Appalachian spruce-fir watershed  ap. 1741-1752.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aHigh-elevation red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) - Fraser fir (Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.) forests of the southern Appalachians exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity in structure, and possibly in N uptake, because of a combination of natural disturbances and heavy fir mortality caused by infestations of the exotic balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae Ratz). The objectives of this study are to determine spatial variability in tree N uptake in a small high-elevation catchment in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, compare outcomes among calculation methods, and assess the influence of stand and landscape properties on N uptake. Tree N uptake is estimated for fifty 20 x 20 m plots in the Noland Divide Watershed (NDW). Components considered in the calculations are stem growth, foliage increment, and mortality of spruce, fir, and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) from 1993 and 1998 stand inventories; throughfall N flux measured in summers 1998 and 1999; litterfall N return for 1 year in a subset of 12 plots; tissue N analyses; and atmospheric N deposition and root turnover estimates from the literature. Overstory N uptake varies spatially within NDW, with a CV of 9-41% depending on the calculation method. Variability among methods is even higher, with an almost 15-fold difference between the smallest and largest average overstory uptake estimate (5 vs. 74 kg(.)ha-1(.)year-1). Only 5 and 3 kg(.)ha-1(.)year-1 of N is sequestered in wood and foliar increment, respectively, while 36 kg(.)ha-1 of N returns annually as aboveground litterfall. Uptake and its components are correlated with measures of stand structure but not with elevation or aspect. 3acanopy 3athroughfall 3astems 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen 3aforest litter 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3anutrient uptake 3awatersheds 3aforest inventory 3aspatial variation 3aAbies fraseri 3aaltitude 3aPicea rubens 3adisturbed soils 3amortality 3aleaves 3aNorth Carolina 3aTennessee 0ainventories 0agrowth 0ainfestation1 aVan Miegroet, H.1 aNicholas, N.S.1 aCreed, I.F.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1741-1752x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0983Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03413naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245017700150300001800327500002300345500001500368520180300383650001702186650002202203650002502225650001302250650001302263650002602276650002102302650002002323650002302343650002202366650001602388650001202404650002102416651001202437653002602449653001502475653001602490653001502506653002602521653001102547653001102558700001702569700001602586700001802602773009802620852000902718856007502727930003302802945001302835946001102848655001202859IND2332368020221120180744.0030502e200210  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233236802DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWill, R.E.10aEffects of annual fertilization and complete competition control on current annual increment, foliar development, and growth efficiency of different aged Pinus taeda stands  ap. 1728-1740.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects that competing vegetation and nitrogen limitation have on the current annual increment (CAI), leaf biomass, and growth efficiency (GE) of different aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands planted on a Piedmont and lower Coastal Plain location in Georgia, U.S.A. were determined by measuring stands receiving a factorial combination of complete interspecific competition control and annual nitrogen fertilization. At the Piedmont location, CAI increased with age (5, 10, and 12 years) as well as fertilization (7.3-9.2 Mg(.)ha-1) and competition control (6.8-9.6 Mg(.)ha-1). The effects of fertilization on leaf biomass increased with stand age (no difference at age 5 to 1.5 Mg(.)ha-1 difference at age 12), while the effects of competition control on leaf biomass decreased with stand age (difference of 2.5 Mg(.)ha-1 at age 5 to difference of 1.6 Mg(.)ha-1 at age 12). At the Coastal Plain location, fertilization increased CAI from 10.3 to 14.8 Mg(.)ha-1. Leaf biomass increased with competition control (4.9-5.5 Mg(.)ha-1) and fertilization (4.4-6.0 Mg(.)ha-1). Leaf biomass increased with stand age for the fertilized stands (5.3-7.0 Mg(.)ha-1 between age 7 and 13) and decreased with stand age for nonfertilized stands (4.9-4.0 Mg(.)ha-1 between age 7 and 13). At the Coastal Plain location, fertilization increased the GE of the age-7 stands from 2.34 to 2.86 but decreased the GE of the age-13 stands from 2.32 to 2.14. In general, GE decreased as mean tree size increased indicating that changes in GE related to treatments may be confounded with changes in tree size. Results of this experiment emphasize the importance of nutrition on stand growth as fertilization increased leaf biomass and may increase stem production per unit of foliage at early stages of development. 3aweed control 3aplant development 3adiammonium phosphate 3atree age 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3astand basal area 3aconifer needles 3apotassium chloride 3aplant competition 3aPinus taeda 3abiomass 3aammonium nitrate 3aGeorgia 0avegetation management 0aefficiency 0agrowth rate 0abasal area 0astand characteristics 0agrowth 0aleaves1 aMunger, G.T.1 aZhang, Y.J.1 aBorders, B.E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1728-1740x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0953Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03247naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011700124300001600241500015500257520178600412650001802198650001202216650002302228650002102251650002602272650002602298650002202324650000902346650001102355650000902366650001902375650001002394650002002404650000902424650001702433651001002450651002502460700001902485700001702504700001602521700001702537700001802554773014502572856005102717852000902768655001202777IND4491204920221120161720.0141110e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449120492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, L.10aDifferent irrigation regimes induce changes in vessel size in olive trees (Olea Europaea L.) from southern Italy  ap. 455-461.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops - Greensys 2012, held July 16-20, 2012, Geisenheim Germany  aOlive tree is a Mediterranean, evergreen species adapted to a semi-arid environment. If moderately watered, it increases fruit and oil yields, while maintaining oil quality. However, in the Mediterranean area a rational management of irrigation is difficult, because of frequent water shortages, recently increasing in frequency and severity. To address this problem, several studies over the past decade have been conducted to evaluate the possibility of controlled deficit irrigation. In order to study long term effects of irrigation, dendrochronological and wood anatomical analyses on nine 18-year-old olive trees (cv. 'Nocellara del Belice') were carried out. Three trees for each treatment (rain fed, irrigated at 66% of ETc, and irrigated of 100% of ETc) were selected in a plantation nearby Benevento (southern Italy), and one cross-section from each tree was analyzed. Using standard dendrochronological methods annual rings were dated and anatomical analyses performed. Micro-sections were cut from each sample with a sliding micro tome and then analyzed using an optical microscope. Significant differences were found between irrigated and rain fed olive trees. In particular, vessel size variability within a ring in the irrigated olive trees was very low, whereas in rain fed trees a clear change in vessels size between early wood and late-wood was observed. This suggests that cambial activity stopped after the formation of early wood. Late wood cells were formed under different environmental conditions in comparison with early wood. Vessels in irrigated olive trees were smaller and more abundant. To our knowledge, this is the first dendrochronological study conducted in an irrigated plantation of olive trees, showing useful information for water management. 3aOlea europaea 3acambium 3adeficit irrigation 3adendrochronology 3aenvironmental factors 3airrigation management 3along term effects 3aoils 3aolives 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3atrees 3awater shortages 3awood 3awood anatomy 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aSebastiani, L.1 ad'Andria, R.1 aMorelli, G.1 aTognetti, R.1 aCherubini, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 June 20, , no. 1038 p.455-461dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1038/1038_56.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002200179245012400201300001800325500002400343506007600367520178100443506003702224650001302261650001202274650001402286650001402300650001902314650002202333650000902355650001402364650002202378650002502400650001702425650001002442650001402452650001402466650002202480650002602502650000902528650001002537651001102547651001102558700001702569700002702586773010102613852000902714856007802723856003202801655001202833IND4385367120221207132110.0061119e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438536712DNAL7 a170083492pmid7 aPMC28035842pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl2022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALCANTARA, SUZANA10aLow Genetic Structure in an Epiphytic Orchidaceae (Oncidium hookeri) in the Atlantic Rainforest of South-eastern Brazil  ap. 1207-1213.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: and Aims Oncidium hookeri is a neotropical species of epiphytic Orchidaceae found in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest at the top of the Mantiqueira Range of mountains. The genetic variation of O. hookeri was studied to assess the distribution of genetic variability within and among six populations localized in Atlantic rainforest remnants. Gene flow among populations and the occurrence of recent bottlenecks were investigated in order to infer the degree of isolation of these populations. METHODS: Thirteen polymorphic loci were used for allozyme electrophoresis. The data were analysed by means of standard statistical approaches, to estimate gene diversity and the genetic structure of the populations. Key Results The mean gene diversity and allelic richness were He = 0·099 and A = 1·75, respectively. F-statistics revealed high heterozygote deficiencies in all populations (FIS = 0·43-0·82). Several rare alleles were found in all the populations, and three populations presented private alleles. Low genetic differentiation among O. hookeri populations was detected (FST = 0·029); natural selection may be involved in PGM locus differentiation among populations. The genetic differentiation between paired populations was low, bearing no correlation with geographic distance (Mantel test: r = -0·34, P = 0·72). Only two populations showed signs of recent bottlenecks. CONCLUSIONS: The heterozygote deficiency found seems to be caused by pollinator behaviour; the low frequencies of several alleles of different loci can be maintained due to clonal propagation. Despite the stochastic nature of the wind-dispersal of seeds to long distances, this process may promote an effective gene flow among populations, thus avoiding genetic differentiation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncidium 3aalleles 3aepiphytes 3agene flow 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amountains 3anatural selection 3apopulation structure 3arain forests 3aseeds 2aEcosystem 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aOrchidaceaexgenetics 2aRain 2aTrees 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aSEMIR, JOÃO1 aSOLFERINI, VERA NISAKA0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Dec., v. 98, no. 6 p.1207-1213dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl2023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle02492naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009300164300001400257520121700271650001601488650001801504650002601522650001201548650001701560650001901577650002001596650001201616650001201628650001701640650001101657650001201668650001601680650002101696650001601717653001001733653001601743700002001759773012901779852000901908856008501917930003302002946001102035655001202046IND4447082320221120151506.0101231e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444708232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-010-1361-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambi, Hulda 10aEffect of surfactants on the functional properties of gelatin-polysaccharide-based films  ap. 63-69.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the addition of surfactants sodium stearoyl lactate (SSL) and sucrose ester (SE) on the functional properties of films produced with polysaccharides mixtures (methylcellulose/glucomannan/pectin in 1/4/1 ratio, respectively) and gelatin. The films were produced by the casting method and characterized for their water vapor permeability (WVP), mechanical (tensile strength and elongation to break point), morphological and optical properties. Films with low WVP were obtained with surfactants. Addition of SE to the films with polysaccharide/gelatin ratio of 90/10 showed improved mechanical properties. Films presented smooth surfaces with micro voids and lumpiness, depending on the surfactant tested. Surfactants increased the opacity of the films by a factor of 1-3%. All film properties were dependent on the surfactant affinity for the biopolymer matrix. SE presented more affinity for biopolymer matrix containing high polysaccharide proportion, and SSL presented more affinity for polymer matrix containing high gelatin proportion. The addition of surfactants decreased the water vapor permeability of the films, increasing their hydrophobic character. 3abiopolymers 3afood research 3afunctional properties 3agelatin 3aglucomannans 3ahydrophobicity 3amethylcellulose 3aopacity 3apectins 3apermeability 3asodium 3asucrose 3asurfactants 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0aFilms 0aGlucomannan1 aGrosso, Carlos 0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2011 Jan., v. 232, no. 1 p.63-69dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-010-1361-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101231b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02585naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245017000173300001600343500002400359520128500383650002001668650001801688650002101706650000901727650001801736650000901754650001701763650001001780650001701790650002101807650001701828650002501845650001801870650001401888650001801902700001701920700002501937700002001962773010501982852000902087856005502096655001202151IND4459868920221120135511.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445986892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00811.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMAZURKIEWICZ, J.10aCold-pressed rapeseed cake as a component of the diet of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): effects on growth, nutrient utilization, body composition and meat quality  ap. 387-394.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the study was to determine the possibility of inclusion of cold-pressed rapeseed cake (CPRC) in diets for common carp, Cyprinus carpio L. Four isonitrogenous (322 g kg⁻¹ crude protein) and isoenergetic diets (17.5 MJ kg⁻¹) with four levels of CPRC incorporation 0, 110, 220 and 330 g kg⁻¹ (treatments RC0, RC11, RC22 and RC33, respectively) were evaluated in a 50-day growth test with common carp of 500 g initial weight. Statistically significant higher final weights (1215-1243 g) were obtained in fish fed diets including CPRC. Fish growth rates were nearly identical in all treatments (specific growth rate of 1.7-1.8% day⁻¹). Similar results were obtained in respect of feeding coefficients (FCR) that ranged from 1.6 to 1.8. Crude protein and ash concentration in fish bodies did not change. Statistically significant decreases in moisture content were found in carp in groups RC22 and RC33. Statistically significant increase of crude lipid in fish bodies were found in groups RC22 and RC33. The slaughter traits and meat quality analysis of carp did not show significant differences. We conclude that it is possible to include up to 330 g kg⁻¹ of CPRC in diets of 2-year-old common carp without significant effects on growth and food utilization. 3aCyprinus carpio 3aanimal growth 3abody composition 3acarp 3acrude protein 3adiet 3afish feeding 3afoods 3alipid bodies 3ameat composition 3ameat quality 3anutrient utilization 3arapeseed cake 3aslaughter 3awater content1 aPRZYBYŁ, A.1 aCZYŻAK-RUNOWSKA, G.1 aŁYCZYŃSKI, A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2011 Aug., v. 17, no. 4 p.387-394dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00811.x 7aarticle03900naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245012500189300001600314520194400330650002202274650002002296650001902316650001902335650001302354650002302367650001602390650001002406650001302416650003902429650001002468650001302478650001302491650001202504650001802516650001202534650001202546650002302558650002202581650002302603650003302626650001802659650002702677650001202704650001502716650002702731653001702758653001702775653002502792700002202817700002402839700002202863700001702885700002402902700002502926700002502951773011202976852000903088856008503097930003303182946001103215655001203226IND4442642820221120124806.0100917e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444264282DNAL7 a205718762pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-010-9140-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, Annaliese S. 10aGenome structure affects the rate of autosyndesis and allosyndesis in AABC, BBAC and CCAB Brassica interspecific hybrids  ap. 655-666.  aGene introgression into allopolyploid crop species from diploid or polyploid ancestors can be accomplished through homologous or homoeologous chromosome pairing during meiosis. We produced trigenomic Brassica interspecific hybrids (genome complements AABC, BBAC and CCAB) from the amphidiploid species Brassica napus (AACC), Brassica juncea (AABB) and Brassica carinata (BBCC) in order to test whether the structure of each genome affects frequencies of homologous and homoeologous (both allosyndetic and autosyndetic) pairing during meiosis. AABC hybrids produced from three genotypes of B. napus were included to assess the genetic control of homoeologous pairing. Multi-colour fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to quantify homologous pairing (e.g. A-genome bivalents in AABC), allosyndetic associations (e.g. B-C in AABC) and autosyndetic associations (e.g. B-B in AABC) at meiosis. A high percentage of homologous chromosomes formed pairs (97.5-99.3%), although many pairs were also involved in autosyndetic and allosyndetic associations. Allosyndesis was observed most frequently as A-C genome associations (mean 4.0 per cell) and less frequently as A-B genome associations (0.8 per cell) and B-C genome associations (0.3 per cell). Autosyndesis occurred most frequently in the haploid A genome (0.75 A-A per cell) and least frequently in the haploid B genome (0.13 B-B per cell). The frequency of C-C autosyndesis was greater in BBAC hybrids (0.75 per cell) than in any other hybrid. The frequency of A-B, A-C and B-C allosyndesis was affected by the genomic structure of the trigenomic hybrids. Frequency of allosyndesis was also influenced by the genotype of the B. napus paternal parent for the three AABC (B. juncea × B. napus) hybrid types. Homoeologous pairing between the Brassica A, B and C genomes in interspecific hybrids may be influenced by complex interactions between genome structure and allelic composition. 3aBrassica carinata 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3aallopolyploidy 3aancestry 3achromosome pairing 3achromosomes 3acrops 3adiploidy 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahaploidy 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3ameiosis 2aAlleles 2aBrassicaxgenetics 2aChimeraxgenetics 2aChromosome Pairing 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMeiosis 2aPolyploidy 2aRecombination, Genetic 0aallosyndesis 0aautosyndesis 0ainterspecific hybrid1 aHuteau, Virginie 1 aEber, Frédérique 1 aCoriton, Olivier 1 aYan, Guijun 1 aNelson, Matthew N. 1 aCowling, Wallace A. 1 aChèvre, Anne-Marie 0 tChromosome research.g2010 Sept., v. 18, no. 6 p.655-666dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-010-9140-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01745naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008600168300001600254520077200270653001501042653001001057653002801067653001701095653003101112653001201143700003101155773010701186852000901293856008501302939003301387946001101420655001201431IND4449611120221120110322.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444961112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9602-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoner, Radhakanta 10aEarthquake response of external mine overburden dumps: a micromechanical approach  ap. 941-959.  aThe huge piles of overburden comprising of fragmented rocks and loose soil are dumped within the leasehold area causing serious environmental problems in view of occasional sliding and the risks of miner's life. The continuum-based numerical approach ignores the discrete nature of the geo-materials found in external overburden dump, in terms of both composition and interactions. Engineering mechanics in the discontinuum regime has been utilized to overcome the mentioned limitations. The distinct element method is employed to characterize the overburden dump geometry and the associated physical behaviour of the dump mass for seismic loads. The study discussed about the earthquake vibration responses and assessed the internal dynamics of the dump mass system. 0aOverburden 0aDumps 0aDistinct element method 0aSeismic load 0aNatural frequency of dumps 0aDamping1 aCakrabarttī, Debāśisha.0 tNatural hazards.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.941-959dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9602-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03366naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245017200144300001600316500001500332520176900347650001202116650001602128650002302144650002202167650001302189650003402202650001702236650001702253650002502270650001602295650001502311650001702326650002502343650001402368650002302382650003502405650002102440650001702461650002102478651001702499653002602516653001802542653001602560700001502576700001802591700001702609700001802626773007602644852000902720930003302729945002502762946001302787655001202800IND4370440720221120110247.0050524e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437044072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKruger, H.S.10aUrbanization of Africans in the North West Province is associated with better micronutrient status: the Transition and Health during Urbanization Study in South Africa  ap. 365-375.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to assess by dietary and biochemical methods in a cross-sectional study the micronutrient status of a population in transition. The study sample was stratified according to the level of urbanization. Africans, aged 15 to 75 years, were recruited from 37 randomly selected sites throughout the North West Province of South Africa. Fieldworkers measured dietary intakes using a validated food frequency questionnaire and a food portion photo book. The following indicators of micronutrient status were measured: serum ferritin, hemoglobin level, hematocrit, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum retinol, and urinary iodine. More than half of all subjects had intakes of vitamin A, folate, ascorbic acid, zinc, iron, and calcium less than 67% of the recommended dietary allowance. According to the biochemical analyses, 7.2% of the men and 26.9% of the women had serum ferritin concentrations less than 20 microgram/L. Only 1.5% of all subjects had serum retinol levels less than 20 microgram/dL. Urban subjects had significantly higher mean intakes of vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, folate, niacin, iron, and zinc than rural subjects. The median urinary iodine of the rural subjects was 93 microgram/L compared with the median of 161 microgram/L for the urban subjects. Many rural subjects used noniodated salt in cooking. The subjects living in rural areas ate mostly unfortified starchy foods, whereas urban subjects ate more vegetables, fruit, and brown bread and used iodated salt. Regular intake of nutrient-dense foods and iodated salt should be emphasized in nutrition education. The results indicate the importance of the fortification of staple foods with micronutrients in South Africa. 3aelderly 3aurban areas 3amiddle-aged adults 3aelderly nutrition 3avitamins 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aurbanization 3ayoung adults 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3avolunteers 3aportion size 3anutrition assessment 3alifestyle 3anutritional status 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aTotal Diet Study 3afood choices 3adietary minerals 3aSouth Africa 0abiochemical compounds 0aeating habits 0afood intake1 aKruger, A.1 aVorster, H.H.1 aJooste, P.L.1 aWolmarans, P.0 tNutrition research.g2005 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.365-375x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20050711b20050802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/07/11  aOther US 7aarticle01947naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014700168300001600315520086900331650001401200653003201214653001301246653002301259700001901282700002201301700002201323700001901345773011901364852000901483856008501492930003301577946001101610655001201621IND4443725620221120110340.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444372562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10965-009-9375-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStiubianu, George 10aSilicone-modified cellulose.

Recent development of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has allowed to directly visualize such transient intermediates in a number of protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. Here we present an analysis of the recently published PRE NMR data for a protein complex of yeast cytochrome c (Cc) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP). First, we describe a simple, general method to map out the spatial and temporal distributions of binding geometries constituting the Cc-CcP encounter state. We show that the spatiotemporal mapping provides a reliable estimate of the experimental coverage and, at higher coverage levels, allows to delineate the conformational space sampled by the minor species. To further refine the encounter state, we performed PRE-based ensemble simulations. The generated solutions reproduce well the experimental data and lie within the allowed regions of the encounter maps, confirming the validity of the mapping approach. The refined encounter ensembles are distributed predominantly in a region encompassing the dominant form of the complex, providing experimental proof for the results of classical theoretical simulations. 3acytochrome c 0aEncounter state 0aParamagnetic relaxation enhancement 0aCytochrome c peroxidase 0aTransient complex1 aUbbink, Marcellus 1 avan Nuland, Nico A.

First, pairs of TEs cause chromosome breaks with frequencies inversely related to the intertransposon distance. Second, some combinations of two TEs produce complex rearrangements that often include DNA adjacent to one or both elements. In pairs of TEs in direct orientation, alternative reactions involving the external ends of the two TEs should lead to the transposition of a macrotransposon consisting of both elements plus the intervening chromosomal segment. Such macrotransposons have been hypothesized previously based on deletions, but no macrotransposon insertions have been recovered. To detect macrotransposition, we have analyzed heritable chromosomal rearrangements produced by a chromosome-breaking pair of Ac and Ds elements situated 6.5 kb apart in direct orientation in a part of the maize (Zea mays) genome dispensable for viability. Here, we show that the postulated macrotransposon can excise and reinsert elsewhere in the genome. In addition, this transposon pair produces other complex rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, and reshuffling of the intertransposon segment. Thus, closely linked TE pairs, a common transposition outcome in some superfamilies, are adept at restructuring chromosomes and may have been instrumental in reshaping plant genomes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aZea mays 3achromosomes 3acorn 3agenome 3atransposons 3aviability 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aGene Rearrangementxgenetics 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aDooner, Hugo K.0 tplant cell.g2008 Aug., v. 20, no. 8 p.2019-2032dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.108.0605823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01802naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245012100159300001800280500002400298520063800322650001700960650001200977650001900989650001401008650002201022650001901044650000901063650002701072651001001099700001901109700001601128700002201144700002301166700002301189773011601212852000901328856007901337655001201416IND4460758220221120030242.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446075822DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.11000562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImanishi, Ayumi10aDevelopment of microsatellite markers for Euryale ferox (Nymphaeaceae), an endangered aquatic plant species in Japan  ap. e233-e235.  aIncludes references  aPremise of the study: Microsatellite markers were developed to investigate genetic diversity and genetic structure of Euryale ferox, a vulnerable aquatic plant.

Recent studies show that selective deletion of PTEN in pancreatic β-cells leads to resistance to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, but the mechanism is unclear. One major mechanism underlying STZ toxicity is cytokine-mediated β-cell destruction in which oxidative stress plays a key role. The present study investigated the role of PTEN in cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis, and further explored whether oxidative stress, particularly peroxynitrite formation, could regulate PTEN-Akt pathway. Incubation of βTC-6 cells with cytokine mixture (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) or exogenous peroxynitrite significantly increased apoptotic cell percentage, elevated PTEN and p-PTEN levels, and inhibited Akt activation. Transfection with PTEN-specific siRNA protected βTC-6 cells from cytokine or peroxynitrite-mediated cell apoptosis and partially reversed Akt inhibition. Furthermore, nitrotyrosine formation, an indicator of peroxynitrite production, was significantly elevated after cytokine treatment. Preventing peroxynitrite formation by administrating NAC/l-NMMA, or scavenging peroxynitrite directly by UA, attenuated cytokine-induced PTEN upregulation, Akt inhibition, and β-cell apoptosis. These findings suggest that peroxynitrite-mediated PTEN upregulation plays an important role in cytokine-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. 3aapoptosis 0aPTEN 0aCytokine 0aPeroxynitrite 0aPancreatic β-cell1 aZhang, Jing 1 aYin, Tao 1 aCao, Hongwei 1 aZhang, Nanyan 1 aLi, Xiaomiao 1 aWang, Li 1 aXing, Ying 1 aLi, Deqiang 1 aJi, Qiuhe 0 tApoptosis.g2010 Aug., v. 15, no. 8 p.877-886dBoston : Springer USx1360-81857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10495-010-0510-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03831naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011600163300001600279500002400295500001500319520237300334650000902707650002802716650002402744650002202768650001302790650001302803650001602816650002602832650001902858650000902877650001702886650001402903650001502917650002302932650001802955651001002973651001802983653001903001700001803020700001803038700001603056700001703072700001403089700002703103700001703130773009703147852000903244856004803253655001203301IND4431706720221123040632.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443170672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0056-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Zhisheng10aEffects of organic matter incorporation on nitrous oxide emissions from rice-wheat rotation ecosystems in China  ap. 315-330.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOrganic matter addition is thought to be an important regulator of nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from croplands. Contradictory effects, however, were reported in previous studies. To investigate the effects of crop residue management on N₂O emissions from rice-wheat rotation ecosystems, we conducted field experiments at three sites (Suzhou, Wuxi and Jiangdu) in the Yangtze River Delta, using static chamber and gas chromatography methods. Our data show that N₂O emissions throughout the rice season from plots treated with wheat straw application at a high rate (WS) prior to rice transplanting (1.1-2.0 kg N ha⁻¹) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those from the control plots without organic matter addition or added with wheat straw at a moderate rate (1.6-2.9 kg N ha⁻¹). Furthermore, the WS treatments had a residual inhibitory effect on N₂O emissions in the following non-rice season, which consistently resulted in significantly lower emissions (P < 0.05) compared to the control treatments (2.2-3.1 vs. 3.9-5.6 kg N ha⁻¹). In comparison to the control treatments, the WS treatments reduced both the seasonal and annual direct emission factors of the applied nitrogen (EFd) by 50-68% (mean: 57%). The addition of compost (aerobically composted rice or wheat straw harvested in the last rotation) reduced the seasonal and annual EFds by 29-32%. Over the entire rice-wheat rotation cycle, annual N₂O emissions from the fertilized fields at the three sites ranged from 3.3 ± 0.3 to 16.8 ± 0.6 kg N ha⁻¹, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 61%. Similarly, the EFds during the rice-wheat rotation cycle ranged from 0.4% to 2.5%, with a CV of 67%. These high spatial variations might have been related to: variations in soil properties, such as texture and soil organic carbon; management practices, such as straw treatments (i.e., compost versus fresh straw) and weather conditions, such as precipitation and rainfall distribution. Our results indicate that the incorporation of fresh wheat straw at a high rate during the rice season is an effective management practice for the mitigation of N₂O emissions in rice-wheat rotation systems. Whether this practice is also effective in reducing the overall global warming potential of net N₂O, CH₄ and CO₂ emissions needs to be seen through further studies. 3arice 3acrop residue management 3asoil organic carbon 3aagricultural land 3acomposts 3anitrogen 3awheat straw 3afield experimentation 3aglobal warming 3arain 3asoil texture 3aemissions 3aecosystems 3agas chromatography 3anitrous oxide 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aorganic matter1 aZhou, Zaixing1 aZheng, Xunhua1 aXie, Baohua1 aMei, Baoling1 aWang, Rui1 aButterbach-Bahl, Klaus1 aZhu, Jianguo0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Feb., v. 327, no. 1-2 p.315-330dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0056-4 7aarticle02142naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100005000145245007300195300001500268520074600283650001701029650002201046650001101068650001501079650001801094650002401112650002201136650001201158650001301170650001101183650002201194650001601216650002001232650001201252653001301264653001201277700002701289700002101316700002901337700003801366773013001404852000901534856008501543930003301628946001101661655001201672IND4447082820221123040549.0101231e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444708282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-010-1367-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Emanuel Joaquim Victória Monteiro 14aThe use of stable isotopes for authentication of gadoid fish species  ap. 97-101.  aThe rise of processed seafood in international trade has increased the feasibility of fish species substitution.

We have combined the advantages of SPCE with the high light collection efficiency of supercritical angle fluorescence by carrying out an immunoassay on a paraboloid array biochip in the absence of the conventional SPCE spacer layer normally used to minimize metal quenching of the fluorescence. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated an SPCE-based assay by utilizing the protein assay layer as the spacer layer. A novel 3 × 3 injection molded polymer biochip with paraboloid elements was used. The paraboloid elements served to enhance the light collection efficiency while the top surface was coated with a gold layer to use excitation of surface plasmons and detection of SPCE emission. Theoretical modeling of the gold-protein layer structure showed that the surface plasmon resonance angles were located in the detection range of the paraboloid biochip. The polarization dependence of SPCE emission was also demonstrated. Finally, a human IgG sandwich immunoassay was carried out which exhibited a limit of detection of ~10 ng/ml using 3σ. The results demonstrate the potential of the SPCE-based paraboloid array biochip as a novel platform for high-throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions. 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amodels 3apolymers 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSurface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) 0aQuenching 0aSpacer layer 0aBiochip1 aMcDonagh, Colette 1 aMacCraith, Brian D. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Nov., v. 398, no. 5 p.1947-1954dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-4026-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03354naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002000174245007600194300001800270500002400288500001500312520126900327650001601596650001601612650001001628650001201638650002001650650001701670650001801687650000901705650002501714650001401739650002001753650002101773650002201794650001201816650002601828650002901854650002201883650002601905650004701931650004701978650006402025650000902089650003502098650000902133650001702142650001902159653002402178700002902202700002202231700002002253700002102273700002002294700002202314773016302336852000902499856007702508930003302585945002502618946001302643655001202656IND4423797920221122235752.0090728e20090722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442379792DNAL7 a195486752pmid7 a10.1021/jf900576h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aAssuncao, Marco10aRed Wine Protects against Ethanol-Induced Oxidative Stress in Rat Liver  ap. 6066-6073.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthanol consumption may be deleterious to the liver. However, alcoholic beverages contain, besides ethanol (EtOH), complex chemical mixtures that can modify EtOH's adverse effects. Red wine (RW) is rich in polyphenolic antioxidants, often reported as hepatoprotective agents. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 6 months of RW ingestion on hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. Six-month-old Wistar rats were treated with RW or EtOH; controls were pair-fed. EtOH increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and decreased reduced and oxidized glutathione. These animals also displayed stimulated superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities. RW treatment decreased malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels. Glutathione-S-transferase and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activities were stimulated and glutathione reductase activity was inhibited by RW intake. No modifications were detected in nuclear factor-κ B or alkaline phosphatase activities. EtOH consumption induced fibrosis in portal spaces and hepatocyte lipid accumulation that were absent with RW treatment. This paper highlights the importance of RW nonalcoholic components and the relevance of biological matrix in the study of EtOH oxidative effects. 3apolyphenols 3aglutathione 3aliver 3aethanol 3aenzyme activity 3ainflammation 3aanimal models 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3ared wines 3aadverse effects 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aEthanolxtoxicity 2aGlutathionexanalysis 2aHepatitis, Alcoholicxprevention & control 2aLiverxchemistryxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aLiver Diseases, Alcoholicxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWinexanalysis 0aalcoholic beverages1 aSantos-Marques, Maria J.1 aMonteiro, Rosario1 aAzevedo, Isabel1 aAndrade, Jose P.1 aCarvalho, Felix1 aMartins, Maria J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 July 22, v. 57, no. 14 p.6066-6073dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf900576h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle03364naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002200183245012900205300001800334500002400352506007600376520146100452506003701913650002501950650000801975650002501983650001202008650001402020650002102034650001002055650001202065650001302077650001202090650001302102650002602115650002502141650005702166650007002223650006002293650002802353650001402381650001402395650005402409650002102463700001502484700001902499700001802518700002102536773010802557852000902665856008202674856003002756655001202786IND4382802020221207121858.0060813e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438280202DNAL7 a168449042pmid7 aPMC15339882pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0429782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Martino, Gemma10aFunctional Analyses of Two Tomato APETALA3 Genes Demonstrate Diversification in Their Roles in Regulating Floral Development  ap. 1833-1845.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe floral homeotic APETALA3 (AP3) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a MADS box transcription factor required for specifying petal and stamen identities. AP3 is a member of the euAP3 lineage, which arose by gene duplication coincident with radiation of the core eudicots. Although Arabidopsis lacks genes in the paralogous Tomato MADS box gene 6 (TM6) lineage, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) possesses both euAP3 and TM6 genes, which have functionally diversified. A loss-of-function mutation in Tomato AP3 (TAP3) resulted in homeotic transformations of both petals and stamens, whereas RNA interference-induced reduction in TM6 function resulted in flowers with homeotic defects primarily in stamens. The functional differences between these genes can be ascribed partly to different expression domains. When overexpressed in an equivalent domain, both genes can partially rescue the tap3 mutant, indicating that relative levels as well as spatial patterns of expression contribute to functional differences. Our results also indicate that the two proteins have differing biochemical capabilities. Together, these results suggest that TM6 and TAP3 play qualitatively different roles in floral development; they also support the ideas that the ancestral role of AP3 lineage genes was in specifying stamen development and that duplication and divergence in the AP3 lineage allowed for the acquisition of a role in petal specification in the core eudicots.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acorolla 3aflowering 3agene duplication 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3astamens 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMADS Domain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aRNA Interference1 aPan, Irvin1 aEmmanuel, Eyal1 aLevy, Avraham1 aIrish, Vivian F.0 tplant cell.g2006 Aug., v. 18, no. 8 p.1833-1845dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.0429783Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010400165300001600269500002400285520117800309650001101487650001201498650001201510650001801522650001501540650002001555650001201575651001301587653002601600653003301626653001701659653001601676653002101692700001901713773008401732852000901816856004801825655001201873IND4423999220221122212706.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442399922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-009-9236-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogale, Ayalneh10aResource Entitlement and Mobility of Pastoralists in the Yerer and Daketa Valleys, Eastern Ethiopia  ap. 453-462.  aIncludes references  aLiterature on the mobility of pastoralists and resource access is widely available, but conceptualization and understanding of the socioeconomic processes expected to affect the outcome are inconsistent. In this article, drawing on research conducted in the Yerer and Daketa Valleys, eastern Ethiopia, we use the notion of entitlements to examine how, under increasing pressure for resource access, various agro-pastoral households manage conflicting interests in common grazing resources. We observed that in times of drought and resource scarcity incumbent agro-pastoralists find peaceful sharing arrangements with intruding pastoralists. Asset-poor agro-pastoralists enter into mutually beneficial arrangements with pastoralists, trading their resource endowments to grazing land for other assets from the pastoralists, whereas wealthier households prefer a reciprocal risk-management strategy. These multiple arrangements have distributional effects because asset-poor agro-pastoralist households can stabilize or enhance their household assets and their capabilities in times of drought, and thus benefit from assisting pastoralist migrants to the common grazing land. 3aassets 3adrought 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3ahouseholds 3arisk management 3avalleys 3aEthiopia 0aGrazing land resource 0aCommon property institutions 0aEntitlements 0aPastoralist 0aAgro-pastoralist1 aKorf, Benedikt0 tHuman ecology.g2009 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.453-462dSpringer USx0300-78397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-009-9236-3 7aarticle02630naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245014600152300001600298500002300314500001500337520140500352650002201757650001201779650001801791650002601809650002701835650002101862650002001883650001501903651001101918653002201929653001501951700001801966773009501984852000902079856007502088930003302163945001302196946001102209655001202220IND2332934620221122212703.0030605e200204  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233293462DNAL7 a10.1139/x02-0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmann, J.L.10aPredictive mapping of forest composition and structure with direct gradient analysis and nearest-neighbor imputation in coastal Oregon, U.S.A  ap. 725-741.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aSpatially explicit information on the species composition and structure of forest vegetation is needed at broad spatial scales for natural resource policy analysis and ecological research. We present a method for predictive vegetation mapping that applies direct gradient analysis and nearest-neighbor imputation to ascribe detailed ground attributes of vegetation to each pixel in a digital landscape map. The gradient nearest neighbor method integrates vegetation measurements from regional grids of field plots, mapped environmental data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. In the Oregon coastal province, species gradients were most strongly associated with regional climate and geographic location, whereas variation in forest structure was best explained by Landsat TM variables. At the regional level, mapped predictions represented the range of variability in the sample data, and predicted area by vegetation type closely matched sample-based estimates. At the site level, mapped predictions maintained the covariance structure among multiple response variables. Prediction accuracy for tree species occurrence and several measures of vegetation structure and composition was good to moderate. Vegetation maps produced with the gradient nearest neighbor method are appropriately used for regional-level planning, policy analysis, and research, not to guide local management decisions. 3asimulation models 3aforests 3aforest policy 3abotanical composition 3ageographical variation 3aclimatic factors 3astand structure 3aprediction 3aOregon 0aspecies diversity 0avegetation1 aGregory, M.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.725-741x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x02-0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02073naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007500169300001600244520119400260653001501454653002301469653001901492700001701511773016701528852000901695856009201704946001101796655001201807IND4440558120221122153642.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444055812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-9876.2009.00702.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jialiang10aInterval-censored data with repeated measurements and a cured subgroup  ap. 693-705.  aThe hypobaric decompression sickness data study was conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to investigate the risk of decompression sickness in hypobaric environments. The quantity of interest is the time to onset of grade IV venous gas emboli, which was mixed case interval censored because of measurement limitations. In the study, some subjects participated in multiple experiments, leading to repeated and correlated measurements on those subjects. In addition, it has been suggested that some subjects had a much lower risk of developing grade IV venous gas emboli than others, i.e. those subjects were immune from the event of interest (or 'cured'). We propose to use two-part models, where the first part describes the probability of cure and the second part describes the survival for susceptible subjects. We use two random effects to account for the correlated nature of measurements. A leverage bootstrap approach is proposed for model diagnosis. A simulation study shows satisfactory performance of the estimation and diagnosis approaches proposed. Model estimation and evaluation of the hypobaric decompression sickness data are carefully investigated. 0aCure model 0aInterval censoring 0aTwo-part model1 aMa, Shuangge0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Some statements on relative species vulnerability have been made but they rely on empirical observations, which are often difficult to generalize. In this context, a study was conducted to compare the overturning resistance of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) on a mesic site. To establish which tree characteristics would best explain the critical turning moment, simple linear regressions were calculated using tree dendrometric data. The best regressions were obtained with stem weight. With this variable, resistance to overturning did not differ between the two species. Only regressions involving total height showed a significantly greater resistance for white spruce. This difference can be explained by a difference between the species in height-diameter relationships. For a similar height, spruce has a greater diameter, involving a higher stem weight and thus a greater resistance. Decay did not play a major role in our experiment as trees with external defects were excluded. Our results suggest that to minimize losses from windthrow, silvicultural treatments on mesic sites should try to increase the proportion of trees of either species with the lowest height/diameter ratio. 3aPicea glauca 3aAbies balsamea 3aweight 3amechanical properties 3adiameter 3aQuebec1 aRuel, J.C.1 aLaflamme, G.1 aAchim, A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2002 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.642-652x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-2123Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02095naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245012600174300001600300500002400316520102400340650001701364650001601381650002001397650002801417650002001445650002101465650001501486650001401501650001601515650001701531773014301548852000901691856005701700655001201757IND4456125020221122090051.0110408e197903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445612502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1979.tb02864.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCOPLAND, M.J.W.10aHymenoptera in hop gardens, with particular reference to parasitoids associated with the damson-hop aphid phorodon humuli  ap. 146-152.  aIncludes references  aA study was made of Hymenoptera, particularly aphid parasitoids in hop gardens receiving three different pesticide regimes. Aphidophagous species accounted for 50% of the total Hymenoptera caught in each site, using water traps, and comprised equal numbers of primary and hyperparasitoids. There was no significant increase in the proportion of aphid parasitoids captured when aphid populations were allowed to rise. However, there was a significant decrease in all Hymenoptera when weed control was employed. Parasitoids bred from the hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank), comprised three species of Aphidiinae which are primary parasitoids and five species of hyperparasitoid. From “mummies” which completed development, 48% hyperparasitism was recorded. However, 34% of “mummies” failed to emerge, most likely killed by predation from Anthocoridae or unsuccessful attack by hyperparasitoids. Native Aphidiinae do not appear to offer a significant contribution towards the integrated control of the hop aphid. 3aAnthocoridae 3aHymenoptera 3aPhorodon humuli 3aaphidophagous predators 3ahyperparasitism 3ahyperparasitoids 3apesticides 3apredation 3awater traps 3aweed control0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1979, v. 25, no. 2 p.146-152dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw32591wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1979.tb02864.x 7aarticle02755naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013800165300001600303520168400319650001102003650002502014650001502039650001902054650001402073650001802087650001102105650001702116650001102133700002102144700001802165700001702183773015202200856004402352852000902396655001202405IND60633256520221122052817.0190320e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063325652DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.80.3.2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuckburally, Adam10aEffects of ventilation mode and blood flow on arterial oxygenation during pulse-delivered inhaled nitric oxide in anesthetized horses  ap. 275-283.  aOBJECTIVE To determine the impact of mechanical ventilation (MV) and perfusion conditions on the efficacy of pulse-delivered inhaled nitric oxide (PiNO) in anesthetized horses. ANIMALS 27 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES Anesthetized horses were allocated into 4 groups: spontaneous breathing (SB) with low (< 70 mm Hg) mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; group SB-L; n = 7), SB with physiologically normal (≥ 70 mm Hg) MAP (group SB-N; 8), MV with low MAP (group MV-L; 6), and MV with physiologically normal MAP (group MV-N; 6). Dobutamine was used to maintain MAP > 70 mm Hg. Data were collected after a 60-minute equilibration period and at 15 and 30 minutes during PiNO administration. Variables included Pao2, arterial oxygen saturation and content, oxygen delivery, and physiologic dead space-to-tidal volume ratio. Data were analyzed with Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney U, and Friedman ANOVA tests. RESULTS Pao2, arterial oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen content, and oxygen delivery increased significantly with PiNO in the SB-L, SB-N, and MV-N groups; were significantly lower in group MV-L than in group MV-N; and were lower in MV-N than in both SB groups during PiNO. Physiologic dead space-to-tidal volume ratio was highest in the MV-L group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Pulmonary perfusion impacted PiNO efficacy during MV but not during SB. Use of PiNO failed to increase oxygenation in the MV-L group, likely because of profound ventilation-perfusion mismatching. During SB, PiNO improved oxygenation irrespective of the magnitude of blood flow, but hypoventilation and hypercarbia persisted. Use of PiNO was most effective in horses with adequate perfusion. 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3ablood flow 3ablood pressure 3abreathing 3adata analysis 3ahorses 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen1 aGrubb, Tamara L.1 aWiklund, Maja1 aNyman, Gorel0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2019 Mar., v. 80, no. 3 p.275-283dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.80.3.275  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010700163300001400270500002400284500001500308520130400323650001601627650001601643650001801659650001001677650001901687650002701706650002101733650001701754650001701771650002001788650002401808650001101832650001301843650001401856650001801870650001901888650001501907650001601922653001201938700001601950773011801966852000902084856004802093655001202141IND4447647520221121104350.0110121e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444764752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-010-1656-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaidya, Bipin10aEffects of Seed Roasting on Tocopherols, Carotenoids, and Oxidation in Mustard Seed Oil During Heating  ap. 83-90.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeed roasting is practiced in the mustard oil industry in some areas of the world, and can affect the physicochemical properties of the oil for further applications. This research studied the differences in oxidative stability, tocopherols, and carotenoids during heating at 160 °C between oil extracted from roasted mustard seeds and that from unroasted seeds. The content of free fatty acids, polar compounds (PC), and lutein were not significantly different between the roasted and unroasted seed oils before heating. The fatty acid compositions of both oils were also similar, with high amounts of erucic, linoleic, and oleic acids, moderate amounts of linolenic and eicosenoic acids, and low amounts of palmitic and stearic acids. However, the levels of tocopherols and conjugated dienoic acids (CDA) were higher in the roasted seed oil. Heating increased the content of CDA and PC in both oils, but decreased tocopherols and lutein. The rates of increase in CDA and PC and the degradation rates of tocopherols and lutein during heating were lower in the roasted than in the unroasted seed oil. Overall, the increased thermo-oxidative stability of the mustard oil by roasting the seeds before oil extraction was highly correlated with improved heat stabilities for both tocopherols and lutein. 3atocopherols 3amustard oil 3alinoleic acid 3aseeds 3alinolenic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3astearic acid 3amustard seed 3apolar compounds 3aoxidative stability 3alutein 3aroasting 3aoxidation 3apalmitic acid 3aheat treatment 3aoleic acid 3aerucic acid 0amustard1 aChoe, Eunok0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2011 Jan., v. 88, no. 1 p.83-90dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-010-1656-0 7aarticle04099naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001900161245022900180300001600409500002400425520171200449650001602161650002502177650002402202650001302226650001802239650002102257650003402278650001002312650001402322650001802336650002302354650001502377650000902392650002402401650001302425650003202438650002202470650003102492650000902523650002102532650001202553650000902565650002502574650000902599650004902608650005002657650005402707650001102761650001102772650004102783650003902824650000902863650001602872650001502888650008002903650003202983650003103015651001003046651002503056700001703081700001703098700002103115700001803136700002203154773011103176852000903287856004503296655001203341IND4440159320221121054115.0100716e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444015932DNAL7 a201122972pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2009003162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirayama, Fumi10aDietary intake of isoflavones and polyunsaturated fatty acids associated with lung function, breathlessness and the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Possible protective effect of traditional Japanese diet  ap. 909-917.  aIncludes references  aThe Japanese diet is high in soy products and fish. A case-control study was conducted in Japan to investigate the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and fatty acids and lung function, breathlessness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 278 referred patients aged 50-75 years with COPD diagnosed within the past 4 years, and 340 community-based controls were assessed for respiratory symptoms and undertook spirometric measurements of lung function. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered face-to-face to obtain information on habitual food consumption. Dietary intakes of isoflavones and fatty acids were derived from the Japanese food composition tables. The COPD patients had significantly lower habitual intakes of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; both omega-3 and omega-6) than control subjects. Lung function measures were found to be positively associated with isoflavones and PUFA intake. Substantial reductions in prevalence of COPD and breathlessness were observed for isoflavones, the respective adjusted odds ratio being 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.19-0.68) and 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.33-1.10) for the highest versus lowest levels of total isoflavone intake. The corresponding tests for linear trend were significant. High intakes of PUFA and omega-6 fatty acids (derived from foods excluding oils and fats as seasonings) also appeared to reduce the risks of COPD and breathlessness symptom, but no evidence of association was found for other types of fatty acids.

The effect of this treatment on the composition and the physicochemical and sensory properties of maple syrups obtained from demineralized maple sap was evaluated. The ED technology was efficient to decrease levels of malic acid and calcium in osmosed maple saps. Effectively, 38% and 24% decreases in malic acid and calcium respectively were reached for ED with a demineralization level of 25% without any changes in the other measured components of osmosed maple saps. The demineralization process had no effect on the yield of syrups produced and on their characteristics: no significant difference was observed during sensory analysis and viscosity. Moreover, the percentage of light transmission of syrups produced from demineralized osmosed saps was higher than for the control. This work suggests that ED could be a potential technology to decrease or avoid sugar sand formation during maple syrup production. 3amaple syrup 3asap 3achemical composition 3afood processing 3aosmotic treatment 3adialysis 3asensory properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3amalic acid 3acalcium 3ayields 3aviscosity 3afood quality 0ademineralization 0asugar sand 0asugar sand formation1 aGaudreau, H.1 aLavigne, D.1 aMartin, N.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 July, v. 87, no. 9 p.1691-1698dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28903Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02448naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002200139245014900161300001600310520141700326650002601743650002601769650001401795650000801809650001301817651002101830653000901851700002101860773008201881852000901963856007901972930003302051945001302084946001302097655001202110IND2036444520221121050210.0931222e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203644452DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.4.8182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzpatrick, S.M.10aFecundity, number of diapause eggs, and egg size of successive generations of the blackheaded fireworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) on cranberries  ap. 818-823.  aThis study was conducted to assess the reproductive potential of first- and second-generation Rhopobota naevana (Hubner) females collected from a commercial cranberry farm and reared on field-collected foliage under controlled conditions. Between 90 and 95% of eggs laid by first-generation females hatched within 2 wk of oviposition, whereas most (80-95%) eggs laid by second-generation females entered diapause. In 1990, when cranberry plants were heavily fertilized with nitrogen, total fecundity of the two generations was similar. In 1991, when a minimal amount of nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the plants, first-generation females were more fecund than second-generation females, and diapause eggs laid by second-generation females were larger than nondiapause eggs laid by first-generation females. Ovarian maturation proceeded more slowly in the second generation than in the first. Duration of pupal stage, adult stage, and emergence period were longer in the second generation than in the first. Male pupae weighed less than female pupae, and males emerged slightly before females. Results suggest that first generation fireworm females allocate resources gathered during larval feeding to production of as many eggs as possible, whereas second-generation females produce fewer, larger eggs. However, second-generation females fed nitrogen-rich foliage may be able to produce more eggs than usual. 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3aRhopobota unipunctana 3afecundity 3aova 3adiapause 3aBritish Columbia 0asize1 aTroubridge, J.T.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.818-823x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.4.8183Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245010700158300001600265520152600281650001601807650002601823650002301849651001201872653002401884653001401908700001701922700001501939773008201954852000902036856007902045930003302124945001302157946001302170655001202183IND2036444320221121050113.0931222e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203644432DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.4.8022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrichilo, P.J.10aSpatial and temporal dynamics of the threecornered alfalfa hopper (Homoptera: Membracidae) on soybeans  ap. 802-809.  aWithin-plant distribution and within-field dispersion of Spissistilus festinus (Say) nymphs on conventionally planted and tilled soybeans, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, were quantified over a 2-yr period at two experimental sites. Within-plant distribution (vertical and horizontal location) was more closely associated with vegetative development in 1986 than in 1987. The mainstem node with the most nymphs, designated the most likely node (MLN), represented the location of 50% or mote of all nymphs through 4 July (V6-V7) and at least 30% through 10 August (Vl3-Vl8). From plant emergence until first bloom (Rl), 100% of the nymphs were found on either the mainstem, mainstem petioles, or the first lateral branch node. However, from Rl until the end of the season, significantly more nymphs were found on mainstem petioles, and twice as many nymphs were associated with lateral branches than with the mainstem. Higher nymphal densities and a greater proportion of infested plants occurred in 1986 than in 1987. Indices of dispersion calculated from individual plant samples suggested greater aggregation of nymphs than did values reported for larger sample units such as the ground cloth. Iterative nonlinear regression of proportion infested plants against mean density allowed estimation of Taylor's coefficients that were used to develop sequential sampling plans appropriate for enumerative and presence-absence methods. Results indicated that nymphs did not reach damaging levels during any of the sampling periods. 3aGlycine max 3aSpissistilus festinus 3apopulation density 3aAlabama 0asequential sampling 0adispersal1 aWilson, L.T.1 aMack, T.P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.802-809x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.4.8023Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01797naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245009800156300001600254520085700270650001801127650002001145650000901165650001701174653001601191700001801207700001701225773008201242852000901324856007901333930003301412945001301445946001301458655001201471IND2036444620221121050228.0931222e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203644462DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.4.8242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavallee, R.10aDevelopment of the white pine weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on cut leaders of white pine  ap. 824-830.  aIn 1989 and 1990, after the egg-laying period of the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi (Peck), infested leaders of white pine, Pinus strobus L., were harvested in a young plantation. To test the influence of bark quality modification on weevil development, leaders were set directly into water or kept dry. The number of insects emerging per leader and the adult mean weight of the weevils were measured for leaders exposed to both treatments. During the second year, the data were also collected on weevil development in the field. Results show that the white pine weevil can complete its development on cut leaders. However, the dry treatment significantly reduced the mean weight and the number of weevils when compared with the wet treatment. The number of insects emerging per leader was less affected by treatment than was the adult mean weight. 3aPinus strobus 3aPissodes strobi 3abark 3ainsect pests 0adevelopment1 aMauffette, Y.1 aAlbert, P.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.824-830x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.4.8243Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02433naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007800164300001800242520129200260650001101552650001401563650001401577650001401591650001801605650000901623650001801632650001001650650001001660650002201670650001001692650000901702653002701711653001201738700002001750773011501770852000901885856008501894930003301979946001102012655001202023IND4441615420221121033917.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9354-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolák, Jakub 10aPatterns of sexual size dimorphism in cattle breeds support Rensch's rule  ap. 1255-1266.  aRensch's rule describes the pattern of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) claiming that in taxa where males are the larger sex, larger species generally exhibit higher male to female body size ratios. Agreement with Rensch's rule is manifested by the slope of the allometric relationship between male and female body size exceeding one. In this paper we have tested the hypothesis that recent rapid evolutionary changes of body size accompanying domestication process and morphological radiation of domestic breeds follow Rensch's rule. We have analyzed literature data on adult body size of males and females in domestic cows, yaks, buffaloes and other bovines (315, 12, 24 and 2 breeds, respectively) and compared it with SSD in 18 wild species/subspecies of the subfamily Bovinae. Male to female body mass ratio in domestic cows (1.48) was fairly comparable to that found in other species of domestic and wild bovines except domestic buffaloes (1.19). In cows we have demonstrated clear positive allometry of male to female body mass ratio (slope 1.21) predicted by Rensch's rule, however, no such clear relationship was found when body mass was replaced by shoulder height. These findings are in agreement with those we have previously reported in other livestock species, goats and sheep. 3aadults 3aallometry 3abody size 3abuffaloes 3acattle breeds 3acows 3adomestication 3agoats 3amales 3asexual dimorphism 3asheep 3ayaks 0aEvolution of body size 0aBovinae1 aFrynta, Daniel 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.1255-1266dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9354-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02440naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011200167300001800279500001500297520132200312650001701634653001401651653001701665653000901682653001001691700002401701700002401725700001801749700001701767700002601784700002401810773009201834852000901926856008501935930003302020946001302053655001202066IND4446082820221121033721.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444608282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10495-010-0533-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogan, Andrew E. 10aIn vitro and in vivo characterisation of a novel c-FLIP-targeted antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide  ap. 1435-1443.  a2019-12-04  aPrevious studies have suggested that the caspase 8 inhibitor FLIP is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic target. In this study, we characterised a novel FLIP-targeted antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (AS PTO). FLIP AS and control PTOs were assessed in vitro in transient transfection experiments and in vivo using xenograft models in Balb/c nude mice. FLIP expression was assessed by QPCR and Western. Apoptosis induction was determined by flow cytometry and Western. Of 5 sequences generated, one potently down-regulated FLIP. AS PTO-mediated down-regulation of FLIP resulted in caspase 8 activation and apoptosis induction in non-small cell lung (NSCLC) cells but not in normal lung cells. Similar results were observed in colorectal and prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the FLIP AS PTO sensitized cancer cells but not normal lung cells to apoptosis induced by rTRAIL. Moreover, the FLIP AS PTO enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Importantly, compared to a control non-targeted PTO, intra-peritoneal delivery of FLIP AS PTO inhibited the growth of NSCLC xenografts and enhanced the in vivo antitumour effects of cisplatin. We have identified a novel FLIP-targeted AS PTO that has in vitro and in vivo activity and which therefore has potential for further pre-clinical development. 3adrug therapy 0aAntisense 0achemotherapy 0aFLIP 0aTRAIL1 aWilson, Timothy R. 1 aFenning, Catherine 1 aCummins, Rob 1 aKay, Elaine 1 aJohnston, Patrick G. 1 aLongley, Daniel B. 0 tApoptosis.g2010 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.1435-1443dBoston : Springer USx1360-81857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10495-010-0533-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02990naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155072000900164100001900173245009400192300001800286500002400304500001500328520127300343650001801616650001901634650001701653650002401670650001101694650001501705650002301720650002301743650003401766650002801800650001901828650002201847650002101869650002101890650001701911650001901928650001401947650001101961653001701972700001301989700001502002700001402017700001602031700001502047700001302062773014602075852000902221856007702230930003302307945002502340946001102365655001202376IND4392382420221121033707.0070614e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439238242DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ305 0aQ505 0aQ115 0aQ2051 aParentelli, C.10aSensory and microbiological quality of shiitake mushrooms in modified-atmosphere packages  ap. 1645-1652.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present work was to study the influence of modified-atmosphere packaging on the microbiological and sensory quality of shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Mushrooms were packaged under atmospheric air (passive modified atmosphere) and an initial gas mixture of 5% O2 and 2.5% CO2 (active modified atmosphere), in bags of two different films: low-density polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). As control, mushrooms were packaged in macroperforated PP films. Bags were stored at 5 °C for 20 days. Package atmosphere composition, mushroom respiration rate, weight loss, microbiological counts and sensory quality were determined during storage. Risk assays were also performed. Under the studied conditions, shiitake mushroom deterioration was not due to microorganism growth, and therefore the shelf-life of this product might be defined by changes in its sensory characteristics. Sensory analysis showed that mushrooms stored under modified atmosphere (active and passive) had a higher deterioration rate than those stored in PP macroperforated films, and lower sensory quality values during the entire storage time. These results suggest that mushroom deterioration was probably due to shiitake mushrooms' sensitivity to high CO2 concentrations. 3afood spoilage 3acarbon dioxide 3aplastic film 3apackaging materials 3aweight 3ashelf life 3asensory properties 3afood contamination 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amicrobial contamination 3afood packaging 3afood microbiology 3acell respiration 3aLentinula edodes 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3amushrooms 3aoxygen 0afood quality1 aAres, G.1 aCorona, M.1 aLareo, C.1 aGambaro, A.1 aSoubes, M.1 aLema, P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 July, v. 87, no. 9 p.1645-1652dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28483Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02610naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245006400171300001800235500002400253500001500277520124400292650001601536650002601552650001801578650001901596650001601615650002301631650001301654650002001667650001401687650000901701650002201710650001901732653002201751653001601773700002201789700001601811773014601827852000901973856007701982930003302059945002502092946001102117655001202128IND4392382820221121022757.0070614e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439238282DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ502 0aQ5041 aOsawa, C.C.10aDetermination of hydroperoxides in oils and fats using kits  ap. 1659-1666.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe primary products of lipid oxidation are peroxides, which are usually quantified using iodometric methods, although interferent action and difficulty in determining the titration end point can lead to imprecise results. PeroxySafe kits determine the peroxide value (PV) on the basis of ferrous oxidation in the presence of xylenol orange in an acidic medium. They provide a fast and simple alternative requiring minimal sample sizes and generating few residues. The present study, correlating statistically the results of these kits with the official iodometric method (AOCS method Cd 8b-90) for the determination of PVs of refined vegetable oils, lard and hidrogenated fats, proved that they can be used satisfactorily. Larger differences were found for PVs of less than 2 meq kg-1 owing to the relatively small titrant volume used in the official method. The low sensitivity of the official iodometric method was not compensated for by the use of a more dilute solution, although it was assumed that the use of a larger volume of titrant would lead to a smaller difference. The results obtained here revealed that the PVs had doubled, with the kits giving up to four times those obtained using the modification of the official method. 3acorrelation 3aquantitative analysis 3avegetable oil 3aperoxide value 3acalibration 3alipid peroxidation 3aaccuracy 3aanalytical kits 3aoxidation 3alard 3ahydrogenated oils 3ahydroperoxides 0aiodometric method 0amethodology1 aGoncalves, L.A.G.1 aRagazzi, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 July, v. 87, no. 9 p.1659-1666dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28703Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245009900157300001600256500001500272520167200287650001601959650002501975650003002000650002702030650002202057651001202079653000902091653001402100700001402114700001602128700001802144773008202162852000902244856007902253930003302332945001302365946001302378655001202391IND2036442820221121022801.0931222e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203644282DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/22.4.7512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neill, K.M.10aAggressive interactions and feeding success of scavenging grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae)  ap. 751-758.  a2019-12-04  aScavenging of arthropod tissue by grasshoppers has been hypothesized to be an important aspect of their diet selection and an important route of pathogen transmission. By placing grasshopper cadavers in the field, we determined that the frequency distributions of nymphs and adults of different species observed scavenging differed from that in the local grasshopper community. Only four of the 10 species present in sweep samples were observed scavenging grasshopper cadavers. The largest species, Melanoplus packardii Scudder tended to be present among scavengers in proportions much greater than its representation in the community. The most abundant species at the two research sites, Melanoplus sanguinipes F. and Aulocara elliotti (Thomas) tended either to be underrepresented in the scavenger samples or to be present in proportions equal to those in the community. Access to the cadavers was strongly related to success in aggressive interactions among grasshoppers congregating at feeding sites. We observed both intra- and interspecific competitive interactions among grasshoppers. Using a logistic regression model that took into account the size differences among contestants and the species involved in each interaction, we found a good match between die observed and expected number of fights won by each species/sex/developmental stage class. M. packardii and M. sanguinipes tended to win fights when they were matched against smaller opponents, but A. elliotti lost more fights than expected from their size alone. Neither sex nor status of the contestants as resident and intruder at a cadaver had a significant effect on the outcome of interactions. 3acannibalism 3aMelanoplus packardii 3ainterspecific competition 3aMelanoplus sanguinipes 3aAulocara elliotti 3aMontana 0asize 0aAcrididae1 aWoods, S.1 aStreett, D.1 aO'Neill, R.P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.751-758x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/22.4.7513Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01719naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008500166300001400251520071600265650001600981650001300997650001301010650001201023650002701035650001101062651002201073653001301095700002201108773011301130852000901243856008501252939003301337946001101370655001201381IND4449671920221121004609.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444967192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-010-0673-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiątek, Marcin.10aSporisorium warambiense sp. nov., a fourth smut fungus on Xerochloa in Australia  ap. 57-60.  aSporisorium warambiense is described and illustrated from the ovaries of Xerochloa laniflora from the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

This review focuses on the hypothesis that high species diversity of freshwater gastropods results, in part, from predators maintaining biodiversity across a range of deep- and shallow-water habitats. Invertebrate predators, such as aquatic insects, and leeches consume soft tissue of pulmonate snails by penetrating shells of various shapes and sizes. Crayfish and large prawns chip around the shell aperture to enter thick shells and crush small shells with their mandibles. Crabs use their strong chelae to crush thin and thick shells. Fishes with pharyngeal teeth are major shell-breaking predators that combine with other vertebrate predators such as turtles and wading birds to increase the diversity of gastropod communities by regulating the abundance of dominant species. Although the generalized diets of most freshwater predators preclude tight co-evolutionary patterns of responses, there are combinations of predators that modify gastropod behavior and shell morphology in aquatic assemblages of different ages and depths. This combination of invertebrate and vertebrate predatory impacts led to competitive advantages among individual gastropods with different adaptations: (1) less vulnerable shell morphologies and sizes; (2) predator-avoidance behaviors; or (3) rapid and widespread dispersal with variable life histories. Some individuals develop thicker and/or narrow-opening shells or shells with spines and ridges. Other thin-shelled species crawl out of the water or burrow to lower their risk to shell-breaking or shell-entering predators. Some alter their age at first reproduction and grow rapidly into a size refuge. Fluctuations in water levels and introductions of non-native species can change competitive dominance relationships among gastropods and result in major losses of native species. Many different gastropod predators control species that are human disease vectors. Most snails and their predators provide other ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. Their persistence and diversity of native species require adaptive management and coordinated study. 3aaquatic insects 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aburrows 3acrabs 3acrayfish 3adiet 3adisease vectors 3aecosystem services 3aenergy transfer 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahuman diseases 3aindigenous species 3ainland waters 3aintroduced species 3alife history 3apredators 3areproduction 3arisk 3ashrimp 3asnails 3aspecies diversity 3ateeth 3aturtles 3awater birds 0aShell morphology 0aDecapod crustaceans 0aDisease ecology 0aAncient lakes 0aWater depth0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Oct., v. 653, no. 1 p.191-215dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0354-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03907naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245019100155300001600346500001500362520244100377650002302818650002402841650002702865650002402892650001102916650002002927650001502947650001702962650002102979650001803000650002203018651001003040653000803050653003503058653000803093653000703101653001103108653000803119700002103127700002203148700002403170700001703194773010703211852000903318856007503327946001103402655001203413IND4440920420221120231831.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444092042DNAL7 a10.1071/SR090892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Subhadip10aChanges in soil organic carbon pool in three long-term fertility experiments with different cropping systems and inorganic and organic soil amendments in the eastern cereal belt of India  ap. 413-420.  a2019-12-04  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a significant proportion of the terrestrial carbon (C) store and has a pivotal role in several physical, chemical, and biological soil processes that contribute to soil productivity and sustainability. Applications of inorganic and organic materials are management options that have the potential to increase SOC in agricultural systems. A study was conducted in 3 long-term fertility experiments (Barrackpur, Mohanpur, and Cuttack) on agricultural soils in the eastern cereal belt of India, to examine the effect of cultivation and the application of inorganic and organic amendments on total soil organic carbon (TOC) and on the proportions of soil C fractions at these sites. A supplementary aim of this study was to determine the suitability of the loss-on-ignition (LOI) method to routinely estimate SOC (Walkley and Black, WB) in this region by determining relationships and conversion factors between the WB and LOI techniques. Soil was sampled at 3 depths (0-0.15, 0.15-0.30, and 0.30-0.45m) from 4 treatments (conventional cultivation, NPK, NPK+FYM, and fallow) of the experimental sites and analysed for TOC and various soil C pools. There were differences in the magnitude of TOC values among the sites. Conventional cultivation had the lowest TOC contents (148t/ha) and NPK+FYM amended soils the largest (207t/ha), with intermediate values in the other treatments. The non-labile or residual SOC fraction (Cfrac₄) constituted the largest percentage of SOC under all treatments and varied from 35-49%. A higher proportion of the labile Cfrac₁ fraction was observed under the fallow, whereas the proportion of Cfrac₄ was significantly larger under NPK+FYM. There was a significant decrease in SOC with increasing soil depth. SOC decreased up to 17% at 0.15-0.30m and declined a further 21% at 0.30-0.45m. The more labile C fractions (Cfrac₁, Cfrac₂, Cfrac₃) dominated in the near surface soil layers, but decreased significantly in the deeper layers to be dominated by Cfrac₄ at 0.30-0.45m depth. We also observed a strong correlation between the WB and LOI methods (calibrated for each soil) irrespective of soil depths and conclude that this might be a suitable method to estimate SOC where other techniques are not available. We conclude that fertiliser application and especially manure application have the potential to significantly increase SOC in agricultural soils. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3afertilizer application 3asoil surface layers 3afallow 3asoil amendments 3asoil depth 3acarbon sinks 3amanure spreading 3aorganic soils 3asoil productivity 3aIndia 0aLOI 0along-term fertility experiment 0aTOC 0aWB 0acarbon 0aSOC1 aWilson, Brian R.1 aMandal, Biswapati1 aGhoshal, Subrata K.1 aGrowns, Ivor0 tSoil research.g2010, v. 48, no. 5 p.413-420dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR090893Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02403naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004400097040001800141100001800159245016900177300001600346500001500362520131200377650001401689650001301703650001601716650001601732650001901748653002501767700002201792700002101814700001601835773009201851852000901943856005701952939003302009946001102042655001202053991610467070742620221120221710.0861114e198608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL860762322DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0872012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, E.H.10aFlowering in lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.): the duration of the photoperiodic inductive phase as a function of accumulated daylength above the critical photoperiod  ap. 235-248.  a2019-12-04  aThe durations from emergence to the appearance of first flower buds and to first open flowers were recorded in three genotypes of lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.) when plants were transferred from short days (either 8 or 10 h) to long days (16 h), or vice versa, after various times from emergence. These results were compared with those of control treatments in which plants remained in either short or long days throughout. Four developmental phases were identified: pre-emergence, pre-inductive, inductive and post-inductive. The first two phases and the last are insensitive to photoperiod, but are probably sensitive to temperature. The duration of the inductive phase, which has to be completed before flowering can occur at the end of the post-inductive phase, can be predicted by assuming that its reciprocal is a linear function of both photoperiod and temperature. It follows that the critical photoperiod decreases with increase in temperature and that the duration of the inductive phase can be calculated from a summation of the amounts by which successive daylengths exceed the critical photoperiod until a value (‘the photoperiodic sum’) characteristic of the genotype is reached. The implications of these findings for predictive field models of time to flowering in lentils are discussed. 3aflowering 3agenotype 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3aLens culinaris 0adevelopmental stages1 aSummerfield, R.J.1 aMuehlbauer, F.J.1 aShort, R.W.0 tAnnals of botany.g1986 Aug., v. 58, no. 2 p.235-248wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087201  a00000000b19861114c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01896naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010600163300001800269520079000287650001401077650001701091650001401108650001401122653002301136653001601159700001901175700002101194700002001215700001601235700001601251773012701267852000901394856008501403930003301488946001301521655001201534IND4445388120221120213429.0101119e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444538812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00044-009-9258-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, Balaji 10aSynthesis and cytotoxicity of 1-phenylethanolamine carboxamide derivatives: effects on the cell cycle  ap. 1141-1152.  aSeven novel analogues of 1-phenylethanolamine carboxamide derivatives, 3a-3g, related to carboxamides isolated from Isodon excisus were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic and apoptosis-induction properties against murine B16 and leukemia L1210 cell lines.

Generally, the amino-containing compounds were slightly more active than their unsubstituted congeners. Also, the indole-containing compounds 3c and 3f gave the strongest cytotoxic activity (IC₅₀ = 25-87 μM) against the growth of L1210 and B16 cancer cells. Compound 3f was subjected to flow cytometry studies and it was found to induce L1210 cells grown in culture to undergo apoptosis. 3aneoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3aapoptosis 3asynthesis 0aPhenylethanolamine 0aCarboxamide1 aForrest, Lori 1 aWeisbruch, Paul 1 aChavda, Sameer 1 aPati, Hari 1 aLee, Moses 0 tMedicinal chemistry research.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 9 p.1141-1152dBoston : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Bostonx1054-25237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00044-009-9258-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02007naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007700163300001600240520100700256650001801263653002201281653002401303653002101327700002401348700002201372700001501394773014601409852000901555856008501564930003301649946001101682655001201693IND4448872620221120213422.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444887262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10064-010-0298-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaina, A.

Existing criteria for a ‘Flyrock Danger Zone' are rigid, such that blasting may not be permitted where there are structures within about 100 m. A statistical approach to the problem is proposed and new concepts of Factor of Safety, Threat Levels and Flyrock Risk have been introduced in order to elucidate risk classes for different geo-mining conditions. The new criteria allow the mining engineer to work out the confidence level of the blasting practice in terms probabilities and risk. The approach is unique, with the emphasis on the categories of blasting and degree of risk that a blasting engineer can afford without sacrificing production and at the same time controlling the travel distance of the flyrock. The proposed dynamic danger zone gives the engineer flexibility to adjust blasting operations to take account of safety requirements and production demands. 3arisk analysis 0aOpencast blasting 0aFlyrock Danger Zone 0aFactor of Safety1 aChakraborty, A.

FINDER2 enrolled Western postmenopausal women recurring or progressing after prior endocrine therapy. Primary endpoint: objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints: time to progression (TTP), clinical benefit rate (CBR), tolerability, and PK parameters. Patients were randomized to receive fulvestrant: 250 mg/month (approved dose [AD]); 250 mg plus loading dose (loading dose [LD]; 500 mg on day 0, 250 mg on days 14, 28, and monthly thereafter); or 500 mg (high dose [HD]; 500 mg/month plus 500 mg on day 14 of Month 1). Treatment continued until disease progression or discontinuation. 144 patients were randomized: fulvestrant AD (n = 47); LD (n = 51); HD (n = 46). ORRs were: 8.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4, 20.4%), 5.9% (1.2, 16.2%), and 15.2% (6.3, 28.9%) in the AD, LD, and HD arms, respectively. CBRs were: 31.9% (95% CI: 19.1, 47.1%), 47.1% (32.9, 61.5%), and 47.8% (32.9, 63.1%) for the AD, LD, and HD arms, respectively. Median TTP (months) was numerically longer for HD (6.0) and LD (6.1) versus AD (3.1). Tolerability was similar across dosing regimens. Steady-state plasma fulvestrant concentrations were predictable and achieved earlier with LD and HD. While there appeared to be a trend toward improved efficacy with HD and LD versus AD, no significant differences could be shown. A parallel study (FINDER1) has reported similar findings in Japanese patients. 0aFulvestrant 0aAdvanced breast cancer 0aFaslodex 0aHigh dose 0aLoading dose 0aEndocrine1 aRolski, Janusz 1 aPapai, Zsuzsanna 1 aMauriac, Louis 1 aCardoso, Fatima 1 aChang, Jose 1 aPanasci, Lawrence 1 aIanuli, Carmen 1 aKahán, Zsuzsanna.1 aFukase, Kenjiro 1 aLindemann, Justin P.

A PFD of 111with R : FR of 0.86 was used in a second experiment. The lower the R : FR or the higher the PFD the higher the mean bulbing ratio and the ratio of bulb plus sheath to leaf blade dry weight and the earlier the bulb swelling. Lower R : FR accelerated scale initiation as did the higher PFD under R : FR 2.88 but not under R : FR 1.41. In high PFD bulb swelling occurred before scale initiation because many sheaths of bladed leaves thickened, but in low PFD and low R : FR bulb swelling and scale initiation were concurrent. In the low PFD a low R : FR increased soluble carbohydrate concentrations in sheaths and scales compared to high R : FR. In high PFD, soluble carbohydrate concentrations did not vary with R : FR and were higher than under low PFD. 3aAllium cepa 3acultivars 3alight intensity 3ared light 3afar-red light 3acarbohydrates 3aplant development 0alight flux 0abulb development1 aBrewster, J.L.1 aMorris, G.E.L.1 aButler, H.A.0 tAnnals of botany.g1986 Aug., v. 58, no. 2 p.197-206wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087198  a00000000b19861114c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001500128245017000143300001500313500002400328520127400352650001001626650001201636650001801648650002701666650002501693650002301718650001001741650002001751650002301771650002501794653002401819653002801843700001501871700002701886700001701913700001701930773008801947852000902035856008102044930003302125945002502158946001102183655001202194IND4392413920221120164940.0070615s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439241392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ2041 aIijima, K.10aIsolation and Identification of Potential Beer-Spoilage Pediococcus inopinatus and Beer-Spoilage Lactobacillus backi Strains Carrying the horA and horC Gene Clusters  ap. 96-101.  aIncludes references  aFour beer-spoilage strains, LA20, LA21, LA22 and LA23, were isolated from brewery environments. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, LA20 was identified as Pediococcus inopinatus and the remaining three were identified as Lactobacillus backi. The homologs of horA and horC, the hop resistance genes originally identified in L. brevis ABBC45, were detected simultaneously in LA22 and LA23, while only a horA homolog and a horC homolog were found in LA20 and LA21 respectively. The 5.6 kb DNA regions containing the horA homolog in LA20 and LA22 were almost 99% identical with the corresponding region of ABBC45. Similarly the 8.2 kb regions containing the horC homolog in LA21 and LA22 were more than 99% identical with that of ABBC45. Interestingly the horA-containing 5.6 kb regions in LA20 and LA22 were found to be completely identical despite the distinct genus status. Coupled with the fact that LA20 and LA22 were isolated from the same sampling site, these results, taken collectively, reinforce our hypothesis that horA and horC genes were acquired by beer-spoilage species through horizontal gene transfer and confirm the usefulness of horA and horC as genetic markers for the species-independent determination of beer-spoilage ability in lactic acid bacteria. 3abeers 3abrewing 3afood spoilage 3aPediococcus inopinatus 3alactic acid bacteria 3astrain differences 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aDNA fingerprinting 3anucleotide sequences 0aLactobacillus backi 0amolecular sequence data1 aSuzuki, K.1 aAsano, Shūzō,d1927-1 aKuriyama, H.1 aKitagawa, Y.0 tJournal of the Institute of Brewing.g2007, v. 113, no. 1 p.96-101x0046-97507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.scientificsocieties.org/jib/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03161naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245012700191300001600318500002400334520165400358650001102012650001002023650001002033650002202043650001402065650001502079650003002094650002502124650001802149650001202167650002302179650003302202650002902235650002202264650001402286650001502300650001402315650002702329651001902356651001902375700001802394700002202412700002002434700002402454773010102478852000902579856005502588655001202643IND4378355320221120164823.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437835532DNAL7 a164996912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02832.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZardus, John D.10aBathymetric and geographic population structure in the pan-Atlantic deep-sea bivalve Deminucula atacellana (Schenck, 1939)  ap. 639-651.  aIncludes references  aThe deep-sea soft-sediment environment hosts a diverse and highly endemic fauna of uncertain origin. We know little about how this fauna evolved because geographic patterns of genetic variation, the essential information for inferring patterns of population differentiation and speciation are poorly understood. Using formalin-fixed specimens from archival collections, we quantify patterns of genetic variation in the protobranch bivalve Deminucula atacellana, a species widespread throughout the Atlantic Ocean at bathyal and abyssal depths. Samples were taken from 18 localities in the North American, West European and Argentine basins. A hypervariable region of mitochondrial 16S rDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced from 130 individuals revealing 21 haplotypes. Except for several important exceptions, haplotypes are unique to each basin. Overall gene diversity is high (h = 0.73) with pronounced population structure ([Phi][subscript ST] = 0.877) and highly significant geographic associations (P < 0.0001). Sequences cluster into four major clades corresponding to differences in geography and depth. Genetic divergence was much greater among populations at different depths within the same basin, than among those at similar depths but separated by thousands of kilometres. Isolation by distance probably explains much of the interbasin variation. Depth-related divergence may reflect historical patterns of colonization or strong environmental selective gradients. Broadly distributed deep-sea organisms can possess highly genetically divergent populations, despite the lack of any morphological divergence. 3abasins 3afauna 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageography 3ahaplotypes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aBivalviaxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHaplotypes 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aAtlantic Ocean1 aEtter, Ron J.1 aChase, Michael R.1 aRex, Michael A.1 aBoyle, Elizabeth E.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.639-651dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02832.x 7aarticle02980naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010400189300001600293500001500309520134400324650002201668650002301690650003601713650006901749650004501818650002801863650003001891650004201921650001101963650003201974651002902006653002702035653001602062653001202078653003102090700001502121700002002136700001802156700002102174773015802195852000902353856009202362930003302454946001102487655001202498IND4443440220221120164859.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444344022DNAL7 a196192632pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0507.2009.01746.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Thean Y.14aThe increased role of non-albicans species in candidaemia: results from a 3-year surveillance study  ap. 515-521.  a2019-12-04  aVarious studies have documented a shift in species distribution in Candida bloodstream infections (BSI), but there are little data from Southeast Asia. This study was performed to determine the species epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida species BSI in Singapore. Candida spp. from BSI were collected from a tertiary and secondary referral hospital, and an obstetrics/paediatric hospital over a 3-year period. The most common isolates were Candida albicans (36%), Candida tropicalis (27%), Candida glabrata (16%) and Candida parapsilosis (16%). Candida parapsilosis and C. albicans were predominant in the paediatric hospital, and C. albicans and C. tropicalis predominant in the other two institutions. Candida tropicalis temporarily replaced C. albicans as the predominant strain from BSI in 2006. Overall, 87.3% of Candida isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, and 10.4% classified as susceptible-dose-dependent. Fluconazole resistance was detected in C. tropicalis (3.6%), C. parapsilosis (2.1%) and C. glabrata (4.0%). Candida albicans is the predominant species isolated from BSI in Singapore. However, non-albicans species accounted for nearly two-thirds of all cases of candidaemia and the relative increase in C. tropicalis infections deserves further investigation. Resistance to fluconazole was uncommon. 3aantifungal agents 3aCandida tropicalis 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCandidaxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aCandidiasisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aDrug Resistance, Fungal 2aFluconazolexpharmacology 2aFungemiaxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 0aSingaporexepidemiology. 0afluconazole resistance 0acandidaemia 0aCandida 0aantifungal drug resistance1 aTan, Ai L.1 aTee, Nancy W.S.1 aNg, Lily S.Y.1 aChee, Chloe W.J.0 tMycoses diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of fungal diseases.g2010 Nov., v. 53, no. 6 p.515-521dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0933-74077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0507.2009.01746.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02213naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008100163300001800244520113700262650001201399650001901411650001901430650001101449650001601460651001001476653002701486653001601513653001201529700001901541700001301560700001501573773011301588852000901701856008501710930003301795946001101828655001201839IND4444053820221120164839.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444405382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0662-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Zhong 10aFurther study on the effect of buffer zone size on regional climate modeling  ap. 1027-1038.  aIn this study, the effect of buffer zone size on the performance of a regional climate model (RCM) was investigated. In contrast to carrying out simulations where the buffer zone expands inward, numerical experiments were performed with the buffer zone expanded outward, which ensured an objective comparison on the effect of buffer zone sizes. Case simulations on the abnormal 1998 East Asian summer monsoon demonstrated that an RCM's performance depended on the outward expansion of the buffer zone. Moreover, a broader buffer zone is able to improve large-scale circulation simulation in the upper troposphere; however, a narrower buffer zone shows better performance in the middle and lower troposphere. Numerical experiments show that the performance of RCMs in simulating the seasonal evolution of rainbands over eastern China is not completely consistent with that of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). A possible reason why the configuration with the buffer zone expanding inward can improve the extension/withdrawal of the summer monsoon and the associated precipitation evolution over eastern China is discussed. 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3amonsoon season 3asummer 3atroposphere 3aChina 0aRegional climate model 0aBuffer zone 0aWavelet1 aWang, Xiaodan 1 aLu, Wei 1 aHu, Yijia 0 tClimate dynamics.g2010 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.1027-1038dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0662-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02977naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001400178245008000192300001400272500002400286520151700310650001001827650001201837650002101849650001701870650002001887650001101907650001001918650001301928650001401941650001301955650002201968650001001990650002502000650002302025653002802048653001902076700001502095700001502110700001602125700001702141700001602158773010202174852000902276856008102285930003302366945002502399946001102424655001202435IND4392413820221120161810.0070615s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439241382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFox, G.P.10aRelationship Between Hardness Genes and Quality in Barley (Hordeum vulgare)  ap. 87-95.  aIncludes references  aBarley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes were sequenced for polymorphism in the hardness genes, these being the three hordoindoline (hin a, hin b1 and hin b2) genes. The variation in haplotype was determined by sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Polymorphism between each gene was then compared to grain hardness (three methods), malt quality characteristics (hot water extract and friability) and cattle feed quality. Two haplotypes were found in a set of forty barley genotypes. For hin a, two alleles were present, namely hin a1 and hin a2. However, there was no specific hin a allele that was associated with grain hardness, malt and feed quality. Barley has two hin b genes, namely hin b1 and hin b2, and the genotypes tested here had one of two alleles for each gene. However, there were no obvious effects on hardness or quality from either of these hin b alleles. Unlike wheat, where a clear relationship has been demonstrated between a number of SNPs in the wheat hardness genes and quality (soft or hard wheat), there was no such relationship for barley. Despite the wide range in hardness, malt and feed quality, there were only two haplotypes for each of the hin a, hin b1 and hin b2 genes and there was no clear relationship between grain hardness, malt or feed quality. The genotypes used in this study demonstrated that there was a low level of polymorphism in hardness genes in current commercial varieties as well as breeding lines and these polymorphisms had no impact on quality. 3abeers 3amalting 3afood composition 3afood quality 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3aseeds 3ahardness 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3aDNA fingerprinting 0amolecular sequence data 0ahordoindolines1 aNguyen, L.1 aBowman, J.1 aPoulsen, D.1 aInkerman, A.1 aHenry, R.J.0 tJournal of the Institute of Brewing.g2007, v. 113, no. 1 p.87-95wJournal:11754x0046-97507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.scientificsocieties.org/jib/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03625naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008400171300001800255520202600273650001202299650001102311650001202322650001102334650001202345650001902357650001902376650002102395650002302416650001202439650002202451650001002473650001102483650001302494650001502507650001602522650001102538650001602549650002102565650001802586650002102604650001202625651001002637653001802647653002702665653000902692700003602701700002502737700001902762773012102781852000902902856009202911930003303003946001103036655001203047IND4441989720221120161903.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444198972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02163.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARCÉ, RAFAEL13aEl Niño Southern Oscillation and climate trends impact reservoir water quality  ap. 2857-2865.  aLow dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom layers of lakes and reservoirs usually indicates low water quality. In lakes, empirical models predicting anoxia are almost entirely based on the decay of plankton biomass, while in reservoirs recent findings suggest a prominent role of streamflow and load of organic carbon. This suggests a potential link between water quality in reservoirs and climate processes affecting streamflow. Here we support this hypothesis presenting evidence that both interannual climate variability and recent climate change, mainly consisting in a significant increase in potential evapotranspiration in the upstream basin, affected the oxygen content in a Mediterranean reservoir (Sau Reservoir, Spain). Using a 44-year monthly record, we found strong and consistent signatures of El Niño Southern Oscillation in the inflow and reservoir oxygen content. Spectral and wavelet techniques showed that the El Niño, streamflow, and reservoir oxygen content series oscillated in common periods, which coincided with the main El Niño variability modes. An empirical model explaining the annual oxygen content in the reservoir suggested that a decreasing streamflow trend reduced the oxygen content of the reservoir by about 20%, counteracting remediation measures implemented at the basin upstream the reservoir. Our results provide the first quantitative evidence of climate change effects on reservoir water quality using long-term instrumental data, and indicate that streamflow should be considered as a key variable in assessing climate change impact on reservoir water quality. These results are especially relevant in regions of the world where reservoirs are abundant and most climate models predict a decrease in runoff during the next decades. Both the expected trends and the sensitivity of reservoir water quality to global interannual climate variability should be considered for a correct management of water resources in the present and to design adaptation policies in the future. 3aEl Nino 3abasins 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adissolved oxygen 3aevapotranspiration 3ahypoxia 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3aoxygen 3aplankton 3aprediction 3aremediation 3arunoff 3astream flow 3awater management 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3awavelet 3aSpain 0aAnoxic Factor 0aclimate change impacts 0aENSO1 aRODRÍGUEZ-ARIAS, MIQUEL ÀNGEL1 aGARCÍA, JUAN CARLOS1 aARMENGOL, JOAN0 tGlobal change biology.g2010 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.2857-2865dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02163.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01909naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009400158300001400252500002400266520075500290650001001045650001201055650001201067650002701079650001801106650002901124650002101153650002101174650002201195700001701217700001601234773010201250852000901352856008101361930003301442945002501475946001101500655001201511IND4392413620221120161922.0070615s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439241362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fermentation performance was followed by monitoring the total sugar content and yeast growth. Volatile compounds were evaluated by analysing higher alcohols, esters and carbonyl compounds at the end of fermentation. Faster fermentation rates and higher yeast counts were observed with the higher pitching levels. Lower amounts of 2- and 3-methyl-1- butanols and higher levels of 2-methyl-1-propanol were found at the increased pitching rates. The concentration of isoamyl acetate was reduced with an increased pitching rate. Higher amounts of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione were obtained at the lower pitching levels. 3abeers 3abrewing 3agravity 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abrewers yeast 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afood composition 3aflavor compounds 3along term effects1 aTanguler, H.1 aCakiroz, H.0 tJournal of the Institute of Brewing.g2007, v. 113, no. 1 p.75-79wJournal:11754x0046-97507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.scientificsocieties.org/jib/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070813b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03774naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245015800206300001200364506007600376520211000452592002802562506003702590650001402627650001502641650001302656650002002669650002402689650001602713650001502729650000902744650002002753650001402773650001502787650001502802650001502817650001702832650001702849650004202866650001602908650000902924650001202933650001202945650001502957650001302972700002602985700002203011773009703033856008103130852000903211655001203220IND60555832020221207073433.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055583202DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0827-02doi7 aPMC50415422pmcid7 a276862512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Stephen10aEvaluation of injectable robenacoxib for the treatment of post-operative pain in cats: results of a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial  ap. 215.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Few pharmaceuticals are registered in cats for the management of post-operative pain and inflammation. The objective of this study was to assess the field efficacy and safety of an injectable formulation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug robenacoxib in cats undergoing surgery. The study was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 349 cats were enrolled and underwent surgery comprising forelimb onychectomy, as an example of orthopedic surgery, plus either ovariohysterectomy or castration. All cats received butorphanol prior to anesthesia and forelimb four-point regional nerve blocks with bupivacaine after induction of general anesthesia. Cats were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of robenacoxib, at a target dosage of 2.0 mg/kg (n = 174), or placebo (n = 175) once prior to surgery and for an additional two days post-operatively. RESULTS: Significantly (P = 0.037) fewer cats administered robenacoxib received additional analgesia rescue therapy (34 of 173, 19.7 %) compared to cats given placebo (73 of 175, 41.7 %). The percentage of treatment success was therefore 80.3 % with robenacoxib and 58.3 % with placebo. Behavior, posture, pain on palpation of the paw and soft tissue surgery sites, and overall pain were significantly (P < 0.05) improved versus placebo at various time points within the first 8 h in cats receiving robenacoxib. The most frequently reported adverse events were incision site infection/dehiscence, bleeding, vomiting, decreased appetite and lethargy. Frequencies of reported adverse clinical signs, hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis variables, and body weight changes were similar between groups. There were no significant changes from baseline with robenacoxib in hepatic, hematological or renal clinical pathology variables. CONCLUSIONS: Robenacoxib by s.c. injection was effective and well tolerated in the control of post-operative pain associated with orthopedic, ovariohysterectomy and castration surgery in cats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3aappetite 3ablood chemistry 3abody weight changes 3abutorphanol 3acastration 3acats 3aclinical trials 3adeclawing 3adehiscence 3ahematology 3ahemorrhage 3ainflammation 3anerve tissue 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aorthopedics 3apain 3aposture 3aspaying 3aurinalysis 3avomiting1 aRoberts, Elizabeth S.1 aKing, Jonathan N.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.215-215dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0827-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300001600305520192800321592002802249650002202277650001702299650001502316650001602331650001402347650001502361650001102376650001302387650001602400651001002416653002102426653001402447653001302461653002202474653000702496653000702503653000902510653001002519700006002529773016002589856008402749852000902833655001202842IND60646280020221119231347.0190606e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064628002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmano, Nobuko10aAccuracy of the visual estimation method as a predictor of food intake in Alzheimer's patients provided with different types of food  ap. 122-128.  aThe visual estimation method is commonly used in hospitals and other care facilities to evaluate food intake through estimation of plate waste. In Japan, no previous studies have investigated the validity and reliability of this method under the routine conditions of a hospital setting. The present study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the visual estimation method, in long-term inpatients with different levels of eating disability caused by Alzheimer's disease. The patients were provided different therapeutic diets presented in various food types.This study was performed between February and April 2013, and 82 patients with Alzheimer's disease were included. Plate waste was evaluated for the 3 main daily meals, for a total of 21 days, 7 consecutive days during each of the 3 months, originating a total of 4851 meals, from which 3984 were included. Plate waste was measured by the nurses through the visual estimation method, and by the hospital's registered dietitians through the actual measurement method. The actual measurement method was first validated to serve as a reference, and the level of agreement between both methods was then determined. The month, time of day, type of food provided, and patients' physical characteristics were considered for analysis.For the 3984 meals included in the analysis, the level of agreement between the measurement methods was 78.4%. Disagreement of measurements consisted of 3.8% of underestimation and 17.8% of overestimation. Cronbach's α (0.60, P < 0.001) indicated that the reliability of the visual estimation method was within the acceptable range.The visual estimation method was found to be a valid and reliable method for estimating food intake in patients with different levels of eating impairment. The successful implementation and use of the method depends upon adequate training and motivation of the nurses and care staff involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3adiet therapy 3adietitians 3afood intake 3ahospitals 3amotivation 3anurses 3apatients 3aplate waste 3aJapan 0aTherapeutic diet 0aFood type 0aValidity 0aVisual estimation 0aAD 0aBI 0aMMSE 0aMNA®1 aNakamura, Tomiyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4069-97790 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2018 Feb., v. 23 p.122-128dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245012200184300001600306520135800322592002801680650002501708650001001733650001201743650001201755650001401767650003101781650001601812650003001828650001901858650001401877650001201891650001201903700002001915700001901935700002501954773008201979856004802061852000902109655001202118IND50073168020221119065121.0140219e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007316802DNAL7 a243666832pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-013-2010-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Seiji10aSpatial distribution of the RABBIT EARS protein and effects of its ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers  ap. 707-715.  aIn many flowering plants, flowers consist of two peripheral organs, sepals and petals, occurring in outer two whorls, and two inner reproductive organs, stamens and carpels. These organs are arranged in a concentric pattern in a floral meristem, and the organ identity is established by the combined action of floral homeotic genes expressed along the whorls. Floral organ primordia arise at fixed positions in the floral meristem within each whorl. The RABBIT EARS (RBE) gene is transcribed in the petal precursor cells and primordia, and regulates petal initiation and early growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. We investigated the spatial and temporal expression pattern of a RBE protein fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Expression of the GFP:RBE fusion gene under the RBE cis-regulatory genomic fragment rescues the rbe petal defects, indicating that the fusion protein is functional. The GFP signal is located to the cells where RBE is transcribed, suggesting that RBE function is cell-autonomous. Ectopic expression of GFP:RBE under the APETALA1 promoter causes the homeotic conversion of floral organs, resulting in sterile flowers. In these plants, the class B homeotic genes APETALA3 and PISTILLATA are down-regulated, suggesting that the restriction of the RBE expression to the petal precursor cells is crucial for flower development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acalyx 3acarpels 3acorolla 3aflowering 3agene expression regulation 3agene fusion 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahomeotic genes 3ameristems 3arabbits 3astamens1 aNoguchi, Mariko1 aHamamura, Yuki1 aHigashiyama, Tetsuya0 tPlanta.g2014 Mar., v. 239, no. 3 p.707-715dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-013-2010-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012000181300001600301520143300317592002801750650001301778650001201791650002601803650002301829650002601852650002201878650001301900650001501913650002701928650002401955650001101979650001201990650003802002650002302040650002502063650002302088650002002111650002202131650002502153650001302178650002702191651001002218700002302228700001902251700001602270773010202286856004802388852000902436655001202445IND4470687320221117233909.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447068732DNAL7 a223831572pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-012-0482-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzuno, Ayako10aGenetic variation and structure of the endangered Lady Fern Athyrium viridescentipes based on ubiquitous genotyping  ap. 613-618.  aTo clarify the genetic status and provide effective information for the conservation of Athyrium viridescentipes, a critically endangered fern species with only 103 individuals remaining in the wild, we conducted ubiquitous genotyping to determine the genotypes of all remnant individuals of the target species. We analyzed the genetic variation of the 103 known individuals in four populations by using 13 microsatellite loci. The genotypes of single spores from a sporophytic individual were also determined in order to reveal the breeding system of this species. The level of allelic variation in A. viridescentipes was significantly lower than that of closely related Athyrium species. The genetic composition of the four populations was rather similar. Sixty-nine individuals (67%) possessed an identical pattern in the allele combinations at 13 microsatellite loci. The mean pairwise F ST among four populations was 0.018. The segregated pattern of alleles, determined by single-spore genotyping, revealed that allelic recombination occurs through meiosis. The results indicate that this species contains a low level of genetic variation, has low population differentiation, and maintains populations by sexual reproduction. These findings could lead to more effective conservation programs, the selection of the most appropriate individuals for ex situ conservation efforts, and separate management of extant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthyrium 3aalleles 3aconservation programs 3aendangered species 3aferns and fern allies 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asexual reproduction 3aspores 2aAlleles 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEndangered Species 2aFernsxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 0aJapan1 aTakamiya, Masayuki1 aKaneko, Shingo1 aIsagi, Yuji0 tJournal of plant research.g2012 Sept., v. 125, no. 5 p.613-618dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-012-0482-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01299naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008000156300002000236520023400256592002800490650001700518650003100535650001800566650001700584700001900601700001400620700001700634700001900651700001500670700001500685700001400700700001600714773012400730856007400854852000900928655001200937IND60664487420221119061015.0190912e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448742DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40995c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Duyang10aUltrasmall paramagnetic near infrared quantum dots as dual modal nanoprobes  ap. 21247-21250.  aGadolinium-functionalized CdHgTe–ZnS core–shell quantum dots with ultrasmall particle size and tunable near-infrared emission were synthesized as a dual-modal nanoprobe for in vivo fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aparticle size 3aquantum dots1 aZhang, Pengfei1 aJia, Jing1 aLi, Mingxing1 aSheng, Zonghai1 aHu, Dehong1 aGong, Ping1 aWan, Qian1 aCai, Lintao0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 21, v. 3, no. 44 p.21247-21250dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40995c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300001800277520123100295592002801526650002401554650001401578650001801592650000901610650001501619650001301634650001401647700001701661700001901678700001201697700001401709700001801723700002001741700001401761700002001775773014201795856007401937852000902011655001202020IND60642792620221122150234.0190508e20171129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064279262DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02487h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaoyu10aControlled synthesis and transformation of nano-hydroxyapatite with tailored morphologies for biomedical applications  ap. 9148-9156.  aHydroxyapatites (HAps) with nano-sized structures are promising materials in various biomedical areas, but the synthesis of high quality particles is still challenged by the insufficient precision of size and morphology, as well as the presence of severe agglomeration. An inadequate knowledge of the early nucleation, growth and transformation might limit our exploration and application of HAp. Here, we report a novel oil/water microemulsion–hydrothermal hybrid strategy for the preparation of highly dispersive HAps with tailored morphologies and controlled size. Through the synergetic effect of the oleic acid and microemulsion system, a well-dispersed HAp nucleus was first generated at 2 h. By tuning the ensuing hydrothermal conditions from room temperature to 140 °C, the nucleus would grow from spherical to needle-like nanoparticles. The size of the particles could be regulated by the alteration of the hydrothermal temperature. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated the complete evolution of HAp growth and transformation at a critical temperature of 90 °C by quenching the reaction at various intervals. The obtained particles were explored as potential cellular delivery carriers and polymer fillers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aemulsions 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apolymers 3asynergism1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Chengwei1 aSun, Yi1 aMa, Yifan1 aDong, Xiuling1 aQian, Jiangchao1 aYuanyuan,1 aLiu, Changsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Nov. 29, v. 5, no. 46 p.9148-9156dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02487h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245016800171300001600339520207900355592002802434650001102462650001002473650001902483650001302502650002302515650000902538650001402547650002502561650001202586650001002598650001602608650002002624650000902644650002302653650002602676650001302702650001402715650001902729650001902748650001902767650000902786650000902795651001102804653002202815653001102837653001902848653000902867653001002876653001002886700001502896700002502911700001502936700001802951700005802969773010603027856008703133852000903220655001203229IND60545641120221123043717.0160902e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054564112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickinson, N.10aEvaluating environmental and social influences on iron and zinc status of pregnant subsistence farmers in two geographically contrasting regions of Southern Malawi  ap. 199-210.  aMicronutrient deficiency affects over 4.5 billion people worldwide, the majority in developing countries. Deficiencies of iron (and associated anaemia) and zinc in pregnancy are associated with complications, maternal and neonatal mortality, and developmental disorders in the foetus and growing child. We report the results of pilot study which used an interdisciplinary approach to explore environmental and sociocultural factors influencing the micronutrient status in the soil–plant–human transfer for pregnant subsistence farmers in two geographically contrasting regions of Southern Malawi. It evaluated micronutrient status in soil and the staple crop and explored the context for their transfer to pregnant women. Scientific and social science methods were used to collect data, following full sensitisation of the communities. A total of 99 participants were recruited from Chiradzulu (plateau) and Chikwawa (floodplain). Soil, maize and blood samples were collected, along with food frequency and health behaviour questionnaires and anthropological observation.Statistical analysis revealed that soil iron was significantly higher in Chiradzulu than in Chikwawa; total iron concentration is not deemed to be deficient in either area. Soil zinc was not significantly different between areas. Maize concentrations of iron and zinc were not significantly different between areas, and were not deficient relative to improved cultivars. Blood iron deficiency and associated anaemia were problematic in both areas, but more so in Chikwawa than in Chiradzulu, and zinc deficiency was similar in both areas. The study has identified a significant difference in the blood iron status of the participants of the two communities, and has shown that this difference is not accounted for by the staple crop maize. Socio-geographical factors appear to play a significant role in the micronutrient health of the populations. The findings lend support to multifaceted community intervention studies which educate communities on strategies to tackle micronutrient deficiencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achildren 3acommunity programs 3acorn 3acultivars 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3afetus 3afloodplains 3ahealth behavior 3airon 3aneonatal mortality 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplateaus 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3asocial factors 3asoil 3azinc 3aMalawi 0aInterdisciplinary 0aMalawi 0aMicronutrients 0aSoil 0aMaize 0aBlood1 aRankin, J.1 aPollard, M.q(Mary),1 aMaleta, K.1 aRobertson, C.1 aHursthouse, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3690-29570 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 500-501 p.199-210dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014500162300001600307520135500323592002801678650002801706650002601734650002301760650001301783650001201796650001501808650001401823650001301837650002501850650001401875650001501889650001601904650001401920650000901934650001901943650001301962651001001975700003001985700001602015700001702031700001702048700001802065773011702083856008102200852000902281655001202290IND60480279820221116230203.0160126e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048027982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0167-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lili10aBiomass production, nutrient cycling and distribution in age-sequence Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolate) plantations in subtropical China  ap. 357-368.  aBiomass production and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) accumulation, distribution and cycling were quantified in young, mature and over-mature (10-, 22-, and 34-year old) Chinese fir [Cunninghamia lanceolate (Lamb.) Hook] plantations in southern China. Total stand biomass of young, mature and over-mature stands was 38, 104 and 138 t ha⁻¹ respectively. Biomass production increased significantly with age. Stem wood represented the highest percentage of stand biomass, accounting for 41, 55 and 63 % in the young, mature and over-mature plantations respectively. Nutrients concentration was highest in live needles and branches, and lowest in stem wood. The plantations accumulated more N, followed by K, Ca, Mg, and P. Nutrient return amount, nutrient utilization efficiency, nutrient turnover time, the ratio of nutrient return and uptake increased with stand age, which implies that young Chinese fir deplete soil nutrients to maintain growth, and efficiently utilize nutrients to decrease dependence on soil nutrients as they age. Harvesting young Chinese fir plantations would therefore lead to high nutrient loss, but prolonging the rotation length could improve soil recovery, and help sustain productivity in the long-term. Improved nutrient return through litterfall as stands get older may also be beneficial to nutrient pool recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass production 3abranches 3acalcium 3aharvesting 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrient utilization 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3apotassium 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3astemwood 3aChina1 aShalom, Addo-Danso Daniel1 aWu, Pengfei1 aHe, Zongming1 aLiu, Chunhua1 aMa, Xiangqing0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.357-368dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0167-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001600287520095900303592002801262650001301290650001301303650000901316650002401325650001901349650001301368700001601381700001801397700001701415773008701432856008501519852000901604655001201613IND60565705220221117171854.0181002e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056570522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.03.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiuyun10aRole of embedded 3d transition metal atoms on the electronic and magnetic properties of defective bilayer graphene  ap. 376-383.  aThe effect of transition metal atoms on the electronic and magnetic properties of defective bilayer graphene (TM@dBLGs, TM = Ti-Fe) have been systematically studied by first principles calculations. Mixed covalent and ionic bonding is demonstrated between transition metal atoms and on-site graphene layers. Except Ti and Fe, all the TM@dBLG systems anchored by V, Cr and Fe atoms are found to be robust ferromagnetic. Different from the metallic pristine BLG, a number of TM@dBLGs are transformed to be semiconductors, of which, the band gaps of GTiG_SV_H, GVG_SV_H and G(N)FeG_SV are about 361 meV, 219 meV and 147 meV, respectively. In comparison, the B/N doped TM@dBLGs exhibit distinct electronic and magnetic properties due to the charge redistribution. Our findings propose an effective route to manipulate the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene, which allows its potential application in modern spintronic and electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3agraphene 3airon 3amagnetic properties 3asemiconductors 3avanadium1 aXu, Wenxian1 aDai, Jianpeng1 aLiu, Yongjun0 tCarbon.g2017 July, v. 118 p.376-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.03.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014800172300001800320520160900338592002801947650001001975650001101985650001301996650001302009650000902022650001202031650001102043650001202054650001602066650002302082651001202105700002202117700002602139773013102165856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60081804920221121032941.0220609e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008180492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-014-1087-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammouda, Abdessalem10aPatterns of within-clutch variation in yolk lutein in the Yellow-legged Gull Larus michahellis: the effects of egg laying order and laying date  ap. 1009-1015.  aIn gull species, the level of carotenoids in egg yolks is known to decrease along the egg laying sequence. However, the extent of this laying order effect is expected to vary among clutches according to laying date, due to possible differences between early-nesting and late-nesting females with regards to their ability to control the transfer of maternal resources to the eggs. A laying date effect could also result from a seasonal decline in the availability of dietary carotenoids. In this study, we collected data from Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in southern Tunisia to investigate how nesting date interacts with egg-laying order in shaping patterns of within-clutch variation in yolk lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in this species. In particular, we examined (1) whether yolk lutein concentration declined along the laying sequence and (2) whether the extent of the decline differed among clutches according to laying date. Our results show that yolk lutein decreased along the laying sequence at the clutch level. More interestingly, they also show that the decrease in yolk lutein levels along the laying sequence was more pronounced in late clutches than in early clutches, although lutein levels in adult plasma did not vary according to laying date. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the Yellow-legged Gull employs the brood reduction strategy and that said strategy is more drastically applied in late clutches than in early clutches. The relevance of female age and seasonal variation in chick-rearing conditions for these findings is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus 3aadults 3abreeding 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afemales 3alutein 3anesting 3aoviposition 3aseasonal variation 3aTunisia1 aSelmi, Slaheddine1 aPearce-Duvet, Jessica0 tJournal of ornithology.g2014 Oct., v. 155, no. 4 p.1009-1015dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-014-1087-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008900157300001800246520113300264592002801397650001801425650001601443650001501459650001501474650001301489650001101502650001501513700001801528700002601546700002501572700001601597700002101613773014101634856007401775852000901849655001201858IND60642792720221122150307.0190508e20171206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064279272DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02492d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNissan, Ifat10aTopographical impact of silver nanolines on the morphology of neuronal SH-SY5Y Cells  ap. 9346-9353.  aAn extracellular environment is critical in neuronal development and growth. Changes in neuronal morphology, neuron adhesion, and even the rate of neurite formation, can be modified by both the chemical and physical properties of interfacing substrates. Topography has a major impact on neuronal growth. Neuronal behavior and morphology are affected by the size, shape and pattern of the topographic elements. Combining topography with active materials may lead to enhanced influence. This paper demonstrates the effects of silver nanolines (AgNLs) on the growth pattern of SH-SY5Y cells. The morphology of the cells atop the nanotopographical substrates is measured, revealing a significant promoting effect. The number of neurites initiating from the soma is larger in SH-SY5Y cells plated on AgNLs than in control samples. The cells also exhibit an increase in neurite branching points towards more complex structures. These results indicate that substrates decorated with nanotopography affect cellular growth in a way that may be useful for enhanced regeneration, opening new possibilities for electrode and implant design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3acell growth 3aelectrodes 3ananosilver 3aneurites 3asilver 3atopography1 aSchori, Hadas1 aKumar, Vijay Bhooshan1 aPassig, Merav Antman1 aShefi, Orit1 aGedanken, Aharon0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Dec. 6, v. 5, no. 47 p.9346-9353dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02492d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014100176520144500317592002801762650001301790650001501803650001601818650001701834650001401851650001801865650001901883650001301902650001501915650000701930650001801937650001301955650001401968650001101982650001801993650001602011650001602027653001802043653001502061653002502076653001802101653002602119653002402145700002502169700006502194700006302259773010602322856008702428852000902515655001202524IND60710834120221119223227.0210926e20201205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071083412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlavova, Tatiana G.10aEncapsulation of fragrances and oils by core-shell structures from silica nanoparticles, surfactant and polymer: Effect of particle size  aOils and fragrances can be encapsulated by using composite shells of silica nanoparticles, polymer and surfactant (potassium oleate). The template for the creation of the core-shell structure is a particle stabilized (Pickering) emulsion. The surfactant adsorbs on the nanoparticles and leads to their reversible hydrophobization and adsorption on the oil/water interface. The outer layer of the self-assembled shell represents a layer from crosslinked polymer. The procedure of encapsulation is simple and includes single homogenization by ultrasound of the formulation that contains all ingredients together. The produced capsules have mean radius in the range between 2 and 11 microns. By order of magnitude and trend, the capsule size follows the law of limited coalescence with respect to the dependence on nanoparticle size and concentration. The composite structure of the shells leads also to dependence on the concentrations of added polymer and surfactant. The produced microcapsules are stable when rinsed with pure water of pH in the range 3 – 10. However, if dispersed in water of pH > 11, the microcapsules are destabilized and release their cargo, i.e., they are pH-responsive. Various fragrances and oils, such as limonene, citronellol, benzyl acetate, and sunflower seed oil were encapsulated. The developed methodology could find applications in any field, in which reversible encapsulation of oily substances is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3acitronellol 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3ahomogenization 3alimonene 3aoleic acid 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3apotassium 3asilica 3asunflower oil 3asurfactants 3aultrasonics 0aEncapsulation 0aFragrances 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aColloidosomes 0aCore-shell structures 0aPickering emulsions1 aRadulova, Gergana M.1 aKralchevsky, Peter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3942-14111 aDanov, Krassimir D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9563-09740 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Dec. 05, v. 606 p.125558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1255583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01360naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300001800264520035100282592002800633650001700661650001900678650001400697650001800711650001100729700001500740700001300755700001600768700001600784700001800800773012100818856007400939852000901013655001201022IND60664487620221119060929.0190912e20131213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448762DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40998h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yanjie10aHighly compressible magnetic liquid marbles assembled from hydrophobic magnetic chain-like nanoparticles  ap. 3162-3164.  aWe demonstrated a large-scale, low-cost and rapid flame synthesis of hydrophobic magnetic chain-like nanoparticles (HMCNPs) composed of core–shell Fe₂O₃@SiO₂ nanoparticles.

Stream fishes in metapopulations are particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation because persistence depends on dispersal and colonization of new habitat but dispersal is constrained to stream networks. Great Plains streams are increasingly fragmented by water diversion and climate change, threatening connectivity of fish populations in this ecosystem. We used seven microsatellite loci to describe population and landscape genetic patterns across 614 individuals from 12 remaining populations of Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini) in Colorado, a candidate species for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We found small effective population sizes, low levels of genetic diversity within populations, and high levels of genetic structure, especially among basins. Both at- and between-site landscape features were associated with genetic diversity and connectivity, respectively. Available stream habitat and amount of continuous wetted area were positively associated with genetic diversity within a site, while stream distance and intermittency were the best predictors of genetic divergence among sites. We found little genetic contribution from historic supplementation efforts, and we provide a set of management recommendations for this species that incorporate a conservation genetics perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEtheostoma 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3afish 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 3astreams 3aArkansas 3aColorado 3aGreat Plains region1 aCrockett, H.1 aFunk, W.

Species at the bottom of trophic cascades (host plants) are expected to be less negatively affected than higher trophic levels, such as herbivores and their parasitoids or predators. Here we test this hypothesis regarding the effects of habitat area and connectivity in a trophic system with three levels: first with the population size of the larval food plant Hippocrepis comosa, next with the population density of the monophagous butterfly species Polyommatus coridon and finally with its larval parasitism rate. Our results show no evidence for negative effects of habitat fragmentation on the food plant or on parasitism rates, but population density of adult P. coridon was reduced with decreasing connectivity. We conclude that the highly specialized butterfly species is more affected by habitat fragmentation than its larval food plant because of its higher trophic position. However, the butterfly host species was also more affected than its parasitoids, presumably because of lower resource specialization of local parasitoids which also frequently occur in alternative hosts. Therefore, conservation efforts should focus first on the most specialized species of interaction networks and second on higher trophic levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippocrepis 3aadults 3abutterflies 3afood plants 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apopulation density 3apopulation size1 aKrauss, Jochen1 avan Achterberg, Cornelis1 aSteffan-Dewenter, Ingolf0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2011 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.707-714dSpringer-Verlagx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9370-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013800171300001600309520158300325592002801908650003001936650001901966650002801985650001502013650002302028650001302051650001102064650001602075650000902091653001102100653003002111653000902141653001302150653001602163653000902179653002302188700002302211773013002234856005102364852000902415655001202424IND50075795120221119083702.0140410e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007579512DNAL7 a10.1080/10236244.2011.6176062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbieri, Edison14aThe effects of different temperature and salinity levels on the acute toxicity of zinc in the Pink Shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis)  ap. 251-263.  aThe purpose of this study was to measure the acute toxicity of zinc (Zn) on Farfantepenaeus paulensis at different salinities and temperatures by monitoring oxygen consumption. This aspect of the effect of zinc has not been studied in this important commercial species before. First, we examined the acute toxicity of zinc in F. paulensis at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h medium lethal concentration (LC₅₀). One hundred and fifty shrimp were employed for the routine metabolism measurement utilizing sealed respirometers. Ten shrimp were subjected to oxygen consumption measurements in one of the four concentrations of zinc (control, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg L⁻¹) at three salinities (36, 20, and 5) and three temperatures (25°C, 20°C, and 15°C). Zinc was significantly more toxic at a salinity of 5 than at 20 or 36. The oxygen consumption was estimated through experiments performed on each of the 12 possible combinations of three temperatures (25°C, 20°C, and 15°C) and three salinities (36, 20, and 5). The shrimp showed a significant reduction in oxygen consumption at a salinity of 5. The results show that the oxygen consumption decreases with respect to the zinc concentration in all temperatures studied. At the highest zinc concentration employed (3.0 mg L⁻¹), the salinity 5 and the temperature at 25°C, oxygen consumption decreases 60.92% in relation to the control. The results show that zinc is more toxic to F. paulensis at lower salinities. The significance of the findings for the biology of the species close to sources of zinc is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFarfantepenaeus paulensis 3aacute toxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3amonitoring 3aoxygen consumption 3asalinity 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3azinc 0ashrimp 0aFarfantepenaeus paulensis 0azinc 0asalinity 0atemperature 0aLC50 0aoxygen consumption1 aDoi, Sônia Assami0 tMarine and freshwater behaviour and physiology.g2011 July 1, v. 44, no. 4 p.251-263dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-03627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236244.2011.617606  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300001800269520197400287592002802261650001602289650002102305650002102326650002002347650001502367650001302382650002602395650001802421650001902439650001302458650002602471650000902497650001102506650001702517650002302534650001502557650000902572650001302581700002302594700005202617700002302669700001802692700001802710700002202728700003502750773014102785856007402926852000903000655001203009IND60642793020221122150259.0190508e20171206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064279302DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02515g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbina, Srinivas10aHyperbranched polyglycerols: recent advances in synthesis, biocompatibility and biomedical applications  ap. 9249-9277.  aIn the pursuit of dendrimer alternatives, hyperbranched polymers have found increasing interest from academia and industry in a broad range of fields due to their topological and synthetic advantages. Hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG), as the name implies, is a hyperbranched polymer with about 50–65% dendrimeric structure. Due to its ease in synthesis, globular nature, versatility in terms of functionalization, and superb biocompatibility profiles HPG provides a promising class of materials suitable for numerous applications in nanomedicine and biomedical technologies. The structural features of HPG can be easily tailored by adopting different synthetic methodologies. In this review, we briefly explore the synthesis of HPGs starting from the traditional Lewis acid based approaches to recent advances including the development of high MW HPGs, biodegradable HPGs, co-block HPGs and sustainable or ‘green’ HPG synthesis. The robust history of HPG biocompatibility is extensively reviewed giving examples of both in vitro and in vivo models. In particular, HPG showed very minimal polymer accumulation in vital organs after intravenous injection compared to other polymers widely used for various biomedical applications. HPG is well tolerated in mice and rats, and has been found to be non-immunogenic to date. Due to its demonstrated safety profile and multifunctionality, HPG has been extensively studied for different biomedical applications including as macromolecular therapeutics, multivalent inhibitors/scavengers, in controlled drug delivery systems, in organ preservation, dialysis and cell surface engineering, as imaging agents and theranostics, in the development of anti-fouling surfaces and proteomics reagents. We highlight these applications along with its advantages. Finally, we conclude by providing a future prospective of HPG as one of the promising PEG alternatives with a great potential to enter clinical trials in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3aclinical trials 3adendrimers 3adialysis 3adrug delivery systems 3aillicit drugs 3aimage analysis 3aindustry 3aintravenous injection 3amice 3amodels 3ananomedicine 3aprecision medicine 3aproteomics 3arats 3atopology1 aVappala, Sreeparna1 aKumarAuthors are equally contributed., Prashant1 aSiren, Erika M.

To date, no competitive spectrophotometric or electrochemical immunoassays have yet been successfully applied to gluten detection in processed food samples, which require the use of complex prolamin extraction solutions containing additives with denaturing, reducing and disaggregating functions. Thus, in this work, great effort was put into the optimization and performance evaluation of the immunosensor in terms of suitability as a screening tool for analysis of cereal-based food samples. For this purpose, aqueous ethanol or complex extraction mixtures, as the patented Cocktail Solution®, were proved effective in the extraction of gliadin. Good sensitivity was achieved after optimization of the immunocompetitive assay, giving limit of detection and limit of quantitation of 8 and 22 ng/ml of gliadin, respectively, for ethanol extracts. The immunosensor was proved to be suitable also for samples extracted with Cocktail Solution® after a proper dilution. Analysis of real samples of different flours proved the suitability of the immunosensing device as a powerful tool for safety assessment of raw materials used for the formulation of dietary products for celiac disease patients. This immunosensor combines good analytical performance using a very simplified set-up protocol with suitability for rapid screening analysis performed using inexpensive and portable instrumentation.

Combination of: (i) a fermentation liquid obtained by dilution of this bacterial culture with pure water to a final concentration of 20%; (ii) a temperature of 37°C; and (iii) a fermentation time of 4 days resulted in optimal fermentation of corn flour. The water‐retention capacity of the fermented corn flour was approximately 75% of unfermented corn flour. Standardized corn dough was prepared using fermented and unfermented corn flour, and the viscidity and elasticity of the fermented corn dough were found to be approximately three times those of the unfermented corn dough. Both maximum tensile resistance and maximum tensile ratio of fermented corn dough were more than two times greater than unfermented corn dough. Analysis of the starch molecules in fermented and unfermented corn flour showed that the fermented corn starch particles were generally smaller and were irregularly shaped with many more water‐permeable holes. The fermented corn starch had a lower molecular weight on average and a higher amount of amylose than unfermented corn starch and was partially hydrolyzed, with amylopectin as the major substrate. There was no noticeable difference between the fermented and unfermented corn starch regarding crystal structure, but the degree of crystallinity of the fermented corn starch was much lower than that of unfermented corn starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acorn 3acorn flour 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3adough 3ajuices 3alactic fermentation 3amicrobial culture 3amolecular weight 3apH 3atemperature1 aHui, Xia‐Guang1 aQiang, Yang1 aHua, Li‐Xin0 tStärke =.g2017 May, v. 69, no. 5-6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2016002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245015900176300001600335520111400351592002801465650002201493650001501515650002001530650002601550650002601576650002301602650001901625650002501644650002201669650001601691650000901707700002201716700002601738700002001764700002901784773011701813856008101930852000902011655001202020IND60480280320221119170218.0160126e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048028032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0135-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafezi, Seyedeh Masoumeh10aUse of amino silane coupling agent to improve physical and mechanical properties of UF-bonded wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) poplar wood particleboard  ap. 427-431.  aWe evaluated the potential use of amino silane coupling agent (SiNH) to improve physical and mechanical properties of UF-bonded wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) poplar wood particleboard. We examined the effects of varied content of silane coupling agent content and ratios of straw to poplar wood particles on particleboard properties. The ratios of straw to poplar wood particles were 100:0, 85:15, 70:30 and 55:45. Silane coupling agent content was tested at three levels, 0, 5 and 10 %. The experimental panels were tested for their mechanical strength, including modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bonding (IB) and physical properties according to procedures specified in DIN 68763 (Chipboard for special purposes in building construction: concepts, requirements, testing, 1982–03, 1982). All board properties were improved by the addition of silane coupling agent. The use of poplar wood particles had a positive effect on the mechanical properties of wheat straw particleboard but had a negative effect on physical properties (thickness swelling and water absorption).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3abuilding construction 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3aparticleboards 3astrength (mechanics) 3aurea formaldehyde 3awheat straw 3awood1 aEnayati, Aliakbar1 aHosseini, Kazem Doost1 aTarmian, Asghar1 aMirshokraii, Sayed Ahmad0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.427-431dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0135-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001600301520126800317592002801585650001601613650002301629650001501652650001401667650001901681650002201700650001301722650001901735650002701754700002201781700002301803773009601826856008101922852000902003655001202012IND60080135520221121033907.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008013552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-014-0580-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaarinen, Emily V.10aLocal extinction event despite high levels of gene flow and genetic diversity in the federally-endangered Miami blue butterfly  ap. 811-821.  aA certain level of genetic diversity and connectivity between populations is necessary to allow small populations to persist over time. In this study, we investigate the last two populations of the highly endangered Miami blue butterfly, one of which was extirpated in 2010. We investigate whether an erosion of genetic diversity was the cause for the extirpation of the Bahia Honda State Park (BHSP) population. As the level of existing molecular diversity within and gene flow between the last two populations of the endangered Miami blue butterfly was unknown, we present data from twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci as an assessment. We show that greater genetic diversity (allelic richness and observed heterozygosity) than originally predicted existed in the BHSP population prior to its extirpation and values were even greater in the Key West National Wildlife Refuge population. Allelic frequencies show short-range gene flow between neighboring habitat patches and underline the importance of habitat connectivity. It does not appear that loss of genetic diversity was the cause for the loss of the BHSP population. Greater consideration of habitat connectivity should be considered for short and long-term conservation and management of this taxon.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutterflies 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aDaniels, Jaret C.1 aMaruniak, James E.0 tConservation genetics.g2014 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.811-821dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-014-0580-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245015800156300001600314500001900330520116300349592002801512650001101540650001101551650002801562650002101590650001701611650001201628700001901640700001901659700001801678700001401696700001601710700005501726700005501781700005601836700005501892700005201947700005501999773014402054856007602198852000902274655001202283IND60724090420221120151656.0210120e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072409042DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c101212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Jing10aMicromechanism in All-Solid-State Alloy-Metal Batteries: Regulating Homogeneous Lithium Precipitation and Flexible Solid Electrolyte Interphase Evolution  ap. 839-848.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSulfide-based solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) matched with alloy anodes are considered as promising candidates for application in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) to overcome the bottlenecks of the lithium (Li) anode. However, an understanding of the dynamic electrochemical processes on alloy anode in SSE is still elusive. Herein, in situ atomic force microscopy gives insights into the block-formation and stack-accumulation behaviors of Li precipitation on an Li electrode, uncovering the morphological evolution of nanoscale Li deposition/dissolution in ASSBs. Furthermore, two-dimensional Li–indium (In) alloy lamellae and the homogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) shell on the In electrode reveal the precipitation mechanism microscopically regulated by the alloy anode. The flexible and wrinkle-structure SEI shell further enables the electrode protection and inner Li accommodation upon cycles, elucidating the functional influences of SEI shell on the cycling behaviors. Such on-site tracking of the morphological evolution and dynamic mechanism provide an in-depth understanding and thus benefit the optimizations of alloy-based ASSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanodes 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium1 aSong, Yue-Xian1 aChen, Wan-Ping1 aGuo, Hui-Juan1 aShi, Yang1 aGuo, Yu-Jie1 aShi, Ji-Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2887-26201 aGuo, Yu-Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0322-84761 aJia, Fei-Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1037-41751 aWang, Fu-Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0962-12601 aWen, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2644-74521 aWan, Li-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0656-09360 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 143, no. 2 p.839-848dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c101213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011000161300001600271520208500287592002802372650002302400650002102423650002002444650001402464650001602478650001202494650001102506650001302517650002102530650001702551650001602568650001002584650001502594651001002609700001402619700001402633700001502647700001602662773011702678856008102795852000902876655001202885IND60480280420221119170048.0160126e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048028042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0177-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Bing10aDecomposition of Mongolian pine litter in the presence of understory species in semi-arid northeast China  ap. 329-337.  aThe effects of understory plant litter on dominant tree litter decomposition are not well documented especially in semi-arid forests. In this study, we used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of two understory species (Artemisia scoparia and Setaria viridis) litter on the mass loss and N release of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) litter in Keerqin Sandy Lands, northeast China, and identified the influencing mechanism from the chemical quality of decomposing litter. Four litter combinations were set up: one monoculture of Mongolian pine and three mixtures of Mongolian pine and one or two understory species in equal mass proportions of each species. Total C, total N, lignin, cellulose and polyphenol concentrations, and mass loss of pine litter were analyzed at days 84 and 182 of incubation. The chemistry of pine litter not only changed with the stages of decomposition, but was also strongly influenced by the presence of understory species during decomposition. Both understory species promoted mass loss of pine litter at 84 days, while only the simultaneous presence of two understory species promoted mass loss of pine litter at 182 days. Mass loss of pine litter was negatively correlated with initial ratios of C/N, lignin/N and polyphenol/N of litter combinations during the entire incubation period; at 182 days it was negatively correlated with polyphenol concentration and ratios of C/N and polyphenol/N of litter combinations at 84 days of incubation. Nitrogen release of pine litter was promoted in the presence of understory species. Nitrogen release at 84 days was negatively correlated with initial N concentration; at 182 days it was negatively correlated with initial polyphenol concentration of litter combinations and positively correlated with lignin concentration of litter combinations at 84 days of incubation. Our results suggest that the presence of understory species causes substantial changes in chemical components of pine litter that can exert strong influences on subsequent decomposition of pine litter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia scoparia 3aPinus sylvestris 3aSetaria viridis 3acellulose 3acorrelation 3aforests 3alignin 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplant litter 3apolyphenols 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aChina1 aMao, Rong1 aHu, Yalin1 aHuang, Yue1 aZeng, Dehui0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.329-337dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0177-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011800163300001600281520112700297592002801424650003101452650001001483650001201493650001801505650001401523650000901537650001001546650001101556650001701567650001501584650001201599650001001611650001201621650001701633700001701650700002001667700001801687700001701705773009901722856004801821852000901869655001201878IND4483811320221117182600.0120715e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448381132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4708-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLÃ¼, XueFei10aEffects of cadmium, 17Î²-estradiol and their interaction in the male Chinese loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus)  ap. 858-863.  aTo assess the interaction effect between cadmium (Cd) and 17Î²-estradiol (E2), male Chinese loaches (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) were exposed to E2 (1 Î¼g/L) and Cd (50 or 500 Î¼g/L) alone and in combination using a semi-static waterborne exposure system. The effects of E2 on the accumulation and distribution of Cd, as well as the effects of Cd on vitellogenin (Vtg) synthesis induced by E2, were investigated. Cd mainly accumulated in the kidneys, liver, intestines, and gills, with little amounts in muscles, bones, and gonads. Co-exposure with E2 did not change the main targets for Cd. E2 could induce Vtg synthesis in male Chinese loaches, and co-exposure with 50 or 500 Î¼g/L Cd could inhibit the Vtg induced by 1 Î¼g/L E2. Compared with the results reported in the literature, it can be concluded that factors such as fish species, Cd dosage, and manner of exposure might make contributions to the interaction between Cd and E2. Our results also suggested that male Chinese loaches are susceptible to Cd, and can be recommended as a potential sentinel species to study the ecotoxicology of heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMisgurnus anguillicaudatus 3abones 3acadmium 3aecotoxicology 3aestradiol 3afish 3agills 3agonads 3aheavy metals 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3avitellogenin1 aLiu, FeiYuan1 aZhou, Xiaoping,1 aZhou, QunFang1 aDeng, Yulin,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Mar., v. 57, no. 8 p.858-863dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4708-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017000160300002000330520090700350592002801257650001301285650001101298650001101309650001301320650001401333650001301347650002001360650001401380650002901394650002801423650002101451650002201472650001401494650001901508650001201527650001001539650001301549650001301562650001701575650001701592650001301609650001701622700002001639700001701659700002801676700003101704700001701735773012401752856007401876852000901950655001201959IND60664488420221119061425.0190912e20130730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448842DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41018h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahana, Animesh10aLighting of a rhodamine-based fluorescent lamp using ClO₄⁻ as a connector: detection by the naked eye and cell imaging studies of trace amounts of ClO₄⁻ ions  ap. 14044-14047.  aA visible light excitable (λₑₓ = 520 nm), rhodamine-based, perchlorate selective ‘turn on’ fluorescent probe, RHENTU, is prepared and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. The probe is suitable for use in the detection of ClO₄⁻ by the naked eye. It is also capable of detecting ClO₄⁻ in contaminated living cells under a fluorescence microscope. Common anions viz. F⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻, N₃⁻, NCO⁻, NO₂⁻, NO₃⁻, SCN⁻, CN⁻, CH₃COO⁻, SO₄²⁻ and H₂PO₄⁻ do not interfere with these processes. The binding constant of RHENTU for ClO₄⁻ has been determined to be 2.9 × 10³ M⁻¹/² using the Benesi–Hildebrand equation. Addition of ClO₄⁻ to RHENTU afforded an intense red emission with a quantum yield (4.5 × 10⁻²) five times greater than that of free RHENTU. The lowest detection limit (LOD) of RHENTU for ClO₄⁻ is 1 × 10⁻⁷ M.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanions 3aazides 3abromides 3achlorides 3acyanides 3adetection limit 3aequations 3afluorescence microscopes 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent lamps 3afluorides 3aimage analysis 3aiodides 3alight 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aperchlorates 3aspectroscopy 3asulfates 3athiocyanates1 aBanerjee, Arnab1 aLohar, Sisir1 aChottapadhyay, Amarnath1 aMukhopadhyay, Subhra Kanti1 aDas, Debasis0 tRSC advances.g2013 July 30, v. 3, no. 33 p.14044-14047dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41018h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245006800183300001400251520045400265592002800719650001400747650001700761650004400778653001400822653001700836653003100853653003300884700002800917773013800945856008501083852000901168655001201177IND60544290920221119222308.0190415e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054429092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2015.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCcana-Ccapatinta, Gari Vidal10aAcylphloroglucinol derivatives from Hypericum laricifolium Juss  ap. 63-68.  aA new dimeric acylphloroglucinol derivative, hyperlaricifolin (1), and two new monomeric acylphloroglucinols, laricifolin A (2) and laricifolin B (3), were isolated from an extract of the aerial parts of Hypericum laricifolium Juss., along with the four known dimeric acylphloroglucinols uliginosin B, isouliginosin B, hyperbrasilol B, and isohyperbrasilol B.

This stems from their diverse properties, including flexible spectral tunability, stability, and photocatalytic efficiencies. Their functionality depends on the complex influence of multiple parameters, including their composition, dimensions, architecture, surface coating, and environmental conditions. A particularly promising direction for rapid adoption of these nanoparticles as photocatalysts is their ability to act as photoinitiators (PIs) for radical polymerization. Previous studies served to demonstrate the proof of concept for the use of quantum confined semiconductor nanocrystals as photoinitiators, coining the term Quantum PIs, and provided insights for their photocatalytic mechanism of action. However, these early reports suffered from low efficiencies while requiring purging with inert gases, use of additives, and irradiation by high light intensities with very long excitation durations, which limited their potential for real-life applications. The progress in nanocrystal syntheses and surface engineering has opened the way to the introduction of the next generation of Quantum PIs. Herein, we introduce the research area of nanocrystal photocatalysts, review their studies as Quantum PIs for radical polymerization, from suspension polymerization to novel printing, as well as in a new family of polymerization techniques, of reversible deactivation radical polymerization, and provide a forward-looking view for the challenges and prospects of this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3airradiation 3amechanism of action 3ananocrystals 3anew family 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3asemiconductors1 aMagdassi, Shlomo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-05531 aBanin, Uri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1698-21280 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 143, no. 2 p.577-587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c105543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245013000210300001600340506007600356520198200432592002802414506003702442650002502479650001702504650001802521650001002539650001102549650001602560650002202576653001402598653001702612653000902629653001402638653001602652653001502668700002102683700002102704700002102725700002502746700002002771700002402791773011702815856008502932852000903017655001203026IND60533720220221207142037.0190417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053372022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.09.0022doi7 aPMC38624992pmcid7 a245333432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEads, David A.10aUsing occupancy models to investigate the prevalence of ectoparasitic vectors on hosts: An example with fleas on prairie dogs  ap. 246-256.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEctoparasites are often difficult to detect in the field. We developed a method that can be used with occupancy models to estimate the prevalence of ectoparasites on hosts, and to investigate factors that influence rates of ectoparasite occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection. We describe the approach using a study of fleas (Siphonaptera) on black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). During each primary occasion (monthly trapping events), we combed a prairie dog three consecutive times to detect fleas (15s/combing). We used robust design occupancy modeling to evaluate hypotheses for factors that might correlate with the occurrence of fleas on prairie dogs, and factors that might influence the rate at which prairie dogs are colonized by fleas. Our combing method was highly effective; dislodged fleas fell into a tub of water and could not escape, and there was an estimated 99.3% probability of detecting a flea on an occupied host when using three combings. While overall detection was high, the probability of detection was always <1.00 during each primary combing occasion, highlighting the importance of considering imperfect detection. The combing method (removal of fleas) caused a decline in detection during primary occasions, and we accounted for that decline to avoid inflated estimates of occupancy. Regarding prairie dogs, flea occupancy was heightened in old/natural colonies of prairie dogs, and on hosts that were in poor condition. Occupancy was initially low in plots with high densities of prairie dogs, but, as the study progressed, the rate of flea colonization increased in plots with high densities of prairie dogs in particular. Our methodology can be used to improve studies of ectoparasites, especially when the probability of detection is low. Moreover, the method can be modified to investigate the co-occurrence of ectoparasite species, and community level factors such as species richness and interspecific interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCynomys ludovicianus 3aSiphonaptera 3aectoparasites 3ahosts 3amodels 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity 0aDetection 0aEctoparasite 0aFlea 0aOccupancy 0aPrairie dog 0aPrevalence1 aBiggins, Dean E.1 aDoherty, Paul F.1 aGage, Kenneth L.1 aHuyvaert, Kathryn P.1 aLong, Dustin H.1 aAntolin, Michael F.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2013 Dec., v. 2 p.246-256dElsevier LtdwJournal:21679x2213-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245009100209500002200300506007600322520120900398592002801607506003701635650001501672650001901687650001301706650001001719650001901729650001301748650001301761650001201774700002901786700002401815773006701839856008301906852000901989655001201998IND60565706220221207123121.0170626s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056570622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.03.0222doi7 aPMC55817172pmcid7 a283476442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoer, Elena F.10aGenomic determinants of epidermal appendage patterning and structure in domestic birds  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVariation in regional identity, patterning, and structure of epidermal appendages contributes to skin diversity among many vertebrate groups, and is perhaps most striking in birds. In pioneering work on epidermal appendage patterning, John Saunders and his contemporaries took advantage of epidermal appendage diversity within and among domestic chicken breeds to establish the importance of mesoderm-ectoderm signaling in determining skin patterning. Diversity in chickens and other domestic birds, including pigeons, is driving a new wave of research to dissect the molecular genetic basis of epidermal appendage patterning. Domestic birds are not only outstanding models for embryonic manipulations, as Saunders recognized, but they are also ideal genetic models for discovering the specific genes that control normal development and the mutations that contribute to skin diversity. Here, we review recent genetic and genomic approaches to uncover the basis of epidermal macropatterning, micropatterning, and structural variation. We also present new results that confirm expression changes in two limb identity genes in feather-footed pigeons, a case of variation in appendage structure and identity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aappendages 3achicken breeds 3achickens 3agenes 3agenetic models 3agenomics 3amutation 3apigeons1 aVan Hollebeke, Hannah F.1 aShapiro, Michael D.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009800177300001600275520177300291592002802064650001702092650001302109650001702122650001202139650001302151650001702164650001502181650002002196650001302216650002002229650001802249650001202267650001002279651000902289700001802298700001902316700001902335773011702354856008102471852000902552655001202561IND60480280920221119164332.0160126e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048028092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0187-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Seyed Ata Ollah10aEffects of geometric design of forest road and roadside vegetation on traffic noise reduction  ap. 463-468.  aGeometric design of forest roads and design of their landscapes can reduce noise pollution and its harmful effects on human health. We investigated the effects of technical and biological parameters such as geometric road design and various roadside tree stands on reducing noise pollution according to the tree density and distance from roadway in Darabkola Forests, Sari, Iran. We recorded the noise generated by a car (Land Rover) relative to changes in longitudinal slope, horizontal curve radius and type of road pavement. We also measured noise levels according to roadside tree density and stand type (coniferous and hardwood) in 40 rectangular plots of three widths (25, 100 and 300 m) and 50 m length that were randomly demarcated along forest roads. The changes in noise level were recorded using a decibel meter with an accuracy of ±1.5 dB and resolution of 0.1 dB. Noise levels were higher alongside unpaved roads than alongside paved roads. There was an inverse relationship between the measured noise level and horizontal curve radius. The rate of noise level on horizontal curve with a radius less than 30, 30–45 m and more than 45 m were 64.8, 70.8 and 75.9 dB, respectively. The noise level increased with the increasing longitudinal slope of the road. There was a significant difference between the noise level on slopes less than 3 % (67 dB) and 3–8 % (71.2 dB) in comparison with slopes greater than 8 % (77.8 dB), (p < 0.05). Pinus brutia L. reduced the noise level more (about 6 dB) in stands of 1/3 density of mixed hardwoods within 25 m from middle of the road. Careful design of geometric properties of forest roads as well as planting coniferous trees with hardwoods is a suitable solution for reducing noise pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus brutia 3aconifers 3aforest roads 3aforests 3ahardwood 3ahuman health 3alandscapes 3anoise pollution 3aplanting 3aroadside plants 3astand density 3atraffic 3atrees 3aIran1 aZandi, Seyran1 aFallah, Asghar1 aNasiri, Mehran0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.463-468dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0187-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245008700215506010400302506007600406520178300482592002802265506003702293650002902330650002602359650001602385650001702401651000902418653003402427653003202461653003102493653003302524653001002557700007102567700001902638773011802657856008602775852000902861655001202870IND60777427720221207085450.0220921e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077742772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhosravi Kazazi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9183-756710aEmerging paradigm shift in urban indicators: Integration of the vertical dimension  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSince new urbanism strategies encourage higher density and compact city development, it is expected that the height of urban environments will increase in the next few years as a remedy for many urban problems such as urban sprawl, cost of living, and detrimental environmental impacts of horizontal development of cities. Therefore, urban designers and planners should consider the third dimension of cities according to the vertical growth paradigm that is inherently a three-dimensional (3D) socioeconomic and environmental process. While a large body of literature is focusing on horizontal or two-dimensional (2D) urban indicators, it still lacks more research to compare 2D and 3D urban indicators. In this study, urban environment quality indicators, as a prominent example of urban indicators, were measured in two and three dimensions in the central business district of Urmia in Iran. Also, a Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to find a pairwise relationship between indicators. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that most 3D indicators have no significant linear relationship with other indicators, so predicting 3D indicator values based on other indicators is a difficult or even impossible task. Comparing 2D indicators with 3D ones shows that approximately 30 percent of the study area has a different urban environmental quality if it integrates the vertical dimension with 2D indicators. In addition, measuring and modelling 3D indicators provide better locational information on urban conditions and the life of citizens than traditional 2D urban indicators. This study recommends planning for the expansion of 3D information and associated tools that lead to deeper analytical insights into 3D Urban Environmental Quality assessment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental quality 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aIran 0aSustainable urban development 0aUrban environmental quality 0aTwo-dimensional indicators 0aThree-dimensional indicators 0aUrmia1 aRabiei-Dastjerdi, Hamidreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2576-793X1 aMcArdle, Gavin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 316 p.115234-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245017700173300001400350520188400364592002802248650004402276650001302320650001202333650001402345650001902359650001002378650002402388650002902412650002102441650002402462650001702486650002102503650001802524650001502542650000902557650002002566650001302586650001102599650001102610650001102621651001402632651001002646651001002656651001102666653002102677653002102698653004702719653002702766653002202793700002602815700002602841700001902867700002302886700002402909700002302933700002902956700001902985700001803004700002403022700002403046773010403070856008703174852000903261655001203270IND60545642420221122003841.0160902e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054564242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadano, Yara S.10aGaseous emissions from a heavy-duty engine equipped with SCR aftertreatment system and fuelled with diesel and biodiesel: Assessment of pollutant dispersion and health risk  ap. 64-71.  aThe changes in the composition of fuels in combination with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emission control systems bring new insights into the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants. The major goal of our study was to quantify NOx, NO, NO2, NH3 and N2O emissions from a four-cylinder diesel engine operated with diesel and a blend of 20% soybean biodiesel. Exhaust fume samples were collected from bench dynamometer tests using a heavy-duty diesel engine equipped with SCR. The target gases were quantified by means of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The use of biodiesel blend presented lower concentrations in the exhaust fumes than using ultra-low sulfur diesel. NOx and NO concentrations were 68% to 93% lower in all experiments using SCR, when compared to no exhaust aftertreatment. All fuels increased NH3 and N2O emission due to SCR, a precursor secondary aerosol, and major greenhouse gas, respectively. An AERMOD dispersion model analysis was performed on each compound results for the City of Curitiba, assumed to have a bus fleet equipped with diesel engines and SCR system, in winter and summer seasons. The health risks of the target gases were assessed using the Risk Assessment Information System For 1-h exposure of NH3, considering the use of low sulfur diesel in buses equipped with SCR, the results indicated low risk to develop a chronic non-cancer disease. The NOx and NO emissions were the lowest when SCR was used; however, it yielded the highest NH3 concentration. The current results have paramount importance, mainly for countries that have not yet adopted the Euro V emission standards like China, India, Australia, or Russia, as well as those already adopting it. These findings are equally important for government agencies to alert the need of improvements in aftertreatment technologies to reduce pollutants emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaerosols 3aammonia 3abiodiesel 3adiesel engines 3agases 3agovernment agencies 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainformation systems 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3apollutants 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoybeans 3asulfur 3asummer 3awinter 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aIndia 3aRussia 0aExhaust emission 0aDiesel biodiesel 0aSelective catalytic reduction system (SCR) 0aHealth risk assessment 0aAERMOD simulation1 aBorillo, Guilherme C.1 aGodoi, Ana Flávia L.1 aCichon, Amanda1 aSilva, Thiago O.B.1 aValebona, Fábio B.1 aErrera, Marcelo R.1 aPenteado Neto, Renato A.1 aRempel, Dennis1 aMartin, Lucas1 aYamamoto, Carlos I.1 aGodoi, Ricardo H.M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 500-501 p.64-71dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014400162300001800306520156100324592002801885650001401913650002101927650001601948650002601964650003701990650002902027650001902056650001302075650002002088650002702108650001302135650001502148650002602163650001802189650002902207700001502236700001602251700001502267700001402282773012802296856008102424852000902505655001202514IND60555711120221116142052.0170725e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055571112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-016-9847-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ting12aA targeted proteomics approach to the quantitative analysis of ERK/Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptosis and multi-drug resistance in breast cancer  ap. 7491-7503.  aApoptosis suppression caused by overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins is a central factor to the acquisition of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in breast cancer. As a highly conserved anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 can initiate an anti-apoptosis response via an ERK1/2-mediated pathway. However, the details therein are still far from completely understood and a quantitative description of the associated proteins in the biological context may provide more insights into this process. Following our previous attempts in the quantitative analysis of MDR mechanisms, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based targeted proteomics was continually employed here to describe ERK/Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptosis. A targeted proteomics assay was developed and validated first for the simultaneous quantification of ERK1/2 and Bcl-2. In particular, ERK isoforms (i.e., ERK1 and ERK2) and their differential phosphorylated forms including isobaric ones were distinguished. Using this assay, differential protein levels and site-specific phosphorylation stoichiometry were observed in parental drug-sensitive MCF-7/WT cancer cells and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells and breast tissue samples from two groups of patients who were either suspected or diagnosed to have drug resistance. In addition, quantitative analysis of the time course of both ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 in doxorubicin (DOX)-treated MCF-7/WT cells confirmed these findings. Overall, we propose that targeted proteomics can be used generally to resolve more complex cellular events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3adoxorubicin 3aliquid chromatography 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3astoichiometry 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aXu, Feifei1 aSheng, Yuan1 aZhang, Wen1 aChen, Yun0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 408, no. 26 p.7491-7503dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-9847-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245009700163300001300260520092700273592002801200650001201228650001301240650001801253650001601271650001801287650000901305650004301314650004701357650001401404650001101418650000901429650001801438650001801456650002101474650003901495650001501534653001401549653000901563653002401572653002101596653002101617700002001638700002101658700002401679700002701703773011001730856007801840852000901918655001201927IND4463950720221120174745.0160209e20120124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446395072DNAL7 a10.1515/1556-3758.24232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehghan, Afsaneh14aThe Effect of Microwave Pasteurization on Some Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Milk  ap. 1-12.  aIn this research, cow’s milk was pasteurized using microwave (MW) or HTST methods and their effects on some milk components were studied.

The contents of six amino acids (aspartic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, histidine, arginine, and lysine in mg/L) and fatty acids (weight percentage) showed no significant differences using either MW or HTST pasteurization method. There were slight but insignificant differences in trans fatty acid and D-amino acid contents in the milk pasteurized with either MW or HTST method. SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis of milk proteins did not reveal any differences between the pasteurization methods. It was finally concluded that MW heating is a good alternative to HTST pasteurization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3afatty acids 3aglutamic acid 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahigh-temperature short-time pasteurization 3ahistidine 3alysine 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3amilk proteins 3apasteurized milk 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asolubility 0amicrowave 0aHTST 0amilk pasteurization 0amilk amino acids 0amilk fatty acids1 aJamalian, Jalal1 aFarahnaky, Asgar1 aMesbahi, Gholamreza1 aMoosavi-Nasab, Marzieh0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2012 Jan. 24, v. 8, no. 1 p.1-12dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1556-3758.24233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012100171300001600292500001500308520169600323592002802019650001402047650001902061650002302080650001402103650001102117650001602128650001202144650001002156650001102166650002502177650002002202650001802222650001402240650001202254650001002266650002402276650001502300650001802315650002402333650001302357653001302370653002202383653001502405653001802420653001902438653001302457653001402470653001702484700002302501700002702524700002202551700001902573700001902592700002602611700002202637700002002659773012702679856008502806852000902891655001202900IND60565706820221123041404.0190312e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056570682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2016.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLefoulon, Emilie10aWhence river blindness? The domestication of mammals and host-parasite co-evolution in the nematode genus Onchocerca  ap. 457-470.  a2019-12-06  aThe genus Onchocerca includes 34 described species and represents one of the largest genera of the filarial nematodes within the family Onchocercidae. Representative members of this genus are mainly parasites of ungulates, with some exceptions such as Onchocerca lupi and Onchocerca volvulus, infecting carnivores and/or humans. For a long time, the evolutionary relationships amongst onchocercids remained poorly studied, as the systematics of this genus was impaired by the high morphological variability of species included in the taxon. Although some molecular phylogenies were developed, these studies were mainly focused on bovine Onchocerca spp. and O. volvulus, including assessments of Wolbachia endosymbionts. In the present study, we analysed 13 Onchocerca spp. from a larger host spectrum using a panel of seven different genes. Analysis of the coxI marker supports its usefulness for the identification of species within the genus. The evolutionary history of the genus has been herein revised by multi-gene phylogenies, presenting three strongly supported clades of Onchocerca spp. Analyses of co-evolutionary scenarios between Onchocerca and their vertebrate hosts underline the effect of domestication on Onchocerca speciation. Our study indicates that a host switch event occurred between Bovidae, Canidae and humans. Cophylogenetic analyses between Onchocerca and the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia indicate the strongest co-evolutionary pattern ever registered within the filarial nematodes. Finally, this dataset indicates that the clade composed by O. lupi, Onchocerca gutturosa, Onchocerca lienalis, Onchocerca ochengi and O. volvulus derived from recent speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aonchocerciasis 3aOnchocerca ochengi 3aWolbachia 3ahumans 3acoevolution 3aCanidae 3ahosts 3acattle 3aOnchocerca gutturosa 3adata collection 3aendosymbionts 3aphylogeny 3aBovidae 3agenes 3aOnchocerca lienalis 3acarnivores 3adomestication 3aOnchocerca volvulus 3abacteria 0avolvulus 0aDiagnostic marker 0aOnchocerca 0aDomestication 0aHost-switching 0aFilariae 0aPhylogeny 0aCo-evolution1 aGiannelli, Alessio1 aMakepeace, Benjamin L.1 aMutafchiev, Yasen1 aTownson, Simon1 aUni, Shigehiko1 aVerocai, Guilherme G.1 aOtranto, Domenico1 aMartin, Coralie0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2017 July, v. 47, no. 8 p.457-470dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2016.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010600170300001600276520096700292592002801259650002001287650002001307650001301327650001401340650001601354650001201370650000901382650001801391651001001409653003001419653002601449653001701475653001001492653002001502700001401522700001801536700001201554700001801566773010601584856008701690852000901777655001201786IND60545642720221121175526.0160902e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054564272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Guo-Li10aChiral signature of α-HCH and o,p′-DDT in the soil and grass of the Central Tibetan Plateau, China  ap. 147-154.  aEnantiomeric fraction (EF) of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has been used as a signature for tracing the source and following pathways. The chiral analysis was performed for α-HCH and o,p′-DDT in paired soil and grass samples from the Central Tibetan Plateau (CTP), a unique background region. In the case of α-HCH, excess of (−) α-HCH was predominant in 83.3% of soil samples, and 80% of grass samples showed excess of (+) enantiomer. For o,p′-DDT, 90.9% of grass samples showed excess of (−) o,p′-DDT while 50% of soil samples showed excess of the (−) enantiomer. A correlation between EFs of soil and grass was not observed for either compound. The EFs of both compounds were correlated with soil concentration and with change of sampling altitude, within EFs being lower than racemic. However, these trends were not found in grass. Our study provides a database of EFs and signatures for OCPs in the CTP, one background region of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aaltitude 3adatabases 3aenantiomers 3agrasses 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aChina 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aEnantiomeric fraction 0aSurface soil 0aGrass 0aTibetan Plateau1 aSun, Yong1 aQin, Jian-Xun1 aLi, Jun1 aWang, Gen-Hou0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 500-501 p.147-154dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245012900211520133400340592002801674650002201702650002001724650001401744650001001758653001201768653001901780653001401799653001301813653001601826653000901842700006801851700002801919773011801947856008602065852000902151655001202160IND60777428020221121154053.0220921e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077742802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaraji, Fariborz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0620-202010aPotential and current practices of recycling waste printed circuit boards: A review of the recent progress in pyrometallurgy  aOver the last few decades, a substantial amount of e-waste including waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) has been produced and is accumulating worldwide. More recently, the rate of production has increased significantly, and this trend has raised some serious concerns regarding the need to develop viable recycling methods. The presence of other materials in the WPCBs, such as ceramics and polymers, and the multi-metal nature of WPCBs all contribute to the increased complexity of any recycling process. Among the viable techniques, pyrometallurgy, with the inherent ability to process the waste independent of its composition, is a promising candidate for both rapid and large-scale treatment. In the present study, firstly, the principles of the pyrometallurgical methods for WPCB recycling are discussed. Secondly, the different unit operations of thermochemical pretreatment including incineration, pyrolysis, and molten salt processing are reviewed. Thirdly, the smelting processes for the recovery of metals from WPCBs, as well as the issues surrounding slag formation and subsequent treatment are explained. Fourthly, alternative methods for the recovery of polymers and ceramics, in addition to metal recycling, are elucidated. Fifthly, emission control techniques and the potential for energy recovery are evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic wastes 3aenergy recovery 3apyrolysis 3aslags 0aE-Waste 0aPyrometallurgy 0aPyrolysis 0aSmelting 0aMolten salt 0aSlag1 aGolmohammadzadeh, Rabeeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4169-53261 aPickles, Christopher A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 316 p.115242-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1152423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245012700165300001300292520119600305592002801501650002901529650002201558650000901580650001801589650002301607650001701630650001001647650001601657650001501673650001601688650002101704650000701725650002301732650003901755650002301794650002601817650001301843650002301856650001401879653001701893653001601910653002001926653002601946653002701972700001501999700002002014700001902034773010902053856007802162852000902240655001202249IND4463950920221120174826.0160209e20120209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446395092DNAL7 a10.1515/1556-3758.26462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurekatete, Nicole10aEffects of Fermentation on Nutritional and Functional Properties of Soybean, Maize, and Germinated Sorghum Composite Flour  ap. 1-15.  aSorghum germination resulted in a substantial tannin loss (95.7 %). Proximate composition, titratable acidity, pasting properties, in vitro protein digestibility, and protein solubility were studied post fermentation (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) of the blended soybean, maize, and germinated sorghum flours. The pH progressively decreased with fermentation time, while titratable acidity increased from 0.029 to 0.118 ml/ml. Crude protein content increased with fermentation (251.7-274.8 mg/g) as a result of a shift in the dry matter composition. In-vitro protein digestibility markedly increased (12 %) as a result of fermentation. Protein solubility curves were above 30% of which highest for both fermented (12 and 24 hours) and unfermented composite flours were at pH 12 (51.77-77.64%) and lowest at pH 4 (30.31-35.98%). SDS-PAGE showed that protein hydrolysis occurred during fermentation over 12 and 24 hours. Unfermented composite flour was potentially stable as food ingredient due to its pasting stability, but the fermented flour low viscosity potential was preferred in this study as more flour will be used during porridge making, hence giving a food with a high nutrient density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3afermentation 3aflour 3agermination 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3anutrient density 3apH 3apasting properties 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein solubility 3aproximate composition 3asoybeans 3atitratable acidity 3aviscosity 0afermentation 0agermination 0acomposite flour 0afunctional properties 0anutritional properties1 aHua, Yufei1 aKong, Xiangzhen1 aZhang, Caimeng0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2012 Feb. 9, v. 8, no. 1 p.1-15dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1556-3758.26463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010200206520189400308592002802202650002002230650002302250650002202273650001902295650001002314650001502324650003602339650001102375650001502386650001802401650000902419650002502428651001602453653003302469653001802502653002702520653003302547653001602580773010402596856008302700852000902783655001202792IND60646276520221119234343.0200607e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064627652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mran.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Sakkaf, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-703210aComparison of three modelling approaches to predict the risk of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand  aNew Zealand has the highest rate of reported campylobacteriosis in the developed world. Due to the large economic and health consequences of campylobacteriosis, prediction models for disease are required to be designed to predict accurately the number of campylobacteriosis cases. The Bayesian approach has gained increased interest in recent years for calculating the outcomes of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). A classical time series and Monte Carlo (MC) modelling were also explored as appropriate techniques to predict campylobacteriosis. A simplified model representing the entire food chain from the farm to the fork with all the variables of interest was used with the Bayesian method. The Auto Regressive Integrated Moving-Average intervention models (ARIMA additive and multiplicative), Holt-Winters (HW multiplicative) and Bayesian methods were considered the best models for predicting the actual 7333 notified campylobacteriosis cases with 7990, 8442, 8666 and 9250 cases, respectively. It is also noteworthy that the notification rate has more or less stabilised since 2008 until 2017. MC modelling provided the least realistic prediction (846,451 cases). The HW method is simple to use and reliable method for time series predictions. However, the Bayesian method provides a prior assessment of any possible intervention in the food chain and provides satisfactory prediction accuracy in spite of the complexity involved in constructing and assigning probabilities from expert knowledge or prior information, linking the nodes and complex software. This study highlighted the importance of the Bayesian model to assess all the factors which may contribute to the campylobacteriosis risk and confirmed that it can provide better conclusions for QMRA than the MC technique because of its interactive link between the data and the parameter (backward inference).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acampylobacteriosis 3acomputer software 3aexpert opinion 3afarms 3afood chain 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3amodels 3aprediction 3apublic health 3arisk 3atime series analysis 3aNew Zealand 0aBayesian hierarchical models 0aCampylobacter 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aQuantitative risk assessment 0aTime series0 tMicrobial risk analysis.g2020 Apr., v. 14 p.100077-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23482x2352-35227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015300163300001600316500001500332520233300347592002802680650001402708650002502722650001902747650001102766650002202777650001402799650002802813650001402841650001502855650000902870650001102879650002202890650002002912650001802932650001502950650001402965650001802979650001902997650002203016650001703038650001203055650001103067650001903078650002603097650001303123650000903136650001703145650001503162651001003177653001503187700004403202773011803246856004803364852000903412655001203421IND50063538920221119112413.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006353892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-012-9388-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudha, Velu10aCharacterization of bottom sediments and phosphorus fractions in hyper-eutrophic Krishnagiri reservoir located in an agricultural watershed in India  ap. 481-496.  a2019-12-04  aThe hyper-eutrophicated Krishnagiri reservoir is situated in hot tropical and semiarid climate zone in South India. There are 16 villages in the command area, which are directly benefited by this reservoir, and water from the reservoir is used for irrigation, fish rearing, livestock rearing and recreation purposes. The reservoir is located in an agricultural watershed, and the rate of soil erosion in the catchment area is very high. Thus, the reservoir is severely affected by sedimentation, and half of its capacity was reduced. Previous studies in Krishnagiri reservoir clearly indicate the lack of information on the quality of sediments and dynamics of nutrient in the reservoir. Hence, the present study was conducted on bottom sediments, and it included the assessment of physicochemical characteristics and nutrients, such as composition, redox potential, moisture content, organic carbon, organic matter, total iron, manganese, calcium carbonate, different phosphorus fractions and total phosphorus. The increasing trend in organic matter and also the significant change from positive to high negative values of redox potential clearly indicate the inflow of high organic load which may result from the disposal of sewage and industrial waste water in the upstream catchment side. The high concentration of inorganic phosphorus fractions at the inflow point of the reservoir obviously implies that there was a significant input of nutrients into the reservoir. Hence, the study concludes that the rainfall, soil erosion and runoff are the major environmental factors for the input and accumulation of large quantities of nutrients in the bottom sediments of Krishnagiri reservoir during the study period. The present study clearly suggests for a careful investigation into sediment nutrients in Krishnagiri reservoir, and it is also necessary to assess the role of sediments in the phosphorus dynamics and its significant effect on eutrophication. This study demonstrates that the examination of physicochemical characteristics and nutrients in the bottom sediments is a helpful tool to identify the sources of nutrients to the reservoir. The baseline data provided in this paper will be helpful for the policy makers to frame better policies for the sustainable management of water quality in Krishnagiri reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aorganic matter 3acarbon 3aindustrial wastes 3anutrients 3aagricultural watersheds 3asediments 3airrigation 3airon 3arunoff 3aissues and policy 3aredox potential 3awater quality 3arecreation 3alivestock 3awater content 3aeutrophication 3acalcium carbonate 3afish culture 3arearing 3asewage 3asemiarid zones 3aenvironmental factors 3avillages 3arain 3asoil erosion 3awastewater 3aIndia 0aphosphorus1 aAmbujam, Neelakanda Kanniaperumalpillai0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2013 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.481-496dSpringer-Verlagx1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-012-9388-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012300171300001600294520117200310592002801482650001801510650001301528650002601541650001001567650001201577650001301589650001901602650001701621650001201638650000901650650001201659650001301671650001501684651002001699651002401719653003001743653002301773653001301796653001401809653002201823700001801845700002201863773015101885856008402036852000902120655001202129IND60612265520221121064957.0190412e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061226552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aasci.2018.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachashvili, N.J.10aDistribution regularity and habitats of Salt Tree [Halimodendron halodendron (Pall.)

Nevertheless, the influence of environmental pollution on the occurrence of osteoporosis is still unclear and controversial. In this context, heavy metals are the most important pollutants capable to affect bone mass. The aim of this study was to investigate whether heavy metals accumulation in bone tissues could be related to the altered bone metabolism and architecture of osteoporotic patients. To this end, we analyzed 25 bone head biopsies osteoporotic patients and 25 bone head biopsies of osteoarthritic patients. Moreover we enrolled 15 patients underwent hip arthroplasty for high‐energy hip fracture or osteonecrosis of the femoral head as a control group. Bone head biopsies were studied by BioQuant‐osteo software, scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive X‐ray microanalysis. We found a prevalence of lead, cadmium and chromium accumulation in osteoporotic patients. Noteworthy, high levels of sclerostin, detected by immunohistochemistry, correlate with the accumulation of heavy metal found in the bone of osteoporotic patients, suggesting a molecular link between heavy metal accumulation and bone metabolism impairment. In conclusion, the presence of heavy metals into bone shed new light on the comprehension of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis since these elements could play a non redundant role in the development of osteoporosis at cellular/molecular and epigenetic level. Nevertheless, in vivo and in vitro studies need to better elucidate the molecular mechanism in which heavy metals can participate to osteoporosis. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Like ecosystem services (ES), EDS impact economic and non-economic aspects of human life within social-ecological systems (SES). The concept of EDS has been much debated, with strongly differing opinions regarding its utility and implications. In this opinion paper, we emphasize its relevance and complementarity to the ES concept for analyzing SES, and advocate applying EDS to SES research more systematically. Firstly, we highlight that though EDS are now sometimes studied, they remain neglected compared to ES. Secondly, we propose five reasons why EDS and ES are complementary concepts. Thirdly, we suggest that EDS are critical to understanding stakeholders’ behavior regarding ecosystems. Drawing on existing studies, we illustrate how stakeholders in SES simultaneously perceive and benefit or suffer from ES and EDS. We further suggest that, under certain conditions, EDS may influence people’s behavior more than ES. Such 'EDS-biased behavior' implies that, under certain circumstances, targeting EDS reduction may be more effective than targeting ES increase to encourage nature-friendly behaviors. Finally, we provide five recommendations to further integrate ES and EDS in research, as a pathway towards improving the understanding of SES and the effectiveness of sustainability policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders1 aDendoncker, Nicolas1 aBarnaud, Cécile,1 aSirami, Clélia0 tEcosystem services.g2019 Apr., v. 36 p.100913-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.1009133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300002000276500001900296520141300315592002801728650001601756650002301772650003101795650001501826650001101841650001301852650002001865650001401885650001701899700001501916700001201931700001701943700001801960700001701978700001901995773014402014856007402158852000902232655001202241IND60720720320221122080917.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072072032DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta08937k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wujun10aScalable microgel spinning of a three-dimensional porous graphene fiber for high-performance flexible supercapacitors  ap. 25355-25362.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGraphene fiber-based supercapacitors are emerging as one of the most promising energy-storage devices for wearable electronic devices. However, neat graphene fibers fabricated from liquid crystal spinning, the most commonly used method for preparing graphene fibers, usually have a graphite-like structure due to the π–π aggregation, which greatly impedes their practical application in energy storage. Herein, we developed a facile approach for fabricating a N and S co-doped porous graphene fiber by means of microgel spinning using self-assembled 3D GO microgels as a spinning dope followed by thermal reduction. The fabricated fiber with a large specific surface area (312 m² g⁻¹), appropriate hierarchical pore structures and synergistic effects of N and S co-doping can act as a superior flexible electrode for fiber-shaped supercapacitors in terms of high volumetric capacitance (59.9 F cm⁻³ at a current density of 0.1 A cm⁻³), outstanding energy and power density (8.3 mW h cm⁻³ at 50.3 mW cm⁻³), exceptional rate capability (44.1 F cm⁻³ at a high current density of 1 A cm⁻³) and long cycle stability (96.2% of the initial specific capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles). This cost-effective and simple preparation method paves the way to large-scale fabrication of heteroatom-doped porous graphene fibers and promotes their practical application in wearable devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aliquid crystals 3amicrogels 3asurface area1 aLi, Wanfei1 aLi, Min1 aMao, Qinghui1 aPan, Zhenghui1 aZhu, Meifang1 aZhang, Yuegang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 47 p.25355-25362dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08937k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010400172500001900276520140600295592002801701650002801729650004301757650001501800650001601815650002101831650002201852650001301874650001501887650001901902650001901921653001901940653001801959653001701977653002301994653002202017700002102039700002702060700002302087700002002110700002002130700006602150773011902216856008802335852000902423655001202432IND60686484420221121032212.0200601e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068648442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1379202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRybak, Anna V.10aGenetic analysis in earthworm population from area contaminated with radionuclides and heavy metals  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study assessed the effects of environmental contamination by naturally occurring radionuclides and heavy metals on the genetic structure of a population of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. A. caliginosa were collected from four sites and characterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses. No differences in genetic structure and diversity were found between sites that differed greatly in soil contamination levels of radionuclides and metals. However, when the genetic structure of the A. caliginosa population was analyzed without considering information about the sampling site, a complex intraspecific genetic structure was identified. At least three highly divergent lineages were found, in unequal proportions, of each genetically isolated group from each study site. No associations were found between the distribution of the detected genetic clusters and the geographical origin of the samples. Thus, no noticeable adaptive changes or signs of directional selection were detected, despite the long history of genotoxic waste disposal at the sampling site. These results suggest a combined effect of three factors on the genetic structure and diversity of A. caliginosa in soils: the complexity of the contaminant composition, the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the pollutants, and the complexity of the intraspecific genetic structures of A. caliginosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aearthworms 3aenvironment 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic structure 3amutagens 3aprovenance 3asoil pollution 3awaste disposal 0aMicroevolution 0aRadionuclides 0aHeavy metals 0aSoil contamination 0aGenetic diversity1 aBelykh, Elena S.1 aMaystrenko, Tatiana A.1 aShadrin, Dmitry M.1 aPylina, Yana I.1 aChadin, Ivan F.1 aVelegzhaninov, Ilya O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4715-40530 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 25, v. 723 p.137920-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1379203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007200166300001800238520215800256592002802414650001102442650002902453650001102482650001102493650001802504650002002522700001702542700002002559700001802579773010502597856004802702852000902750655001202759IND4472597920221119090747.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447259792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-011-9786-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Amaya10aAssessment of Environmental Water Cost Through Physical Hydronomics  ap. 2931-2949.  aThe Georgescu-Roegen’s statements about the connexion between the Economy and the Thermodynamics, together with the Eco-integrator approach introduced by Naredo and its relation with the water cost definitions given in the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), are the outline backgrounds of the work presented in this paper. Assuming that the physical laws are called to be the objective and universal tools to assess water costs, Physical Hydronomics (PH) has been developed as the accounting tool for the WFD application, regarding its physico-chemical objectives. PH is defined as the specific application of the Thermoeconomics to physically characterize the degradation and correction of water bodies. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, through the exergy loss calculation, is the basic working tool in this study. The final objective of PH is to use those calculated physical costs of water as a guide to allocate the environmental and resource costs introduced by the WFD. In this paper, the general framework and the basic accounting principles of PH are explained. First, from the quantity and quality measurements in the river (they give the exergy value to water bodies), the exergy profiles of the river at different statuses (those defined by the WFD) are obtained. Then, the environmental cost of water is obtained (in energy units) as the exergy needed to cover the gap between the current state of the river and the objective state defined by the applicable legislation to fulfil the European requirements. To do it, thermodynamic efficiency of water treatment technologies was introduced in the analysis. Then, the physical cost are translated into monetary units. To illustrate the application of the PH’s methodology, the example of the Spanish Muga Basin, sited in the Inland Basins of Catalonia, is summarized at the end of this paper. The results show that similar results to conventional Measurements Plans to fulfil the WFD objectives are obtained. However, PH presents an important advantage: costs could be allocated according to the degradation (exergy costs) provoked by the different water users in the water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aenvironmental assessment 3aexergy 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater treatment1 aUche, Javier1 aValero, Antonio1 aRubio, Carlos0 tWater resources management.g2011 Sept., v. 25, no. 12 p.2931-2949dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-011-9786-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245015200180300001600332520183000348592002802178650002502206650001802231650001502249650001602264650001602280650001902296650001102315650001402326650001602340650001602356650001002372650002202382650001102404650003102415650001202446650001402458650000902472650001302481650001002494650000902504650001202513650002102525650003602546650002102582650001902603650000902622650001802631650004102649650000902690650001702699700002402716700002702740700002402767700002002791700002102811773011102832856004802943852000902991655001203000IND50066777920221119112429.0130531e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006677792DNAL7 a236131482pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-013-9665-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Amit10aBiochemical, Histological, and Memory Impairment Effects of Chronic Copper Toxicity: A Model for Non-Wilsonian Brain Copper Toxicosis in Wistar Rat  ap. 257-268.  aAnimal models of copper toxicosis rarely exhibit neurological impairments and increased brain copper accumulation impeding the development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases having high brain Cu content. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intraperitoneally injected copper lactate (0.15 mg Cu/100 g body weight) daily for 90 days on copper and zinc levels in the liver and hippocampus, on biochemical parameters, and on neurobehavioral functions (by Morris water maze) of male Wistar rats. Copper-administered animals exhibited significantly decreased serum acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and impaired neuromuscular coordination and spatial memory compared to control rats. Copper-intoxicated rats showed significant increase in liver and hippocampus copper content (99.1 and 73 % increase, respectively), 40.7 % reduction in hepatic zinc content, and interestingly, 77.1 % increase in hippocampus zinc content with concomitant increase in copper and zinc levels in serum and urine compared to control rats. Massive grade 4 copper depositions and grade 1 copper-associated protein in hepatocytes of copper-intoxicated rats were substantiated by rhodanine and orcein stains, respectively. Copper-intoxicated rats demonstrated swelling and increase in the number of astrocytes and copper deposition in the choroid plexus, with degenerated neurons showing pyknotic nuclei and dense eosinophilic cytoplasm. In conclusion, the present study shows the first evidence in vivo that chronic copper toxicity causes impaired spatial memory and neuromuscular coordination, swelling of astrocytes, decreased serum AChE activity, copper deposition in the choroid plexus, neuronal degeneration, and augmented levels of copper and zinc in the hippocampus of male Wistar rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aanimal models 3aastrocytes 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3achoroid plexus 3acopper 3acytoplasm 3ahepatocytes 3ahippocampus 3aliver 3along term effects 3amemory 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apoisoning 3arats 3atoxicity 3aurine 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBrainxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMale 2aMaze Learning 2aMemory Disordersxchemically induced 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aBadyal, Rama Kumari1 aVasishta, Rakesh Kumar1 aAttri, Savita Verma1 aThapa, Babu Ram1 aPrasad, Rajendra0 tBiological trace element research.g2013 June, v. 153, no. 1-3 p.257-268dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-013-9665-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245006900189300001800258520199800276592002802274650002402302650003002326650001202356650002702368650001602395650001602411650000902427650001302436650001402449650002102463650001902484650000702503650001502510650000902525650002302534650001402557650001402571650001102585650001102596650002702607650001802634650002702652650001502679650001102694650001602705650001602721650002902737650002702766650002302793650002502816650000902841650001202850650002102862650004102883650005902924650002902983651001103012651001103023773011803034856008103152852000903233655001203242IND60081345420221122031938.0140831e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008134542DNAL7 a250277762pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3850-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Taani, Ahmed A.10aTrend analysis in water quality of Al-Wehda Dam, north of Jordan  ap. 6223-6239.  aTemporal status and trends in water quality of Al-Wehda Dam, Jordan, from 2006 to 2012 indicate that the dam is subject to a combination of impacts from rainstorm and agricultural runoffs. It also revealed that mineral dissolution, sediment load, rainfall events, evaporation, and water-level fluctuation are the major contributors to variations in water quality. The water chemistry of the impounded Al-Wehda Reservoir showed that Na, Ca, Mg, HCO₃, and Cl are the principal ions, reflecting the dominance of carbonate weathering, with some contribution of silicates. The pH values showed a cyclic pattern with highest values observed in the spring seasons. Total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca, Mg, and HCO₃ are primarily related to leaching and evaporation, with elevated levels that occurred in the rainy winter months. In contrast, seasonal patterns in Na, K, Cl, and NH₄–N contents showed decreased values in winter. Peaks in NO₃–N observed in winter are strongly associated with agricultural runoff. Fluctuations in chlorophyll-a level were coincided with low ratio of total nitrogen (TN) to total phosphorus (TP). Seasonal variations in organic matter content were also apparent, with peaks that generally occurred in spring through early fall corresponding with high algal growth. On an annual basis, the vast majority of water quality data have generally declined, particularly, in 2011. However, it is not clear whether these decreases are related to change in management practices within the Yarmouk basin, or protective measures have been implemented. Comparison of in-lake and post-dam water quality from 2009 to 2011 showed variation in concentrations, where Ca, HCO₃, NO₃–N, Mg, and TDS showed relatively greater post-dam values than in-lake water, whereas pH, Na, Cl, K, COD, BOD₅, and chlorophyll-a were consistently lower in post-dam water. This comparison emphasizes the importance of self-purification capacity of Al-Wehda Dam in reducing some contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acalcium 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorophyll 3aevaporation 3aions 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asilicates 3asodium 3aspring 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater quality 3awater quality analysis 3aweathering 3awinter 2aAgriculture 2aChlorophyll 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 2aWater Qualityxstandards 3aJordan 0aJordan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Oct., v. 186, no. 10 p.6223-6239dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3850-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011500165300001800280500002000298520105900318592002801377596007601405650003001481650002501511650001401536650001901550650001301569650001601582650001501598650002301613700001401636700001601650700002001666773011101686856008001797852000901877655001201886IND60790315120221123004518.0220824e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079031512DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.124742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurnecka, David10aBordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica filamentous hemagglutinins are processed at different sites  ap. 1256-1266.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFilamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) mediates adherence and plays an important role in lower respiratory tract infections by pathogenic Bordetellae. The mature FHA proteins of B. pertussis (Bp‐FHA) and the B. bronchiseptica (Bb‐FHA) are generated by processing of the respective FhaB precursors by the autotransporter subtilisin‐type protease SphB1. We have used bottom‐up proteomics with differential ¹⁶O/¹⁸O labeling and show that despite high‐sequence conservation of the corresponding FhaB segments, the mature Bp‐FHA (~ 230 kDa) and Bb‐FHA (~ 243 kDa) proteins are processed at different sites of FhaB, after the Ala‐2348 and Lys‐2479 residues, respectively. Moreover, protease surface accessibility probing by on‐column (on‐line) digestion of the Bp‐FHA and Bb‐FHA proteins yielded different peptide patterns, revealing structural differences in the N‐terminal and C‐terminal domains of the Bp‐FHA and Bb‐FHA proteins. These data indicate specific structural variations between the highly homologous FHA proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  aLM2015064cMinistry of Education,Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aBordetella pertussis 3adigestion 3ahemagglutinins 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteomics 3arespiratory system1 aMan, Petr1 aSebo, Peter1 aBumba, Ladislav0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.1256-1266dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.124743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012900174520193800303592002802241650002402269650002302293650001102316650001802327650002302345653001302368653001002381653001502391653001702406700002102423700002202444700001902466700002102485700002202506773010602528856008702634852000902721655001202730IND60782807820221118194745.0220824e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078280782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbarzadeh, Hamed10aBall-Cup, Janus, core-shell and disordered-alloy rhodium-gold nanoparticles: An atomistic simulation on structural stability  aIn recent years, the synthesis of Au-Rh nanoparticles with different chemical arrangements have been reported. Studies indicated that the Au-Rh nanoparticles show the highly effective catalytic activity in the hydrogenation reactions at 300 K. Therefore, in this work, the stability of different chemical arrangements of Au-Rh nanoparticles, including Aucₒᵣₑ@Rhₛₕₑₗₗ, Rhcₒᵣₑ@Auₛₕₑₗₗ, Aubₐₗₗ-Rhcᵤₚ, Rhbₐₗₗ-Aucᵤₚ, Rh|Au Janus, and Au-Rh disordered-alloy, was investigated at room temperature by molecular dynamics simulation. The different parameters such as excess energy and strain were employed for comparison of stability of Au-Rh nanoparticles. Results show that the Au atoms always show the highest strain values regardless of their core or shell position. Therefore, the placement of Au atoms in the core of the nanoparticle leads to the most strain in the core position and the instability of Au-Rh nanoparticles. While, the placement of Rh atoms in the core of the nanoparticle and the placement of Au atoms in the shell of the nanoparticle lead to the reduction of the strain in the core and reduction of the surface energy in the shell, respectively, and consequently increase the stability of the Au-Rh nanoparticle. Hence, among the Au-Rh nanoparticles with different chemical arrangements, the group of Rhbₐₗₗ-Aucᵤₚ, Rh|Au Janus, and Rhcₒᵣₑ@Auₛₕₑₗₗ are known as nanoparticles with the most stability and the group of Aucₒᵣₑ@Rhₛₕₑₗₗ, and Aubₐₗₗ-Rhcᵤₚ are known as nanoparticles with the lowest stability. Meanwhile, the disordered-alloy nanoparticle shows the intermediate stability between two groups. Generally, in the Au-Rh nanoparticles with different chemical arrangements, it can be concluded that the stability of nanoparticles decreases by increasing the number of Au atoms in the positions close to the core.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ahydrogenation 3amolecular dynamics 0aBall-Cup 0aJanus 0aCore-shell 0aNanoparticle1 aMehrjouei, Esmat1 aAbbaspour, Mohsen1 aSalemi, Sirous1 aYaghoubi, Hamzeh1 aHajizadeh, Zohreh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129658-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008700158300002000245500001900265520149200284592002801776650002501804650001701829650001901846650001601865650001701881700001601898773014401914856007402058852000902132655001202141IND60720720720221122065323.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072072072DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta09096d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuetian10aIncorporating quantum dots for high efficiency and stable perovskite photovoltaics  ap. 25017-25027.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLead halide perovskites have been widely studied for successful photovoltaic applications because of their exceptional optoelectronic properties, high photoconversion efficiencies, facile solution process and low cost. However, both organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells still face the challenges with respect to higher photovoltaic performances and long-term stabilities against various environmental factors. To address these stability issues, solution-processed colloidal perovskite nanocrystals have been introduced into perovskite solar cells either as the sole light absorber material, or a surface additive for bulk perovskite films. The incorporation of perovskite quantum dots onto bulk perovskite thin films has shown great potential on improving the band alignment in solar cell structures, passivating bulk and surface defects, and enhancing overall device performances. Here in this perspective, we summarize the recent development on integrating semiconductor nanocrystals, including perovskite and metal chalcogenide quantum dots, onto bulk perovskite thin films for solar cell device fabrication. We also highlight and provide an outlook of the ongoing research studies regarding how the function and mechanism of this nanocrystal incorporation, the distribution of the added components, as well as the processing route, the chemical composition and the morphology of the nanocrystal can affect the fabricated device performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3ananocrystals 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aZhao, Yixin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 47 p.25017-25027dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta09096d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245005800160300001200218520092300230592002801153650001501181650000901196650001301205650001601218653001001234653001401244653001401258653001101272653000901283653000901292653000901301653000801310653000801318653000801326653000801334653000801342653000801350653000801358653000801366653000801374653000801382653000801390653000801398653000801406653000801414653000801422653000801430653000801438653000801446653000801454653000801462653000801470653000801478653000801486653002101494653001101515653002301526653002501549700001501574773007001589856008201659852000901741655001201750IND60552399120221117005608.0161021e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055239912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Li12aA challenge for miRNA: multiple isomiRs in miRNAomics  ap. 1-7.  aAccumulating evidence suggests that a single microRNA (miRNA) locus can generate a series of sequences during miRNA maturation process. These multiple sequences, called miRNA variants, or isomiRs, have different lengths and different 5′ and 3′ ends. Some of these isomiRs are detected as varied nucleotides and 3′ additional non-template nucleotides. As physiological miRNA isoforms, they have drawn attention for possible regulatory biological roles. The present work mainly reviews miRNA/isomiR biogenesis, isomiR expression patterns, and functional and evolutionary implications, especially between isomiRs from homologous and clustered miRNA loci. The phenomenon of multiple isomiRs and their biological roles indicates that analysis performed at the miRNA and isomiR levels should be included in miRNA studies. This may enrich and complicate miRNA biogenesis and coding–non-coding RNA regulatory networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3aloci 3amicroRNA 3anucleotides 0amiRNA 0apri-miRNA 0apre-miRNA 0amiRNA* 0aUTRs 0aSNPs 0aRISC 0aaca 0abta 0acfa 0acgr 0adre 0agga 0aeca 0aggo 0ahsa 0amdo 0amml 0ammu 0aoan 0aoar 0aola 0apma 0appa 0appy 0aptr 0arno 0assc 0atgu 0axtr 0aMicroRNA (miRNA) 0aIsomiR 0aExpression pattern 0aEvolutionary pattern1 aChen, Feng0 tGene.g2014 July 01, v. 544 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015100160500001900311520193500330592002802265650002602293650002902319650002202348650001402370650002502384650001402409650000902423650001602432650001202448650001302460650001302473650001402486650001702500650001102517653001102528653001102539653001502550700001402565700001302579700001902592700001602611700001502627700005702642773012102699856008202820852000902902655001202911IND60713312820221121015228.0201202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071331282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2020.1038842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kang14aThe involvement of TNF-α and TNF-β as proinflammatory cytokines in lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity of Nile tilapia by initiating apoptosis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTumor necrosis factors (TNFs) are pleiotropic cytokines with important functions in homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Recent advances have shown that TNFs are also involved in the regulation of adaptive immune responses. However, the knowledge about how TNF participates in and regulates adaptive immune response in early vertebrates is still limited. In present study, we identified two isoforms of TNF, TNF-α and TNF-β, from Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (On-TNF-α and β). After analyzing the sequence characteristics, we investigated their regulatory roles in adaptive immune response of this fish species. On-TNF-α and β are evolutionarily conserved compare with their homologs from other vertebrates. Both TNFs were distributed in a wide range of tissues in O. niloticus, and with relative higher expression level in gill. After the animals were infected by Streptococcus agalactiae, mRNA levels of On-TNF-α and TNF-β in spleen lymphocytes were significantly upregulated during the primary response stage of adaptive immunity. Meanwhile, both TNF proteins in spleen lymphocytes were also dramatically elevated during the adaptive immune stage after bacterial infection. These results indicate the potential participation of On-TNF-α and TNF-β in adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia. Furthermore, On-TNF-α and β transcripts were obviously augmented, once spleen lymphocytes were activated by T cell-specific mitogen PHA. More importantly, both recombinant On-TNF-α and β could induce the apoptosis of head-kidney leukocytes of Nile tilapia. And On-TNF-β but not On-TNF-α promoted the apoptosis by activating caspase-8 in the target cells. Altogether, our study revealed that TNF-α and TNF-β participated in the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia by initiating the apoptosis, and thus shed novel perspective for the regulatory mechanism of adaptive immunity in teleost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aadaptive immunity 3aapoptosis 3abacterial infections 3acaspase-8 3afish 3ahomeostasis 3akidneys 3amitogens 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3aspleen 0aTNF-α 0aTNF-β 0aLymphocyte1 aQiu, Hong1 aYan, Jie1 aShen, Xiaotong1 aWei, Xiumei1 aDuan, Ming1 aYang, Jialong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3112-50120 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2021 Feb., v. 115 p.103884-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2020.1038843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245014300167300001800310500002000328520201100348592002802359650002102387650002002408650001402428650002002442650001402462650002302476650002302499650002802522650001202550650001702562650001802579650001602597650001902613650002302632650001102655650001502666650001002681650001402691650003002705700001802735700001502753700001602768700002602784700001702810700002502827700001702852700001502869700001902884773012602903856007303029852000903102655001203111IND60588132920221120210106.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058813292DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.223152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashmi, Muhammad Zaffar10aEffects of structurally different noncoplanar and coplanar PCBs on HELF cell proliferation, cell cycle, and potential molecular mechanisms  ap. 1183-1190.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of chemicals that persist in the environment, indoors, and humans. Lung exposure to airborne and food contaminants, such as PCBs, may cause possible lung disorders, such as cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of structurally different lower chlorinated (≤4Cl), noncoplanar PCB40, and coplanar PCB77 on human lung fibroblast cell line (HELF) cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and possible molecular mechanisms. Noncoplanar PCB40 and coplanar PCB77 exhibited concentration‐ and time‐dependent biphasic dose–response effects on HELF cell proliferation. Noncoplanar PCB40 and coplanar PCB77 induced 23 and 45% cytotoxicity at higher concentrations than the control. The flow cytometry analysis showed that exposure to PCB40 caused a significant increase in time spent in the G1 phase but decreased length of the S phase in a concentration‐ and time‐dependent manner, whereas PCB77 exposure decreased time spent in the G1 and S phases but increased time spent in the G2 phase. Western blot analysis indicated that PCB77 increased the expression of cyclin E, CDK2, p21, and caspase‐9, while PCB40 decreased the expression of these proteins (except CDK2 and p21). An increase in CDK expression after exposure to PCB77 suggests that it may cause carcinogenic effects on HELF cells at higher doses. Our results also demonstrate that the different cytotoxic effects induced by coplanar and nonplanar PCBs were correlated with their structural characteristics; the coplanar congener was more cytotoxic than the nonplanar congener. The study elaborates threshold levels for these chemicals and suggests that the cytotoxicity mechanisms by which PCB congeners act on HELF cells depend on their planarity and chemical structures. Furthermore, the study will be important for developing antidotes to the adverse effects and risk assessment practices for PCBs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Strawberry growers face many challenges related to weather, cultivation, and markets. Decision support tools can help optimize strawberry production but require sound models or other predictive tools as a foundation. The goal of this study was to improve a new CROPGRO-Strawberry model in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) using experimental data with observations from different seasons and multiple cultivars. Model improvements were made in three primary areas: 1) cardinal temperatures for different development processes, 2) a module for the dynamic assimilate partitioning based on photothermal age, and 3) improvement of the cultivar and ecotype coefficients. The model predicts the growth, development, and fruit production of strawberry over time using weather, soil, management and physiological parameters as inputs. Overall, the results show a good simulation of development and growth (d = 0.77 to 0.99, RRMSE = 0.26 to 0.68), but an overestimation of vegetative growth during the early season. Periodic and cumulative fruit harvests were well-simulated (d = 0.91, RRMSE 0.47), capturing the seasonal dynamics and representing differences among cultivars and harvest intervals. A strategic analysis showed the applicability of the crop model to understand and manage the impact of seasonal climate variability on total strawberry yield as well as the distribution of fruit production across different harvest months. Future work should include improvements in the simulation of vegetative growth and evaluation against new datasets representing different production environments and cultivars. The improved CROPGRO-Strawberry model will enable future work on applications to other specialty crops where modeling of continuous fruiting and multiple harvests of individual fruit instead of one end-of-season harvest is desired.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acrop models 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aecotypes 3afruits 3ahorticultural crops 3asoil 3astrawberries 3avegetative growth 3aweather 3aworld markets 3aFlorida 0aStrawberry 0aFragaria × Ananassa 0aDSSAT 0aCrop model 0aProcess-based model 0aYield forecast 0aPhysiology model 0aPeriodic harvests 0aSubtropical strawberry production 0aCSM-CROPGRO1 aBoote, Kenneth J.1 aOh, Juhyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1189-06301 aGuan, Zhengfei1 aAgehara, Shinsuke1 aShelia, Vakhtang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9768-79581 aWhitaker, Vance M.1 aAsseng, Senthold1 aZhao, Xin1 aHoogenboom, Gerrit0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110538-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245010600173300001800279500002000297520127000317592002801587596005501615596005401670596005401724596008901778596008701867596004201954596007101996650002402067650001802091650001202109650001102121650001602132650002102148650001202169650001702181650001102198650001202209650001602221650001702237650002302254650002702277650001502304650001602319700002702335700003402362700002902396700003602425700002902461700003302490700002702523700002202550773011102572856008002683852000902763655001202772IND60790315220221122222106.0220824e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079031522DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.124752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatuz‐Mares, Deyamira10aExpression of alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH‐2) in the phytopathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis  ap. 1267-1279.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aType 2 alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH‐2) participate indirectly in the generation of the electrochemical proton gradient by transferring electrons from NADH and NADPH into the ubiquinone pool. Due to their structural simplicity, alternative NADH dehydrogenases have been proposed as useful tools for gene therapy of cells with defects in the respiratory complex I. In this work, we report the presence of three open reading frames, which correspond to NDH‐2 genes in the genome of Ustilago maydis. These three genes were constitutively transcribed in cells cultured in YPD and minimal medium with glucose, ethanol, or lactate as carbon sources. Proteomic analysis showed that only two of the three NDH‐2 were associated with isolated mitochondria in all culture media. Oxygen consumption by permeabilized cells using NADH or NADPH was different for each condition, opening the possibility of posttranslational regulation. We confirmed the presence of both external and internal NADH dehydrogenases, as well as an external NADPH dehydrogenase insensitive to calcium. Higher oxygen consumption rates were observed during the exponential growth phase, suggesting that the activity of NADH and NADPH dehydrogenases is coupled to the dynamics of cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a20150761cSecretaría de Investigación y Posgrado  a238497cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  a254904cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aIN222117cPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica  a238497cPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica  cInstituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)  cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico (DGAPA UNAM) 3aNADPH dehydrogenase 3aUstilago zeae 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aelectrochemistry 3aethanol 3agene therapy 3agenome 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3amitochondria 3aoxygen consumption 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproteomics 3aubiquinones1 aMatus‐Ortega, Genaro1 aCárdenas‐Monroy, Christian1 aRomero‐Aguilar, Lucero1 aVillalobos‐Rocha, Juan Carlos1 aVázquez‐Meza, Héctor1 aGuerra‐Sánchez, Guadalupe1 aPeña‐Díaz, Antonio1 aPardo, Juan Pablo0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.1267-1279dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.124753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245010900204300001600313506007600329520082900405592002801234506003701262650002401299650001001323650001701333650001801350650001901368650001601387650002101403650001401424650001901438650001701457650001901474650001301493653002401506653001901530653002101549653001901570700001701589700001801606773017601624856008101800852000901881655001201890IND60612266120221207122611.0180905e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061226612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0022doi7 aPMC48227692pmcid7 a268872542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yuntong14aThe dynamic structure of Spitzenkörpers of Trichosporon asahii examined by the fluorescent probe FM4-64  ap. 266-269.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Spitzenkörper is a dynamic and specialized multicomponent cell complex present in the tips of hyphal cells. The amphiphilic styryl dye FM4-64 was found to be ideal for imaging the dynamic changes of the apical vesicle cluster within growing hyphal tips. It is widely used as a marker of endocytosis and to visualize vacuolar membranes. Here we performed uptake experiments using FM4-64 to study the dynamic of the Spitzenkörper in Trichosporon asahii. We observed that Spitzenkörpers were present at the tip of the budding site of the spore, blastospore, and the germ tube of T. asahii. We also found that Spitzenkörpers were present at the tip of the hyphae as well as the subapical regions. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, leads to abnormal Spitzenkörper formation and loss of cell polarity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichosporon asahii 3aactin 3ablastospores 3acell polarity 3acytochalasin D 3aendocytosis 3afluorescent dyes 3agerm tube 3aimage analysis 3amicrobiology 3apolymerization 3avacuoles 0aTrichosporon asahii 0aSpitzenkörper 0aPolarized growth 0aCytochalasin D1 aXia, Zhikuan1 aWang, Wenling0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Jan.,  Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.266-269dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176520194600278592002802224650003602252650002002288650002302308650000802331650001802339650001202357650001202369650002402381650001102405650002802416650002102444650002002465650001402485650002302499650002402522650001402546653002502560653002702585653002002612653002002632653001402652700005702666700006202723700002002785700001802805700005902823700003002882700007102912700006302983773010903046856008603155852000903241655001203250IND60749966220221119182910.0211029e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074996622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrzegorzewska, Maria14aThe effect of hot water treatment on the storage ability improvement of fresh-cut Chinese cabbage  aFresh-cut Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) was subjected to hot water treatment (HWT) at different temperatures (38–57°C) and duration (3 s – 20 min.), followed by ambient air cooling. After treatment, the cabbage was stored at different temperatures: 0°C, 5°C and 15°C. Fresh-cut cabbage (untreated) served as the control object. During storage, quality assessments and sensory evaluation were performed. Additionally, nutrient content and microbial contamination were determined. Chinese cabbage responded in a variety of ways to hot water treatment. Positive and stable reactions were obtained for cabbage after short treatment in a water bath at 53°C and 55°C for 3 s. These treatments delayed unfavourable quality alterations of fresh-cut cabbage, such as cut surface browning and rotting of leaf pieces at all storage temperatures. The development of off-odors and off-tastes was significantly inhibited in cabbage after HWT and short storage at 15°C. In general, the treatments did not influence the nutritional value of the cabbage. The concentrations of ascorbic acid, total sugars, soluble phenols and antiradical activity did not differ significantly in treated and non-treated material. Only the content of nitrates in cabbage stored at 15°C decreased significantly in all objects and the lowest amount was found for cabbage dipped in tap water.The intensive multiplication of yeasts and coliforms was noticed on fresh-cut Chinese cabbage after 3 days of storage at 15°C. A lower storage temperature (0°C) significantly inhibited microbial development in the cabbage, and especially yeasts and coliforms. The dipping of cut cabbage in tap water had no significant effect on the number of yeasts and coliforms, but increased mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae compared to cut, untreated cabbage. HWT at 53°C and 55°C decreased the number of Enterobacteriaceae over 7 days of storage at 5°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aair 3aascorbic acid 3acabbage 3acooling 3ahot water treatment 3aleaves 3amicrobial contamination 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aoff odors 3asensory evaluation 3astorage temperature 3atap water 0aFresh-cut vegetables 0aPost-cutting treatment 0aStorage quality 0aSensory quality 0aNutrients1 aBadełek, Ewa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9182-34371 aSzczech, Magdalena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8408-69371 aKosson, Ryszard1 aWrzodak, Anna1 aKowalska, Beata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7067-32331 aColelli, G.q(Giancarlo),1 aSzwejda-Grzybowska, Justyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1260-58971 aMaciorowski, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1059-42390 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1105513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010400167300001600271500002000287500001500307520248100322592002802803650002302831650001902854650001302873650001502886650002502901650002402926650002702950650002002977650001302997650001903010650002403029650001703053650001503070650002203085650001403107650001803121650001803139650001403157650001303171650001303184650001003197653001703207700002303224700001603247700001903263700003003282773009603312856007303408852000903481655001203490IND60571220620221118002249.0170712e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057122062DNAL7 a10.1890/09-0666.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPostma-Blaauw, Maria B.10aSoil biota community structure and abundance under agricultural intensification and extensification  ap. 460-473.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aUnderstanding the impacts of agricultural intensification and extensification on soil biota communities is useful in order to preserve and restore biological diversity in agricultural soils and enhance the role of soil biota in agroecosystem functioning. Over four consecutive years, we investigated the effects of agricultural intensification and extensification (including conversion of grassland to arable land and vice versa, increased and decreased levels of mineral fertilization, and monoculture compared to crop rotation) on major soil biota group abundances and functional diversity. We integrated and compared effects across taxonomic levels to identify sensitive species groups. Conversion of grassland to arable land negatively affected both abundances and functional diversity of soil biota. Further intensification of the cropping system by increased fertilization and reduced crop diversity exerted smaller and differential effects on different soil biota groups. Agricultural intensification affected abundances of taxonomic groups with larger body size (earthworms, enchytraeids, microarthropods, and nematodes) more negatively than smaller‐sized taxonomic groups (protozoans, bacteria, and fungi). Also functional group diversity and composition were more negatively affected in larger‐sized soil biota (earthworms, predatory mites) than in smaller‐sized soil biota (nematodes). Furthermore, larger soil biota appeared to be primarily affected by short‐term consequences of conversion (disturbance, loss of habitat), whereas smaller soil biota were predominantly affected by long‐term consequences (probably loss of organic matter). Reestablishment of grassland resulted in increased abundances of soil biota groups, but since not all groups increased in the same measure, the community structure was not completely restored. We concluded that larger‐sized soil biota are more sensitive to agricultural intensification than smaller‐sized soil biota. Furthermore, since larger‐sized soil biota groups had lower taxonomic richness, we suggest that agricultural intensification exerts strongest effects on species‐poor soil biota groups, thus supporting the hypothesis that biodiversity has an “insurance” function. As soil biota play an important role in agroecosystem functioning, altered soil biota abundances and functional group composition under agricultural intensification are likely to affect the functioning of the agroecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aorganic matter 3aProtozoa 3agrasslands 3afunctional diversity 3amineral fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3apredatory mites 3aNematoda 3aagroecosystems 3acommunity structure 3aarable soils 3aearthworms 3aintensive farming 3ainsurance 3acrop rotation 3aEnchytraeidae 3abody size 3ahabitats 3abacteria 3afungi 0abiodiversity1 ade Goede, Ron G.

Nitrification in an acidic orchard soil amended with peanut shell biochar (PBC) produced at 400°C was investigated. Nitrification was weakened by PBC addition due to the decreased NH4+-N content and reduced ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance in PBC-amended soils. Adding phenolic compounds (PHCs) free biochar (PBC-P) increased the AOB abundance and the DGGE band number, indicating that PHCs remaining in the PBC likely reduced AOB abundance and diversity. However, PBC addition stimulated rape growth and increased N bioavailability. Overall, adding PBC could suppress the nitrification process and improve N bioavailability in the agricultural soils, and thus possibly mitigate the environmental negative impacts and improving N use efficiency in the acidic soils added with N fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aagricultural soils 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aorchard soils 3apeanuts 3aphenolic compounds 3asoil amendments 0aBiochar 0aNitrification 0aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria 0aAcidic soil 0aPhenolic compounds1 aZong, Haiying1 aZheng, Hao1 aLiu, Guocheng1 aChen, Lei1 aXing, Baoshan0 tChemosphere.g2015 Nov., v. 138 p.576-583dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017100156300001800327500002000345520172900365592002802094650002602122650002102148650001902169650001802188650001002206650001802216650001902234650001402253650001802267650001002285650001902295650000902314650001702323650001202340650002102352650001802373700002202391700002302413700002102436700002702457700002002484700002202504700002802526773012602554856007302680852000902753655001202762IND60588133020221120223814.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058813302DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.223312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuron, Nelly10aChronic and low exposure to a pharmaceutical cocktail induces mitochondrial dysfunction in liver and hyperglycemia: Differential responses between lean and obese mice  ap. 1375-1389.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPharmaceuticals are found in the environment but the impact of this contamination on human and animal health is poorly known. The liver could be particularly targeted since a significant number of these drugs are hepatotoxic, in particular via oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, the latter events can also be observed in liver diseases linked to obesity, so that the obese liver might be more sensitive to drug toxicity. In this study, we determined the effects of a chronic exposure to low doses of pharmaceuticals in wild‐type and obese mice, with a particular focus on mitochondrial function. To this end, wild‐type and ob/ob mice were exposed for 4 months to a cocktail of 11 pharmaceuticals provided in drinking water containing 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/L of each drug. At the end of the treatment, liver mitochondria were isolated and different parameters were measured. Chronic exposure to the pharmaceuticals reduced mitochondrial respiration driven by succinate and palmitoyl‐l‐carnitine in wild‐type mice and increased antimycin‐induced ROS production in ob/ob mice. Hyperglycemia and hepatic histological abnormalities were also observed in treated ob/ob mice. Investigations were also carried out in isolated liver mitochondria incubated with the mixture, or with each individual drug. The mitochondrial effects of the mixture were different from those observed in treated mice and could not be predicted from the results obtained with each drug. Because some of the 11 drugs included in our cocktail can be found in water at relatively high concentrations, our data could be relevant in environmental toxicology. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here we report a new relationship between Hop and the nuclear structural protein emerin in maintenance of nuclear morphology. Depletion or overexpression of Hop resulted in the reduction of emerin protein levels via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that Hop and emerin are in a common complex, which could accommodate Hsp70 but not Hsp90, and that TPR2AB is required for the association. Loss of Hop or emerin led to a deformation of nuclear structure, a statistically significant decrease in nuclear size, and was associated with changes in the levels of nuclear proteins, lamin A-C and fibrillarin. The nuclear defects upon Hop loss could be rescued by emerin overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest that Hop stabilises emerin and that loss of Hop alters nuclear structure via emerin degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3adeformation 3anuclear proteins 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein content 3astructural proteins 0aHop 0aSTIP1 0aEmerin 0aNucleus 0aHsp90 0aHsp701 aEdkins, Adrienne Lesley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3615-66510 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Dec. 09, v. 507, no. 1-4 p.503-509dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245012000207300001400327506007600341520101500417592002801432506003701460650002001497650002301517650002701540650001601567650001401583650002201597650002001619650002801639650002001667650002601687650001701713650001601730650001301746650001201759650001601771653001501787653001501802653002601817653002301843700002201866700002601888773017401914856008102088852000902169655001202178IND60612266220221207122609.0180905e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061226622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0032doi7 aPMC48227682pmcid7 a268872212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Rashmi,14aThe improvement of competitive saprophytic capabilities of Trichoderma species through the use of chemical mutagens  ap. 10-17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe antagonistic potential of Trichoderma strains was assayed by studying the effect of their culture filtrate on the radial growth of Sclerotium rolfsii, the causal agent of chickpea collar rot. Trichoderma harzianum-1432 (42.2%) and Trichoderma atroviride (40.3%) were found to be strong antagonists. To enhance their antagonistic potential, mutagenesis of these two selected strains was performed. Two mutants, Th-m1 and T. atroviride m1, were found to be more effective than their parent strains. The enzymatic activities of the selected parent and mutant strains were assayed, and although both mutants were found to have enhanced enzymatic activities compared to their respective parent strains, Th-m1 possessed the maximum cellulase (5.69U/mL) and β-1,3-glucanase activity (61.9U/mL). Th-m1 also showed high competitive saprophytic ability (CSA) among all of the selected parent and mutant strains, and during field experiments, Th-m1 was found to successfully possess enhanced disease control (82.9%).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aSclerotium (genus) 3aTrichoderma atroviride 3aantagonists 3achickpeas 3aculture filtrates 3adisease control 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3amicrobiology 3amutagenesis 3amutagens 3amutants 3asaprophytes 0aBiocontrol 0aCollar rot 0aTrichoderma harzianum 0aSclerotium rolfsii1 aMaurya, Sudarshan1 aUpadhyay, Ram Sanmukh0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Jan.,  Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.10-17dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300002000274500001900294520130500313592002801618650002201646650001101668650001501679650003001694650002101724650002401745650001501769650002101784650003701805700002701842700001801869700001601887700001801903700001701921700002001938700001901958700002101977773014401998856007402142852000902216655001202225IND60720721120221120131212.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072072112DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta09299a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwak, In Hye10aAnisotropic alloying of Re₁₋ₓMoₓS₂ nanosheets to boost the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 25131-25141.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides have recently attracted much attention as excellent electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Re₁₋ₓMoₓS₂ alloy nanosheets in the entire composition range were synthesized using a hydrothermal reaction. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed anisotropic atomic distribution of the alloy phase, in which the Re and Mo atoms tend to segregate along a crystallographic axis. The phase transition occurs from the triclinic phase (1T′′) ReS₂ to the monoclinic phase (1T′) MoS₂ at 50% Mo. Re₀.₅Mo₀.₅S₂ exhibited the highest electrocatalytic HER activity, which was characterized by a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at an overpotential of 98 mV (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec⁻¹ in 0.5 M H₂SO₄. Extensive calculations using spin-polarized density functional theory showed that the most energetically stable configuration consists of separated MoS₂ and ReS₂ domains along the b axis, and the 1T′′ → 1T′ phase transition at 50% Mo, which agrees with the experimental results. The Gibbs free energy along the HER pathway indicates that the best performance at Mo 50% is due to the formation of S–H or Mo–H (at S vacancies) on the MoS₂ domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aalloys 3aanisotropy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3aphase transition 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDebela, Tekalign Terfa1 aKwon, Ik Seon1 aSeo, Jaemin1 aYoo, Seung Jo1 aKim, Jin-Gyu1 aAhn, Jae-Pyoung1 aPark, Jeunghee1 aKang, Hong-Seok,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 47 p.25131-25141dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta09299a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245010600160300001800266500002000284520191900304592002802223650001502251650002102266650001102287650001302298650001102311650001502322650001302337650001702350650001402367650001602381700001802397700001702415700001402432700001902446700001602465700001502481773011202496856008002608852000902688655001202697IND60790315620221122164341.0220824e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079031562DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.124832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Baoqi10aComprehensive analysis of key genes, microRNAs and long non‐coding RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 1424-1436.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common aggressive cancer whose molecular mechanism remains elusive. We aimed to identify the key genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved with HCC. We obtained mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA profiles for HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and then identified differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). We performed functional annotation of DEmRNAs and then constructed HCC‐specific DEmiRNA–DEmRNA, DEmiRNA–DElncRNA and DElncRNA–DEmiRNA–DEmRNA interaction networks. We searched for nearby target cis‐DEmRNAs of DElncRNAs and performed receiver operating characteristic and survival analyses. A total of 1239 DEmRNAs, 33 DEmiRNAs and 167 DElncRNAs in HCC were obtained. Retinol metabolism [false discovery rate (FDR) = 7.02 × 10⁻¹⁴] and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (FDR = 7.30 × 10⁻¹¹) were two significantly enriched pathways in HCC. We obtained 545 DEmiRNA–DEmRNA pairs that consisted of 258 DEmRNAs and 28 DEmiRNAs in HCC. mir‐424, miR‐93 and miR‐3607 are three hub DEmiRNAs of the HCC‐specific DEmiRNA–DEmRNA interaction network. HAND2‐AS1/ENSG00000232855–miR‐93–LRAT/RND3, ENSG00000232855–miR‐877–RCAN1 and ENSG00000232855–miR‐224–RND3 interactions were found in the HCC‐specific DElncRNA–DEmiRNA–DEmRNA interaction network. A total of three DElncRNA–nearby target DEmRNA pairs (HCG25–KIFC1, LOC105378687–CDC20 and LOC101927043–EPCAM) in HCC were obtained. Diagnostic and prognostic values of several selected DElncRNAs, DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs for HCC were assessed. Our study identified several DEmRNAs, DEmiRNAs and DElncRNAs with great diagnostic or prognostic value for HCC, which may facilitate studies into the molecular mechanisms, and development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic target sites for HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acytochrome P-450 3agenome 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3atherapeutics 3avitamin A 3axenobiotics1 aZhang, Xuejun1 aChao, Lumeng1 aZheng, Yu1 aTan, Yongsheng1 aWang, Liang1 aZhang, Wei0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.1424-1436dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.124833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245020000158300001800358500002000376520199400396592002802390650001802418650001602436650002102452650001402473650001602487650002302503650001902526650001202545650002302557650001402580650002302594650001602617650001102633650001002644650002502654650001502679650003902694650001502733700001902748700001802767700002102785700002102806700001902827700002302846773012602869856007302995852000903068655001203077IND60588133220221120224031.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058813322DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.223372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGo, Ryeo‐Eun10aFludioxonil induced the cancer growth and metastasis via altering epithelial–mesenchymal transition via an estrogen receptor‐dependent pathway in cellular and xenografted breast cancer models  ap. 1439-1454.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFludioxonil is an antifungal agent used in agricultural applications that is present at measurable amounts in fruits and vegetables. In this study, the effects of fludioxonil on cancer cell viability, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis were examined in MCF‐7 clonal variant breast cancer cell (MCF‐7 CV cells) with estrogen receptors (ERs). MCF‐7 CV cells were cultured with 0.1% DMSO (control), 17β‐estradiol (E2; 1 ×10⁻⁹ M, positive control), or fludioxonil (10⁻⁵−10⁻⁸ M). MTT assay revealed that fludioxonil increased MCF‐7 CV cell proliferation 1.2 to 1.5 times compared to the control, while E2 markedly increased the cell proliferation by about 3.5 times. When the samples were co‐treated with ICI 182,780 (10⁻⁸ M), an ER antagonist, fludioxonil‐induced cell proliferation was reversed to the level of the control. Protein levels of cyclin E1, cyclin D1, Snail, and N‐cadherin increased in response to fludioxonil as the reaction to E2, but these increases were not observed when fludioxonil was administered with ICI 182,780. Moreover, the protein level of p21 and E‐cadherin decreased in response to treatment with fludioxonil, but remained at the control level when co‐treated with ICI 182,780. In xenografted mouse models transplanted with MCF‐7 CV cells, fludioxonil significantly increased the tumor mass formation by about 2.5 times as E2 did when compared to vehicle (0.1% DMSO) during the experimental period (80 days). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the protein level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Snail, and cathepsin D increased in response to fludioxonil as the reaction to E2. These results imply that fludioxonil may have a potential to induce growth or metastatic behaviors of breast cancer by regulation of the expression of cell cycle‐, EMT‐, and metastasis‐related genes via the ER‐dependent pathway. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Complex mapping of Zinnia mesophyll cell transdifferentiation into tracheary elements with or without prior cell division was documented after palisade and spongy parenchyma cell immobilization during the first 4 days of culture. Here, we report a positive effect of galactoglucomannan oligosaccharides on cell viability and density and higher metaxylem-like tracheary element formation in xylogenic cell culture. The maximal positive effect was achieved by the simultaneous addition of the oligosaccharides and growth hormones (auxin, cytokinin) to the cell culture medium. Moreover, a large number of metaxylem-like tracheary elements were observed in a low-auxin medium supplemented with oligosaccharides, but not in a low-cytokinin medium, suggesting a close relationship between auxin and the oligosaccharides during tracheary element formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZinnia 3aauxins 3acell culture 3acell division 3acell viability 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3ahormones 3aoligosaccharides 3atracheary elements 2aAsteraceaexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Transdifferentiation 2aCells, Cultured 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aCytokininsxpharmacology 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aMannansxpharmacology 2aMesophyll Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aXylemxgrowth & development1 aDigonnet, Catherine1 aGoffner, Deborah1 aLišková, Desana0 tPlant cell reports.g2013 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.479-487dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-012-1379-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245008900171300001600260520088000276592002801156650001501184650001401199650001401213650001401227650001901241650002201260650000901282650001401291650002201305650001501327650002001342653003501362653002001397653002201417653001901439653001401458653002201472700001501494700001701509700001701526700001701543700001201560773007701572856008901649852000901738655001201747IND60545475820221119153508.0160902e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054547582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Rong10aRemoving pentachlorophenol from water using a nanoscale zero-valent iron/H2O2 system  ap. 138-143.  aNanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an environmentally benign material that has been widely used as a reducing agent to treat environmental pollutants. In this study, nZVI was used as a heterogeneous Fenton catalyst in an nZVI/H2O2 system to remove pentachlorophenol (PCP) from water. The PCP degradation process in the nZVI/H2O2 system was completed within 1h. The relative Cl− concentration increased throughout the test period (6h), indicating that the performance of the oxidative system in terms of dechlorination was excellent. The initial H2O2 concentration significantly influenced the PCP removal rate, and nZVI performed better than commercial zero-valent iron as a catalyst. Moreover, magnetite (Fe3O4), which was the main product of the corrosion of nZVI, was found to perform well as an adsorbent and catalyst, so it allowed the nZVI to be effectively reused.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acorrosion 3adechlorination 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amagnetite 3apentachlorophenol 3apollutants 3areducing agents 0aZero-valent iron nanoparticles 0aFenton reaction 0aPentachlorophenol 0aDechlorination 0aMagnetite 0aHydrogen peroxide1 aCheng, Can1 aLiu, Guo-hua1 aZheng, Xiang1 aLi, Guanqing1 aLi, Jie0 tChemosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 141 p.138-143dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137100002800155245008100183300001400264520158700278592002801865650000801893650001301901650001401914650001301928650002401941650001301965650001601978650002201994650001802016650001602034773009402050856009102144852000902235655001202244IND4479698620221118221217.0141110e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447969862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatchatourian, Oleg A.10aExperimental study and mathematical model for soya bean drying in thin layer  ap. 54-64.  aThin-layer drying tests were conducted for soya bean in the temperature range 45–120 °C, velocity range 0–3 m s⁻¹, initial grain moisture content 0.13–0.32 dec., d.b., with variations in relative air humidity 5–50%. To generate air of required humidity the water vapour was injected after the air heater. The influence of velocity on drying dynamics essentially depends on initial grain moisture content. At low values of initial grain moisture content (<0.22 dec., d.b.) influence of velocity was practically absent. At high moisture content (>0.32 dec., d.b.) increases in air velocity (from 0.12 m s⁻¹ up to 0.37 m s⁻¹) led initially to acceleration in the drying process. Subsequent increases in velocity (from 0.5 m s⁻¹ up to 2.5 m s⁻¹) did not practically influence drying dynamics. In the absence of airflow the drying ratio is less essential than even the lowest velocity (0.12 m s⁻¹) used in the experiments. The increases in air humidity that slows down the drying process are related with the increase in value of the equilibrium moisture content. The dependences of the moisture ratio with time under identical initial condition did not practically depend on air humidity. To describe the experimental results obtained it was proposed to consider the soya bean seed as composed of two compartments with different transfer coefficients. The resulting thin-layer drying model consisted of two ordinary differential equations, considered the influence of all the studied parameters and satisfactorily described all experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aequations 3ahumidity 3amathematical models 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3athin-layer drying 3awater content 3awater vapor0 tBiosystems engineering.g2012 Sept., v. 113, no. 1 p.54-64dElsevier Ltdx1537-51107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008600161520067500247592002800922650001300950650001100963650001900974650001800993650001201011650001601023650001501039650001701054650001201071650001401083653004401097653002401141653003201165653001701197700001201214700001601226700001601242700001901258700001401277700001501291773011801306856008201424852000901506655001201515IND60749966620221119182924.0211001e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074996662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2021.1043312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lin10aPhytochemical and chemotaxonomic study on Fallopia dentatoalata (Fr.

Owing to the excellent optical, electrochemical, and charge transport properties of these polymers, impressive PCEs of 10.99 and 13.96% were achieved by the inverted-type lab-scale spin-coated devices based on PB-QxF and PBF-QxF, respectively, in the presence of a nonfullerene Y6 acceptor. In addition, to evaluate the feasibility of the process for mass production, a scalable roll-to-roll (R2R) slot-die coating process was attempted to fabricate PSCs on flexible substrates. Notably, the best PCE of 9.63% was obtained using an R2R processed additive-free PSC based on PBF-QxF, which is the highest value among all R2R processed PSCs. Moreover, the device with PBF-QxF exhibited good thickness tolerance to PCE up to 350 nm, which is one of the key requirements for R2R compatible materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorine 3apolymers1 aKo, Seo-Jin1 aAn, Na Gyeong1 aWhang, Dong Ryeol1 aLee, Seung-Hoon1 aAhn, Hyungju1 aKim, Jin Young1 aVak, Doojin1 aYoon, Sung Cheol1 aChang, Dong Wook0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 47 p.25208-25216dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta09354h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245011900190300001800309520187000327592002802197650001302225650002502238650001302263650000902276650001102285650002002296650002202316650002602338650000902364650002102373650001102394650001102405650001202416650001102428650002302439650000902462650002902471650003402500650002102534650001102555650004102566650005902607700002302666700001802689700002202707773011802729856008102847852000902928655001202937IND60081346120221123000453.0140831e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008134612DNAL7 a248793632pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3857-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMil-Homens, Mário,10aComparing spatial and temporal changes in metal trends (Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn) on the Portuguese shelf since the 1970s  ap. 6327-6340.  aComparison between an archive dataset, collected during the 1970s (1974–1977), and samples taken during the PALEO1 cruise (2002) enabled evaluation of large-scale and long-term spatiotemporal changes in Al, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn contents in bulk surface sediments in four areas of the Portuguese shelf. The so-called gradient method (GM) with normalisation to Al, a proxy for terrigenous clay content, was applied. The studied areas are distributed from north to south along the western margin, with the northernmost located off shore the Ave and Douro rivers, a central one located off shore the Lis River and a southern one located off shore the Mira River. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to identify differences among study areas and periods of sample collection. A comparison of metal contents in 2002 samples with the Portuguese classification scheme regulation for deposition of dredged materials in coastal areas indicates good environmental quality in terms of Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn levels. Nevertheless, the GM results suggest an increase in metal loadings relative to Al from the 1970s to the 2002 samples (except for Pb). The Algarve area on the southern shelf is characterised by having high number of sites with metal level on class 2. These high values have traditionally been explained by a substantial supply of natural metals from the Guadiana, Tinto and Odiel rivers that drain areas Iberian Pyrite Belt formations. This supply has probably been magnified by present and past mining activities. For quality evaluation of marine sediments, especially when using total metal contents, this study shows the importance of considering all possible sources of metal loading. The natural grain size and composition variability have also a crucial influence on the metal content, and the combined evaluation allows a more holistic perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanalysis of variance 3achromium 3aclay 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adredged materials 3aenvironmental quality 3alead 3amarine sediments 3amining 3anickel 3apyrites 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aMining 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data1 aStevens, Rodney L.1 aCato, Ingemar1 aAbrantes, Fatima,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Oct., v. 186, no. 10 p.6327-6340dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3857-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003000188245011600218300001400334506007600348520159800424592002802022506003702050650002002087650002702107650002302134650001602157650002102173650001902194650002302213650002302236650001102259650001502270650001102285650001402296650002002310650002602330650001302356650003002369650001202399650001302411650001302424650000702437650002702444650001602471650001202487650001402499650001602513650001202529650000902541653001602550653002402566653001402590653002102604653002402625700001802649700001902667773013502686856008102821852000902902655001202911IND60612266620221207123520.0180905e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061226662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0072doi7 aPMC48227592pmcid7 a268872232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallikharjuna Rao, K.L.N.10aCultural conditions on the production of extracellular enzymes by Trichoderma isolates from tobacco rhizosphere  ap. 25-32.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwelve isolates of Trichoderma spp. isolated from tobacco rhizosphere were evaluated for their ability to produce chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Isolates ThJt1 and TvHt2, out of 12 isolates, produced maximum activities of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase, respectively. In vitro production of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase by isolates ThJt1 and TvHt2 was tested under different cultural conditions. The enzyme activities were significantly influenced by acidic pH and the optimum temperature was 30°C. The chitin and cell walls of Sclerotium rolfsii, as carbon sources, supported the maximum and significantly higher chitinase activity by both isolates. The chitinase activity of isolate ThJt1 was suppressed significantly by fructose (80.28%), followed by glucose (77.42%), whereas the β-1,3-glucanase activity of ThJt1 and both enzymes of isolate TvHt2 were significantly suppressed by fructose, followed by sucrose. Ammonium nitrate as nitrogen source supported the maximum activity of chitinase in both isolates, whereas urea was a poor nitrogen source. Production of both enzymes by the isolates was significantly influenced by the cultural conditions. Thus, the isolates ThJt1 and TvHt2 showed higher levels of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities and were capable of hydrolyzing the mycelium of S. rolfsii infecting tobacco. These organisms can be used therefore for assessment of their synergism in biomass production and biocontrol efficacy and for their field biocontrol ability against S. rolfsii and Pythium aphanidermatum infecting tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aSclerotium (genus) 3aTrichoderma 3aammonium nitrate 3abeta-glucanase 3abiological control 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acell walls 3achitin 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afructose 3afungal diseases of plants 3aglucose 3amycelium 3anitrogen 3apH 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arhizosphere 3asucrose 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atobacco 3aurea 0aTrichoderma 0aCultural conditions 0aChitinase 0aβ-1,3-Glucanase 0aTobacco rhizosphere1 aSiva Raju, K.1 aRavisankar, H.0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Jan.,  Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.25-32dElsevier Editora Ltda.wJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009700158300002000255500001900275520109900294592002801393650002201421650001101443650000801454650001701462650001901479650001901498650001901517650002101536700002001557700001801577700001901595700002001614700002001634700002201654700001801676700001601694773014401710856007401854852000901928655001201937IND60720721520221120140420.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072072152DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta09502h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yingzhi13aAn ‘ice-melting’ kinetic control strategy for highly photocatalytic organic nanocrystals  ap. 25275-25282.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEngineering the size, shape and crystallinity of organic semiconductor nanostructures (OSNs) offers the opportunity of fine tuning their optoelectronic properties for photocatalytic applications. Here, we report a facile and general ‘ice-melting’ kinetic control strategy to synthesize OSNs with excellent photocatalytic performance. The ultraslow release and interaction of organic molecules from ice melting yields an ultralow local concentration (∼five orders of magnitude fewer molecules), fundamentally enhancing the energy barrier thus leading to their relaxed and ordered assembly into refined nanocrystals (∼one order of magnitude smaller in size, morphological change from amorphous to crystalline); such nanocrystals display improved light-harvesting and charge transfer properties and consequent photocatalytic efficiency towards degrading organic pollutants compared to standard OSNs, or even commercial titania photocatalysts (Degussa P25); we also generalize the ‘ice-melting’ kinetic control strategy to synthesize a series of highly photoactive organic nanocrystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aice 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide1 aJiang, Dongjian1 aZhang, Yujuan1 aYao, Shenglian1 aRosei, Federico1 aZhang, Xiaohong1 aHuang, Zheng-Hong1 aWang, Luning,1 aKang, Feiyu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 47 p.25275-25282dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta09502h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245010400208300001800312506007600330520192800406592002802334506003702362650002202399650002102421650002102442650001602463650001702479650001402496650001402510650001402524650003102538650001102569650001002580651000902590700002002599700002202619700003102641700002002672700002202692773011702714856008102831852000902912655001202921IND60520671220221207144615.0160522e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052067122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-015-0967-12doi7 aPMC48921102pmcid7 a261303242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivappa, Nitin10aAssociation between inflammatory potential of diet and mortality in the Iowa Women’s Health study  ap. 1491-1502.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: Chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well-established causes of disability and premature deaths. Dietary components that are known to affect chronic inflammation have been implicated in the etiology and prognosis of these chronic diseases. We examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict overall, cancer and CVD mortality in the Iowa Women’s Health study. METHODS: The DII was computed from baseline dietary intake assessed in this cohort of 37,525 women, who were aged 55–69 years when enrolled starting in 1986. During the follow-up period, through December 31, 2010, in a total of 17,793 deaths, 5044 cancer- and 6528 CVD-related deaths were identified through mortality record linkage. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with DII expressed both as a continuous variable and as quartiles. RESULTS: Comparing subjects in DII Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1, modest positive associations were noted for all-cause mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.07; 95 % CI 1.01–1.13; p-trend = 0.006), digestive cancer mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.19; 95 % CI 1.00–1.43; p-trend = 0.05), CVD mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.09; 95 % CI 1.01–1.18; p-trend = 0.08), non-cancer/non-CVD/non-acute mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.09; 95 % CI 1.00–1.19; p-trend = 0.19), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.17; 95 % CI 1.05–1.30; p-trend = 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality (HRQ₄ᵥₛQ₁ 1.43; 95 % CI 1.18–1.75; p-trend = 0.0006). No substantial associations were observed for mortality from stroke, Alzheimer’s disease or unspecified dementia. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet, as evidenced by higher DII scores, may be associated with total mortality as well as mortality from digestive cancer, CVD, CHD and COPD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3achronic diseases 3acoronary disease 3afood intake 3ainflammation 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3astroke 3awomen 3aIowa1 aBlair, Cindy K.1 aPrizment, Anna E.1 aJacobs, David R., Jr.cJr.1 aSteck, Susan E.1 aHebert, James R.,0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 June, v. 55, no. 4 p.1491-1502dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-015-0967-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245009000206520153400296592002801830650001301858650001101871650001001882650001901892650000901911650002401920650001701944650002001961650001901981650001602000653001302016653001902029653001802048653002102066653001002087653001702097653002602114653000902140773010802149856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60646278020221119232717.0190613e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064627802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2019.1002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Deepak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4487-775510aHyper-temporal variability analysis of solar insolation with respect to local seasons  aThe incoming solar radiation at any location results from the complex interactions of energy between the atmosphere and land or ocean surfaces. The available amount of solar insolation at the earth surface are spatially and temporally variable. These are varying predominantly at seasonal/daily basis which is caused by well-predictable astronomic factors (via solar altitude) and by changing atmospheric conditions (e.g. clouds, aerosols, water vapours and ozone). This variability also affects the predictability and manageability of all types of solar energy. The current study presents hyper-temporal variations analysis of solar insolation for Kalaburagi (erstwhile Gulbarga) district over the year 2004–2014 to understand the variability at a seasonal scope. The process was repeated on monthly bins of data (e.g. the eight Januaries, Februaries, etc.). The understanding of solar insolation requires a description of the temporal and spatial context to decipher a predictable, quantifiable variability at space-time continuum. The key aspects of the work introduces hyper-temporal (H-T) variability analysis of solar insolation with respect to local seasons. The accuracy of analysis at spatial or temporal solar insolation will enable us to add reliability (lower risk) and quality of the solar resources. Therefore, synergistic use of hyper-temporal data and advanced data analysis approaches will result in enhancing the potential of complex problem related to the application of solar resources for various purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aenergy 3aozone 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3ashortwave radiation 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aspace and time 3awater vapor 0aAnalysis 0aHyper-temporal 0aLocal seasons 0aSolar insolation 0aUrban 0aSmart Cities 0aGulbarga (Kalaburagi) 0aNREL0 tRemote sensing applications.g2019 Aug., v. 15 p.100241-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2019.1002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011000156300001800266500002000284520126100304592002801565650002001593650001501613650002901628650002001657650001001677650001501687650001601702650001001718650001501728650001401743650001701757650001101774650001701785650002201802650000901824650001301833700002901846700003801875700002901913700002701942700002901969700002301998700003502021700002202056773012602078856007302204852000902277655001202286IND60588133620221120200015.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058813362DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.223212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTae, Barbara10aEvaluation of globins expression in brain, heart, and lung in rats exposed to side stream cigarette smoke  ap. 1252-1261.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe side stream cigarette smoke (SSCS) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking‐induced toxicity. Hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin (Mb), neuroglobin (Ngb), and cytoglobin (Cygb) are globins with different distributions and functions in the tissues and have similar actions by providing O₂ (oxygen) for respiratory chain, detoxification of ROS and nitric oxide (NO), and protect tissues against irreversible lesions. We aimed to investigate the effects of SSCS exposure on gene and protein expression of Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in different tissue. The Ngb and Cygb gene and protein expression in the cerebral cortex increased after 1 week of rat exposure to SSCS. In hippocampus, the Ngb gene and protein expression increased after 1 week or more of exposure and no change was observed in Cygb gene and protein expression. In myocardium, Mb and Cygb gene expression increased at 1 and 4 weeks of exposure, while protein expression of both increased at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. In lung, observed an increase in Cygb gene and protein expression after 2, 3, and 4 weeks of exposure. The findings suggest that SSCS modulates Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in central and peripheral tissue © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) is a C4 crop with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) said to be organic by default. Being carbon and nitrogen mutually exclusive, in the present study, it was investigated how light regulates the expression of genes of carbon metabolism and photosynthesis in two finger millet genotypes (GE 3885 and GE 1437) with differing grain protein content (13.8 and 6.2 %). Different genes associated with carbon metabolism were isolated (Cab, RBCS, PEPC, PPDK, PEPC-k, ME, SPS, PK, 14-3-3 and SnRK1) and the co-expression of Dof1 and these genes was investigated under different light–dark conditions. The deduced protein sequences of isolated genes showed relationship of marked variations with their homolog which might corresponds to difference in photosynthetic efficiency between finger millet and other plants. In 24 h day–night conditions, the identified genes exhibited diurnal rhythm in both genotypes with different time of peak expression. In dark, the expression of identified genes in both genotypes oscillated with varied amplitude indicating their control by an endogenous clock. However, Cab, RBCS and PPDK showed no oscillations suggesting that genes are light inducible. Exceptionally, ME transcript showed differential response within genotypes. Upon illumination, genes were induced within the measured period indicating that light is a signal involved in the entrainment of these genes. Exception was ME and SnRK1 in GE 1437. We conclude that expression of Dof1 in higher grain protein genotype was more consistent with the expression of carbon metabolism genes under study suggesting that Dof1 differentially regulates the expression of these light inducible genes and simultaneously controls the grain protein content in finger millet genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aEleusine coracana 3aagronomic traits 3aamino acid sequences 3acarbon 3acircadian rhythm 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrain protein 3alighting 3amillets 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDarkness 2aEleusinexgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenotype 2aLight 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects.1 aGupta, Supriya1 aArora, Sandeep1 aAnil Kumar,0 tPlant cell reports.g2014 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1403-1411dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-014-1625-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04271naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245009200212300001600304506007600320520220200396592002802598506003702626650002302663650002202686650001502708650000902723650002102732650002202753650002502775650001502800650002302815650001802838650002302856650002302879650001502902650001402917650001402931650002202945650002502967650001402992650000903006650001903015650001803034650001903052650001303071650002203084651001303106653001503119653001403134653001403148653001603162653001403178653002503192653002003217653002003237700001703257700003003274700002103304773015403325856008503479852000903564655001203573IND60533717920221207142717.0190417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053371792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.02.0022doi7 aPMC38625292pmcid7 a245333232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollings, Tracey10aWildlife disease ecology in changing landscapes: Mesopredator release and toxoplasmosis  ap. 110-118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChanging ecosystem dynamics are increasing the threat of disease epidemics arising in wildlife populations. Several recent disease outbreaks have highlighted the critical need for understanding pathogen dynamics, including the role host densities play in disease transmission. In Australia, introduced feral cats are of immense concern because of the risk they pose to native wildlife through predation and competition. They are also the only known definitive host of the coccidian parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, the population-level impacts of which are unknown in any species. Australia’s native wildlife have not evolved in the presence of cats or their parasites, and feral cats may be linked with several native mammal declines and extinctions. In Tasmania there is emerging evidence that feral cat populations are increasing following wide-ranging and extensive declines in the apex predator, the Tasmanian devil, from a consistently fatal transmissible cancer.We assess whether feral cat density is associated with the seroprevalence of T. gondii in native wildlife to determine whether an increasing population of feral cats may correspond to an increased level of risk to naive native intermediate hosts. We found evidence that seroprevalence of T. gondii in Tasmanian pademelons was lower in the north-west of Tasmania than in the north-east and central regions where cat density was higher. Also, samples obtained from road-killed animals had significantly higher seroprevalence of T. gondii than those from culled individuals, suggesting there may be behavioural differences associated with infection. In addition, seroprevalence in different trophic levels was assessed to determine whether position in the food-web influences exposure risk. Higher order carnivores had significantly higher seroprevalence than medium-sized browser species. The highest seroprevalence observed in an intermediate host was 71% in spotted-tailed quolls (Dasyurus maculatus), the largest mammalian mesopredator, in areas of low cat density. Mesopredator release of cats may be a significant issue for native species conservation, potentially affecting the population viability of many endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDasyurus maculatus 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acarnivores 3acats 3adefinitive hosts 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease transmission 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3aferal animals 3aindigenous species 3aintermediate hosts 3alandscapes 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apopulation growth 3apopulation viability 3apredation 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3atoxoplasmosis 3atrophic levels 3awildlife 3awildlife diseases 3aTasmania 0aToxoplasma 0aT. gondii 0aFeral cat 0aFelis catus 0aAustralia 0aMesopredator release 0aDisease ecology 0aTasmanian devil1 aJones, Menna1 aMooney, N.

The northern portion of Umm Nigga falls within the boundaries of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) adjacent to Iraq, and was fenced off to restrict public access since 1994. The central objective of this project was to use remote sensing, field assessment, and Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial data to develop a site history for restoration planning of Umm Nigga. Field observation and GIS analysis indicated that the landscape could be divided into three units along a gradient ranging from the coast to inland locations, based on geology, soil properties, and dominant vegetation. Reference sites in the DMZ were also matched for each unit. Remote sensing was used to compare vegetation cover between damaged and reference sites at selected units. Results showed that vegetation cover increased in the unfenced damaged site after the 1991 Gulf War from 2% in 1988 to 37% in 1998, but then it decreased to 23% in 2013. In the DMZ reference site, the vegetation cover also increased from 0% in 1988 to 40% in 1998, but it continued increasing through 2013 to 64%. We conclude that overgrazing and destructive camping are the major source of disturbance in the damaged areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acamping 3acoasts 3aecological site descriptions 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aovergrazing 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3asoil properties 3aspatial data 3avegetation cover 3aIraq 3aKuwait1 aFeagin, Rusty A.1 aMūsawī, Laylá,1 aWhisenant, Steven1 aPopescu, Sorin0 tRestoration ecology.g2016 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.91-99dWiley Periodicals, Inc.x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.122893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001900178245020400197300001600401520167100417592002802088650002002116650001602136650001002152650001302162650003102175650001802206650001702224650002802241650001302269650002102282650001802303650001802321650000902339650002202348650002302370650002802393650002902421650002802450650001102478650003602489650001102525650006802536650004702604650004302651650000902694650001602703650003202719650003302751650006202784650002602846650002002872650001702892650003402909650001702943700002002960700002002980700002103000700002203021700002503043773009603068856009303164990002303257852000903280655001203289IND60088903420221117232410.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008890342DNAL7 a223047932pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStein, Evan A.10aRenal safety of intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin: A retrospective analysis of renal adverse events among 40,600 participants in the rosuvastatin clinical development program  ap. 471-477.  aOBJECTIVE: Intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins reduces cardiovascular risk but can cause liver-, muscle-, and possibly renal-related adverse events (AEs). We assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on the risk of developing renal impairment or renal failure among participants in the rosuvastatin clinical development program. METHODS: The analysis was based on AE data reported by investigators from 36 studies that included 40,600 participants who did not have advanced, pre-existing renal disease. Rates of renal AEs were determined based on time to first occurrence of renal impairment or renal failure. RESULTS: Renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 536 study participants during 72,488 patient-years of follow-up. Renal event rates were higher in patients with history of heart failure (n=5011), hypertension (n=21,864), diabetes (n=5165), or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min/1.73m² (n=9507) at baseline but did not differ with rosuvastatin compared with placebo or with rosuvastatin 40mg compared with rosuvastatin 10mg. Relative risk (RR) estimates obtained from pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials were RR: 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.23, p=0.777) for any reported renal impairment or renal failure event, RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.76–1.37, p=0.894) for serious renal AEs, and RR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.36–1.35, p=0.282) for renal AEs leading to death. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that intensive LDL-C-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin does not affect the risk of developing renal insufficiency or renal failure in patients who do not have advanced, pre-existing renal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3adeath 3adiabetes 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aheart failure 3ahypertension 3alow density lipoprotein 3apatients 3aprogram planning 3arelative risk 3arenal failure 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aFemale 2aFluorobenzenesxadverse effects 2aHumans 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitorsxadverse effects 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aPyrimidinesxadverse effects 2aRenal Insufficiencyxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSulfonamidesxadverse effects 2aTime Factors1 aVidt, Donald G.1 aShepherd, James1 aCain, Valerie A.1 aAnzalone, Deborah1 aCressman, Michael D.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Apr., v. 221, no. 2 p.471-477dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014000174520138000314592002801694650002101722650001101743650003501754650001601789650002101805650001601826650000901842650002901851650001301880650001501893651001101908653002101919653003701940653001901977653002801996653001102024700002302035700002302058700002602081700002602107700002202133700002502155773011202180856008202292852000902374655001202383IND60777424820221122023330.0220824e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077742482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1130872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrigoriou, Constantina10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace elements dietary intake in inhabitants of Athens, Greece, based on a duplicate portion study  aConcentration levels of 26 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 20 trace elements were measured in dietary samples, in order to estimate the dietary intake and the potential exposure risk of the Greek population. Dietary samples were collected with the help of 30 volunteers inhabitants of Athens, Greece, according to the duplicate portion study (DPS) method where the determination of the compounds is conducted in the final consumed meal. DPS was selected as an alternative to a total diet study for its feasibility, low cost and realistic image that it provides. PAHs determination was performed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and trace elements determination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The estimated mean daily dietary exposure on 26 PAHs for an adult was estimated at 101.47 ng kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹, while moderate to low exposure was related to the type and amount of food consumed. Exposure levels to PAHs do not indicate a possible risk for the health of the study group. For toxic, potentially essential and/or essential trace elements the daily exposure calculated for Greek population was in accordance with the reference values of the health-based guidances and compared to previous diet studies reported for the population of other countries was in general similar to the lower bound exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTotal Diet Study 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abody weight 3adietary exposure 3afood intake 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aGreece 0aDietary exposure 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aTrace elements 0aDuplicate portion study 0aGreece1 aCostopoulou, Danae1 aVassiliadou, Irene1 aKaravoltsos, Sotirios1 aSakellari, Aikaterini1 aBakeas, Evangelos1 aLeondiadis, Leondios0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 July, v. 165 p.113087-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1130873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04511naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024002300173024004000196024002500236040001800261100001500279245013200294520218000426592002802606650001402634650002002648650002402668650002602692650002102718650001302739650002302752650001702775650003102792650001202823650002002835650003002855650001002885650002402895650001302919650001402932650001602946650001102962650001202973650001802985650001203003650001403015650001203029650001003041650001703051651001003068653003103078653001603109653001403125653001403139653002003153700005803173700005703231700001503288700002103303700001103324700001903335700001303354700001603367700001903383773011703402856008603519856011403605961001303719852000903732655001203741IND60710832520221214230227.0201118e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071083252DNAL7 a3752142aris7 a10113/71083252hdl7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1128942doi7 a3752142seq_no_1157 a6046-21000-012-00D2aris_project_no7 a4342962aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Siyang10aCombining ability of cytoplasmic male sterility on yield and agronomic traits of sorghum for grain and biomass dual-purpose use  aSorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a high-yielding C4 crop used not only to produce grains for food, feed, and industrial uses but also biomass (i.e., leaf and stem) for biofuel production. To take better advantage of its heterosis for both grain and biomass dual-purpose use, the combining ability of 34 cytoplasmic male sterile lines (female) were tested with 3 cytoplasmic male fertile restore lines (male) using the North Carolina design (NCⅡ) at Zhuozhou (Hebei province) and Jiexiu (Shanxi province) in northern China for two years (2017 and 2018). The hybrids exhibited a grain yield of 0.3 ∼ 14.0 t ha⁻¹ and had an aboveground biomass yield (AGBY) of 9.6 ∼ 109.9 t ha⁻¹ across both sites in 2017 and 2018. The genotype and site × genotype interactions significantly affected the yield and agronomic traits. With respect to their grain and biomass dual-purpose use, the tested 34 female lines revealed that plant height, gravity center height, productive tiller rate, and harvest index were strongly general combining ability (GCA) sensitive. Stem width, days to maturity, AGBY, and grain width were medium GCA-sensitive; and grain yield, 100-grain weight, days between heading and maturity, and grain bulk density were weakly GCA-sensitive. The GCA effect on grain yield was positive and significantly correlated with productive tiller rate, AGBY, and harvest index. The GCA effect on AGBY had a positive, significant correlation with plant height, gravity center height, productive tiller rate, and days to maturity; but the effect was negatively correlated with 100-grain weight and grain width. For tested traits, the additive gene effects strongly predominated over the non-additive genes for tested traits. Plant height was the most GCA-sensitive trait and the most important for biomass production. Female lines AMP418, AMP431, AMP434, AMP443, AMP495, AMP496 and the male line X097 were selected as being high-GCA effect germplasm. These selections from newly introduced cytoplasmic male sterile lines hold promise for accelerating the genetic improvement of sorghum for its dual-purpose use as grain for food and biomass for biofuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aSorghum bicolor 3aaboveground biomass 3aadditive gene effects 3aagronomic traits 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abulk density 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3afemales 3afuel production 3ageneral combining ability 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3agrains 3agravity 3aharvest index 3aheading 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3amales 3aplant height 3aChina 0aCytoplasmic male sterility 0aEnergy crop 0aGermplasm 0aHeterosis 0aHybrid breeding1 aTang, Chaochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7179-05351 aWang, Mingli,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9406-89511 aLi, Songbo1 aDiallo, Boubacar1 aXu, Yi1 aZhou, Fangyuan1 aSun, Lei1 aShi, Wenjun1 aXie, Guang Hui0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 157 p.112894-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1128943Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/71083253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012200173300001600295520114000311592002801451650001101479650001901490650001301509650001101522650000901533650002101542650001601563650001301579650001101592650001301603650001401616650001601630650001001646651001401656700002501670700002201695773010101717856008101818852000901899655001201908IND60555708220221123043624.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055570822DNAL7 a10.1007/s13364-016-0280-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuškaitis, Rimvydas,10aFeeding in an unpredictable environment: yearly variations in the diet of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius  ap. 367-372.  aYearly variations in the diet composition of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius were studied in typical dormouse habitat in Lithuania over 5 years (2010–2014) with different feeding conditions. A high proportion of birch seeds in the dormouse diet in two out of 5 years was a very much unexpected result. Dormice consumed them from mid-June until late October even when the most preferable food—hazel nuts—was abundant. In autumn when accumulating fat reserves for hibernation, hazel dormice fed on four main food sources—fruits of glossy buckthorn, oak acorns, hazel nuts and birch seeds. The consumption of these food sources was directly related to their availability. During the study period, only one, two or three of these food sources were abundant in any particular year, while others were absent or scarce. In total, the fruits of glossy buckthorn and oak acorns accounted for the major portion of dormouse diet in autumn. Dormice living in habitat with irregular fruiting of the main food plants are adapted to feed on varying food sources and can switch from one food source to another in different years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aFrangula alnus 3aGliridae 3aautumn 3adiet 3afood consumption 3afood plants 3afruiting 3afruits 3ahabitats 3ahazelnuts 3ahibernation 3aseeds 3aLithuania1 aBaltrūnaitė, Laima1 aKitrytė, Neringa0 tMammal research.g2016 Oct., v. 61, no. 4 p.367-372dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2199-24017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-016-0280-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001300156245012000169300001800289520112500307592002801432650002401460650002301484650002201507650002101529650001801550650001501568650001101583650002001594650001401614650001401628650001001642650002601652650003801678650008201716650001001798650004201808650008201850651001001932653002401942653001001966653002301976653001401999653001502013653001802028700001702046700001902063700001902082700001902101700001202120773014802132852000902280856007502289655001202364IND4463947420221119205554.0160905e20120627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446394742DNAL7 a226706612pmid7 a10.1021/jf301525s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Bo10aIntegrated Effects of Light Intensity and Fertilization on Growth and Flavonoid Accumulation in Cyclocarya paliurus  ap. 6286-6292.  aCyclocarya paliurus has been used for drug formulations and ingredients in functional foods in China. Field studies were conducted to examine the relationships between environmental factors and flavonoid accumulation. A split-plot randomized design was used to establish three shading treatments and three fertilization levels, and growth parameters and flavonoid contents were detected. The greatest biomass production was achieved in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, and leaf production per seedling increased by 139.5% compared to the treatment without shade and fertilization. Overall, shade and fertilization had a significantly negative effect on contents of total flavonoid, kaempferol, quercetin, and isoquercitrin in leaves of C. paliurus. However, the greatest accumulation of total flavonoid in the leaves was observed in intermediate shade and fertilization treatment, achieving 364.4 g/plant. The results suggest that manipulating the field growing conditions and optimizing the silvicultural system would be important for obtaining the greatest yield of targeted health-promoting substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclocarya paliurus 3abiomass production 3adrug formulations 3afunctional foods 3aisoquercitrin 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3aquercetin 3aseedlings 3ashade 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aJuglandaceaexchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aLight 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 3aChina 0aCyclocarya paliurus 0ashade 0abiomass production 0aquercetin 0akaempferol 0aisoquercitrin1 aShang, Xulan1 aFang, Shengzuo1 aLi, Qiongqiong1 aFu, Xiangxiang1 aSu, Jun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 June 27, v. 60, no. 25 p.6286-6292dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301525s3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02693naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245011900168500002000287520141000307592002801717650002401745650002201769650001201791650001201803650002301815650000901838650001601847650001301863650003101876650000901907650002301916650001801939650001301957650001001970650002001980650002302000650001502023650001402038700002502052773008302077856007802160852000902238655001202247IND60571506720170926000000.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057150672DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2016000842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeboye, Adedola S.10aPhysicochemical, morphological, thermal and pasting properties of marama (Tylosema esculentum) storage root starch  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStarch from marama (Tylosema esculentum) storage roots were isolated and characterized for physicochemical, micro‐ and molecular structure, pasting, and thermal properties, and were compared to commercial cassava, maize, and potato starches. The amylose content of marama root starch was 192 g/kg starch; and was close to cassava (196 g/kg), but lower in comparison to maize (250 g/kg) and higher than potato (161 g/kg). Marama root starch granules were found to be simple; spherical, lenticular, and oval in shape with granule size range of about 5–38 µm. The peak viscosity (5350–5475 mPa · s) of marama root starch paste is about twice as high as those of cassava and maize. Marama root starch has higher gel firmness than cassava but half that of potato and maize starches. Gelatinization temperature range (67.5–79.0°C) of marama root starch was close to commercial cassava and maize starches. Marama root starch exhibited type A molecular arrangement (X‐ray diffraction) pattern similar to the cassava and maize starches, but different to type B exhibited by the potato starch. Granule size, amylose:amylopectin ratio and molecular arrangement pattern seem to account for the differences and or similarities between marama root starch and the commercial starches. Marama starch has potential as thickeners in food compared to maize and cassava due to the high viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTylosema esculentum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylose 3acassava 3achemical structure 3acorn 3acorn starch 3afirmness 3agelatinization temperature 3agels 3apasting properties 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aroots 3astarch granules 3athermal properties 3athickeners 3aviscosity1 aEmmambux, Naushad M.0 tStärke =.g2017 Mar., v. 69, no. 3-4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2016000843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010900156300001800265520115000283592002801433650001601461650001201477650001801489650001901507650001401526650001301540650001501553650001601568650001901584650001901603650001901622650002301641700002101664700001901685700001701704700001501721700001601736773014101752856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60642791320221123025733.0190508e20171108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064279132DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02412f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jinhua10aRobust and thermoplastic hydrogels with surface micro-patterns for highly oriented growth of osteoblasts  ap. 8446-8450.  aBiocompatible hydrogels with high strength, high precision patterns, and arbitrary 3D shapes are extremely desired soft platforms in the biomedicine fields. On the basis of the thermal-reversible sol–gel transition of agarose and the formation of nanofibers below 35 °C, a robust and thermoplastic hydrogel (TPG) was fabricated by in situ polymerization of acrylamide in the agarose matrix. The tensile fracture stress/strain values of the TPG were unexpectedly higher than those of both agarose and polyacrylamide hydrogels as a result of the double networks reinforced with nanofibers. The TPG could reversibly soften and harden by heating and cooling treatment, respectively, leading to an excellent mechanical recoverability and reprocessing ability. Thus, arbitrary 3D-shaped hydrogels and micro-patterns embossed on the TPG surface with a high resolution of 1 μm were constructed. The rigid TPG exhibited a remarkable affinity for the adhesion and proliferation of cells. In particular, the TPGs with microgrooves could highly guide the oriented growth of osteoblasts, showing potential applications in the field of tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aagarose 3acell adhesion 3acold treatment 3ahydrogels 3amedicine 3ananofibers 3aosteoblasts 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3athermoplastics 3atissue engineering1 aDuan, Jiangjiang1 aWu, Shuangquan1 aGuo, Jingmei1 aHuang, Cui1 aZhang, Lina0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Nov. 8, v. 5, no. 43 p.8446-8450dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02412f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04206naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245018800211300001400399506007600413520205500489592002802544506003702572650002602609650001602635650001202651650001002663650001902673650001402692650001002706650002202716650001302738650001002751650001902761650002002780650001802800650001402818650003002832650002402862650001802886650002402904650001902928650001102947650002002958650001302978653002802991653001503019653001903034653001803053653001803071653002303089700002303112700002803135700001903163700002403182700002103206700002103227700002603248773015203274856008503426852000903511655001203520IND60533718320221207144833.0190417e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053371832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.03.0012doi7 aPMC38625322pmcid7 a245333192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotero, Adriana10aTrypanosomes genetic diversity, polyparasitism and the population decline of the critically endangered Australian marsupial, the brush tailed bettong or woylie (Bettongia penicillata)  ap. 77-89.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile much is known of the impact of trypanosomes on human and livestock health, trypanosomes in wildlife, although ubiquitous, have largely been considered to be non-pathogenic. We describe the genetic diversity, tissue tropism and potential pathogenicity of trypanosomes naturally infecting Western Australian marsupials. Blood samples collected from 554 live-animals and 250 tissue samples extracted from 50 carcasses of sick-euthanized or road-killed animals, belonging to 10 species of marsupials, were screened for the presence of trypanosomes using a PCR of the 18S rDNA gene. PCR results revealed a rate of infection of 67% in blood and 60% in tissues. Inferred phylogenetic trees using 18S rDNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) sequences showed the presence of eight genotypes that clustered into three clades: a clade including Trypanosoma copemani, a new clade closely related to Trypanosoma gilletti, and a clade including Trypanosoma H25 from an Australian kangaroo. Trypanosome infections were compared in a declining and in a stable population of the endangered Australian marsupial, the brush tailed bettong or woylie (Bettongia penicillata). This marsupial showed high rates of infection with Clade A genotypes (96%) in the declining population, whereas in the stable population, Clade B genotypes were predominant (89%). Mixed infections were common in woylies from the declining but not from the stable population. Histopathological findings associated with either mixed or single infections involving Clade A genotypes, showed a strong inflammatory process and tissue degeneration predominantly in heart, oesophagus and tongue. Trypanosomes were successfully grown in culture and for the first time we demonstrate that a genotype within Clade A has the capacity to not only colonize different tissues in the host but also to invade cells in vitro. These results provide evidence for the potential role of trypanosomes in the decline of a formerly abundant marsupial that is now critically endangered.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBettongia penicillata 3aTrypanosoma 3aanimals 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3aesophagus 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3amixed infection 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3aribosomal DNA 3atissue degeneration 3atissue tropism 3atongue 3atrypanosomiasis 3awildlife 0aAustralian trypanosomes 0aMarsupials 0aTissue tropism 0aIntracellular 0aPathogenicity 0aPopulation decline1 aThompson, Craig K.1 aPeacock, Christopher S.1 aClode, Peta L.1 aNicholls, Philip K.1 aWayne, Adrian F.1 aLymbery, Alan J.1 aThompson, R.C.

One possibility is that the virus may be carried into the brain by immune cells that traffic across the blood–CSF barrier in the choroid plexus. Since few studies have directly examined macrophage trafficking across the blood–CSF barrier, we established transwell and explant cultures of feline choroid plexus epithelium and measured trafficking in the presence or absence of FIV. Macrophages in co-culture with the epithelium showed significant proliferation and robust trafficking that was dependent on the presence of epithelium. Macrophage migration to the apical surface of the epithelium was particularly robust in the choroid plexus explants where 3-fold increases were seen over the first 24 h. Addition of FIV to the cultures greatly increased the number of surface macrophages without influencing replication. The epithelium in the transwell cultures was also permissive to PBMC trafficking, which increased from 17 to 26% of total cells after exposure to FIV. Thus, the choroid plexus epithelium supports trafficking of both macrophages and PBMCs.

Average concentrations of total (Σ) PCDD/Fs and ΣPBDEs in sediments ranged from 68.8 to 479pgg−1 dry weight (dw) and 60.8 to 179pgg−1 dw, respectively. Contamination levels of sedimentary PCDD/Fs and PBDEs were low to moderate compared to other urbanized regions worldwide. The concentrations in different fish species (Nile perch; Lates niloticus and Nile tilapia; Oreochromis niloticus) were 5.32 to 49.0pgg−1 wet weight (ww) for PCDD/Fs and 59.3 to 495pgg−1 ww for PBDEs. Higher concentrations of the pollutants were found in L. niloticus than O. niloticus, which could be attributed to species differences in feeding habits and lifestyles. World Health Organization-toxic equivalents (WHO2005-TEQs) for PCDD/Fs ranged from 0.08 to 0.33pgTEQg−1 dw and 0.001–0.14pgTEQg−1 ww in sediments and fish, respectively. The TEQ values were low compared to the data for fresh water fish reported in literature and within a permissible level of 3.5pgg−1 ww recommended by the European Commission. Based on the Commission set value and minimum risk level criteria formulated by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the fish from the Murchison Bay was fit for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLates niloticus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3afreshwater fish 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3ainterspecific variation 3alifestyle 3amass spectrometry 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3arisk 3asediments 3atoxic substances 3aurbanization 3aLake Victoria 3aUganda 0aPCDD/Fs 0aPBDEs 0aSediments 0aFish 0aLake Victoria1 aSillanpää, Mika1 aWang, Pu1 aLi, Yingming1 aKiremire, Bernard T.1 aKasozi, Gabriel N.1 aZhu, Chaofei1 aRen, Daiwei1 aShang, Hongtao1 aZhang, Qinghua1 aJiang, Guibin0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 500-501 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009300167300001600260520197100276592002802247650001402275650001502289650000902304650001102313650001002324650001002334651001102344700002002355700002402375700002002399700001802419700001902437700003102456773010102487856008102588852000902669655001202678IND60555708520221120044449.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055570852DNAL7 a10.1007/s13364-016-0284-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Thomas S.10aDental anomalies suggest an evolutionary trend in the dentition of wolverine (Gulo gulo)  ap. 361-366.  aIn mammals, congenital dental anomalies likely represent an evolutionary trend in the reduction of teeth (oligodonty) from the primitive dental formula. We quantified variation in the number of teeth from 421 wolverine (Gulo gulo) from northwestern Canada, focusing on polydonty (additional teeth), congenital oligodonty, and tooth rotation (misalignment). We predicted that oligodonty may be an evolutionary consequence of a previously reported increase in size of carnassial teeth since the Pleistocene. We also predicted that wolverine with missing or rotated teeth had smaller dental arcades than those without these anomalies. Oligodonty was observed in 42 wolverines (10 %), with the most cases involving the P¹ or P₁ (56 %) and P² or P₂ (32 %). We observed rotated teeth in 43 % of wolverines; virtually all of the rotated teeth we observed were P² or P₂. The frequency of oligodonty or rotated teeth was strikingly similar between the sexes. Both oligodonty and rotated teeth were observed more frequently in the mandibular than the maxillary toothrows. Most wolverine (67 %) with oligodonty were missing teeth unilaterally; in contrast, most animals with rotated teeth exhibited bilateralism (86 %). Condylobasal length and most measures of the dental arcade did not differ between wolverine with or without missing or rotated teeth; however, we found that skulls with missing or rotated teeth had narrower palate breadth ratios. Our data suggest that there may be an evolutionary trend in the loss of teeth at the anterior of the toothrows of wolverines, which may be a result of narrower dental arcades and larger carnassial teeth. Wolverine have a hypercarnivorous diet, and selection may be toward optimizing those teeth that contribute to securing and processing food (i.e., canine and carnassial teeth), and against those that likely do not contribute substantially to increasing fitness and survival, such as the P¹/P₁ and P²/P₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGulo gulo 3acarnivores 3adiet 3apalate 3askull 3ateeth 3aCanada1 aRivest, Gabriel1 aBlakeburn, David A.1 aHamm, Emilie R.1 avan Eyk, Aldo1 aKukka, Piia M.1 aRobitaille, Jean-François0 tMammal research.g2016 Oct., v. 61, no. 4 p.361-366dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2199-24017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-016-0284-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008100169500002200250500001500272520075900287592002801046650002501074650001901099650001301118650001601131650001901147650001501166650002401181650002501205650002201230650002801252650003301280650002101313651001801334653001501352653002101367653002601388653001301414653001601427700001901443700002101462773009701483856008201580852000901662655001201671IND60565704020221120024745.0170626s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056570402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimushina, M.V.10aDirect labeling of serum proteins by fluorescent dye for antibody microarray  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aAnalysis of serum proteome by antibody microarray is used to identify novel biomarkers and to study signaling pathways including protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions.

It has been proposed [Hazlett BA. 2000. Responses to single and multiple sources of chemical cues by New Zealand crustaceans. Mar Freshw Behav Physiol. 34:1–20] that a graded response will be seen if the animals have an alternative response to one behavioural category of stimuli (the alternative-behaviour-gradual-change rule). The crab Heterozius rotundifrons has two alternative patterns of predation avoidance, either assumption of a rigid limb-extended posture for several minutes or a short period of limb extension and then rapid locomotion. We presented crabs with full strength input in one category (food stimulus) and one of seven intensities of input in a conflicting category (either chemical or visual cues associated with increased predation risk). In both cases, as the intensity of the danger signal gradually increased, there was a gradual increase in the duration of the limb-extended posture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3acrabs 3alocomotion 3aposture 3apredation 3arisk 3aNew Zealand 0aconflicting stimuli 0agradual increase 0aintegration 0abehaviour 0acrab 0aHeterozius rotundifrons1 aMcLay, Colin0 tMarine and freshwater behaviour and physiology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1 p.13-19dTaylor & Francis Groupx1029-03627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236244.2010.533519  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001400181245005500195300001800250506007600268520036300344592002800707506003700735650001200772650001400784650001300798650001500811650001400826650001100840650001600851700001800867700001900885700001300904700001800917773014200935856007401077852000901151655001201160IND60642791620221207133527.0190508e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064279162DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02431b2doi7 aPMC58023732pmcid7 a294303012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei12al-Carnitine derived zwitterionic betaine materials  ap. 8676-8680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn l-carnitine derived zwitterionic betaine material was developed.

Herein, Luffa rattan (LR), a biowaste material, was used to synthesize functional biochar (F-LRBC) to adsorb U(VI) from aqueous solutions for the first time. The effect of solution pH, contact time and initial concentration of uranyl ions on uranium(Ⅵ) adsorption by F-LRBC was evaluated. FT-IR and SEM analysis confirmed that there are abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and pores on the surface of F-LRBC. Experiments demonstrated that the adsorption behavior of uranium(Ⅵ) by F-LRBC is spontaneous and efficient. The maximum adsorption capacity of F-LRBC for uranyl ions predicted by the Langmuir model was higher than that of most biochar adsorbent. The adsorption mechanism of uranyl ions on F-LRBC is complicated, including electrostatic interaction, complexation and physical adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalamus 3aLuffa 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3aelectrostatic interactions 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3auranium 3auranyl ions 3awastewater 0aUranium(VI) adsorption 0aBiochars 0aHummer method 0aBiowaste1 aHuang, Bin1 aWang, Yun1 aZhou, Limin,d1973-1 aLiu, Zhirong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Dec. 05, v. 606 p.125480-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1254803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008800160300001400248520097100262592002801233650001901261650001901280650001401299650001501313650001401328650001601342650001601358650001401374650002901388773009101417856007201508852000901580655001201589IND60478684320221119015134.0160113e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047868432DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.37122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Jürgen,10aNegative ion electrospray high‐resolution tandem mass spectrometry of polyphenols  ap. 33-43.  aRepresentative compounds with a 1,3‐dihydroxybenzene substructure belonging to different important polyphenol classes (stilbenes, flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, phloroglucinols, anthraquinones and bisanthraquinones) were investigated based on detailed high‐resolution tandem mass spectrometry measurements with an Orbitrap system under negative ion electrospray conditions.

Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) is one of the most important tree crops in the southern United States, comprising 45 % of commercial forestry land. Stem defects can reduce timber product quality and influence competitive interactions. We examined the effects of controlling Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrata Scudder in Comstock, 1880) and site management (fertilizer or herbicide use) on stem defects, of two full-sib families (C1 and C2) and two clonal varieties (V1 and V2) of loblolly pine at upper and lower coastal plain sites in North Carolina (UCP and LCP, respectively). At UCP, V1 and V2 had fewer stem defects with insecticide treatment indicating that pest pressure affected stem form. C2 had twice as many defects as other genotypes at LCP, while C1 had the most defects at UCP, showing that carefully matching site and genotype could improve plantation performance without increasing costs. Additionally, we examined the effects of Hurricane Irene on stem leaning at LCP. V1, the tallest genotype, was most strongly affected, indicating genotype differences in tolerance to this form of abiotic stress. Interestingly, insecticide treatment decreased the negative effects of the hurricane on C1 stem lean, indicating that tip moth pressure may make C1 more susceptible. Our results illustrate that the interaction of biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pest infestation and climate, can strongly impact stem form, potentially affecting ecophysiological function and economic value. Cost-effective silvicultural options, such as pest control and management of genetic resources can potentially decrease exposure to such environmental risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aRhyacionia frustrana 3aabiotic stress 3aclimate 3acoastal plains 3acost effectiveness 3acrops 3aeconomic valuation 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental exposure 3afertilizers 3aforestry 3agenotype 3aherbicides 3ahurricanes 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3amoths 3apest control 3aproduct quality 3arisk 3astem form 3atrees 3awind damage 3aNorth Carolina1 aKing, John S.0 tTrees.g2014 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1343-1353dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-1039-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003200134024003500166024001200201040001800213100001700231245017300248500002000421506017300441520122500614592002801839650004401867650002601911650002301937650001701960650001401977650000901991650002402000650001302024650002202037650002002059700002102079700002202100700002402122700002302146700003002169773008302199856011402282856007902396956008402475961000902559852000902568655001202577IND60571507220221214225014.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057150722DNAL7 a3085522aris7 a10113/57150722hdl7 a10.1002/star.2016000212doi7 a10.1002/star.2016000212chorus8 ans13431  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jingyuan10aProperties of starch–polyglutamic acid (PGA) graft copolymer prepared by microwave irradiation − Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and rheology studies  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe rheological properties of waxy starch‐γ‐polygutamic acid (PGA) graft copolymers were investigated. Grafting was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The starch–PGA copolymers absorbed water and formed gels, which exhibited concentration‐dependent viscoelastic solid properties. Higher starch–PGA concentrations resulted in stronger viscoelastic properties. The analysis for moduli of different concentrations indicated that the starch–PGA graft copolymer gels were physical gels, meaning the cross‐links between the molecules were physical junctions. However, stress relaxation measurements showed that the starch–PGA graft copolymer gels had long relaxation times, which result from the presence of the chemical cross‐links that were evident in the FTIR spectra. The non‐linear steady shearing rheological properties studies indicated that starch–PGA gels exhibited shear thinning behavior, which can be well fitted with the power law constitutive equation. The function and behavior of the starch–PGA graft copolymer gels suggest that this kind of starch‐based biomaterial could be a potential candidate for applications in cosmetic gels, skin wound care materials, and agricultural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagricultural products 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3aequations 3agels 3amicrowave radiation 3arheology 3astress relaxation 3aviscoelasticity1 aSolaiman, Daniel1 aAshby, Richard D.1 aGarcía, Rafael A.,1 aGordon, Sherald H.1 aHarry‐O'kuru, Rogers E.0 tStärke =.g2017 Mar., v. 69, no. 3-4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57150723Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2016000213Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/11118.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245014200195300001600337500002400353520157600377650001401953650001401967650001301981650001701994650001502011650001402026650001002040650000902050650001202059650002002071650002402091650007702115650002702192650002102219650002502240650004602265650003802311650001702349650001702366650001602383650001202399650006202411650006602473650003302539650001602572650002602588650006202614650001602676700002202692700002602714700001902740700001602759700002002775700001802795700001802813700001502831700001502846700002002861700001902881700002202900773009702922852000903019856005503028655001203083IND4458469520221116165815.0110527e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445846952DNAL7 a214183512pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04556.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoltunow, Anna M.G.10aSexual reproduction is the default mode in apomictic Hieracium subgenus Pilosella, in which two dominant loci function to enable apomixis  ap. 890-902.  aIncludes references  aAsexual seed formation, or apomixis, in the Hieracium subgenus Pilosella is controlled by two dominant independent genetic loci, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS (LOA) and LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS (LOP). We examined apomixis mutants that had lost function in one or both loci to establish their developmental roles during seed formation. In apomicts, sexual reproduction is initiated first. Somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells differentiate near meiotic cells, and the sexual pathway is terminated as AI cells undergo mitotic embryo sac formation. Seed initiation is fertilization-independent. Using a partially penetrant cytotoxic reporter to inhibit meioisis, we showed that developmental events leading to the completion of meiotic tetrad formation are required for AI cell formation. Sexual initiation may therefore stimulate activity of the LOA locus, which was found to be required for AI cell formation and subsequent suppression of the sexual pathway. AI cells undergo nuclear division to form embryo sacs, in which LOP functions gametophytically to stimulate fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm formation. Loss of function in either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in total reversion to sexual reproduction. Therefore, in these apomicts, sexual reproduction is the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode genes essential for sexual reproduction, but may function to recruit the sexual machinery at specific time points to enable apomixis. 3aHieracium 3aPilosella 3aapomixis 3acytotoxicity 3aembryo sac 3aendosperm 3agenes 3aloci 3amutants 3aparthenogenesis 3asexual reproduction 2aAsteraceaexcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aChromosome Segregation 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGametogenesis, Plant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Loci 2aGermination 2aMeiosis 2aOvulexcytologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPollenxgrowth & development 2aPollination 2aReproduction, Asexual 2aSeedsxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aTetraploidy1 aJohnson, Susan D.1 aRodrigues, Julio C.M.1 aOkada, Takashi1 aHu, Yingkao1 aTsuchiya, Tohru1 aWilson, Saira1 aFletcher, Pam1 aIto, Kanae1 aSuzuki, Go1 aMukai, Yasuhiko1 aFehrer, Judith1 aBicknell, Ross A.0 tplant journal.g2011 June, v. 66, no. 5 p.890-902dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04556.x 7aarticle02965naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245008300115300001600198500001500214520207500229650002002304650001402324650000802338650002002346650001002366650001402376650001302390650001402403650002502417650001902442653001102461773008202472852000902554939003302563945000802596946001102604655001202615991590479510742620221116165526.0920415s1991    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920012312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aEffects of low-fat lactovegetarian diet on health parameters of adult subjects  ap. 255-267.  a2019-12-04  aForty-two healthy adult omnivorous subjects and 28 experienced lactovegetarians participated in this experimental study lasting for seven months, February through August. The objective was to assess the effects of a low-fat, low-vitamin D diet on health status indicators, in particular on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Initially, 21 omnivorous subjects changed from mixed-type diet to a low-fat lactovegetarian diet. Their other health habits, such as rest, exercise, and use of stimulants, were not altered. In addition, a reference group was studied consisting of 21 omnivorous subjects, who did not change their dietary practices. No changes in weight, body mass index, defecation frequency, or maximal oxygen intake were found during the study among the new lactovegetarians, nor was there any significant change in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The new lactovegetarians, however, reported more often changes in their perceived health, increased diarrhea and flatulence, as well as increased vigor and alertness, especially during the first two months. After seven months, the changes in perceived health were diminished. The subjects, however, still reported less constipation and felt more alert than before the study. As biochemical health indicators, serum levels of 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, selenium, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, free cholesterol triglycerides, and apolipoproteins A-I, B and C-II were determined. In winter, relatively low serum 25(OH)D concentrations were observed more often in the lactovegetarian subjects. In late spring and summer, no significant differences were observed between the groups. The lactovegetarian diet, compared with the omnivorous diet, had a favorable effect in particular on serum cholesterol and retinol concentrations. Serum selenium concentrations decreased during consumption of the lactovegetarian diet. The effects of the lactovegetarian diet on serum concentrations of apolipoproteins A-I, B and C-II, alpha-tocopherol, and triglycerides were minimal. 3avegetarian diet 3avitamin A 3amen 3aapolipoproteins 3awomen 3avitamin E 3aselenium 3avitamin D 3aHealth and Pathology 3ablood pressure 0alipids0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g1991, v. 25, no. 3 p.255-267x0367-02447nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02205naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009000162300001600252520101800268650002901286650001901315650002401334650001601358650001401374650002101388650001201409650002601421650002401447650002601471650001801497650001301515650002201528651001201550700002501562700001901587773015001606856004201756852000901798655001201807IND60588683620221116165450.0180129e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058868362DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.265422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortson, Russ E.10aManaging Irrigation with the SOYGRO Crop Growth Model in the Coastal Plain of Georgia  ap. 441-446.  aComputer simulation of crop growth and management can improve management decisions for profitable production of soybean. This study was undertaken to adapt a crop model to evaluate irrigation management options and to simplify its use for farmers and extension agents. The yield prediction of the SOYGRO soybean crop growth model was validated for three soils and one cultivar using three years of data from controlled irrigation tests. The SOYGRO model was then used with 12 years of historical weather data to assess irrigation strategies. An economically preferred strategy was determined consisting of a threshold at 50% available soil water and 1.5 cm of water per irrigation. A PC version of the model was modified to allow real-time crop simulation to facilitate its use by growers and extension personnel. This modification allowed the user to run SOYGRO with current weather data then change to one of three hypothetical weather scenarios to predict the yield and profitability of an irrigation strategy. 3aagricultural engineering 3acoastal plains 3acomputer simulation 3acrop models 3acultivars 3aextension agents 3agrowers 3airrigation management 3ameteorological data 3aplant available water 3aprofitability 3asoybeans 3ayield forecasting 3aGeorgia1 aMcClendon, Ronald W.1 aHook, James E.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1989 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.441-446dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.26542  aDNAL 7aarticle00694naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002900115300001500144520010200159650001400261650002100275650002100296773007200317852000900389939003300398945000800431946001300439655001200452991590479310742620221116165406.0920417e199203  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920012612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10a7 ways to start your day  ap. 35- 56.  aQuick breakfast recipes with nutrient content and food exchanges are the subject of this article. 3abreakfast 3afood preparation 3anutrient content0 tWeight watchers.g1992 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.35- 56x0043-21807nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01030naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005400115300001200169520020800181650000900389650001600398650002000414650003100434650001500465653002200480653002100502653003100523653003000554773006900584852000900653939003300662945000800695946001300703655001200716991590478850742620221116165520.0920417e199202  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920012692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aChange needed, says GAO, but tradition traps USDA  ap. 6-7.  aThe General Accounting Office released a scathing report concerning USDA's organizational structure.

The inhibition of CDK2 plays a central role in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. However, whether CDK2 also influences the survival of cells under genotoxic stress is unknown. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are emerging as key regulators of cell survival. CDK2 specifically phosphorylated FOXO1 at serine-249 (Ser²⁴⁹) in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser²⁴⁹ resulted in cytoplasmic localization and inhibition of FOXO1. This phosphorylation was abrogated upon DNA damage through the cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is dependent on the protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Moreover, silencing of FOXO1 by small interfering RNA diminished DNA damage-induced death in both p53-deficient and p53-proficient cells. This effect was reversed by restored expression of FOXO1 in a manner depending on phosphorylation of Ser²⁴⁹. Functional interaction between CDK2 and FOXO1 provides a mechanism that regulates apoptotic cell death after DNA strand breakage. 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell viability 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3adeath 3agenotoxicity 3aphosphorylation 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aRegan, Kevin M.1 aLou, Zhenkun1 aChen, Junjie1 aTindall, Donald J.0 tScience.g2006 Oct. 13, v. 314, no. 5797 p.294-297dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11305123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20061016b20061202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02296naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245016700186300001600353500014600369500001500515520078000530650002001310650002801330650001201358650001101370650002301381650002501404650001301429650002601442650003401468650001401502653002401516653001501540653002101555700001501576773009601591852000901687856010701696930003301803945001301836946001301849655001201862IND2051189720221116165622.0960509e199604  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205118972DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0514:SCCROC>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKinney, A.D.10aComparative response of Ceriodaphnia dubia and juvenile Anodonta imbecillis to pulp and paper mill effluents discharged to the Tennessee River and its tributaries  ap. 514-517.  aPaper presented at the 15th Annual Meeting, Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, October 30-November 3, 1994, Denver, Colorado.  a2019-12-04  aThe responses of Ceriodaphnia dubia (daphnid) in a 7-d chronic daily-renewal bioassay and 6-d-old juvenile Anodonta imbecillis (paper pondshell mussel) in a 9-d acute daily-renewal bioassay are compared. Values for relative sensitivity to selected complex, industrial, whole-effluent samples were generated following determination of either observed or calculated no-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC). Results from tests using effluents from six pulp and paper products facilities in the Tennessee River Valley indicate that A. imbecillis juveniles are substantially more sensitive than C. dubia to selected effluents. It is suggested that a juvenile mussel bioassay should be used to assess the toxicity of effluent releases to waters with freshwater mussel resources. 3awater pollution 3ainterspecific variation 3amussels 3arivers 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3adevelopmental stages 3atoxicity 3abiological resistance 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3amortality 0aspecies differences 0apollutants 0ajuvenile mussels1 aWade, D.C.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1996 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.514-517x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0514:SCCROC>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02218naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001500167245007900182300001600261520092200277650002501199650001501224650001501239650003401254650002201288650001501310650002001325650001201345650001401357653001601371653002301387653002201410653002501432653001901457700001601476700002101492773009601513852000901609856010701618930003301725945001301758946001301771655001201784IND2051191820221116165644.0960509e199604  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119182DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0560:NIFMRF>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTester, M.10aNeogastropod imposex for monitoring recovery from marine TBT contamination  ap. 560-567.  aImposex, the imposition of male sexual characters on female snails, was used as a bioindicator of recovery from tributyltin (TBT) pollution in the Pacific Northwest. Whelks surveyed before TBT use was regulated had shown a high frequency of affected females in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia; and lower frequency on the west coast of Vancouver Island. A reduction in imposex is now evident on the west coast of Vancouver Island and in some locations in the Strait of Georgia. There is no clear evidence of recovery near Victoria, and Vancouver Harbour still does not have whelks in any abundance, if at all. Of the four species studied, Nucella emarginata is the most suitable bioindicator species because it is abundantly distributed and has the shortest lifespan (1-2 years). When frequency of imposex remains at 100%, the FPL (female penis length) is still available as a useful bioindicator. 3aorganotin pesticides 3apollutants 3aGastropoda 3asex differentiation disorders 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3awater pollution 3afemales 3afrequency 0atributyltin 0anucella emarginata 0anucella lamellosa 0anucella canaliculata 0asearlesia dira1 aEllis, D.V.1 aThompson, J.A.J.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1996 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.560-567x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0560:NIFMRF>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02200naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002400167245007500191300001600266500001500282520099000297650001501287650002401302650001901326650002101345650001701366650001401383650001401397653001501411653002501426700002001451700001601471700001501487700001701502773009601519852000901615856010701624930003301731945001301764946001301777655001201790IND2051190320221116165612.0960509e199604  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119032DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0525:SBDAPI>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalvet-Monfray, K.10aSynergy between deltamethrin and prochloraz in bees: modeling approach  ap. 525-534.  a2019-12-04  aThe metabolic hypothesis proposes that the fungicide prochloraz acts synergistically on deltamethrin by inhibiting oxidative metabolism of deltamethrin. The limits of validity of this hypothesis were tested using a pharmacokinetic box model. Experimental work showed that bee mortalities were higher after 2 h in groups sprayed with deltamethrin at 0.25 g.ha-1 in the presence of prochloraz (25 g.ha-1) than in those sprayed at 1 g.ha-1 with deltamethrin alone. We defined t as the time at which the internal concentration of deltamethrin is the same for both treatments. For the metabolic hypothesis to be consistent with experimental results, t must be less than 2 h. Given t < 2 h, the model was used to study pharmacokinetic parameter values. Published parameter values were inconsistent with simulation results because in all cases t was greater than 2 h. Consequently, the synergy between prochloraz and deltamethrin cannot be explained by the inhibition of oxidative metabolism. 3aprochloraz 3amathematical models 3aApis mellifera 3apharmacokinetics 3adeltamethrin 3asynergism 3amortality 0ametabolism 0adeterministic models1 aBelzunces, L.P.1 aColin, M.E.1 aFleche, C.1 aSabatier, P.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1996 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.525-534x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1996)015<0525:SBDAPI>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02221naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007700170300001600247520117500263650001901438650001101457650002601468650002401494650001501518650002501533651001101558651001801569700002801587700001901615773020301634856004901837852000901886655001201895IND60635646120221116165519.0190402e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063564612DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.8112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvensson, Cecilia10aTrend detection in river flow series: 2. Flood and low-flow index series  ap. 811-824.  aMajor floods in Europe and North America during the past decade have provoked the question of whether or not they are an effect of a changing climate. This study investigates changes in observational data, using up to 100-year-long daily mean river flow records at 21 stations worldwide. Trends in seven flood and low-flow index series are assessed using Mann-Kendall and linear regression methods. Emphasis was on the comparison of trends in these flow index series, particularly in peak-over-threshold (POT) series as opposed to annual maximum (AM) river flow series. There is a larger number of significant trends in the AM than in the POT flood magnitude series, probably relating to the way the series are constructed. Low flood peaks occurring at the beginning or end of a time series with trend may be too low to be selected for the POT analysis. However, one peak per year will always be selected for the AM series, making the slope steeper and/or the series longer, resulting in a more significant trend. There is no general pattern of increasing or decreasing numbers or magnitudes of floods, but there are significant increases in half of the low-flow series. 3aclimate change 3afloods 3aobservational studies 3aregression analysis 3ariver flow 3atime series analysis 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aKUNDZEWICZ, ZBIGNIEW W.1 aMaurer, Thomas0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2005, v. 50, no. 5 p.811-824dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.811  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010300168300001600271520157500287650002001862650001101882650001901893650001201912650001101924650001501935650001901950650001101969650001301980650002301993650002002016650001502036651002102051700002002072700002002092700002102112700002202133773020302155856004902358852000902407655001202416IND60635644720221116163014.0190402e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063564472DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.2005.50.4.6692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekeli, A. Emre10aModelling the temporal variation in snow-covered area derived from satellite images for simulating  ap. 669-682.  aMonitoring the change of snow-covered area (SCA) in a basin is vitally important for optimum operation of water resources, where the main contribution comes from snowmelt. A methodology for obtaining the depletion pattern of SCA, which is based on satellite image observations where mean daily air temperature is used, is applied for the 1997 water year and tested for the 1998 water year. The study is performed at the Upper Euphrates River basin in Turkey (10 216 km2). The major melting period in this basin starts in early April. The cumulated mean daily air temperature (CMAT) is correlated to the depletion of snow-covered area with the start of melting. The analysis revealed that SCA values obtained from NOAA-AVHRR satellite images are exponentially correlated to CMAT for the whole basin in a lumped manner, where R 2 values of 0.98 and 0.99 were obtained for the water years 1997 and 1998, respectively. The applied methodology enables the interpolation between the SCA observations and extrapolation. Such a procedure reduces the number of satellite images required for analysis and provides solution for the cloud-obscured images. Based on the image availability, the effect of the number of images on the quality of snowmelt runoff simulations is also discussed. In deriving the depletion curve for SCA, if the number of images is reduced, the timing of image analysis within the snowmelt period is found very important. Analysis of the timing of satellite images indicated that images from the early and middle parts of the melt period are more important. 3aair temperature 3abasins 3aimage analysis 3amelting 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3atemporal variation 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aTurkey (country)1 aAkyürek, Zuhal1 aŞensoy,  Aynur1 aŞorman, A.

The sediment rating curve and multi-linear regression are also applied to the same data. Statistic measures were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The daily streamflow and suspended sediment data for two stations—Quebrada Blanca station and Rio Valenciano station—operated by the US Geological Survey were used as case studies.

The coding method is applied to generate random self-similar river networks, and the corresponding algorithm for calculating the geometric distances of the links is employed to determine the width function of the river networks, and thus evaluates the adaptability of the process. The width function-based geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (WF-GIUH) model is then applied to estimate the runoff of the Po-bridge watershed in northern Taiwan. The results imply that the separately random self-similar generating algorithm can be used to simulate river networks during the rainfall–runoff process. It can also help analyse the variations of the river network when rainfall locations change and study the influence on hydrological responses (IUH) when the shape of river network changes. 3aalgorithms 3ageometry 3ageomorphology 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aTaiwan1 aWang, Ru-Yih0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2005, v. 50, no. 5 p.769-781dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.769  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001600272520069100288650001500979650001300994650002701007650001101034700001701045773020301062856004901265852000901314655001201323IND60635645420221116162846.0190402e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063564542DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.7532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Chun-Po10aCoding random self-similar river networks and calculating geometric distances: 1.

A probability-distributed soil moisture model is coupled with a linear parallel routing scheme, and conditioned on rainfall–runoff observations from three catchments in the southeast of England. Using an abstraction control problem, which requires accurate simulation of the intermediate flow range, it is shown that using the traditional RMSE fit criterion, produces operationally sub-optimal predictions. This is true in the identification period, when applied to a testing period, and to proxy catchment data. Using a second case study of the Leaf River in Mississippi (USA), where the focus changes to predicting flood peaks over a specified threshold, also suggests that the relevant flood threshold should govern the objective function choice. It is concluded that, due to limitations in the structure of the employed model, it would be counter-productive to try to achieve a good all-round representation of the rainfall–runoff processes, and that a more empirical approach to identification may be preferred for specific forecasting problems. This leaves us with the question of how far hydrological realism should be sacrificed in favour of purpose-driven objective functions. 3acase studies 3ahydrologic models 3aintermediate flow 3aprediction 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil water 3awatersheds 3aEngland 3aMississippi1 aMcIntyre, Neil0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2005, v. 50, no. 5 p.735-751dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.5.735  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005400115300001300169520316700182650002203349650001603371650001903387650001503406650002303421650002103444653002103465773009803486852000903584939003303593945000803626946001103634655001203645991590470570742620221116163148.0921014e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920031712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aHazard analysis and critical control point system  ap. 1-23.  aThe National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (Committee) reconvened a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Working Group in July 1991. The primary purpose was to review the Committee's November 1989 HACCP document comparing it with a draft report prepared by a HACCP Working Group of the Codex Committee on Food Hygiene. Based upon its review, the Committee has determined to expand upon its initial report by emphasizing the concept of prevention, incorporating a decision tree intended to facilitate the identification of Critical Control Points (CCPs), and providing a more detailed explanation of the application of HACCP principles. The Committee again endorses HACCP as an effective and rational means of assuring food safety from harvest to consumption. Preventing problems from occurring is the paramount goal underlying any HACCP system. Seven basic principles are employed in the development of HACCP plans that meet the stated goal. These principles include hazard assessment, CCP identification, establishing critical limits, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, documentation, and verification procedures. Under such systems, if a deviation occurs indicating that control has been lost, the deviation is detected and appropriate steps are taken to reestablish control in a timely manner to assure that potentially hazardous products do not reach the consumer. In the application of HACCP, the use of microbiological testing is seldom an effective means of monitoring critical control points (CCPs) because of the time required to obtain results. In most instances, monitoring of CCPs can best be accomplished through the use of physical and chemical tests, and through visual observations. Microbiological criteria do, however, play a role in verifying that the overall HACCP system is working. The Committee believes that the HACCP principles should be standardized to create uniformity in its work, and in training and applying the HACCP system by industry and regulatory authorities. In accordance with the National Academy of Sciences recommendation, the HACCP system must be developed by each food establishment and tailored to its individual products, processing and distribution conditions. In keeping with its charge of providing recommendations to its sponsoring agencies regarding microbiological food safety issues, this document focuses on this area. The Committee recognizes that in order to assure food safety, properly designed HACCP systems must also consider chemical and physical hazards in addition to other biological hazards. In order for a successful HACCP program to be implemented, management must be committed to a HACCP approach. A commitment by management will indicate an awareness of the benefits and costs of HACCP and include education and training of employees. Benefits, in addition to food safety, are better use of resources and timely response to problems. The Committee designed this document to guide the food industry in the implementation of HACCP systems. The Committee recommends that future documents address the role or regulatory agencies in the HACCP system. 3afood microbiology 3afood safety 3ahealth hazards 3amonitoring 3aprogram evaluation 3aprogram planning 0aproblem analysis0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1992 Sept., v. 71, no. 9 p.1-23x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001900146245012400165300001600289500002400305520129400329650001801623650001701641650002201658650001301680650001001693650001201703650002301715650002501738650001801763650002001781650001601801650002101817650002001838650002101858650001501879651001601894653002301910653002401933653002401957653002101981700001602002773009502018852000902113856009302122930003302215945002502248946001102273655001202284IND4365831220221116163136.0041129s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436583122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aF600 0aK1101 aMcAlpine, K.G.14aThe effects of small-scale environmental heterogeneity on seed germination in experimental treefall gaps in New Zealand  ap. 207-215.  aIncludes references  aSeed germination of woody species was studied in treefall gaps in New Zealand to assess how environmental heterogeneity affects regeneration from seed. Gaps were created in a relictual Pinus radiata plantation destined for restoration to native forest. Seeds of the native species Alectryon excelsus, Macropiper excelsum, and Fuchsia excorticata, and the invasive alien species Cytisus scoparius and Berberis darwinii were sown in sites differing in exposure, with and without 3 cm of pine litter. Litter promoted germination of Alectryon and Macropiper, independent of site. Without litter, percent germination of Macropiper was negatively correlated with percent open sky overhead. Germination of Fuchsia was significantly higher in treefall gaps than in the forest understory, with litter having little effect. Cytisus germinated most successfully in sites exposed to direct solar radiation, with or without litter. Percent germination of Berberis was high in all sites, and was consistently promoted by litter. Glasshouse trials for each species showed the same effects of litter cover as found in the field. These results suggest that microenvironmental heterogeneity can be an important influence on the species composition of regenerating vegetation within and around treefall gaps. 3aPinus radiata 3aforest trees 3aCytisus scoparius 3aBerberis 3aPiper 3aFuchsia 3aforest plantations 3anatural regeneration 3aforest litter 3aconifer needles 3acanopy gaps 3aseed germination 3asolar radiation 3ainvasive species 3aunderstory 3aNew Zealand 0aAlectryon excelsus 0aMacropiper excelsum 0aFuchsia excorticata 0aBerberis dawinii1 aDrake, D.R.0 tPlant ecology.g2003, v. 165, no. 2 p.207-215dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-0237/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03240naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245012400154300001600278500002400294500001500318520172800333650001502061650001102076650002002087650001302107650002202120650002602142650002802168650002102196650001002217650001102227650002202238650003602260650001102296650001502307650002802322650001002350650002002360651001102380653000802391700001702399700001602416773009502432852000902527856009302536930003302629945002502662946001102687655001202698IND4365830520221116162953.0041129s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436583052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aF6001 aRestrepo, C.10aLandslides significantly alter land cover and the distribution of biomass: an example from the Ninole ridges of Hawai'i  ap. 131-143.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the Ninole ridges of Hawai'i we investigated how landslides influence ecosystem development and modify land cover and the distribution of biomass. We estimated above and below-ground biomass, and N and P concentration in leaves (Metrosideros polymorpha) and very fine roots (all species), for vegetation developing on landslides of three age classes (young, < 18 yr; intermediate, <or= 42 yr; and old ca. 124 yr) and on undisturbed soils (ca. 430 yr). The undisturbed soils were derived from ash underlain by basalt. To quantify changes in land cover and the distribution of biomass we combined our estimates of biomass with estimates of the area covered by each vegetation class. The latter estimates were obtained from the analysis and classification of color-infrared aerial photographs. Average above- and below-ground biomass for the herbaceous vegetation (young landslides) was 10.4 and 3.2 t/ha, whereas for the ohia-non ash forest (intermediate and old landslides) was 37.5 and 5.2 t/ha, respectively. For the ohia-ash forest (undisturbed sites), average above and below-ground biomass was 354.6 and 9.5 t/ha, respectively. Average foliar N for the herbaceous and ohia-non ash forest ranged between 0.80-0.84%, whereas root P between 0.056-0.040%, respectively. For the ohia-ash forest, average foliar and root P was 0.918% and 0.036%, respectively. Based on changes in vegetation cover during the last 430 yr, we estimated rate of disturbance at 15% per century or equivalently that 53 t/ha biomass per century exited through the system. The removal of ash-derived soils by landslides significantly alters successional trajectories and by doing so may be transforming the Ninole ecosystems in irreversible ways. 3alandslides 3ashrubs 3amontane forests 3anitrogen 3aherbaceous plants 3aecological succession 3adry matter accumulation 3avegetation cover 3atrees 3aleaves 3aforest ecosystems 3achemical constituents of plants 3abasalt 3aphosphorus 3aMetrosideros polymorpha 3aroots 3adisturbed soils 3aHawaii 0aash1 aVitousek, P.1 aNeville, P.0 tPlant ecology.g2003, v. 166, no. 1 p.131-143dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-0237/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080724b20080801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02204naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100002100134245008300155300001800238500001500256520087800271650002001149650001301169650001301182650002601195650001601221650001101237650001001248650002101258650003201279650001101311650000901322650000901331650002501340650002901365650002501394650002401419653001601443653002901459653002301488700002401511700002101535773011601556852000901672939003301681945000801714655001201722991590467370742620221116162935.0780301e197707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794434622DNAL7 a8790772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRand, William M.10aDetermination of protein allowances in human adults from nitrogen balance data  ap. 1129-1134.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: The problem of predicting human protein requirements is examined in detail. Three methods from the literature that analyze nitrogen balance data are shown to represent a logical sequence wherein each takes into account more sources of variation than does the previous one. These are the single level method and two versions of the multiple level method, all of which assume a population response curve. A fourth method is proposed as the next step in this sequence. This method calculates a response curve for each individual and works with the individual requirements. Since each method makes fewer assumptions about the data and, therefore, about the biological situation of population protein needs, each method gives successively larger protein allowance values, while at the same time identifying the sources of variability and uncertainty in these estimates. 3anutrient intake 3aproteins 3anitrogen 3anutrient requirements 3ameasurement 3aadults 2aAdult 2aDietary Proteins 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeat 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNutritional Requirements 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aStatistics as Topic 0amethodology 0aProtein requirements FAO 0anitrogen retention1 aScrimshaw, Nevin S.1 aYoung, Vernon R.0 pAmer J Clin NutrtAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1977 July, v. 30, no. 7 p.1129-1134x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780301c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01080naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005900115300001300174520035200187650002300539650001800562653002300580653003000603773010500633852001300738939003300751945000800784946001300792852000900805655001200814991590467310742620221116163007.0921119e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920034672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aScholarships available for the 1993-1994 academic year  ap. 1135.  aProgress in the educational and scientific advancement of dietetics inspires friends of the profession to make funds available for qualified candidates to receive scholarships through contributions to The American Dietetic Association Foundation.

The responses for intake of the 33 food items in the questionnaire were fairly reproducible. Food items with substantial correlation coefficients in both groups of men tended to be consumed on a more habitual basis. This finding suggests that if habitually consumed foods are linked to specific cancers, it is less likely that such associations occur by chance. This is of particular importance because when many food items are considered in a dietary study, chance association between a specific food and cancer in not an infrequent event. 3aneoplasms 3adiet study techniques 3aeating habits 3afood intake 3aquestionnaires 3adigestive system diseases 2aAged 2aDiet Surveys 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aGastrointestinal Neoplasms 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aProspective Studies 2aTime Factors 3aHawaii 3aJapan 0aHawaii 0aJapanxethnology. 0aDietary information1 aHankin, Jean H.1 aRhoads, George G.0 pAmer J Clin NutrtAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1976 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1432-1436x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19770301c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle02281naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100002000134245004700154300001400201520092600215650002101141650001501162650003201177650001701209650002201226650001501248650001001263650001801273650001601291650002101307650002801328650001501356650002001371650001101391650002101402650000901423650001601432650003601448650004401484651001301528653002401541700001601565700001501581700001701596773011201613852000901725930003301734945000801767655001201775991590465120742620221116162157.0780601e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894827642DNAL7 a4134272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarac-Nieto, M.10aBody composition in chronic undernutrition  ap. 23-40.  aExtract; Anthropometric, biochemical, metabolic, hematological variables and body water compartments have been measured in 49 adult male subjects who exhibited a wide range of nutritional states from normal to severely undernourished. With severe nutritional involvement, both fat depots and body cell mass were significantly diminished. Muscle cell mass was more affected than other cells in the body. These data could indicate that in the group with moderate compromise, energy reserves were maintained but dietary protein deficiencies were not compensated for. Both calorie and protein deficiencies were evident in the subjects with severe undernutrition. Multiple regression equations were developed that allow prediction of muscle cell mass, fat free weight, and body cell mass from simple anthropometry and serum albumin levels. Decreases in serum albumin concentration were best related to deficits in muscle mass. 3abody composition 3ametabolism 3aanthropometric measurements 3amalnutrition 3ahematologic tests 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBlood Cells 2aBody Composition 2aBody Fluid Compartments 2aBody Water 2aChronic Disease 2aHumans 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Disordersxmetabolism 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxmetabolism 0aColombia 0aBiochemical effects1 aSpurr, G.B.1 aLotero, H.1 aMaksud, M.G.0 pAmer J Clin NutrtAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1978 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.23-40x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01685naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100002400134245003100158300001800189500001500207520048600222650002200708650001600730650002700746650003700773650003200810650001100842650001200853650002100865650002600886650002300912650003400935650002600969650002200995650004701017650002301064653001001087773011601097852000901213939003301222945000801255655001201263991590464650742620221116162233.0781101e197806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894839512DNAL7 a3521272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartoshuk, Linda M.14aThe psychophysics of taste  ap. 1068-1077.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: Modern psychophysical studies of sensory systems have produced new insight into sensory function and new techniques that have application to the clinical evaluation of taste. Most previous taste evaluation has been done with threshold measures that are subject to a variety of problems and that also fail to provide an accurate picture of suprathreshold sensitivity. The scaling of suprathreshold intensity reflects a patient's taste world more accurately than thresholds. 3ataste sensitivity 3ameasurement 2aCitratesxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aHumans 2aMethods 2aPsychophysiology 2aQuininexpharmacology 2aSalivaxphysiology 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSucrosexpharmacology 2aTastexphysiology 2aTaste Thresholdxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTonguexphysiology 0ataste0 pAmer J Clin NutrtAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1978 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1068-1077x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19781101c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01884naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001600099040001800115100002400133245007700157300001600234520070700250650002000957650000900977650002000986650001001006650003201016650002801048650002801076650001801104650001101122650003101133650002601164650003201190650000901222650000901231650001201240650002601252700002001278773011401298852000901412939003301421945000801454655001201462991590464210742620221116162445.0780601e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894827782DNAL7 a230032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, B.S.Narasinga.13aAn in vitro method for predicting the bioavailability of iron from foods  ap. 169-175.  aExtract: An in vitro method for the determination of availability of nonheme iron from foods and diets was investigated. The percent ionizable iron at pH 7.5 in a number of diets was shown to correlate highly with percent iron absorption from the same diets observed in the adult males. Ionizable iron at pH 7.5 was shown to increase in presence of ascorbic acid and meat extract while it decreased in presence of phytate and tannins, similar to the effects of these factors on iron absorption in human subjects. Based on these observations it is proposed that ionizable iron at pH 7.5 determined as described in this study can be used as a reliable measure of bioavailability of nonheme iron in foods. 3abioavailability 3airon 3airon absorption 2aAdult 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aBiological Availability 2aEdible Grainxanalysis. 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIronxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMethods 2aVegetablesxanalysis.1 aPrabhavathi, T.0 pAmer J Clin NutrtAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1978 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.169-175x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780601c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle02052naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245016400130300001800294520085100312650001901163650001901182650002001201650001601221650001601237650001801253650002801271650001901299650001901318650002901337650002001366653001601386700001701402700001601419700001101435700001601446773011201462852000901574930003301583945001301616946001301629655001201642IND2045213220221116162744.0950323e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204521322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, A.J.10aComparison of dehydrin gene expression and freezing tolerance in Bromus inermis and Secale cereale grown in controlled environments, hydroponics, and the field  ap. 1213-1216.  aThere have been very few reports on the expression of stress-responsive genes in field-grown material. A barley dehydrin cDNA was used to investigate the expression of dehydrin-like transcripts after low-temperature and abscisic acid-induced acclimation of bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) suspension cells and of bromegrass and rye (Secale cereale) plants grown in the field and under controlled environmental conditions. Field-acclimated plants accumulated high levels of dehydrin transcripts and were very freezing tolerant. Plants grown in pots and hydroponics under controlled environments also accumulated dehydrin transcripts and showed increased freezing tolerance. Simulation of a combined drought and freezing stress in pots resulted in expression of dehydrin-like transcripts comparable to those observed in field-acclimated material. 3aBromus inermis 3aSecale cereale 3agene expression 3aacclimation 3acold stress 3aabscisic acid 3acell suspension culture 3aplant proteins 3acold tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3astress response 0afield tests1 aWeninger, A.1 aWilen, R.W.1 aFu, P.1 aGusta, L.V.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.1213-1216aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02653naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245009600167300001800263500001500281520085700296650001401153650002601167650002201193650002001215650003601235650001801271650002101289650002001310650003801330650001901368650003501387650002401422650002101446650002701467650006101494650001501555650004001570650002501610650002101635650008701656650002201743650002201765653001701787653003801804700001801842700001801860700001701878773011201895852000902007930003302016945001302049946001302062655001202075IND2045212720221116162554.0950323e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204521272DNAL7 a78246462pmid7 aPMC1596502pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGuirl, M.A.10aPurification and characterization of pea seedling amine oxidase for crystallization studies  ap. 1205-1211.  a2019-12-05  aPea (Pisum sativum L.) seedling amine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6) is the first amine oxidase to be crystallized that diffracts to atomic resolution (2.5 angstrom). Extensive modifications of a published purification procedure were necessary to obtain protein that would give diffraction-quality crystals. Here we report the improved purification and also use this high-purity protein to reexamine some fundamental characteristics of pea seedling amine oxidase. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm and the molecular mass of the protein are investigated by a variety of techniques, yielding extinction coefficient at 280 nm = 20 cm-1 and a mass of 150 +/- 6 kD. In addition, the stoichiometry of the metal and organic cofactors, Cu(II) and 6-hydroxy dopa (Topa) quinone, respectively, is examined. The ratio of Cu(II):Topa:protein monomer is found to be 1:1:1. 3aseedlings 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3aspectral analysis 3acrystallization 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPisum sativum 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme activity 2aAmine Oxidase (Copper-Containing) 2aChromatography 2aChromatography, DEAE-Cellulose 2aChromatography, Gel 2aCopperxanalysis 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aDihydroxyphenylalaninexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aDurapatite 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFabaceaexenzymology 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donorsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSpectrophotometry 0apurification 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing)1 aMcCahon, C.D.1 aMcKeown, K.A.1 aDooley, D.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.1205-1211aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02189naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001800206520123800224650002501462650001201487650001701499650001801516650001601534650001401550650001401564653002401578700002101602700002001623700001601643773011201659852000901771930003301780945001301813946001301826655001201839IND2045211720221116162750.0950323e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204521172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyke, K.A.10aarc6, a fertile Arabidopsis mutant with only two mesophyll cell chloroplasts  ap. 1169-1177.  aA novel mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, arc6 (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts), has been isolated from a transfer DNA-mutagenized population of Arabidopsis seedlings arc6 has the most extreme arc mutant phenotype we have yet described, with only one to three chloroplasts per leaf mesophyll cell compared to a mean of 83 in cells of the wild-type var Wassilewskija. The chloroplasts of arc6 are 20-fold larger than wild-type chloroplasts. Chloroplast division is almost certainly precluded in arc6 mesophyll cells, since chloroplast number per cell does not increase during mesophyll cell expansion, arc6 chloroplasts are long and thin in cross-section and only one-half the width of wild-type chloroplasts and the arrangement of thylakoid membranes is largely unaltered. arc6 segregates as a monogenic recessive nuclear mutation in a normal Mendelian manner and the arc6 phenotype is stably inherited for at least four generations. arc6 plants grow normally and are fertile, although the rosette leaves appear curled and twisted. arc6 plants accumulate 70 to 75% of the biomass of wild type. The phenotype of this novel mutant is discussed in relation to the nature of the control of chloroplast division in leaf cells. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3achloroplasts 3acell division 3acell growth 3amesophyll 3aphenotype 0acell ultrastructure1 aRutherford, S.M.1 aRobertson, E.J.1 aLeech, R.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.1169-1177aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03104naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014600169300001600315500001900331520173100350650001902081650001402100650001302114650002002127650001802147650001202165650001302177650001902190650001402209650001402223650001902237650001402256650001602270650002002286650001402306650002402320700002102344700002502365700002102390773017102411856004602582961000902628852000902637655001202646IND60728971920221116162734.0210226e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072897192DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.256.8.9062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaucher, Mathieu R.10aComparison of clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features between dogs with chronic gastritis with and without lymphofollicular hyperplasia  ap. 906-913.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOBJECTIVE To compare clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic features between dogs with chronic gastritis (CG) with and without lymphofollicular hyperplasia (LFH). ANIMALS 64 and 56 dogs with CG with (cases) and without (controls) LFH, respectively. PROCEDURES The medical record database of a referral clinic was searched to identify dogs that underwent endoscopic examination of the upper portion of the gastrointestinal tract and were subsequently determined to have CG with or without LFH between October 2006 and February 2011. Signalment and clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings were compared between cases and controls. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with CG with LFH. RESULTS Compared with controls, cases were significantly younger and more likely to be of a brachycephalic phenotype. The proportions of dogs with a poor body condition or diarrhea were significantly lower and the proportions of dogs with inspiratory dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or hyperemia and discoloration of the gastric mucosa were significantly higher for the case group, compared with the control group. Inspiratory dyspnea, gastric mucosal hyperemia, and gastritis severity were positively associated, whereas poor body condition was negatively associated, with CG with LFH on multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The strong positive association between inspiratory dyspnea and CG with LFH suggested that the condition may be a consequence of an increase in negative intrathoracic pressure rather than a distinct clinical entity. Prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism by which inspiratory dyspnea contributes to the development of CG with LFH. 3abody condition 3adatabases 3adiarrhea 3adigestive tract 3adiscoloration 3adyspnea 3aexercise 3agastric mucosa 3agastritis 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahyperemia 3ahyperplasia 3amedical records 3aphenotype 3aregression analysis1 aBiourge, Vincent1 aGerman, Alexander J.1 aFreiche, Valerie0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 256, no. 8 p.906-913dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.256.8.906  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01100naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005400126300001800180520033000198650001600528650001700544650001200561650001600573650002200589650002700611700001700638700001500655773007500670852000900745939003300754946001100787655001200798IND9304730320221116162545.0930810e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930473032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvent, A.G.14aThe biosynthesis of nectriapyrone and vermopyrone  ap. 3447-3449.  aThe [1,2-(13)C2]acetate and [Me-(13)C]methionine labelling patterns of nectriapyrone and vermopyrone are consistent with their polyketide origin with the extra methyl groups being introduced from methionine rather than with the originally proposed terpenoid origin for nectriapyrone.

It has been hypothesized that invasive growth of malignant prostate cells may cause these microvesicles, normally released into seminal fluid, to appear in interstitial space and therewith into peripheral circulation. The suitability of prostasomes as blood biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer was tested by using an expanded variant of the proximity ligation assay (PLA). We developed an extremely sensitive and specific assay (4PLA) for detection of complex target structures such as microvesicles in which the target is first captured via an immobilized antibody and subsequently detected by using four other antibodies with attached DNA strands. The requirement for coincident binding by five antibodies to generate an amplifiable reporter results in both increased specificity and sensitivity. The assay successfully detected significantly elevated levels of prostasomes in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy, compared with controls and men with benign biopsy results. The medians for prostasome levels in blood plasma of patients with prostate cancer were 2.5 to sevenfold higher compared with control samples in two independent studies, and the assay also distinguished patients with high and medium prostatectomy Gleason scores (8/9 and 7, respectively) from those with low score ([less-than or equal to]6), thus reflecting disease aggressiveness. This approach that enables detection of prostasomes in peripheral blood may be useful for early diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in organ-confined prostate cancer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aacinar cells 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3ablood plasma 3ablood sampling 3aearly diagnosis 3amen 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprostatic neoplasms1 aRonquist, Gunnar1 aDarmanis, Spyros1 aYan, Junhong1 aCarlsson, Lena1 aWu, Di1 aConze, Tim1 aEk, Pia1 aSemjonow, Axel1 aEltze, Elke1 aLarsson, Anders1 aLandegren, Ulf D.1 aKamali-Moghaddam, Masood0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8809-8814dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10193301083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle02930naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001700179245009700196300001600293520160300309650002701912650002701939650002201966650004301988650001302031650003002044650002702074650002302101650003002124650001502154651002102169700001502190700001802205700001802223773009002241852000902331856008502340930003302425945002502458946001302483655001202496IND4408894020221116162655.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440889402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2007.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aInglis, G.D.10aGenetic diversity of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae in southwestern British Columbia  ap. 101-113.  aThe abundance and genetic diversity of the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae, in southwestern British Columbia (BC) and southern Alberta was examined. The fungus was found to be widespread in soil throughout southwestern BC, and was recovered from 56% of 85 sample sites. In contrast to southwestern BC, no M. anisopliae isolates were recovered in southern Alberta. An automated fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine genetic diversity. In excess of 200 isolates were characterized. The method identified 211 polymorphic amplicons, ranging in size from approximately equal to 92 to 400 base pairs, and it was found to be reproducible with a resolution limit of 86.2% similarity. The AFLP method distinguished Metarhizium from other entomopathogenic fungal genera, and demonstrated considerable genetic diversity (25 genotypes) among the reference strains of M. anisopliae isolates examined (i.e. recovered from various substrates and geographical locations). Although 13 genotypes of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae were recovered from southwestern BC soils, the vast majority of isolates (91%) belonged to one of two closely-related genotypes. Furthermore, these two genotypes predominated in urban, agricultural and forest soils. The reasons for the limited diversity of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae in southwestern BC are uncertain. However, findings of this study are consistent with island biogeography theory, and have significant implications for the development of this fungus for microbial control of pest insects. 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agenetic variation 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenotype 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3astrain differences 3abiological control agents 3aElateridae 3aBritish Columbia1 aDuke, G.M.1 aGoettel, M.S.1 aKabaluk, J.T.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 May, v. 98, no. 1 p.101-113x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2007.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081103b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02706naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245015300212300001800365506007600383520099800459506003701457650001301494650001301507650001801520650002101538650002201559650004101581650001401622650001101636650002001647650001301667650002801680650001301708700001801721700002301739700002301762700001801785700001801803700001801821700001701839700002101856773017301877852000902050856008302059939003302142946001302175655001202188IND4458353820221207050208.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10100421082doi7 aPMC31024022pmcid7 a215555632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwanson, Phillip A.

Epithelial restitution requires active cell migration, a process dependent on dynamic turnover of focal cell-matrix adhesions (FAs). Here, we demonstrate that natural, commensal bacteria stimulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intestinal epithelia. Bacteria-mediated ROS generation induces oxidation of target cysteines in the redox-sensitive tyrosine phosphatases, LMW-PTP and SHP-2, which in turn results in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key protein regulating the turnover of FAs. Accordingly, phosphorylation of FAK substrate proteins, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration are all significantly enhanced by bacterial contact in both in vitro and in vivo models of wound closure. These results suggest that commensal bacteria regulate cell migration via induced generation of ROS in epithelial cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3acell movement 3aepithelial cells 3aintestinal mucosa 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3atyrosine1 aKumar, Amrita1 aSamarin, Stanislav1 aVijay-Kumar, Matam1 aKundu, Kousik1 aMurthy, Niren1 aHansen, Jason1 aNusrat, Asma1 aNeish, Andrew S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8803-8808dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10100421083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle03069naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012200123300001800245520199200263650002102255650002202276650001602298650002002314650001602334650001902350650001802369653001602387653001202403653003202415653003202447700001802479700001802497773011202515852000902627930003302636945001302669946001302682655001202695IND2038522620221116162701.0940405e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203852262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeim, I.10aCurrent nitrogen fixation is involved in the regulation of nitrogenase activity in white clover (Trifolium repens L.)  ap. 1009-1014.  aPrevious studies have shown that nitrogenase activity decreases dramatically after defoliation, presumably because of an increase in the O2 diffusion resistance in the infected nodules. It is not known how this O2 diffusion resistance is regulated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that current N2 fixation (ongoing flux of N2 through nitrogenase) is involved in the regulation of nitrogenase activity in white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv Ladino) nodules. We compared the nitrogenase activity of plants that were prevented from fixing N2 (by continuous exposure of their nodulated root system to an Ar:O2 [80:20] atmosphere) with that of plants allowed to fix N2 (those exposed to N2:O2 80:20). Nitrogenase activity was determined as the amount of H2 evolved under Ar:O2. An open flow system was used. in experiment 1, 6 h after complete defoliation and the continuous prevention of fixation, nitrogenase activity was higher by a factor of 2 compared with that in plants allowed to fix N2 after leaf removal. This higher nitrogenase activity was associated with a lower O2 limitation (measured as the partial pressure of O2 required for highest nitrogenase activity). In experiment II, the nitrogenase activity of plants prevented from fixing N2 for 2 h before leaf removal showed no response to defoliation. The extent to which nitrogenase activity responded to defoliation was different in plants allowed to fix and those that were prevented from doing so in both experiments. This leads to the conclusion that current N2 fixation is directly involved in the regulation of nitrogenase activity. It is suggested that an N feedback mechanism triggers such a response as a result of the loss of the plant's N sink strength after defoliation. This concept offers an alternative to other hypotheses (e.g. interruption of current photosynthesis, carbohydrate deprivation) that have been proposed to explain the immediate decrease in nitrogenase activity after defoliation. 3aTrifolium repens 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3adefoliation 3aphotosynthesis 3acarbohydrates 0adeprivation 0anodules 0aphotosynthesis interruption 0anitrogen sink strength loss1 aHartwig, U.A.1 aNosberger, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.1009-1014aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011000206300001800316506007600334520145900410506003701869650001401906650001101920650000901931650001201940650001101952650001201963650002301975700002001998700002202018700002102040700001802061700002302079773017302102852000902275856008302284939003302367946001302400655001202413IND4458354720221207071257.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10185191082doi7 aPMC31024182pmcid7 a215555552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeredith, M.

Compensatory effects, however, occur in selected cortical regions and it is not known whether such compensatory phenomena have any relation to the original function of the reorganized area. In the cortex of hearing cats, the auditory field of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (FAES) is largely responsive to acoustic stimulation and its unilateral deactivation results in profound contralateral acoustic orienting deficits. Given these functional and behavioral roles, the FAES was studied in early-deafened cats to examine its crossmodal sensory properties as well as to assess the behavioral role of that reorganization. Recordings in the FAES of early-deafened adults revealed robust responses to visual stimulation as well as receptive fields that collectively represented the contralateral visual field. A second group of early-deafened cats was trained to localize visual targets in a perimetry array. In these animals, cooling loops were surgically placed on the FAES to reversibly deactivate the region, which resulted in substantial contralateral visual orienting deficits. These results demonstrate that crossmodal plasticity can substitute one sensory modality for another while maintaining the functional repertoire of the reorganized region.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacoustics 3aadults 3acats 3acooling 3acortex 3ahearing 3asensory properties1 aKryklywy, James1 aMcMillan, Amee J.1 aMalhotra, Shveta1 aLum-Tai, Ryan1 aLomber, Stephen G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8856-8861dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10185191083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle02013naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015700128300001600285520092400301650002201225650001101247650002201258650002201280650001801302650001401320650002001334650002201354650002001376653001601396653001301412700002001425700001601445773011001461852000901571930003301580945001301613946001301626655001201639IND2045201320221116162608.0950322e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204520132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, J.K.10aBiphasic stimulation of translational activity correlates with induction of translation elongation factor 1 subunit alpha upon wounding in potato tubers  ap. 897-903.  aPotato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers exhibit an increase in translational activity in response to mechanical wounding. The response is biphasic, with an initial stimulation apparent within the first 2 h after wounding and a second increase occurring 12 to 24 h after wounding. Increased activity is apparent by measurement of protein synthesis both in vivo and in vitro using a cell-free extract. Accumulation of the translational elongation factor 1 subunit a (EF-1 alpha) parallels translational activity. Changes in the steady-state level of EF-1 alpha mRNA and expression of a chimeric EF-1 alpha promoter/beta-glucuronidase construct in transgenic potato tubers indicate that the gene encoding EF-1 alpha is transcribed during both periods of translational stimulation. These results indicate that stimulation of translational activity is coordinated with increased expression and accumulation of translation factors. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3amechanical damage 3aprotein synthesis 3amessenger RNA 3achimerism 3agene expression 3atransgenic plants 3astress response 0atranslation 0ainjuries1 aShewmaker, C.K.1 aVayda, M.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.897-903aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02046naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001700159245012400176300001600300500002400316520102500340650002501365650002701390653002401417653002501441773009601466852000901562856009001571930003301661945002501694946001301719655001201732IND4414575120221116162723.0090105e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441457512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aJadhav, G.S.10aPerformance of microbial fuel cell subjected to variation in pH, temperature, external load and substrate concentration  ap. 717-723.  aIncludes references  aDuring field application, the microbial fuel cell (MFC) will be exposed to variations in operating parameters. Hence, the performance of MFC, exposed to variation in temperature, pH, external resistance and influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), was investigated in the terms of coulombic efficiency (CE) and COD removal efficiency, while treating a synthetic wastewater. The performance was analyzed under two temperature ranges such as 20-35°C and 8-22°C. Operation under higher temperature range favored higher COD removal efficiency of 90% and lower current (0.7mA) and CE (1.5%). At lower temperature range, although the COD removal efficiency of MFC decreased (59%), it gave higher current (1.4mA) and CE (5%). The highest current was generated at pH of 6.5 in the anodic chamber with CE of 4%. Higher pH difference between anodic and cathodic electrolyte favored higher current and voltage. Within the range of COD tested (100-600mg/l), linear correlation was observed between the current and substrate removed. 3awastewater treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 0amicrobial fuel cell 0acoulombic efficiency0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.717-723dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle03313naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001100181245007700192300001400269520154600283650002101829650002001850650001901870650001201889650001601901650002701917650001301944650003101957650001401988650002302002650002702025650001802052650002102070650001202091650005802103650002702161650002102188650003902209650002502248650004602273650004002319650005102359650001202410700001202422700001202434700001102446700001302457773008802470852000902558856008502567930003302652945002502685946001302710655001202723IND4408892920221116162629.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440889292DNAL7 a181581582pmid7 a10.1016/j.jip.2007.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both P. ternata agglutinin (PTA) protein and L. radiata agglutinin (LRA) protein formed polymers and coagulated both rabbit red blood cells and yeast cells. The two proteins were each diluted to different concentration and then mixed with pinewood nematodes, and nematode survival was measured. Results showed that the two lectin proteins showed significant levels of resistance against nematodes and the nematode population was significantly reduced, compared to PBS buffer without protein control group. The mean number of nematodes of two lectin proteins group was significantly lower than that of control group constantly throughout the assay period with differences being very significant at P < 0.01 after 24 h. After 96 h, when 500 μg/ml proteins were used, nematode number significantly declined to an average of 26 (approximately 43% of the controls) and 32.2 (approximately 53.3% of the controls) nematodes at LRA and PTA protein, respectively, compared to the control group. Results also indicated that higher concentrations of protein were more toxic to the pinewood nematode. Even when the concentration was as low as 30 μg/ml, the toxic proteins retained their anti-nematode activity. Furthermore, pinewood nematode was exposed to the proteins for longer, more pinewood nematodes were killed. Our results indicated the two lectin proteins both apparently have a toxic effect on the pinewood nematode that affects its survival in vitro. 3aPinellia ternata 3aLycoris radiata 3aplant proteins 3alectins 3aagglutinins 3anematicidal properties 3atoxicity 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3amortality 3apopulation density 3achemical concentration 3adose response 3anematode control 2aAnimals 2aAntinematodal Agentsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aHemagglutination Tests 2aImmunity, Innate 2aLycorisxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aNematode Infectionsxprevention & control 2aPinelliaxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPlant Lectinsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aRabbits1 aMao, S.1 aZhu, F.1 aYu, Z.1 aZhao, X.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 May, v. 98, no. 1 p.40-45x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2007.11.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081103b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02953naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245006000206300001600266500002400282520145200306650001801758650002901776650002301805650000901828650002201837650001601859650001501875650001601890650002001906650002701926650004701953650003802000650002402038653003402062653004102096700001402137700001302151700001702164773009602181852000902277856009002286930003302376945002502409946001302434655001202447IND4414575320221116162605.0090105e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441457532DNAL7 a186923922pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aR1001 aNoureddini, H.10aDistribution of phosphorus compounds in corn processing  ap. 731-736.  aIncludes references  aDistillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and corn gluten feed (CGF) are major coproducts of ethanol production from corn dry grind and wet milling facilities, respectively. These coproducts contain important nutrients, nevertheless, high levels of phosphorus (P). About 50-80% of the P in these products is in an organically bound form known as phytate. The phytate P in these products cannot be digested by nonruminant animals. Consequently, large quantities of phytate are deposited into the soil with the animal wastes which potentially could cause P pollution in soil and underground water resources. As regulations on the concentration of P material in ethanol production coproducts become more restrictive, measures need to be taken for effective extraction of phytate P from the coproducts to make these processes more environmentally compatible. Proper marketing of coproducts is critical to the overall economy of ethanol production facilities. In this study, distribution of P compounds in different streams of dry grind and wet milling operations was determined. In the dry grind process, the highest P concentration was found to be in the condensed distillers solubles (CDS) at about 1.34 wt.% (db). About 59% of P in this stream was in phosphates form. The highest concentration of P in the wet milling process was found in the light steep water at about 3.4 wt.% (db). In this stream, about 22% of P was attributed to phosphates. 3awater content 3arenewable energy sources 3aethanol production 3acorn 3adistillers grains 3acorn gluten 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3afeed processing 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aPhosphorus Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPhytic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aZea maysxchemistry 0acondensed distillers solubles 0adistillers dried grain with solubles1 aMalik, M.1 aByun, J.1 aAnkeny, A.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.731-736dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.05.0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle02260naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001900179245009700198300001400295520099500309650001401304650001001318650001401328650001601342650001401358650002301372650002201395650002301417650001201440650002201452653001701474653002601491700001601517700001301533700001501546773008801561852000901649856008501658930003301743945002501776946001301801655001201814IND4408893120221116162559.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440889312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2007.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Rex.10aResistance of the Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum) to infection with Mikrocytos mackini  ap. 54-57.  aManila clams (Venerupis philippinarum) challenged in laboratory trials via bath exposure proved to be resistant to infections with Mikrocytos mackini (protistan parasite of unknown taxonomic affiliation), while Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) challenged simultaneously using identical conditions developed infections. Although M. mackini was detected by a nucleic acid pathogen specific (PCR) assay in 10-30% of the challenged V. philippinarum that were sampled soon after exposure (0-48 h, n = 40), all of the subsequent V. philippinarum (n = 62) sampled 9-17 weeks post-exposure tested negative for M. mackini by PCR assay. Prevalence of infection for the exposed C. gigas (n = 100) during this same period ranged from 50% to 100% by PCR assay. Infection was confirmed in the oysters (58%, n = 60) by a digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe designed to detect M. mackini by in situ hybridization, but M. mackini was not found in any of the exposed Manila clams (n = 63) using this technique. 3aVenerupis 3aclams 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3ainfection 3adisease prevalence 3adisease detection 3adisease resistance 3aoysters 3aCrassostrea gigas 0amikrocytosis 0aDenman Island disease1 aBower, S.M.1 aLowe, G.1 aDavies, S.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 May, v. 98, no. 1 p.54-57x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2007.10.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081103b20081206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009000206300001800296506007600314520110100390506003701491650001201528650001601540650001101556650001901567650000901586650001101595650001201606700002301618700002101641700002201662773017301684852000901857856008301866939003301949946001301982655001201995IND4458355020221207071256.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835502DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11015671082doi7 aPMC31023622pmcid7 a215555812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYassa, Michael A.10aAge-related memory deficits linked to circuit-specific disruptions in the hippocampus  ap. 8873-8878.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConverging data from rodents and humans have demonstrated an age-related decline in pattern separation abilities (the ability to discriminate among similar experiences). Several studies have proposed the dentate and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus as the potential locus of this change. Specifically, these studies identified rigidity in place cell remapping in similar environments in the CA3. We used high-resolution fMRI to examine activity profiles in the dentate gyrus and CA3 in young and older adults as stimulus similarity was incrementally varied. We report evidence for "representational rigidity" in older adults' dentate/CA3 that is linked to behavioral discrimination deficits. Using ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging, we quantified both the integrity of the perforant path as well as dentate/CA3 dendritic changes and found that both were correlated with dentate/CA3 functional rigidity. These results highlight structural and functional alterations in the hippocampal network that predict age-related changes in memory function and present potential targets for intervention.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelderly 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aloci 3amemory 3arodents1 aMattfeld, Aaron T.1 aStark, Shauna M.1 aStark, Craig E.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8873-8878dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11015671083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle04022naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245011200203300001800315506007600333520176900409506003702178650000802215650001202223650002102235650001302256650001602269650001502285650001302300650001702313650001902330650001502349650001302364650001602377650001602393650001402409650003002423650001902453650002002472650002402492650002602516650001802542650001202560651001402572700002102586700001902607700002202626700001702648700002302665700002002688700002002708700002202728700002102750700002402771700002302795700001802818700002402836700001902860700002602879700002402905700001802929773019102947852000903138856008303147939003303230946001303263655001203276IND4458354020221207071242.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835402DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11011371082doi7 aPMC31023462pmcid7 a215555882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Adam C.10aGenomic insights into the physiology and ecology of the marine filamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula  ap. 8815-8820.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFilamentous cyanobacteria of the genus Lyngbya are important contributors to coral reef ecosystems, occasionally forming dominant cover and impacting the health of many other co-occurring organisms. Moreover, they are extraordinarily rich sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, with 35% of all reported cyanobacterial natural products deriving from this single pantropical genus. However, the true natural product potential and life strategies of Lyngbya strains are poorly understood because of phylogenetic ambiguity, lack of genomic information, and their close associations with heterotrophic bacteria and other cyanobacteria. To gauge the natural product potential of Lyngbya and gain insights into potential microbial interactions, we sequenced the genome of Lyngbya majuscula 3L, a Caribbean strain that produces the tubulin polymerization inhibitor curacin A and the molluscicide barbamide, using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing approaches. Whereas ~293,000 nucleotides of the draft genome are putatively dedicated to secondary metabolism, this is far too few to encode a large suite of Lyngbya metabolites, suggesting Lyngbya metabolites are strain specific and may be useful in species delineation. Our analysis revealed a complex gene regulatory network, including a large number of sigma factors and other regulatory proteins, indicating an enhanced ability for environmental adaptation or microbial associations. Although Lyngbya species are reported to fix nitrogen, nitrogenase genes were not found in the genome or by PCR of genomic DNA. Subsequent growth experiments confirmed that L. majuscula 3L is unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen. These unanticipated life history characteristics challenge current views of the genus LYNGBYA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aLyngbya 3aMoorea producens 3abacteria 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3agenomics 3alife history 3amarine science 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogenase 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymerization 3aregulator genes 3aregulatory proteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asigma factors 3atubulin 3aCaribbean1 aMonroe, Emily A.1 aPodell, Sheila1 aHess, Wolfgang R.1 aKlages, Sven1 aEsquenazi, Eduardo1 aNiessen, Sherry1 aHoover, Heather1 aRothmann, Michael1 aLasken, Roger S.1 aYates, John R.

Freshwater is a critical resource to people, and although water resource indicators have been developed that operate from regional to global scales and for midlatitude to equatorial environments, no appropriate index exists for assessing the vulnerability of Arctic communities to changing water resources at the local scale. The Arctic Water Resource Vulnerability Index (AWRVI) is proposed as a tool that Arctic communities can use to assess their relative vulnerability-resilience to changes in their water resources from a variety of biophysical and socioeconomic processes. The AWRVI is based on a social-ecological systems perspective that includes physical and social indicators of change and is demonstrated in three case study communities/watersheds in Alaska. These results highlight the value of communities engaging in the process of using the AWRVI and the diagnostic capability of examining the suite of constituent physical and social scores rather than the total AWRVI score alone. 3acase studies 3afreshwater 3alatitude 3apeople 3auncertainty 3awater resources 3awatersheds 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHumans 2aRain 2aRisk Assessment 2aWater Supplyxanalysisxstandards. 3aAlaska 3aArctic region 0aAlaska 0aArctic regions. 0aIndex 0aResilience 0aVulnerability1 aKliskey, Andrew 1 aLammers, Richard 1 aArp, Chris 1 aWhite, Dan 1 aHinzman, Larry 1 aBusey, Robert 0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.523-541dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9152-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02419naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002100159245010900180300001600289500002400305520121100329650002101540650002701561650002501588650002201613650002701635650001901662700002301681700002101704700002401725700001801749773009601767852000901863856009001872930003301962945002501995946001302020655001202033IND4414573620221116162651.0090105e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441457362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aKhelifi, Eltaief10aBacterial monitoring by molecular tools of a continuous stirred tank reactor treating textile wastewater  ap. 629-633.  aIncludes references  aThis study was performed to examine the effect of the bacterial diversity changes on the performances of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) treating textile wastewater. The molecular fingerprint established using polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) methods showed that bacterial community profiles changed simultaneously with the increase of the wastewater loading rates (WLR). For the two WLR of 0.28gl⁻¹ d⁻¹ and 0.37gl⁻¹ d⁻¹, the reactor maintained good performances, suggesting that the large bacterial community present a high specific activity. The increase of the WLR from 0.37 to 1.12gl⁻¹ d⁻¹ decreased the colour and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies from 90% to 55% and from 85% to 30%, respectively, explained by the decrease of the bacterial diversity and activity. The changes of the bacterial dominance had no affect on the reactor performances. However, the decrease of the bacterial diversity significantly affected the colour and the COD removal efficiencies. It should conclude that indigo dye-containing textile wastewater treatment required the concerted activity of multiple bacterial populations. 3atextile industry 3atextile mill effluents 3awastewater treatment 3aspecies diversity 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization1 aBouallagui, Hassib1 aTouhami, Youssef1 aGodon, Jean-Jacques1 aHamdi, Moktar0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.629-633dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle03055naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245016300127300001600290500001500306520185600321650001302177650001502190650001202205650002602217650002302243653001402266653002402280653004802304653004602352653001002398700001902408700001902427700001502446700001802461773011002479852000902589930003302598945001302631946001302644655001202657IND2038515720221116162711.0940405e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203851572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDotray, P.A.10aEffects of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitors on root cell transmembrane electric potentials in graminicide-tolerant and -susceptible corn (Zea mays L.)  ap. 919-924.  a2019-12-05  aHerbicidal activity of aryloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione herbicides (graminicides) has been proposed to involve two mechanisms: inhibition of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) and depolarization of cell membrane potential. We examined the effect of aryloxyphenoxypropionates (diclofop and haloxyfop) and cyclohexanediones (sethoxydim and clethodim) on root cortical cell membrane potential of graminicide-susceptible and -tolerant corn (Zea mays L.) lines. The graminicide-tolerant corn line contained a herbicide-insensitive form of ACCase. The effect of the herbicides on membrane potential was similar in both corn lines. At a concentration of 50 micromolar, the cyclohexanediones had little or no effect on the membrane potential of root cells. At pH 6, 50 micromolar diclofop, but not haloxyfop, depolarized membrane potential, whereas both herbicides (50 micromolar) dramatically depolarized membrane potential at pH 5. Repolarization of membrane potential after removal of haloxyfop and diclofop from the treatment solution was incomplete at pH 5. However, at pH 6 nearly complete repolarization of membrane potential occurred after removal of diclofop. In graminicide-susceptible corn, root growth was significantly inhibited by a 24-h exposure to 1 micromolar haloxyfop or sethoxydim, but cell membrane potential was unaffected. In gramincide-tolerant corn, sethoxydim treatment (1 micromolar, 48 h) had no effect on root growth, whereas haloxyfop (1 micromolar, 48 h) inhibited root growth by 78%. However, membrane potential was the same in roots treated with 1 micromolar haloxyfop or sethoxydim. The results of this study indicate that graminicide tolerance in the corn line used in this investigation is not related to an altered response at the cell membrane level as has been demonstrated with other resistant species. 3aZea mays 3aherbicides 3asoil pH 3abiological resistance 3amembrane potential 0atolerance 0aherbicidal activity 0ainhibition of acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase 0adepolarization of cell membrane potential 0alines1 aDiTomaso, J.M.1 aGronwald, J.W.1 aWyse, D.L.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.919-924aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02328naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010700128300001600235500001500251520120700266650001801473650001301491650001601504650002501520650003401545650002701579650001401606653001301620653003201633653001801665653002301683700001601706700001501722700001501737773011001752852000901862930003301871945001301904946001301917655001201930IND2045200120221116162654.0950322e199411  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204520012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLietzke, S.E.14aThe three-dimensional structure of pectate lyase E, a plant virulence factor from Erwinia chrysanthemi  ap. 849-862.  a2019-12-05  aThe three-dimensional structure of pectate lyase E (PeIE) has been determined by crystallographic techniques at a resolution of 2.2 angstrom. The model includes all 355 amino acids but no solvent, and refines to a crystallographic refinement factor of 20.6%. The polypeptide backbone folds into a large right-handed cylinder, termed a parallel beta helix. Loops of various sizes and conformations protrude from the central helix and probably confer function. A putative Ca2+-binding site as well as two cationic sites have been deduced from the location of heavy atom derivatives. Comparison of the PelE and recently determined pectate lyase C (PelC) structures has led to identification of a putative polygalacturonate-binding region in PelE. Structural differences relevant to differences in the enzymatic mechanism and maceration properties of PelE and PelC have been identified. The comparative analysis also reveals a large degree of structural conservation of surface loops in one region as well as an apparent aromatic specificity pocket in the amino-terminal branch. Also discussed is the sequence and possible functional relationship of the pectate lyases with pollen and style plant proteins. 3apectate lyase 3acrystals 3aamino acids 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3amolecular conformation 3avirulence 0ageometry 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi 0apathogenicity 0achemical structure1 aYoder, M.D.1 aKeen, N.T.1 aJurnak, F.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.849-862aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245013600188300001600324520086900340650002401209650001701233650001601250650002501266650001501291650002301306650002301329650001201352650002201364650002001386650002101406650001701427650004701444650001401491650005601505650001701561650002201578650004401600651001501644651001101659651002301670651001801693653003501711653002801746653002601774700002301800773011001823852000901933856008501942930003302027946001302060655001202073IND4409112620221116162801.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440911262DNAL7 a185216602pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-008-9116-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoseley, Cassandra 10aForest Restoration and Forest Communities: Have Local Communities Benefited from Forest Service Contracting of Ecosystem Management  ap. 327-343.  aConservation-based development programs have sought to create economic opportunities for people negatively impacted by biological diversity protection. The USDA Forest Service, for example, developed policies and programs to create contracting opportunities for local communities to restore public lands to replace jobs lost from reduced timber harvest. This article examines 12 years of Forest Service land management contracting in western Oregon, Washington, and northern California to evaluate if contractors located in communities near national forests have been awarded more land management contracts and contract value over time. We find that land management contracting spending has declined dramatically and, once we control for intervening factors, we find that local contractors have received a smaller proportion of land management contracts over time. 3aUSDA Forest Service 3abiodiversity 3acontractors 3aecosystem management 3aemployment 3aforest communities 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3anational forests 3apublic lands 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aForestryxeconomicsxorganization & administration. 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 2aUnited States Department of Agriculture 3aCalifornia 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aUnited States 0aConservation-based development 0aProcurement contracting 0aNorthwest Forest Plan1 aReyes, Yolanda E. 0 tEnvironmental management.g2008 Aug., v. 42, no. 2 p.327-343dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9116-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02136naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245013800158300001800296500002800314520109600342650001301438650001301451650001401464650001701478650002801495653001801523653000801541700001601549773014001565852000901705856008501714946001101799655001201810IND4409957120221116162446.0080905s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440995712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-008-8329-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, T.10aSelenocystine induces apoptosis of A375 human melanoma cells by activating ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and p53 phosphorylation  ap. 2763-2775.  aPublisher supplied data  aSelenocystine (SeC), a naturally occurring selenoamino acid, has been shown to be a novel compound with broad-spectrum anticancer activity. In this study, we showed that SeC triggered time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in A375 human melanoma cells by activating the mitochondria-mediated and death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathways. Pretreatment of cells with a general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly prevented SeC-induced apoptosis. A375 cells exposed to SeC showed an increase in levels of total p53 and phosphorylated p53 (serine-15). Silencing of p53 expression with RNA interference significantly suppressed SeC-induced p53 phosphorylation, caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent induction of DNA strand breaks were found to be upstream mediators of p53 activation induced by SeC. In a nude mice xenograft experiment, SeC significantly inhibited the tumor growth of A375 cells via induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest the potential applications of SeC in cancer chemoprevention. 3aselenium 3amelanoma 3aapoptosis 3amitochondria 3areactive oxygen species 0aselenocystine 0ap531 aWong, Y.

Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) prepared from midguts of both the Cry1Ac-resistant GYBT strain (homozygous for a deletion knockout of Ha_BtR) and the susceptible GY strain (homozygous for the wild type of Ha_BtR) possessed saturable and specific binding ability to 125I-Cry1Ac. The binding constant (Kd) of the GY strain was significantly lower than that of the resistant GYBT strain, whereas their binding site concentrations (Bmax) were similar. When midgut BBMVs were reacted directly with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the GY strain had very clear 120- and 85-kDa protein bands, which indicated that the 120- and 85-kDa bands are endogenous biotin-containing proteins. However, the GYBT strain almost completely lost these two biotin-containing proteins. Ligand blotting with biotinylated Cry1Ac toxin showed midgut BBMVs of the GY strain contain five protein bands of 210-, 190-, 150-, 120-, and 85-kDa, respectively, while BBMVs of the GYBT strain contain only two protein bands of 150- and 120-kDa. 120-kDa bands may consist of two proteins with coincidentally the same molecular weight (putatively, an APN and a biotin-containing protein). Our results showed that the binding pattern of Cry1Ac to midgut BBMVs of H. armigera was altered quantitatively and qualitatively by knockout of Ha_BtR. There are multiple Cry1Ac-binding proteins in the midgut of susceptible H. armigera, but only the Ha_BtR can be considered as a putative functional receptor of Cry1Ac. Possible involvement of other receptor proteins in the intoxication process in vivo could not be excluded. 3agenetic resistance 3acadherins 3amidgut 3adelta-endotoxins 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3abinding proteins 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3acrystal proteins 3areceptors 3agene deletion 3abinding capacity 0aBt resistance 0abiological resistance 0atoxin receptors 0acadherin mutations 0atoxin binding1 aWu, Y.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.27-32x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2007.04.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/18  aOther US 7aarticle02282naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245021900210300001600429520112200445650001501567650001501582650002201597700003301619700001901652700002801671773011901699852000901818856008501827930003301912946001101945655001201956IND4409384720221116162504.0080822e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440938472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10858-008-9255-12doi7 aPMC25750512pmcid7 a186682062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuszewski, John J. 10aAutomated error-tolerant macromolecular structure determination from multidimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra and chemical shift assignments: improved robustness and performance of the PASD algorithm  ap. 221-239.  aWe report substantial improvements to the previously introduced automated NOE assignment and structure determination protocol known as PASD (Kuszewski et al. (2004) J Am Chem Soc 26:6258-6273). The improved protocol includes extensive analysis of input spectral data to create a low-resolution contact map of residues expected to be close in space. This map is used to obtain reasonable initial guesses of NOE assignment likelihoods which are refined during subsequent structure calculations. Information in the contact map about which residues are predicted to not be close in space is applied via conservative repulsive distance restraints which are used in early phases of the structure calculations. In comparison with the previous protocol, the new protocol requires significantly less computation time. We show results of running the new PASD protocol on six proteins and demonstrate that useful assignment and structural information is extracted on proteins of more than 220 residues. We show that useful assignment information can be obtained even in the case in which a unique structure cannot be determined. 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3aspectral analysis1 aThottungal, Robin Augustine 1 aClore, Marius.1 aSchwieters, Charles D. 0 tJournal of biomolecular NMR.g2008 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.221-239dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0925-27387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-008-9255-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011400124300001600238520171700254650001801971650002001989650002502009650002002034650001502054653001302069700001402082700001502096773011002111852000902221930003302230945001302263946001302276655001202289IND2038519020221116162338.0940405e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203851902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, S.10aCasein kinase II-type protein kinase from pea cytoplasm and its inactivation by alkaline phosphatase in vitro  ap. 955-962.  aA casein kinase II-type protein kinase has been purified from the cytosolic fraction of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) plumules to about 90% purity as judged from Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This kinase has a tetrameric alpha-alpha'beta-2 structure with a native molecular mass of 150 kD, and subunit molecular masses of 41 and 40 kD for the two catalytic subunits (alpha and alpha') and 35 kD for the putative regulatory subunit (beta). Casein and phosvitin can be used as artificial substrates for this kinase. Both serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated when mixed casein, beta-casein, or phosvitin were used as the substrate, whereas only serine was phosphorylated if alpha-casein or histone III-S was the substrate. The kinase activity was stimulated 130% by 0.5 mM spermine (the concentration required for 50% of maximal enzyme activity [A50] = 0.1 mM) and 80% by 2.5 mM spermidine (A50 = 0.4 mM), whereas putrescine and cadaverine had no effect. The kinase was very sensitive to inhibition by heparin (concentration for 50% inhibition [I50] = 0.025 micrograms/ml). In contrast to most other casein kinase II-type protein kinases, this p reparation was inhibited by K+ and Na+, with I50 values of 75 and 65 mM, respectively. Pretreatment of the purified kina se preparation in vitro with alkaline phosphatase caused a 5-fold decrease in its activity. Additionally, this kinase al so lost its activity when its beta subunit was autophosphorylated in the absence of substrate. These results suggest tha t the activity of this casein kinase II protein kinase may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of two different si tes in its multimeric structure. 3aPisum sativum 3aphosphorylation 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aetiolation 0aplumules1 aJin, C.D.1 aRoux, S.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.955-962aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02448naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001600225520157400241650001301815650002801828650001601856650001301872650002001885653001401905700001901919700001801938773011001956852000902066930003302075945001302108946001302121655001202134IND2038519320221116162509.0940405e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203851932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, J.J.10aCharacterization of paraquat transport in protoplasts from maize (Zea mays L.) suspension cells  ap. 963-969.  aProtoplasts isolated from maize (Zea mays L.) suspension cells were used to study transport of paraquat. [14C] Paraquat uptake was measured in 400-microL centrifuge tubes using silicon oil centrifugation techniques. Approximately 50% of accumulation from a 100 micromolars paraquat solution occurred in the first 10 s, and net accumulation reached a maximum after about 10 min. Membrane binding accounted for about 30% of apparent accumulation. Concentration-dependent uptake kinetics were characterized by a nonsaturating curve, which was resolved into a linear and a saturable component. The Km of the saturable component was 132 micromolars, and the Vmax was 0.512 nmol microL of protoplasts-1 min-1. In the absence of sucrose, the Vmax of the saturable component was reduced by 52%, suggesting that paraquat uptake across the plasmalemma is energy dependent. Measurement of concentration-dependent binding of paraquat to burst protoplasts showed a linear response. This suggests that the linear component from intact protoplast concentration kinetics represented paraquat binding to the plasmalemma surface. Calcium inhibited the saturable component, and this inhibition was shown by Lineweaver-Burk analysis to be noncompetitive. Putrescine, a divalent cationic polyamine with a charge distribution similar to that of paraquat, competitively inhibited paraquat uptake. These results show that paraquat transport characteristics at the plasmalemma of maize protoplasts are similar to those reported earlier for paraquat transport in roots of intact maize seedlings. 3aZea mays 3acell suspension culture 3aprotoplasts 3aparaquat 3aplasma membrane 0atransport1 aDiTomaso, J.M.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.963-969aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle03122naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001600242500001500258520177500273650002502048650001902073650002202092650002602114650001702140650002602157650001002183650001502193650002002208650001602228650002002244650002802264650002802292653001302320653002702333653003802360700001502398700001502413700002802428700001802456773011002474852000902584930003302593945001302626946001302639655001202652IND2038457820221116162625.0940401e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203845782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrol, N.10aEffects of boron on proton transport and membrane properties of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cell microsomes  ap. 763-769.  a2019-12-05  aBoron deficiency and toxicity inhibit ATP-dependent H+ pumping and vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in sunflower roots and cell suspensions. The effects of boron on H+ pumping and on passive H+ conductance, as well as on fluorescence anisotropy in KI-washed microsomes isolated from sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv Enano) cell suspensions, have been investigated. Boron deficiency reduced the total and vanadate-sensitive ATPase activities as well as the vanadate-sensitive ATP-dependent H+ pumping without affecting the amount of antigenic ATPase protein as measured by immunoblotting with an Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane anti-H+-ATPase polyclonal antibody. Kinetic studies revealed that boron deficiency reduced Vmax of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity with little change in the apparent Km for Mg2+-ATP. Proton leakage was greater in microsomal vesicles isolated from cells grown without boron and incubated in reaction medium without added boron, and this effect was reversed by addition of boron to the reaction medium. Fluorescence anisotropy indicated that diphenyl hexatriene and 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene probes were immobilized to a greater extent in microsomes from cells grown without boron than in those from cells grown with 100 micromolar H3BO3. The apparent decrease of membrane fluidity in microsomes from cells grown without boron was reversed by the addition of boron to the reaction medium. Taken together these data suggest that inhibition of H+ gradient formation in microsomes from sunflower cells grown in the absence of boron could be due to the combined effects of reduced H+-ATPase activity and increased passive conductance across the membrane, possibly resulting from increased membrane rigidity. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aimmunoblotting 3aHelianthus annuus 3apolyclonal antibodies 3afluorescence 3anutrient deficiencies 3aboron 3amicrosomes 3aplasma membrane 3aproton pump 3aenzyme activity 3acell suspension culture 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 0aproteins 0afluoresence anisotropy 0apassive hydrogen ions conductance1 aBelver, A.1 aRoldan, M.1 aRodriguez-Rosales, M.P.1 aDonaire, J.P.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.763-769aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02897naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012100127300001600248500001500264520170300279650001401982650001801996650001302014650001802027650001402045650002202059650001302081650002302094650001502117650001302132650001402145653001402159653002302173653001002196653002402206653001002230700001502240700001802255773011002273852000902383930003302392945001302425946001302438655001202451IND2038454920221116162518.0940401e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203845492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelhaize, E.10aAluminum tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). II. Aluminum-stimulated excretion of malic acid from root apices  ap. 695-702.  a2019-12-05  aWe investigated the role of organic acids in conferring Al tolerance in near-isogenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines differing in Al tolerance at the Al tolerance locus (Alt1). Addition of Al to nutrient solutions stimulated excretion of malic and succinic acids from roots of wheat seedlings, and Al-tolerant genotypes excreted 5- to 10-fold more malic acid than Al-sensitive genotypes. Malic acid excretion was detectable after 15 min of exposure to 200 micromolar Al, and the amount excreted increased linearly over 24 h. The amount of malic acid excreted was dependent on the external Al concentration, and excretion was stimulated by as little as 10 micromolar Al. Malic acid added to nutrient solutions was able to protect Al-sensitive seedlings from normally phytotoxic Al concentrations. Root apices (terminal 3-5 mm of root) were the primary source of the malic acid excreted. Root apices of Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive seedlings contained similar amounts of malic acid before and after a 2-h exposure to 200 micromolar Al. During this treatment, Al-tolerant seedlings excreted about four times the total amount of malic acid initially present within root apices, indicating that continual synthesis of malic acid was occurring. Malic acid excretion was specifically stimulated by Al, and neither La, Fe, nor the absence of Pi was able to elicit this response. There was a consistent correlation of Al tolerance with high rates of malic acid excretion stimulated by Al in a population of seedlings segregating for Al tolerance. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Alt1 locus in wheat encodes an Al tolerance mechanism based on Al-stimulated excretion of malic acid. 3aroot tips 3asuccinic acid 3agenetics 3aphytotoxicity 3aseedlings 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaluminum 3anutrient solutions 3amalic acid 3agenotype 3aexcretion 0atolerance 0atolerant genotypes 0alines 0asensitive genotypes 0aroots1 aRyan, P.R.1 aRandall, P.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.695-702aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle03724naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012300165300001600288520173700304650004302041650001302084650001902097650002002116650001502136650001702151650001702168650002102185650003002206650000802236650001102244650001302255650002502268650000902293650001902302650001802321650001302339650001102352650002102363650002402384650001802408650004402426650003002470650002302500650003102523650001602554650003302570650002002603650001702623650002002640650002802660650003002688650003402718650003802752653001102790653001202801700001502813700002002828773011002848852000902958930003302967945001303000946001303013655001203026IND2038460620221116162642.0940401e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203846062DNAL7 a80229382pmid7 aPMC1590532pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastogi, R.10aCloning of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) arginine decarboxylase gene and its expression during fruit ripening  ap. 829-839.  aArginine decarboxylase (ADC) is the first enzyme in one of the two pathways of putrescine biosynthesis in plants. The genes encoding ADC have previously been cloned from oat and Escherichia coli. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to two conserved regions of ADC were used as primers in polymerase chain reaction amplification of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) genomic DNA, and a 1.05-kb fragment was obtained. This genomic DNA fragment encodes an open reading frame of 350 amino acids showing about 50% identity with the oat ADC protein. Using this fragment as a probe, we isolated several partial ADC cDNA clones from a tomato pericarp cDNA library. The 5' end of the coding region was subsequently obtained f rom a genomic clone containing the entire ADC gene. The tomato ADC gene contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 502 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of about 55 kD. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibits 47 and 38% identity with oat and E. coli ADCs, respectively. Gel blot hybridization experiments show that, in tomato, ADC is encoded by a single gene and is expressed as a transcript of approximately 2.2 kb in the fruit pericarp and leaf tissues. During fruit ripening the amount of ADC transcript appeared to peak at the breaker stage. No significant differences were seen when steady-state ADC mRNA levels were compared between normal versus long-keeping Alcobaca (alc) fruit, although alc fruit contain elevated putrescine levels and ADC activity at the ripe stage. The lack of correlation between ADC activity and steady-state mRNA levels in alc fruit suggests a translational and/ or posttranslational regulation of ADC gene expression during tomato fruit ripening. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aarginine 3acarboxy-lyases 3agene expression 3aputrescine 3abiosynthesis 3aAvena sativa 3aEscherichia coli 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3aclones 3apericarp 3aamino acid sequences 3agels 3aimmunoblotting 3ahybridization 3aripening 3agenome 3aoligonucleotides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEdible Grainxenzymology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Primers 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVegetablesxenzymologyxgenetics. 0afruits 0acloning1 aDulson, J.1 aRothstein, S.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.829-839aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013200169300001600301520117900317650002101496650001401517650002301531650003001554650001601584650001601600650001201616650002301628651001001651651001001661653003101671653002301702653001701725653001501742653001701757653002101774700002801795700002401823700002601847700002201873700002701895773010201922852000902024856008502033930003302118946001102151655001202162IND4409401420221116162551.0080822e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440940142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-007-9108-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBillah, Maxwell K. 10aCross mating studies among five fruit fly parasitoid populations: potential biological control implications for tephritid pests  ap. 709-724.  aThe reproductive compatibility between four different species/populations of the tephritid parasitoid Psyttalia (Walker) species from Kenya and individuals of the morphologically identical Psyttalia concolor (Szépligeti) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) from a laboratory culture in Italy used in augmentative biological control of olive fly, Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) (Diptera: Tephritidae) was assessed through cross mating tests using single-pair and group mating methods. Reciprocal crosses among the species resulted in the production of viable offsprings up to the second generation. In spite of the successful production of viable offspring in the laboratory, Psyttalia species are known to have specific host fruit and/or host fly preferences and populations/species may be isolated in one way or the other. However, it is not known whether these populations/species interbreed in the field. We discuss the ability of these parasitoids to interbreed and the potential effects of that on their use as biological control agents, especially in environments where other closely related species are present or in situations where multiple parasitoid introductions are intended. 3aBactrocera oleae 3aPsyttalia 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afruit flies 3aparasitoids 3aprogeny 3areciprocal crosses 3aItaly 3aKenya 0aReproductive compatibility 0aPsyttalia concolor 0aAugmentative 0aTephritids 0aCross mating 0aViable offspring1 aKimani-Njogu, Susan W. 1 aWharton, Robert A. 1 aOverholt, William A. 1 aWilson, David D. 1 aCobblah, Millicent A. 0 tBioControl.g2008 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.709-724dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-007-9108-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01152naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001800196500001500214520028500229650001300514650001300527650001300540650002300553650002200576650003600598650002700634653002300661700001400684773007500698852000900773939003300782946001100815655001200826IND9304734820221116162612.0930811e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930473482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBessalle, R.10aWithanolide C, a chlorinated withanolide from Withania somnifera  ap. 3648-3651.  a2019-12-04  aThe structure of a new chlorinated withanolide isolated from Withania somnifera chemotype III has been elucidated as 5 alpha-chloro,6 beta,14 alpha,17 beta,20 alpha(F)-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-22R-witha-2,24-dienolide by 1H and 13C NMR and chemical ionization mass spectroscopy methods. 3asteroids 3alactones 3aecotypes 3aWithania somnifera 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3amolecular conformation 0achemical structure1 aLavie, D.0 tPhytochemistry.g1992 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.3648-3651x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03986naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245013500162300001600297500001500313520196700328650001802295650002202313650000802335650002002343650001802363650001102381650001002392650002002402650002502422650002602447650001402473650003402487650001102521650005002532650001802582650002002600650002302620650004902643650002002692650004502712650001702757650001202774650002802786650004202814650004202856650003402898650003002932650004402962653001303006653001303019653003003032653001403062653001303076653002803089700001703117773011003134852000903244930003303253945001303286946001303299655001203312IND2038460220221116162511.0940401e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203846022DNAL7 a80229362pmid7 aPMC1590502pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, A.H.10aGene expression patterns associated with in vitro tracheary element formation in isolated single mesophyll cells of Zinnia elegans  ap. 805-813.  a2019-12-05  aTracheary element formation from isolated Zinnia leaf mesophyll cells is an excellent system for the dissection of patterned secondary cell wall thickening and lignification. We used mRNAs from cells cultured for 48 h in the induction medium to isolate differentially regulated genes. Thirteen unique cDNA clones were isolated using a subtractive hybridization method. These clones can be divided into three distinct groups according to their characteristic gene expression in different media. The first group includes those genes whose expression is induced in the basal medium without 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and benzyladenine; this indicates that the expression of these genes is regulated by chemical and physical factors other than these hormones. Three of these clones, p48h-229, p48h-114, and p48h-102 show significant homology to a pathogenesis-related protein II, a serine proteinase inhibitor, and a sunflower anther-specific proline-rich protein, respectively. The second group includes those genes whose expression is mainly NAA induced. One of these clones, p48h-10, shows high protein sequence homology to a barley aleurone-specific cDNA, B11E. The p48h-10-encoded protein shares some common characteristics of plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (low molecular weight, the secretion signal peptide, eight conserved cysteine residues, and a basic protein), although no significant protein sequence homology is found between p48h-10 and other plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins. The third group includes those genes whose expression is induced primarily in the induction medium; this indicates that the expression of these genes is closely associated with the process of tracheary element formation. Two of these clones, p48h-107 and p48h-17, show high homology to adenylate kinase and papaya proteinase I, respectively. The possible roles of these differentiation-specific genes during tracheary element formation are discussed. 3amessenger RNA 3achemical elements 3aDNA 3aZinnia violacea 3ahybridization 3aclones 3acells 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3amesophyll 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aleaves 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxisolation & purification 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Library 2aKinetin 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNaphthaleneacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 0aelements 0ain vitro 0asubtractive hybridization 0aformation 0apatterns 0alipid transfer proteins1 aVarner, J.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.805-813aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234520162700250650001301877650001101890650001301901650001101914650001901925650001701944650001901961650002701980650002202007650001402029650001402043653001702057653003002074653002402104700001702128773011002145852000902255930003302264945001302297946001302310655001202323IND2038460520221116162205.0940401e199311  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203846052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrall, J.P.10aConcurrent measurements of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange during lightflecks in maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 823-828.  aLeaves of maize (Zea mays L.) were enclosed in a temperature-controlled cuvette under 35 Pa (350 microbars) CO2 and 0.2 kPa (0.2%) O2 and exposed to short periods (1-30 s) of illumination (lightflecks). The rate and total amount of CO2 assimilated and O2 evolved were measured. The O2 evolution rate was taken as an indicator of the rate of photosynthetic noncyclic electron transport (NCET). In this C4 species, the response of electron transport during the lightflecks qualitatively mimicked that of C3 species previously tested, whereas the response of CO2 assimilation differed. Under short-duration lightflecks at high photon flux density (PFD), the mean rate of O2 evolution was greater than the steady-state rate of O2 evolution under the same PFD due to a burst of O2 evolution at the beginning of the lightfleck. This O2 burst was taken as indicating a high level of NCET involved in the buildup of assimilatory charge via ATP, NADPH, and reduced or phosphorylated metabolites. However, as lightfleck duration decreased, the amount of CO2 assimilated per unit time of the lightfleck (the mean rate of CO2 assimilation) decreased. There was also a burst of CO2 from the leaf at the beginning of low-PFD lightflecks that further reduced the assimilation during these lightflecks. The results are discussed in terms of the buildup of assimilatory charge through the synthesis of high-energy metabolites specific to C4 metabolism. It is speculated that the inefficiency of carbon uptake during brief light transients in the C4 species, relative to C3 species, is due to the futile synthesis of C4 cycle intermediates. 3aZea mays 3aleaves 3alighting 3aoxygen 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3aenvironmental exposure 3aelectron transfer 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 0aassimilation 0ashort period illumination 0aphoton flux density1 aPearcy, R.W.0 tPlant physiology.g1993 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.823-828aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02498naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245006300205300001800268506007600286520097400362506003701336650001501373650001401388650002401402650001001426650001801436650001601454650001201470650001401482650001601496650001401512650002601526700002001552700002401572700001701596700001901613700002201632700001801654700002101672773017301693852000901866856008301875939003301958946001301991655001202004IND4458142520221207064614.0110520e20110517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445814252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10166501082doi7 aPMC31009422pmcid7 a215368932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPannasch, Ulrike10aAstroglial networks scale synaptic activity and plasticity  ap. 8467-8472.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAstrocytes dynamically interact with neurons to regulate synaptic transmission. Although the gap junction proteins connexin 30 (Cx30) and connexin 43 (Cx43) mediate the extensive network organization of astrocytes, their role in synaptic physiology is unknown. Here we show, by inactivating Cx30 and Cx43 genes, that astroglial networks tone down hippocampal synaptic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Gap junctional networking facilitates extracellular glutamate and potassium removal during synaptic activity through modulation of astroglial clearance rate and extracellular space volume. This regulation limits neuronal excitability, release probability, and insertion of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, silencing synapses. By controlling synaptic strength, connexins play an important role in synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these results establish connexins as critical proteins for extracellular homeostasis, important for the formation of functional synapses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aastrocytes 3aconnexins 3aextracellular space 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3ahomeostasis 3aneurons 3apotassium 3aprobability 3areceptors 3asynaptic transmission1 aVargová, Lydia1 aReingruber, Jürgen1 aEzan, Pascal1 aHolcman, David1 aGiaume, Christian1 aSyková, Eva.1 aRouach, Nathalie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 17, v. 108, no. 20 p.8467-8472dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10166501083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110520  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001600159245013400175300001600309500002400325520080200349650002701151650001501178650002501193650003301218650002101251650002701272650001801299650001801317653002401335700001501359700001801374773009601392852000901488856009001497930003301587945002501620946001301645655001201658IND4414576720221116162325.0090105e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441457672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3501 aBajaj, I.B.12aA statistical approach to optimization of fermentative production of poly(γ-glutamic acid) from Bacillus licheniformis NCIM 2324  ap. 826-832.  aIncludes references  aThis paper reports on the optimization of poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) production by Bacillus licheniformis NCIM 2324 using a statistical approach.

Plackett-Burman design was adopted to select the most important nutrients influencing the yield of PGA. After identifying effective nutrients, response surface methodology was used to develop a mathematical model to identify the optimum concentrations of the key nutrients for higher PGA production, and confirm its validity experimentally.

The alkaline compost-extract contained a mixture of HSs and non-HSs, while acidification of the compost-extract resulted in precipitation of humic acid (HA). The acidified supernatant contained fulvic acid (FA) and non-HSs. In the present study, DAX-8 resin was used to separate FA and non-HSs. HI values, which were estimated to evaluate the maturity of wood waste compost, increased with composting duration. To determine the effects of compost maturity on HA structural features, correlations between HI and indicators of the degree of HA humification (atomic ratios, acidic functional group contents, spectroscopic parameters and molecular weight) were investigated. HI values were significantly related to the indicators of the extent of HA humification during composting. 3aacidification 3ahumification 3acompost maturity 3ahumic acids 3awood chips 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3afulvic acids 3amolecular weight 3abark 3acomposting 3achemical structure 2aComputer Simulation 2aHumic Substances 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aMaterials Testing 2aModels, Chemical 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTime Factors 2aWoodxchemistry 0awood residues1 aYamamoto, Kanako1 aOotsuka, Keishi1 aKomai, Takeshi1 aAramaki, Toshihiro1 aUeda, Shigeru1 aHoriya, Shigekazu0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.791-797dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/23  aOther US 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245014600205300001800351506007600369520128400445506003701729650002501766650001301791650001601804650001001820650001501830650001201845650001401857650002501871650002301896700002201919700001801941700002701959700002201986700002002008700001702028773017302045852000902218856008302227939003302310946001302343655001202356IND4458141320221207064616.0110520e20110517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445814132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10194961082doi7 aPMC31009312pmcid7 a215368962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Brian A.14aThe dominantly expressed class I molecule of the chicken MHC is explained by coevolution with the polymorphic peptide transporter (TAP) genes  ap. 8396-8401.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn most mammals, the MHC class I molecules are polymorphic and determine the specificity of peptide presentation, whereas the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) heterodimers are functionally monomorphic. In chickens, there are two classical class I genes but only one is expressed at a high level, which can result in strong MHC associations with resistance to particular infectious pathogens. However, the basis for having a single dominantly expressed class I molecule has been unclear. Here we report TAP1 and TAP2 sequences from 16 chicken lines, and show that both genes have high allelic polymorphism and moderate sequence diversity, with variation in positions expected for peptide binding. We analyze peptide translocation in two MHC haplotypes, showing that chicken TAPs specify translocation at three peptide positions, matching the peptide motif of the single dominantly expressed class I molecule. These results show that coevolution between class I and TAP genes can explain the presence of a single dominantly expressed class I molecule in common chicken MHC haplotypes. Moreover, such coevolution in the primordial MHC may have been responsible for the appearance of the antigen presentation pathways at the birth of the adaptive immune system.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigen presentation 3achickens 3acoevolution 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3amammals 3apathogens 3apeptide transporters 3asequence diversity1 aHunt, Lawrence G.1 aSowa, Anna K.1 aSkjødt, K.q(Karsten)1 aGöbel, Thomas W.1 aLehner, Paul J.1 aKaufman, Jim0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 17, v. 108, no. 20 p.8396-8401dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10194961083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110520  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245008800206300001800294506007600312520167200388506003702060650002202097650001402119650002502133650001902158650003302177650001402210650001202224650001502236650001202251650001502263650001702278700002902295700001902324700001802343700001502361700002302376700002302399700002202422700002202444773017302466852000902639856008302648939003302731946001302764655001202777IND4458141020221207063009.0110520e20110517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445814102DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11006281082doi7 aPMC31009692pmcid7 a215368812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArakaki, Mónica.10aContemporaneous and recent radiations of the world's major succulent plant lineages  ap. 8379-8384.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cacti are one of the most celebrated radiations of succulent plants. There has been much speculation about their age, but progress in dating cactus origins has been hindered by the lack of fossil data for cacti or their close relatives. Using a hybrid phylogenomic approach, we estimated that the cactus lineage diverged from its closest relatives [almost equal to]35 million years ago (Ma). However, major diversification events in cacti were more recent, with most species-rich clades originating in the late Miocene, [almost equal to]10-5 Ma. Diversification rates of several cactus lineages rival other estimates of extremely rapid speciation in plants. Major cactus radiations were contemporaneous with those of South African ice plants and North American agaves, revealing a simultaneous diversification of several of the world's major succulent plant lineages across multiple continents. This short geological time period also harbored the majority of origins of C₄ photosynthesis and the global rise of C₄ grasslands. A global expansion of arid environments during this time could have provided new ecological opportunity for both succulent and C₄ plant syndromes. Alternatively, recent work has identified a substantial decline in atmospheric CO₂ [almost equal to]15-8 Ma, which would have strongly favored C₄ evolution and expansion of C₄-dominated grasslands. Lowered atmospheric CO₂ would also substantially exacerbate plant water stress in marginally arid environments, providing preadapted succulent plants with a sharp advantage in a broader set of ecological conditions and promoting their rapid diversification across the landscape.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3acacti and succulents 3acarbon dioxide 3adry environmental conditions 3aevolution 3afossils 3agrasslands 3ahybrids 3alandscapes 3awater stress1 aChristin, Pascal-Antoine1 aNyffeler, Reto1 aLendel, Anita1 aEggli, Urs1 aOgburn, R.

Various methods, such as the total antioxidant capacity measured by phosphomolybdenum method, scavenging activities towards 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, superoxide anion radical, and hydroxyl radical, were established in in vitro systems. The amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids in the extracts and fractions were also determined by spectrophotometric methods. The results showed that all the extracts and fractions exhibited antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities at different magnitudes of potency. The decreasing order of antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities among the extracts assayed through all the four methods were found to be ethyl acetate fraction> n-BuOH fraction>methanol extract>water extract. This similar order of the amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids shows that the extent of antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities is in accordance with the amounts of phenolics and flavonoids present in extracts and fractions. The extracts of L. foenum-graecum Hance might be valuable antioxidant natural sources and seemed to be applicable in both healthy medicine and food industry. 3aLysimachia 3aantioxidant activity 3aphenolic compounds 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3asuperoxide anion 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxchemistry 2aMalpighiaceaexmetabolism 0aLysimachia foerum-graecum1 aWang, Xiu-li1 aLi, Jian Ping.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.970-974dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090224b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/24  aOther US 7aarticle03009naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001700187245011000204300001600314500002400330520133700354650002501691650002501716650001601741650001201757650001501769650002701784650002501811650002001836650002201856650001001878650005801888650003201946650002901978650004702007650003202054650002002086653002902106700001402135700001802149700001602167700001802183773009602201852000902297856009002306930003302396945002502429946001302454655001202467IND4414578920221116162545.0090105e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441457892DNAL7 a186628712pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aW0001 aGong, Renmin10aFunctionalization of sawdust with monosodium glutamate for enhancing its malachite green removal capacity  ap. 975-978.  aIncludes references  aIn this paper, waste sawdust was functionalized by monosodium glutamate for improving its cationic sorption capacity. The functionalized sawdust (FS) and crude sawdust (CS) were compared for their malachite green (MG) sorption behaviors with a batch system. The effects of various experimental parameters (e.g. initial pH, sorbent dose, dye concentration, contact time, and temperature etc.) were investigated and the sorption kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics were understood. The MG removal ratios on FS and on CS increased with increasing initial pH and came up to the maximum value beyond pH 6 for FS and pH 8 for CS, respectively. The ratio of sorbed MG kept above 95% for 250mg/l of MG solution when 2.0g/l or more of FS was used. The MG removal percentage decreased more on CS than on FS with increasing initial MG concentration. The isothermal data of MG sorbed on FS and on CS followed the Langmuir model. By functionalizing, the sorption capacity (Q m) of sawdust for MG was increased from 85.47 to 196.08mg/g and the sorption equilibrium time of MG was shortened from 23 to 4.5h. The MG sorption processes on FS and on CS followed the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics. The sorptions of MG on FS and on CS were spontaneous and exothermic processes and lower temperatures were favorable for the sorption processes. 3aindustrial effluents 3awastewater treatment 3aCastanopsis 3asawdust 3aabsorbents 3abiodegradable products 3amonosodium glutamate 3amalachite green 3aaqueous solutions 2aPaper 2aRosaniline Dyesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSodium Glutamatexchemistry 2aUltrafiltrationxmethods 2aWater Pollutantsxisolation & purification 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWoodxchemistry 0aCastanopsis sclerophylla1 aFeng, Min1 aZhao, Jiajing1 aCai, Wenkai1 aLiu, Lingling0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.975-978dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090224b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/24  aOther US 7aarticle02798naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245015200204300001800356506007600374520126200450506003701712650001501749650002101764650001601785650001101801650001401812650001901826650001401845650001401859650001701873650003601890700002101926700001801947700002201965700002101987700002102008773017302029852000902202856008302211939003302294946001302327655001202340IND4458351520221207073321.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10150221082doi7 aPMC31023472pmcid7 a215555872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCipriano, Rocky10aTGF-β signaling engages an ATM-CHK2-p53-independent RAS-induced senescence and prevents malignant transformation in human mammary epithelial cells  ap. 8668-8673.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOncogene-induced senescence (OIS), the proliferative arrest engaged in response to persistent oncogene activation, serves as an important tumor-suppressive barrier. We show here that finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) undergo a p16/RB- and p53-independent OIS in response to oncogenic RAS that requires TGF-β signaling. Suppression of TGF-β signaling by expression of a dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor, use of a TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor, or ectopic expression of MYC permitted continued proliferation upon RAS expression. Surprisingly, unlike fibroblasts, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATM or CHK2 was unable to prevent RAS-mediated OIS, arguing that the DNA damage response is not required for OIS in HMEC. Abrogation of TGF-β signaling not only allowed HMEC lacking p53 to tolerate oncogenic RAS but also conferred the capacity for anchorage-independent growth. Thus, the OIS engaged after dysregulated RAS expression provides an early barrier to malignant progression and is mediated by TGF-β receptor activation in HMEC. Understanding the mechanisms that initiate and maintain OIS in epithelial cells may provide a foundation for future therapies aimed at reengaging this proliferative barrier as a cancer therapy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3alongevity 3amammary glands 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aKan, Charlene E.1 aGraham, James1 aDanielpour, David1 aStampfer, Martha1 aJackson, Mark W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8668-8673dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10150221083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013800207300001800345506007600363520111900439506003701558650002501595650002101620650002101641650002201662650001101684650001101695650001401706700001801720700001701738700002701755700001801782773017301800852000901973856008301982939003302065946001302098655001202111IND4458349620221207071140.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445834962DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11049521082doi7 aPMC31024042pmcid7 a215511012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostentin, Cyrille10aConcerted heavy-atom bond cleavage and proton and electron transfers illustrated by proton-assisted reductive cleavage of an O-O bond  ap. 8559-8564.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectron transfer may be concerted with proton transfer. It may also be concerted with the cleavage of a bond between heavy atoms. All three events may also be concerted. A model is presented to analyze the kinetics of these all-concerted reactions for homogeneous or electrochemical reduction or oxidation processes. It allows the estimation of the kinetic advantage that derives from the increase of the bond-breaking driving force resulting from the concerted proton transfer. Application of the model to the electrochemical reductive cleavage of the O-O bond of an organic peroxide in the presence of a proximal acid group illustrates the applicability of the model and provides an example demonstrating that electron transfer, heavy-atom bond breaking, and proton transfer may be all concerted. Such analyses are expected to be useful for the invention, analysis, and optimization of reactions involved in contemporary energy challenges as well as for the comprehension of major biochemical processes, a number of which involve electron and proton transfer together with cleavage of bonds between heavy atoms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3amodels 3aoxidation1 aHajj, Viviane1 aRobert, Marc1 aSavéant, Jean Michel.1 aTard, Cédric0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8559-8564dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11049521083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245005300203300001800256506007600274520126500350506003701615650002001652650001301672651001801685700002101703773017301724852000901897856008301906939003301989946001302022655001202035IND4458350320221207071214.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10190611082doi7 aPMC31024192pmcid7 a215555532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragu, Tiberiu10aRepresentation and redistribution in federations  ap. 8601-8604.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany of the world's most populous democracies are political unions composed of states or provinces that are unequally represented in the national legislature. Scattered empirical studies, most of them focusing on the United States, have discovered that overrepresented states appear to receive larger shares of the national budget. Although this relationship is typically attributed to bargaining advantages associated with greater legislative representation, an important threat to empirical identification stems from the fact that the representation scheme was chosen by the provinces. Thus, it is possible that representation and fiscal transfers are both determined by other characteristics of the provinces in a specific country. To obtain an improved estimate of the relationship between representation and redistribution, we collect and analyze provincial-level data from nine federations over several decades, taking advantage of the historical process through which federations formed and expanded.

Coordinate induction of monoterpene and diterpene cyclases and two cytochrome P450-dependent diterpenoid hydroxylases by stem wounding  ap. 999-1005.  aOleoresin (pitch) is a defensive secretion composed of monoterpene olefins (turpentine) and diterpene resin acids (rosin) that is produced in grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.) stems in response to wounding. Monoterpene and diterpene biosynthesis are coordinately induced in wounded stems as determined by monitoring the activity of monoterpene and diterpene cyclases, as well as two cytochrome P450-dependent diterpenoid hydroxylases involved in the formation of (-)-abietic acid, the principal resin acid of this species. The activity of these enzymes reaches maximum levels that are 5- to 100-fold higher than those of nonwounded control stems 10 d after wounding and this is followed by a synchronous decline. The increase in biosynthetic activity is consequently followed by the accumulation of a viscous mass of resin acids, with the loss of the volatile monoterpenes, at the site of injury. The observed coordinate indudion of monoterpene olefin and abietic acid biosynthesis and the results of oleoresin analysis are consistent with the role of the volatile monoterpenes as a solvent for the mobilization and deposition of resin acids at the wound site to seal the injury with a rosin barrier after the evaporation of the turpentine. The last skp of resin acid biosynthesis is catalyzed by an operationally soluble aldehyde dehydrogenase that is not inducible by wounding but seemingly is expressed constitutively at a high level. In vivo [14C]acetate feeding and resin analysis indicate that this enzyme is not efficiently coupled to the earlier steps of the pathway. 3aAbies grandis 3astems 3aoleoresins 3abiosynthesis 3amonoterpenoids 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygenases 3aabietic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3achemical reactions 3aditerpenoids 3astress response 0aprecursors 0ainjuries 0ainduction 0aregulation1 aLewinsohn, E.1 aVogel, B.S.1 aSteele, C.L.1 aCroteau, R.0 tPlant physiology.g1994 Nov., v. 106, no. 3 p.999-1005aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03814naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003400184245009500218300001800313506007600331520180000407506003702207650001202244650001802256650001002274650001702284650001302301650001302314650001702327650001102344650000902355650001302364650001302377650001302390650002002403650001402423650001502437650001802452650001102470650002302481700001602504700002002520700001702540700002102557700002702578700002302605700003102628700002002659700001702679700002202696700001802718700002602736700001602762700002002778700003102798773017302829852000903002856008303011939003303094946001303127655001203140IND4458356220221207051949.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11019641082doi7 aPMC31023442pmcid7 a215555902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArboleda-Velasquez, Joseph F.10aHypomorphic Notch 3 alleles link Notch signaling to ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease  ap. E128-E135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe most common monogenic cause of small-vessel disease leading to ischemic stroke and vascular dementia is the neurodegenerative syndrome cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which is associated with mutations in the Notch 3 receptor. CADASIL pathology is characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell degeneration and accumulation of diagnostic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in vessels. The functional nature of the Notch 3 mutations causing CADASIL and their mechanistic connection to small-vessel disease and GOM accumulation remain enigmatic. To gain insight into how Notch 3 function is linked to CADASIL pathophysiology, we studied two phenotypically distinct mutations, C455R and R1031C, respectively associated with early and late onset of stroke, by using hemodynamic analyses in transgenic mouse models, receptor activity assays in cell culture, and proteomic examination of postmortem human tissue. We demonstrate that the C455R and R1031C mutations define different hypomorphic activity states of Notch 3, a property linked to ischemic stroke susceptibility in mouse models we generated. Importantly, these mice develop osmiophilic deposits and other age-dependent phenotypes that parallel remarkably the human condition. Proteomic analysis of human brain vessels, carrying the same CADASIL mutations, identified clusterin and collagen 18 α1/endostatin as GOM components. Our findings link loss of Notch signaling with ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease, a prevalent human condition. We determine that CADASIL pathophysiology is associated with hypomorphic Notch 3 function in vascular smooth muscle cells and implicate the accumulation of clusterin and collagen 18 α1/endostatin in brain vessel pathology.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acell culture 3acollagen 3adementia 3ahemodynamics 3ahumans 3amice 3amutation 3amyocytes 3anecropsy 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype 3aproteomics 3asmooth muscle 3astroke 3atransgenic animals1 aManent, Jan1 aLee, Jeong Hyun1 aTikka, Saara1 aOspina, Carolina1 aVanderburg, Charles R.1 aFrosch, Matthew P.1 aRodríguez-Falcón, Manuel1 aVillén, Judit.1 aGygi, Steven1 aLopera, Francisco1 aKalimo, Hannu1 aMoskowitz, Michael A.1 aAyata, Cenk1 aLouvi, Angeliki1 aArtavanis-Tsakonas, Spyros0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.E128-E135dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11019641083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle03616naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008000172300001600252520212500268650001802393650001502411650001202426650001602438650003302454650001902487650001402506650001402520650001902534650001102553650001302564650001302577650000702590650001802597650001602615650000902631651001102640653001902651653001902670653001802689700002802707700002302735700002502758700002802783700002902811773010802840852000902948856008502957930003303042946001103075655001203086IND4409127920221116162453.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440912792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-007-9111-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerino-Ibarra, Martin 10aPhysical and chemical limnology of a wind-swept tropical highland reservoir  ap. 335-345.  aValle de Bravo (VB) is a tropical reservoir located (19°21'30" N, 100°11'00" W) in the highlands of Mexico. The reservoir is daily swept by strong (7.4 m s⁻¹ mean speed) diurnal (12:00-19:00 h) winds that blow along its two main arms. As expected from its fetch (6.9 km) and its depth (21.1 m mean), the reservoir behaves as a warm monomictic water body. During 2001, VB was stratified from February to October, and well mixed from November to January. Its mean temperature was 19.9°C; the maximum found was 23.8°C in the epilimnion, while a minimum of 17.8°C was registered during mixing. VB exhibited a thermal regime similar to other water bodies of the Mexican tropical highlands, except for a steady increase of its hypolimnetic temperature during stratification, which is attributed to entrainment of epilimnetic water into the hypolimnion. During stratification, the hypolimnion was anoxic, while the whole water column remained under-saturated (60%) during mixing. The flushing time is 2.2 years. Mineralization and total alkalinity are low, which allows strong changes in pH. Ammonia remained low (2.4 μmol l⁻¹ mean) in the epilimnion, but reached up to 60 μmol l⁻¹ in the hypolimnion. Soluble reactive phosphorous had a mean of 0.28 μmol l⁻¹ in the epilimnion and a mean of 1.25 μmol l⁻¹ in the hypolimnion. Nitrate exhibited maxima (up to 21 μmol l⁻¹) during mixing, and also in the metalimnion (2 μmol l⁻¹) during stratification. Low dissolved inorganic nitrogen indicated nitrogen limitation during stratification. Eutrophication is an emerging problem in VB, where cyanobacteria dominate during stratification. At VB chlorophyll a is low during mixing (mean of 9 μg l⁻¹), and high during stratification (mean 21 μg l⁻¹), when blooms (up to 88 μg l⁻¹) are frequent. This pattern is similar to that found in other eutrophic tropical water bodies. We propose that in VB the wind regime causes vertical displacements of the thermocline (0.58-1.10 m hr⁻¹) and boundary mixing, enhancing the productivity during the stratification period in this tropical reservoir. 3aCyanobacteria 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3achlorophyll 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3aeutrophication 3ahighlands 3alimnology 3amineralization 3amixing 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apH 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awind 3aMexico 0aInternal waves 0aValle de Bravo 0aVertical flow1 aMonroy-Ríos, Emiliano 1 aVilaclara, Gloria 1 aCastillo, Fermin S. 1 aGallegos, Margarita E. 1 aRamírez-Zierold, Jorge 0 tAquatic ecology.g2008 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.335-345dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9111-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245009000205300001800295506007600313520122600389506003701615650003101652650003101683650001701714650001501731650001701746650002001763650002001783650001701803650002401820650001601844650001401860650001401874700002001888700002301908700002301931700001901954773017301973852000902146856008302155939003302238946001302271655001202284IND4458352920221207064314.0110526e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835292DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11005671082doi7 aPMC31023722pmcid7 a215555772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumamoto, Yosuke10aCD4⁺ T cells support cytotoxic T lymphocyte priming by controlling lymph node input  ap. 8749-8754.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRapid induction of CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses is critical to combat acute infection with intracellular pathogens. CD4⁺ T cells help prime antigen-specific CTLs in secondary lymphoid organs after infection in the periphery. Although the frequency of naïve precursors is very low, the immune system is able to efficiently screen for cognate CTLs through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we examine the role of CD4⁺ T cells in early phases of the immune response. We show that CD4⁺ T cells help optimal CTL expansion by facilitating entry of naïve polyclonal CD8⁺ T cells into the draining lymph node (dLN) early after infection or immunization. CD4⁺ T cells also facilitate input of naïve B cells into reactive LNs. Such "help" involves expansion of the arteriole feeding the dLN and enlargement of the dLN through activation of dendritic cells. In an antigen- and CD40-dependent manner, CD4⁺ T cells activate dendritic cells to support naïve lymphocyte recruitment to the dLN. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated mode of CD4⁺ T-cell help, whereby they increase the input of naïve lymphocytes to the relevant LN for efficient screening of cognate CD8⁺ T cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aacute course 3aarterioles 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3ainfectious diseases 3alymph nodes 3apathogens 3ascreening1 aMattei, Lisa M.1 aSellers, Stephanie1 aPayne, Geoffrey W.1 aIwasaki, Akiko0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 May 24, v. 108, no. 21 p.8749-8754dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11005671083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110526  aOther US 7aarticle02699naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245005900213300001600272506007600288520120800364592002801572506003701600650002101637650001001658650001101668650001201679650002001691650001001711650001101721650001101732650001801743650000901761650002801770650001301798700001601811700002301827700001201850700002101862700002101883700002501904700002201929773009001951852000902041856008502050930003302135946001302168655001202181IND4408762020221207071246.0080808e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440876202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-008-9115-z2doi7 aPMC25839332pmcid7 a185634862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabakoff, B.q(Boris),14aThe genomic determinants of alcohol preference in mice  ap. 352-365.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSearches for the identity of genes that influence the levels of alcohol consumption by humans and other animals have often been driven by presupposition of the importance of particular gene products in determining positively or negatively reinforcing effects of ethanol. We have taken an unbiased approach and performed a meta-analysis across three types of mouse populations to correlate brain gene expression with levels of alcohol intake. Our studies, using filtering procedures based on QTL analysis, produced a list of eight candidate genes with highly heritable expression, which could explain a significant amount of the variance in alcohol preference in mice. Using the Allen Brain Atlas for gene expression, we noted that the candidate genes’ expression was localized to the olfactory and limbic areas as well as to the orbitofrontal cortex. Informatics techniques and pathway analysis illustrated the role of the candidate genes in neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptic remodeling. The importance of olfactory cues, learning and memory formation (Pavlovian conditioning), and cortical executive function, for regulating alcohol intake by animals (including humans), is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohol drinking 3abrain 3acortex 3aethanol 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3amemory 3ameta-analysis 3amice 3aquantitative trait loci 3avariance1 aSaba, Laura1 aKechris, Katherina1 aHu, Wei1 aBhave, Sanjiv V.1 aFinn, Deborah A.1 aGrahame, Nicholas J.1 aHoffman, Paula L.0 tMammalian genome.g2008 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.352-365dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-008-9115-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03814naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245010900200300001400309500002400323500001500347520112300362650002701485650002101512650001901533650001601552650001801568650002001586650002001606650002501626650002601651650002101677650002801698650002601726650002501752650000901777650003201786650002501818650001301843650001101856650001801867650001901885650001201904650005701916650002501973650004001998650003702038650008302075650006602158650004502224650004302269650003602312650002502348650000902373650000902382650002102391650006102412650005202473650005902525653002502584700001902609700001902628700001802647700001902665700002002684700001902704773009802723852000902821856008502830930003302915945002502948946001102973655001202984IND4414567320221116162122.0090105e20081030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441456732DNAL7 a187610702pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aHu, Xiao-Ping10aAntioxidative and hepatoprotective effect of CGX, an herbal medicine, against toxic acute injury in mice  ap. 51-55.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAim: CGX, a modified traditional Chinese herbal drug whose name means “liver cleaning,” is used to treat various liver disorders. This study investigated the protective effects of CGX and its mechanisms. Material and methods: After pretreating ICR mice twice daily with CGX (po, 50 or 100mg/kg) or distilled water for three consecutive days, acute liver injury was induced by a single injection of CCl₄ (ip, 10mL/kg of 0.2% in olive oil) (n =8 per group). Results: Pretreatment with CGX significantly attenuated the elevation in biochemical parameters, such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, and the malondialdehyde concentrations in liver tissue. Pretreatment with CGX significantly restored the reduction of catalase activity and glutathione (GSH) content, but not superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and it inhibited the CCl₄-induced high expression of iNOS and TNF-α in hepatic tissue. Conclusion: This study showed that CGX has hepatoprotective effects against free radical-induced acute injury via primarily antioxidative properties. 3aaspartate transaminase 3amedicinal plants 3aliver function 3aglutathione 3adose response 3ablood chemistry 3amalondialdehyde 3aalanine transaminase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aherbal medicines 3ahepatoprotective effect 3anitric oxide synthase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3amice 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3adosage 3aanimal models 3aliver diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCarbon Tetrachloride 2aCatalasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aChemical and Drug Induced Liver Injuryxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlutathionexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aLiver Function Tests 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0amedicinal properties1 aShin, Jang-Woo1 aWang, Jing-Hua1 aCho, Jung-Hyo1 aSon, Jin-Young1 aCho, Chong-Kwan1 aSon, Chang-Gue0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2008 Oct. 30, v. 120, no. 1 p.51-55dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle04264naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001700191245010200208300001800310500002400328500001500352520151500367650001801882650001601900650002701916650002401943650002801967650001501995650001202010650001802022650001602040650001502056650002302071650003002094650001602124650002302140650001702163650001702180650001402197650001702211650002002228650002902248650002802277650002402305650001802329650004802347650002302395650006002418650002402478650003002502650005202532650001102584650001102595650002302606650003602629650000902665650005802674650001602732650004702748650001702795653002602812653003202838653001302870653003202883653001502915700002902930700001902959700002202978700002403000700002103024700002503045700002303070773009203093852000903185856008503194930003303279945002503312946001303337655001203350IND4414568820221116162117.0090105e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441456882DNAL7 a186400062pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2008.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aVilar, Lisis10aHigh-fat diet: A trigger of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis? Preliminary findings in obese subjects  ap. 1097-1102.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: We correlated dietary profile and markers of visceral and somatic obesities in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Methods: Patients with histologically proven fatty infiltration of the liver (n = 25, 52 ± 11 y of age, 64% women) underwent abdominal computed tomography, bioelectrical impedance, and anthropometric measurements. Insulin resistance was evaluated (homeostasis model assessment) and dietary intake of macronutrients was estimated by 24-h recall. Main outcome measurements were correlation of carbohydrate and fat ingestion with liver histology. Results: Metabolic syndrome was present in 72% of the population, and increased waist circumference and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol occurred in 66%. Total body fat (bioimpedance) and dietary intake of lipids were higher in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (P < 0.05), but not in diabetic subjects who exhibited more steatosis than non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Waist circumference exhibited a good correlation with homeostasis model assessment, total energy intake, and ingestion of specific fatty acids. Body mass index correlated well with somatic and visceral adiposities. Conclusion: Energy intake and visceral adiposity were predisposing factors for fatty liver disease. Lipid input correlated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the entire group and after stratification for diabetes. These findings suggest that lipid intake may play a greater role in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than hitherto suspected. 3ahigh fat diet 3adietary fat 3adietary energy sources 3awaist circumference 3abioelectrical impedance 3afat intake 3aobesity 3aabdominal fat 3adiet recall 3abiomarkers 3ainsulin resistance 3anutrition risk assessment 3afatty liver 3ametabolic syndrome 3ablood lipids 3avisceral fat 3ahistology 3arisk factors 3abody mass index 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3acomputed tomography 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Compositionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDisease Progression 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFatty Liverxepidemiologyxetiologyxpathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aIntra-Abdominal Fatxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aRisk Factors 0adiet-related diseases 0anon-alcohol steatohepatitis 0abody fat 0aanthropometric measurements 0aoverweight1 aOliveira, Claudia P.M.S.1 aFaintuch, Joel1 aMello, Evandro S.1 aNogueira, Monize A.1 aSantos, Telma E.1 aAlves, Venancio A.F.1 aCarrilho, Flair J.0 tNutrition.g2008 , v. 24, no. 11-12 p.1097-1102dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2008.05.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20110622b20110701c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/01/22  aOther US 7aarticle01129naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007100125300001800196520026300214650001900477650001800496650001300514650002300527650000900550650003600559650004400595651001000639700001800649773007000667852000900737930003300746945001300779946001100792655001200803IND2060260720221116161902.0971026s1990    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206026072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, R.10aVeitchiolide, a tetracyclic triterpene lactone from Abies veitchii  ap. 3267-3269.  aA new tetracyclic triterpene lactone, named veitchiolide, was isolated together with the known triterpenoid, abieslactone, from the stem bark of Abies veitchii.

All media showed an initial rapid decline in DOC values followed by a slower rate during later time periods. Greater than 50% of the DOC leached occurred within the initial time period (<24h). The mass of DOC leached varied significantly between the materials and to a lesser degree between different particle size ranges. The pine had the lowest leached DOC fraction (2.8-4.8mg/g), while the hardwood (21-27mg/g) and compost (13.6-32.7mg/g) were significantly greater.

Waxes of the pruinose and glaucous taxa of Sedum were found to have a high triterpene content. In waxes of Aeonium spathulatum and Sempervivum nevadense, no triterpenes could be detected. Variation in the alkane and triterpene profiles proved to he of significant systematic value. In general, the distribution of the triterpenes in Sedum agrees with the infrageneric classification based on hybridization patterns and related morphological characters. 3afatty acids 3aSempervivum 3awax esters 3achemotaxonomy 3aaldehydes 3aplant cuticle 3achemical structure 3atriterpenoids 3aalkanes 3achemical constituents of plants 3aSedum 3aleaves 3aAfrica 3aTurkey (country) 0aEurope 0aaeonium spathlatum 0aCrassulaceae 0afatty acid esters 0awaxes1 at'Hart, H.1 aBolck, A.1 aZwaving, J.H.1 aMalingre, T.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1994 Jan., v. 35, no. 2 p.389-399x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01421naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005400130300001600184520045000200650001300650650001900663650002800682650001700710650001000727650001500737650001700752650002000769653002500789653005000814653004200864700001500906773007200921852000900993930003301002945001301035946001101048655001201059IND2060241520221116162015.0971023e199401  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206024152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackwell, J.R.10aCytokinin biosythenthesis by extracts of Zea mays  ap. 339-342.  aCell-free extracts of immature Zea kernels incubated with tritiated AMP and DMAPP produced the cytokinins delta 2-isopentenyladenosine and its monophosphate.

Deposit samples were collected on an air-cooled probe at a temperature of 500°C. Samples were analyzed by SEM/EDX and XRD methods. The results reveal that co-firing lignite with olive residue, hazelnut shell and cotton residue show low deposition rates. High concentrations of silicon, calcium, sulfur, iron, and aluminum were found in deposit samples. No chlorine was detected in deposits. Calcium sulfate and potassium sulfate were detected as major and minor components of the deposits, respectively. High sulfur and alumina-silicate content of lignite resulted in formation of alkali sulfates instead of alkali chlorides. Therefore, fuel blends under consideration can be denoted to have low-fouling propensity. 3acotton 3arenewable energy sources 3ahazelnuts 3aolives 3alignite 3abiomass 3ahulls 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aCoal Ash 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aHeatingxinstrumentation 2aHot Temperature 2aIndustrial Wastexprevention & control 2aLigninxchemistry 2aParticulate Matterxchemistry 2aRefuse Disposalxinstrumentation 2aRheologyxinstrumentation 0aplant residues1 aGogebakan, Yusuf1 aSelçuk, Nevin.1 aSelçuk, Ekrem0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Jan., v. 100, no. 2 p.1033-1036dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/25  aOther US 7aarticle02905naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008900162300001600251500002000267520168600287592002801973650001102001650001402012650001102026650001702037650001402054650001702068650001902085700001602104700005502120700002302175700002002198700002102218700005902239773013302298856007902431852000902510655001202519IND60744854920221118103843.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485492DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.126812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jerrold10aDevelopment of a new tool to monitor and identify inadequate oral intake in hospital  ap. 296-304.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: There is a need for quick and easy methods to monitor nutritional intake in hospital and identify patients with poor intake. Food record charts are often used in clinical practice, with low levels of accuracy and completion. This study aims to describe the development and evaluate the performance of a new tool to estimate energy and protein intake and identify poor nutritional intake amongst adult hospital patients. METHODS: Ninety trays were sampled and assessed independently using the new tool ‘Meal Intake Points’ and a weighed (reference) method. The performance was tested by measuring association (Spearman's correlation), agreement (proportion of meals within specified limits of reference method), and sensitivity and specificity to identify poor energy and protein intake. RESULTS: This new tool achieved very strong association for energy estimates (r = .91) and strong association for protein estimates (r = .86). Estimates for energy and protein were within 450 kJ and 4.5 g of the reference method in 77.8% and 62.2% of meals, respectively. It also displayed excellent performance as a screening tool (sensitivity 100%; specificity 76%‐80%). Minor revision of the original tool was needed to optimise performance. CONCLUSIONS: Meal Intake Points accurately estimates energy and protein intake and identifies patients with poor nutritional intake, providing a clinically relevant tool for use in hospitals to monitor intake and identify patients for proactive nutrition support. Further validation studies are needed to determine its performance in clinical practice and whether it is useful in predicting hospital‐acquired malnutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adietetics 3aenergy 3afood records 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3aprotein intake1 aLau, Ka Man1 aRoss, Lynda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2947-41301 aKinneally, Jessica1 aBanks, Merrilyn1 aPelecanos, Anita1 aYoung, Adrienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4498-43420 tNutrition & dietetics.g2021 July, v. 78, no. 3 p.296-304dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3613350x1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.126813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165520106900298592002801367650001701395650002001412650001601432650001601448650001601464650001901480650002501499650001901524650001501543650001001558650001901568650001501587651001001602653003501612653002501647653002601672653003701698700001301735700001401748700001501762700001901777700001701796773011401813856008201927852000902009655001202018IND60674121020221120180028.0200210e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067412102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavalagli, N.10aSatellite radar interferometry and in-situ measurements for static monitoring of historical monuments: The case of Gubbio, Italy  aThe paper presents an overview of the results of diagnostic and monitoring activities carried out in the last years through satellite radar interferometry (2011–2016) and in situ measurements (2017–2019) in the historical city of Gubbio, Italy.

Brandt’s vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii) is an ideal animal to explore the regulatory mechanism of seasonal breeding, and many studies on this vole involve gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, we used the method of the coefficient of variation and the NormFinder algorithm to evaluate the performance of nine commonly used reference genes Gapdh, Hprt1, β-actin, PPIA, Rpl13a, Tbp, Sdha, Hmbs, and B2M using qRT-PCR in eight different tissues, five developmental stages, and three different photoperiods. We found that all nine genes were not uniformly expressed among different tissues. B2M and Rpl13a were the optimal reference genes for different postnatal development stages in the hypothalamus for males and females, respectively. Under different photoperiods in the hypothalamus, none of the selected genes were suitable as reference genes at 6 weeks postnatal; β-actin and PPIA were the optimal reference genes at 12 weeks postnatal; Hprt1, β-actin, PPIA, Hmbs, and B2M were excellent reference genes at 24 weeks postnatal. The present study provides a useful basis for selecting the appropriate reference gene in Lasiopodomys brandtii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiopodomys 3aalgorithms 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypothalamus 3apostnatal development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avoles1 aChen, Yan 1 aWang, Da-Wei 1 aLiu, Xiao-Hui 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 21, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245009600194300001600290500002000306520179900326592002802125596006402153596005802217650002202275650001002297650002002307650001802327650001602345650001402361650001102375650002102386650001602407700002202423773015102445856007502596852000902671655001202680IND60786563120221120182159.0220804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078656312DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.123972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7816-109910aTripalmitin‐Driven Crystallization of Palm Oil: The Role of Shear and Dispersed Particles  ap. 989-999.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile palm oil (PO) is a reliable ingredient in formulations for biscuits, cream fillings, and compound chocolates, our understanding of its crystallization behavior and physico‐chemistry pales in comparison to many other fats and oils. Phase diagrams of triacylglycerol (TAG) mixtures may be used to elucidate fat crystal polymorphism and composition of such oils, yet conditions important to the food industry such as shear speed, relevant processing temperatures, and presence of secondary ingredients are regularly overlooked. Here, the effects of shear speed (n = 0–500 RPM), dispersion concentration (0–5 wt.%), and dispersed particle surface chemistry [silica or octadecyl‐functionalized (C18) silica] on the thermal properties of commercial PO when cooled from 60 to 20 °C at 1 °C min⁻¹ were explored, with focus placed on PO's higher‐melting fraction. Using a series of high‐purity TAG standards, X‐ray diffraction revealed PO's higher‐melting fraction as mainly composed of tripalmitin (PPP) crystals and molecular compounds (MC) of PPP either with 1,3‐dipalmitoyl‐2‐oleoyl‐sn‐glycerol (POP) or with POP and 1,2‐dipalmitoyl‐3‐oleoyl‐rac‐glycerol (PPO) in combination, all in a double chain‐length β' (i.e., β'‐2) conformation. Shear increased the formation of lower‐melting α‐2 POP and β'‐2 MCPOP:PPO:PPP crystals while depleting the system of β'‐2 MCPOP:PPP and β'‐2 PPP crystals. This loss was further exacerbated by the addition of dispersed particles to the point where PPP was completely incorporated as MC and β'‐2 PPP crystals were eliminated. While heterogeneous nucleation tends to favor kinetic products of fat crystallization, the interactions between shear and surface chemistry varied between crystal types.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cProfessional Manufacturing Confectioners' Association 3aX-ray diffraction 3acream 3acrystallization 3afood industry 3aingredients 3apalm oils 3asilica 3atriacylglycerols 3atripalmitin1 aRousseau, Dérick0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2020 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.989-999dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.123973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008400164300001600248500002000264520129000284592002801574650001301602650000901615650001201624650000801636650001101644650001101655650001501666650001801681650001001699650001101709650002101720700002401741773014601765856007901911852000901990655001201999IND60684879120221121233736.0200226e199408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068487912DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.27406504122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlock, Susan M14aThe use of prilled fat to coat and protect amino acids from ruminal degradation  ap. 441-447.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA series of trials was conducted to determine the effectiveness and limitations associated with the use of partially hydrogenated triglycerides as a protective coating to enhance amino acid escape from the rumen. Commercially prepared prills and laboratory‐synthesized prills containing either lysine or methionine were incubated from 0–24 h in situ, in a fistula Ted cow fed hay and grain (1:1, w/w DM). Multiple factors were found to affect the ability of fat to protect amino acids. Examination of prill size where prills were separated by sieves into sizes ranging from 703 μm to 2.5 mm indicated that, overall, larger prills provided greater protection than smaller prills. Differences in protection exist between amino acid source, as methionine recovery was consistently greater than lysine. Reduction of lysine particle size improved its protection, but was still not protected as well as methionine. Prills with iodine values (IV) of < 1, 17 and 40 were also examined. Differences in protection between IV levels was not great, however, IV < 1 and 17 provided greater protection than IV 40. Utilizing results from the various trials, maximal protection level was achieved (approximately 90%) for methionine in prills made from IV 17 which ranged in size from 2 to 2.5 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acows 3afistula 3ahay 3aiodine 3alysine 3amethionine 3aparticle size 3arumen 3asieves 3atriacylglycerols1 aJenkins, Thomas C.,0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Aug., v. 65, no. 4 p.441-447dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.27406504123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245016200199300001600361500002000377520174300397592002802140596023402168650001402402650002702416650001202443650001802455650001902473650001402492650001102506650001602517650002602533700002602559700001702585700002002602700002102622773015102643856007502794852000902869655001202878IND60786563220221120171926.0220804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078656322DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.123632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDıraman, Harun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7431-752410aUsing Nutritional Lipid and Sensorial Profiles for the Characterization of Turkish Olive (Memecik X Gemlik cv) Hybrids obtained from Controlled Crossbreeding  ap. 943-954.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOlive breeding is an important method for improving of olive oil quality. In the early 1990’s, a controlled cross breeding project was started on Turkish domestic olive cultivars by Bornova Olive Research Institute, Izmir. This study was carried out with a total of 11 hybrids and 2 parents and these oil samples were obtained from “Memecik” [5 samples (MG) + 1 parent (MEM)] and “Gemlik” [6 samples (GM) + 1 parent (GEM)] domestic olive cultivars grown under the same agronomic and pedoclimatic conditions. In this study, agronomic criteria (ripening index), some nutritional values (total phenolic contents, major fatty acids [palmitic, oleic, linoleic acid, linolenic acid] and their parameters (linoleic/linolenic ratio, quality index), and sensory properties (panel test) of olive (Memecik and Gemlik) hybrid oils were analyzed during 2005–2008 four harvest years. All results showed that 11 advanced domestic olive hybrids had different oil characteristics relative to the parents of hybrids based on nutritional and sensory profiles. The Pearson correlation coefficients and principal components factor loadings observed among chemical/sensory characteristics and fatty acid profile (GM 19, GM 39, MG 11, MG 5 and MG 123 promising hybrids) could be of interest in future olive breeding programs. Considering the main objectives of olive breeding project, the hybrids of GM 19 and MG 5 exhibited superior agronomic (maturation–regular yield), technological–nutritional (high total polyphenol content, balanced omega3/omega6 ratio), and sensorial (high pungent and bitter qualifications) features. The official registrations of these hybrids were carried out by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No TAGEM/GY/06/11/119cMinistry Food, Agriculture and Livestock of Turkey (especially Dr. Seyfi Özışık, Director of Inst.

The generally accepted model suggests that they formed at the coremantle boundary of an asteroid. Tarduno et al. (p. 939; see the Perspective by Weiss) measured a remnant magnetization in olivine crystals of two pallasite meteorites and conclude that a dynamo must have operated in their parent body, providing further evidence that some asteroids were capable of dynamo generation. The data, together with thermal modeling, suggest that some pallasites could have formed when liquid FeNi from the core of an impacting asteroid was injected into the mantle of a large protoplanet.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3aelectric generators 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amodels1 aCottrell, Rory D.1 aNimmo, Francis1 aHopkins, Julianna1 aVoronov, Julia1 aErickson, Austen1 aBlackman, Eric1 aScott, Edward R.D.1 aMcKinley, Robert0 tScience.g2012 Nov. 16, v. 338, no. 6109 p.939-942dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12239323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013800163300002000301500001900321520138100340592002801721596011501749596008601864596006801950596011002018650001102128650001502139650001902154650001402173650001302187650001702200650001102217650001102228650002402239650002202263650001102285651001002296700001502306700002002321700002002341773016902361856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60696421120221117183217.0200524e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069642112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08556-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yaxiao10aDynamics of the surface thermal landscape (STL) in northern slope of central Tianshan mountains, Xinjiang, NW China from 2000 to 2018  ap. 22033-22045.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing the 2000–2018 MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and taking 11 cities (counties) in the northern slope of the central Tianshan Mountains in northwestern China as the study area, the spatial-temporal characteristics, landscape indices, centroid, and geo-information Tupu (carto-methodology in geo-information, CMGI) of surface thermal landscape (STL) were analyzed, and the paper draws the following results: (1) There are great differences in the diurnal and seasonal STL. The higher thermal levels are distributed more northerly in spring, summer, and autumn, and more southerly in winter. (2) In terms of class type level and landscape level, different landscape indices show different characteristics in diurnal and seasonal thermal landscapes. (3) Centroids at different thermal levels during the daytime are more dispersed than at nighttime in spring and summer, while the opposite is found in autumn. In winter, centroids of different thermal levels are concentrated in the southern and central-southern regions. During the period of 2000–2018, centroids of different thermal levels tend to move with the varying of STL. (4) The whole STL in same seasons changed little, transition usually happens between adjacent thermal levels. Overall, compared with the eastern monsoon area, there are similarities and differences in the characteristics of the STL.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA20040400cthe Strategic Priority Program of the CAS, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road  a400070010209cthe Tianshan Talent Project of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region  aGrant No.U1503302cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aL06cGroup supporting project for study abroad sent by the people’s Government of the Autonomous Region 3aautumn 3alandscapes 3amonsoon season 3apollution 3aresearch 3aspatial data 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atopographic slope 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhang, Fei1 aFang, Chuanglin1 aLiu, Changjiang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 June, v. 27, no. 17 p.22033-22045dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08556-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008700164520164300251592002801894650001701922650001201939650002201951650002001973650001101993650001002004650000902014650002102023650002002044650001102064650001802075650000902093650001702102650001302119650000902132650001502141700002202156700002202178700001902200700002302219773011802242856007702360852000902437655001202446IND60768401820221118152126.0220225e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076840182DNAL7 a10.3390/land110202972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, Quang Chi12aA Land-Use Change Model to Support Land-Use Planning in the Mekong Delta (MEKOLUC)  aAgricultural land-use changes pose challenges for land managers in terms of ensuring the implementation of local land-use plans. This paper aims to build a land-use change model named MEKOLUC (Mekong Delta land-use change) for simulating land-use changes under the impacts of socioeconomic factors (profitability of land-use types, societal impacts on neighborhoods) and environmental factors (soil, salinity, persistence of salinity). The salinity diffusion map was generated using GAMA software and employed Markov cellular automata to depict the spread of salinity under the influence of dike and sluice gate system operations. The land-use decision-making process was based on multi-criteria selection of the main factors, which were land suitability, land convertibility, density of land use in the neighborhood and profitability of land-use patterns. The input data for the case study were historical land-use maps from 2005, 2010 and 2015 of Soc Trang, a coastal province in the Mekong Delta. The model was calibrated using a land-use map from 2010 (with kappa = 0.86) and was verified with land-use maps from 2015 and 2020 with deviations from 0 to 19%. The simulated results showed that shrimp–rice farming areas have been shrinking, even though these are recommended as sustainable farming systems. Inversely, intensive rice crops tended to change to rice–vegetable crops, vegetable crops or perennial fruit trees, which are projected to be well adapted to climate and salinity intrusion by 2030. This case study shows that the developed model is an essential tool for helping land managers and farmers build land-use plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3afruits 3agates 3aland 3aland suitability 3aland use change 3amodels 3aprofitability 3arice 3ariver deltas 3asalinity 3asoil 3avegetables1 aNguyen, Thao Hong1 aTatsumi, Kenichi 1 aPham, Vu Thanh1 aTri, Van Pham Dang0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245009500183300001600278500001900294500000900313520102100322592002801343650001301371650001801384650001101402650001301413700002101426773012301447856009701570852000901667655001201676IND60663615920221118025648.0191122e196609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066361592DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1966.00021962005800050020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Richard H.10aProstrate vs. Common Dallisgrass Under Different Clipping Frequencies and Fertility Levels  ap. 521-522.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aProstrate and common daffisgrasses were fertilized with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 pounds of nitrogen per acre, and harvested every 2 or 4 weeks. Prostrate consistently produced higher forage yields than common, with the difference between varieties more marked at higher nitrogen levels and when cut every 4 weeks. Yields of both grasses were higher when cut every 4 weeks than when cut every 2 weeks, and increased with increasing rates of nitrogen, up to 400 pounds per acre. Higher yields of prostrate were due to faster growth in June, July, and August, with little difference between varieties before or after this period. Crude protein content of both grasses increased with increasing nitrogen and more frequent cutting, with no significant difference between grasses. Forty months after establishment, there were fewer weeds in prostrate dallis than in common. In view of these results, prostrate dallisgrass is recommended for light, poorly drained soils in the South when seed becomes commercially available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acrude protein 3aforage 3anitrogen1 aBurton, Glenn W.0 tAgronomy journal.g1966 Sept., v. 58, no. 5 p.521-522dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1966.00021962005800050020x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245021700166300001600383520136400399592002801763650001201791650003101803650001101834650000901845650001401854650002201868650001801890650001601908650001701924650001101941650001001952650001001962650001501972650003201987653000902019653000902028653000702037653000902044653000902053653001102062653001202073653001402085653001102099653002102110653001702131700001802148700002102166700002002187700001602207700001602223773011102239856008202350852000902432655001202441IND60086554820221116142653.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008655482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jung-Hye10aShort-term heating reduces the anti-inflammatory effects of fresh raw garlic extracts on the LPS-induced production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines by downregulating allicin activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages  ap. 545-551.  aGarlic has a variety of biologic activities, including anti-inflammatory properties. Although garlic has several biologic activities, some people dislike eating fresh raw garlic because of its strong taste and smell. Therefore, garlic formulations involving heating procedures have been developed. In this study, we investigated whether short-term heating affects the anti-inflammatory properties of garlic.Fresh and heated raw garlic extracts (FRGE and HRGE) were prepared with incubation at 25°C and 95°C, respectively, for 2h. Treatment with FRGE and HRGE significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and NO through HO-1 upregulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect was greater in FRGE than in HRGE. The allicin concentration was higher in FRGE than in HRGE. Allicin treatment showed reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO and increased HO-1 activity. The results show that the decrease in LPS-induced NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages through HO-1 induction was greater for FRGE compared with HRGE. Additionally, the results indicate that allicin is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of FRGE. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic use of allicin in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallicin 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3agarlic 3aheat 3aingestion 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3apeople 3asmell 3ataste 3atoxicology 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aFRGE 0aHRGE 0aNO 0aiNOS 0aHO-1 0aTNF-α 0aAllicin 0aCytokines 0aGarlic 0aHeme oxygenase-1 0aNitric oxide1 aRyu, Ji Hyeon1 aKang, Min-jŏng,1 aHwang, Cho Rong1 aHan, Jaehee1 aKang, Dawon0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 58 p.545-551dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245010100161520098800262592002801250650001301278650001501291650001801306650002501324650001701349700002601366700002101392700002401413700002501437700002201462700002401484700002101508700002501529700001401554700002701568700002201595700001801617700002701635700001901662773011801681856007701799852000901876655001201885IND60768401920221118153334.0220225e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076840192DNAL7 a10.3390/land110202982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuch, Roger F.10aConterminous United States Land-Cover Change (1985–2016): New Insights from Annual Time Series  aSample-based estimates augmented by complete coverage land-cover maps were used to estimate area and describe patterns of annual land-cover change across the conterminous United States (CONUS) between 1985 and 2016. Most of the CONUS land cover remained stable in terms of net class change over this time, but a substantial gross change dynamic was captured by the annual and cumulative time intervals. The dominant types of changes can be grouped into natural resource cycles, increases in urbanization, and surface-water dynamics. The annual estimates over the 30-year time series showed a reduction in the rate of urban expansion after 2006, new growth in cropland after 2007, but a net overall decline in cropland since 1985, and two eras of net tree cover loss, the first one early in the time series and the second starting in 2012. Our study provides a holistic assessment of the CONUS land-cover conversion (class) change and can serve as a new benchmark for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aland cover 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3aurbanization1 aWellington, Danika F.1 aTaylor, Janis L.1 aStehman, Stephen V.1 aTollerud, Heather J.1 aBrown, Jesslyn F.1 aLoveland, Thomas R.1 aPengra, Bruce W.1 aHorton, Josephine A.1 aZhu, Zhe 1 aMidekisa, Alemayehu A.1 aSayler, Kristi L.1 aXian, George 1 aBarber, Christopher P.1 aReker, Ryan R.0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010000168520139000268592002801658650002301686650001001709650002801719650001301747650001701760650001801777650001101795650002201806650001301828650001901841700003001860700003401890700002701924700002901951700003101980700003502011700002802046700003002074700002402104700003402128700003502162700002902197700002302226700003002249700002702279773012202306856007502428852000902503655001202512IND60763534720221120175739.0220120e20220114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076353472DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140203582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Bruna Leal Lima10aFood Insecurity and Associated Factors in Brazilian Undergraduates during the COVID-19 Pandemic  aUndergraduates may face challenges to assure food security, related to economic and mental distress, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess food insecurity and its associated factors in undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to February 2021 with 4775 undergraduates from all Brazilian regions. The questionnaire contained socio-economic variables, the validated Brazilian food insecurity scale, and the ESQUADA scale to assess diet quality. The median age of the students was 22.0 years, and 48.0% reported income decreasing with the pandemic. Food insecurity was present in 38.6% of the students, 4.5% with severe food insecurity and 7.7% moderate. Logistic regressions showed students with brown and black skin color/race presented the highest OR for food insecurity; both income and weight increase or reduction during the pandemic was also associated with a higher OR for food insecurity, and better diet quality was associated with decreased OR for food insecurity. Our study showed a considerable presence of food insecurity in undergraduates. Policy for this population must be directed to the most vulnerable: those with brown and black skin color/race, who changed income during the pandemic, and those presented with difficulties maintaining weight and with poor diet quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acolor 3across-sectional studies 3adistress 3afood quality 3afood security 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3aquestionnaires1 aLyra, Clélia de Oliveira1 aGomes, Jéssica Raissa Carlos1 aRolim, Priscilla Moura1 aGorgulho, Bartira Mendes1 aNogueira, Patrícia Simone1 aRodrigues, Paulo Rogério Melo1 ada Silva, Tiago Feitosa1 aMartins, Fernanda Andrade1 aDalamaria, Tatiane 1 aSantos, Thanise Sabrina Souza1 aHöfelmann, Doroteia Aparecida1 aCrispim, Sandra Patricia1 aSlater, Betzabeth 1 aRamalho, Alanderson Alves1 aMarchioni, Dirce Maria0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 14, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140203583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012000162520174400282592002802026650001202054650002002066650001402086650001002100650001502110650002602125650001902151650000902170650001502179650001302194651001002207700002502217700002802242700003102270700001802301700002202319773013002341856007402471852000902545655001202554IND60750087620221122080931.0210910e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008762DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131735252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavallo, Carmela 10aContinuous Monitoring of the Flooding Dynamics in the Albufera Wetland (Spain) by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Datasets  aSatellite data are very useful for the continuous monitoring of ever-changing environments, such as wetlands. In this study, we investigated the use of multispectral imagery to monitor the winter evolution of land cover in the Albufera wetland (Spain), using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. With multispectral data, the frequency of observation is limited by the possible presence of clouds. To overcome this problem, the data acquired by the two missions, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, were jointly used, thus roughly halving the revisit time. The varied types of land cover were grouped into four classes: (1) open water, (2) mosaic of water, mud and vegetation, (3) bare soil and (4) vegetated soil. The automatic classification of the four classes was obtained through a rule-based method that combined the NDWI, MNDWI and NDVI indices. Point information, provided by geo-located ground pictures, was spatially extended with the help of a very high-resolution image (GeoEye-1). In this way, surfaces with known land cover were obtained and used for the validation of the classification method. The overall accuracy was found to be 0.96 and 0.98 for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively. The consistency evaluation between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 was performed in six days, in which acquisitions by both missions were available. The observed dynamics of the land cover were highly variable in space. For example, the presence of the open water condition lasted for around 60–80 days in the areas closest to the Albufera lake and progressively decreased towards the boundaries of the park. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using moderate-resolution multispectral images to monitor land cover changes in wetland environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adata collection 3aevolution 3alakes 3aland cover 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aSpain1 aPapa, Maria Nicolina1 aGargiulo, Massimiliano 1 aPalau-Salvador, Guillermo 1 aVezza, Paolo 1 aRuello, Giuseppe 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131735253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245009000199300001600289500002000305520126800325592002801593650002001621650001401641650003401655650001801689650002501707650002301732700001801755700001801773700002001791700001201811773013301823856007901956852000902035655001202044IND60744855520221118103828.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485552DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.126532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1325-888X10aSalt added to food and body mass index: A bidirectional Mendelian randomisation study  ap. 315-323.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: This study aimed to determine the causal association between salt added to food and body mass index (BMI) by integrating a summary‐level genome‐wide association study (GWAS) data. METHODS: We performed two‐sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using summary statistics of GWAS. Inverse‐variance weighted (IVW), maximum likelihood estimation, and random effect model were used to analyse the effect of salt added to food on BMI. A bidirectional MR analysis with BMI as the exposure and salt added to food as the outcome was also performed. RESULTS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the UK Biobank (n = 462 630) and a meta‐analysis of 322 154 European‐descent individuals. The IVW method estimate indicated that salt added to food was positively associated with BMI (β = 0.1416, SE = 0.0576, P = .0139). Results from maximum likelihood estimation (β = 0.1476, SE = 0.0363, P < .0001) and the random effect model (β = 0.1411, SE = 0.0572, P = .0137) were consistent with the IVW. Bidirectional MR analysis suggested that BMI did not causally affect salt added to food. CONCLUSION: Our results provided qualitative evidence supporting a causal relationship between salt intake and BMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3adietetics 3agenome-wide association study 3ameta-analysis 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models1 aWen, Xiaoxiao1 aPeng, Yaguang1 aZhao, Liancheng1 aYu, Yan0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2021 July, v. 78, no. 3 p.315-323dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3613350x1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.126533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245014000169500001400309520120800323592002801531650001201559650001501571650001701586650001001603650002701613650002001640650001401660650001501674650001401689650002501703650001201728650002001740700003701760700001901797700002601816700003401842700002301876700002901899700002701928700002201955700003101977700002102008773012002029856007502149852000902224655001202233IND60732000320221122085055.0210326e20210322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073200032DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110309032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-Gómez, Marta 10aEffects of L-Glutamine Supplementation during the Gestation of Gilts and Sows on the Offspring Development in a Traditional Swine Breed  aNAL-light  aThe use of amino acids during pregnancy, such as glutamine (Gln), seems to be a promising strategy in selected swine breeds to improve the offspring prenatal development. The main goal of the current study was to assess the development of the offspring from parity 1–3 sows of a traditional breed, which were supplemented with 1% glutamine after Day 35 of gestation, under farm conditions. A total of 486 (288 treated) piglets from 78 (46 treated) Iberian sows were used. At birth and slaughterhouse, fatty acid composition, metabolism, and mTOR pathway gene expression were analyzed. At birth, treated newborns showed greater amounts of specific amino acids in plasma, such as glutamine, asparagine, or alanine, and Σn-3 fatty acids in cellular membranes than control newborns. The expression of genes belonging to mTOR Complex 1 was also higher in treated piglets with normal birth-weight. However, these findings did not improve productive traits at birth or following periods in litters from supplemented gilts (parity 1) or sows (parities 2–3). Thus, further research is needed to properly understand the effects of prenatal glutamine supplementation, particularly in traditional swine breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aasparagine 3abirth weight 3afarms 3afatty acid composition 3agene expression 3aglutamine 3ametabolism 3apregnancy 3aprenatal development 3aprogeny 3aslaughterhouses1 aGarcía-Contreras, Consolación 1 aAstiz, Susana 1 aTorres-Rovira, Laura 1 aPesantez-Pacheco, José  Luis1 aHeras-Molina, Ana 1 aCastro Madrigal, Teresa 1 aLópez-Bote, Clemente 1 aÓvilo, Cristina 1 aGonzález-Bulnes, Antonio,1 aIsabel, Beatriz 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110309033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520184200283592002802125650001802153650002002171650002402191650001402215650002202229650002102251650001802272650002102290650001502311650001002326650001702336650001502353650002202368650002002390650001802410650001902428650002202447700001302469700002002482700001602502773008902518856008402607852000902691655001202700IND60097598920221119171800.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStieb, David M.10aAmbient air pollution, birth weight and preterm birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 100-111.  aLow birth weight and preterm birth have a substantial public health impact. Studies examining their association with outdoor air pollution were identified using searches of bibliographic databases and reference lists of relevant papers. Pooled estimates of effect were calculated, heterogeneity was quantified, meta-regression was conducted and publication bias was examined. Sixty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies reported reduced birth weight and increased odds of low birth weight in relation to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microns (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅). Effect estimates based on entire pregnancy exposure were generally largest. Pooled estimates of decrease in birth weight ranged from 11.4g (95% confidence interval −6.9–29.7) per 1ppm CO to 28.1g (11.5–44.8) per 20ppb NO₂, and pooled odds ratios for low birth weight ranged from 1.05 (0.99–1.12) per 10μg/m³ PM₂.₅ to 1.10 (1.05–1.15) per 20μg/m³ PM₁₀ based on entire pregnancy exposure. Fewer effect estimates were available for preterm birth and results were mixed. Pooled odds ratios based on 3rd trimester exposures were generally most precise, ranging from 1.04 (1.02–1.06) per 1ppm CO to 1.06 (1.03–1.11) per 20μg/m³ PM₁₀. Results were less consistent for ozone and sulfur dioxide for all outcomes. Heterogeneity between studies varied widely between pollutants and outcomes, and meta-regression suggested that heterogeneity could be partially explained by methodological differences between studies. While there is a large evidence base which is indicative of associations between CO, NO₂, PM and pregnancy outcome, variation in effects by exposure period and sources of heterogeneity between studies should be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon monoxide 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3aexposure duration 3alow birth weight 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen dioxide 3aodds ratio 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apregnancy outcome 3apremature birth 3apublic health 3asulfur dioxide 3asystematic review1 aChen, Li1 aEshoul, Maysoon1 aJudek, Stan0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 Aug., v. 117 p.100-111dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013900167520234600306592002802652650002702680650004702707650001502754650001802769650002102787650002402808650002602832650001102858650002302869650001502892650001902907650001402926650001302940650001502953650002202968650001602990650002303006650001503029651001003044651001803054700001403072700002603086700001803112700002903130700002103159700001803180773011403198856008203312852000903394655001203403IND60674121720221120171210.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067412172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarthikeyan, L.10aSimultaneous retrieval of global scale Vegetation Optical Depth, surface roughness, and soil moisture using X-band AMSR-E observations  aThe radiative transfer scheme implemented for the retrieval of soil moisture from passive microwaves is a function of scattering, polarization mixing and attenuation effects of soil and vegetation. Theses factors are usually represented by Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), vegetation scattering albedo, and surface roughness parameter, along with soil moisture. The VOD is the degree to which vegetation attenuates the microwave radiation. It has generally the dominant effect from vegetation, whereas scattering is negligible and close to zero. The surface roughness (which varies in space but not much in time) is until recently, often assumed to be a global constant. In this work, we attempted to simultaneously retrieve the VOD, the surface roughness parameter, and the soil moisture at the global scale using the Level 3 daily 0.25° X-band brightness temperatures of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor. The methodology, coined as the Simultaneous Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (SPRA), is based on the premise that the vegetation dynamics undergo slower temporal changes than the soil moisture - an assumption, which is successfully used in the past for microwave radiometric retrievals at lower frequencies. Results indicate that the SPRA produces the VOD retrievals with reduced high-frequency noise when compared to the baseline Land Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (LPRM) retrievals. This effect assisted in identifying the influence of precipitation and cropping patterns on the temporal dynamics of the VOD. Good agreement is observed between the mean SPRA VOD and canopy height data (global correlation = 0.75). The spatial patterns of surface roughness parameter agree well with the roughness product (HR map) developed using Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor based data (global correlation = 0.57). Validation of SPRA and LPRM soil moisture products with in-situ observations over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) indicated an improvement in mean ubRMSE with SPRA product (SPRA-0.11 m3/m3 and LPRM-0.18 m3/m3) and comparable mean Pearson correlations between the two products (SPRA-0.36 and LPRM-0.38). Further, a precipitation based consistency evaluation of SPRA and LPRM soil moisture retrievals indicated better skill of the SPRA product over India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth Observing System 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3aalgorithms 3acanopy height 3acropping systems 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave radiometers 3amixing 3aradiative transfer 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asalinity 3asoil water 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3aIndia 3aUnited States1 aPan, Ming1 aKonings, Alexandra G.1 aPiles, María1 aFernandez-Moran, Roberto1 aNagesh Kumar, D.1 aWood, Eric F.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 234 p.111473-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245022000170520147900390592002801869650001601897650001501913650002801928650001801956650001701974650002201991650001702013650002302030650001302053651001502066700003602081700001902117700002402136700002802160773012202188856007502310852000902385655001202394IND60763535120221120175806.0220120e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076353512DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140203612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazafindratsima, Yannick 10aObservation of Traditional Caregiver-Infant Feeding Behaviours and Porridge and Energy Intakes during One Meal to Define Key Messages for Promoting Responsive Feeding in the Amparafaravola District, Rural Madagascar  aUndernutrition is highly prevalent in young children in Madagascar and insufficient intake per meal could be one of the main causes. A cross-sectional survey of infant feeding practices including video-recorded meal observations was carried out with 101 caregiver–infant pairs in the Amparafaravola district, Northeast Madagascar. The objective was to quantify the porridge/energy intake of 9–11-month-old children and assess its association with the caregiver–infant feeding behaviours. Then, key messages for promoting responsive feeding (RF) were developed and tested through focus group discussions. The mean porridge intake was 12.8 ± 7.5 g/kg body weight (BW)/meal, corresponding to hardly one-third of the 300 kcal recommended from complementary foods for 9–11-month-old children. Analysis of meal videos suggested that mothers practiced the five positive feeding behaviours (self-feeding, responsive, active, social, and distraction), and rarely the negative ones. Only 6.9% of mothers used positive RF “very frequently”, although it was associated with higher intakes (p < 0.05), with mean intake reaching 21 g/kg BW. In focus groups, caregivers approved the six RF messages and related counselling cards. They suggested some modifications to improve their understanding, and counselling cards were revised accordingly. The long-term impact of RF-promoting card use on the meal intakes and the nutritional status of young children must now be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acaregivers 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3afocus groups 3along term effects 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3aporridge 3aMadagascar1 aRazakandrainy, Andrimampionona 1 aFortin, Sonia 1 aRalison, Charlotte 1 aMouquet-Rivier, Claire 0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140203613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168520173200249592002801981650002102009650001202030650001402042650001102056650001402067650002202081650001202103650001002115650001402125650001102139650001502150650001902165650001202184650002002196650003202216650001002248650002002258650001702278651001202295653001002307653001602317653002302333653001502356700002002371700001902391700002302410700001902433700001902452700002302471700001802494700002202512773011402534856008202648852000902730655001202739IND60674121820221120160158.0200210e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067412182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyörälä, Jiri10aVariability of wood properties using airborne and terrestrial laser scanning  aInformation on wood properties is crucial in estimating wood quality and forest biomass and thus developing the precision and sustainability of forest management and use. However, wood properties are highly variable between and within trees due to the complexity of wood formation. Therefore, tree-specific field references and spatially transferable models are required to capture the variability of wood quality and forest biomass at multiple scales, entailing high-resolution terrestrial and aerial remote sensing methods. Here, we aimed at identifying select tree traits that indicate wood properties (i.e. wood quality indicators) with a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) in an examination of 27 even-aged, managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in southern Finland. We derived the wood quality indicators from tree models sampled systematically from TLS data and built prediction models with respect to individual crown features delineated from ALS data. The models were incapable of predicting explicit branching parameters (height of the lowest dead branch R² = 0.25, maximum branch diameter R² = 0.03) but were suited to predicting stem and crown dimensions from stand, tree, and competition factors (diameter at breast height and sawlog volume R² = 0.5, and live crown base height R² = 0.4). We were able to identify the effect of canopy closure on crown longevity and stem growth, which are pivotal to the variability of several wood properties in managed forests. We discussed how the fusions of high-resolution remote sensing methods may be used to enhance sustainable management and use of natural resources in the changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3abiomass 3abranching 3acanopy 3adead wood 3aforest management 3aforests 3alidar 3alongevity 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asawlogs 3astem elongation 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awood properties 3awood quality 3aFinland 0aLidar 0aData fusion 0aPrecision forestry 0aScots pine1 aSaarinen, Ninni1 aKankare, Ville1 aCoops, Nicholas C.1 aLiang, Xinlian1 aWang, Yunsheng1 aHolopainen, Markus1 aHyyppä, Juha1 aVastaranta, Mikko0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 235 p.111474-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158520165800283592002801941650002101969650001501990650002502005650001802030651001702048700001702065700001802082700001302100773013002113856007402243852000902317655001202326IND60750088020221122080948.0210910e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008802DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131735292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Shengnan 10aImpact of Large-Scale Ocean–Atmosphere Interactions on Interannual Water Storage Changes in the Tropics and Subtropics  aSatellite observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide unique measurements of global terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes at different spatial and temporal scales. Large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions might have significant impacts on the global hydrological cycle, resulting in considerable influences on TWS changes. Quantifying the contributions of large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions to TWS changes would be beneficial to improving our understanding of water storage responses to climate variability. In the study, we investigate the impact of three major global ocean–atmosphere interactions—El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) on interannual TWS changes in the tropics and subtropics, using GRACE measurements and climate indices. Based on the least square principle, these climate indices, and the corresponding Hilbert transformations along with a linear trend, annual and semi-annual terms are fitted to the TWS time series on global 1° × 1° grids. By the fitted results, we analyze the connections between interannual TWS changes and ENSO, IOD, and AMM indices, and estimate the quantitative contributions of these climate phenomena to TWS changes. The results indicate that interannual TWS changes in the tropics and subtropics are related to ENSO, IOD, and AMM climate phenomena. The contribution of each climate phenomenon to TWS changes might vary in different regions, but in most parts of the tropics and subtropics, the ENSO contribution to TWS changes is found to be more dominant than those from IOD and AMM.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic cycle 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3awater storage 3aIndian Ocean1 aLuo, Zhicai 1 aChen, Jianli 1 aLi, Jin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131735293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007600165300001600241520152700257592002801784650002401812650002201836650001301858650001901871650000901890650001401899650003001913650001101943650001701954650001001971650000901981650002401990650002002014650001202034650000902046650001402055650001402069650003102083650002202114700001902136700001302155700001802168700001602186700001602202773008902218856008402307852000902391655001202400IND60097599120221119171844.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhiwei10aImpact of ambient temperature on children's health: A systematic review  ap. 120-131.  aChildren are vulnerable to temperature extremes. This paper aimed to review the literature regarding the relationship between ambient temperature and children's health and to propose future research directions. A literature search was conducted in February 2012 using the databases including PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science. Empirical studies regarding the impact of ambient temperature on children's mortality and morbidity were included. The existing literature indicates that very young children, especially children under one year of age, are particularly vulnerable to heat-related deaths. Hot and cold temperatures mainly affect cases of infectious diseases among children, including gastrointestinal diseases, malaria, hand, foot and mouse disease, and respiratory diseases. Pediatric allergic diseases, like eczema, are also sensitive to temperature extremes. During heat waves, the incidences of renal disease, fever and electrolyte imbalance among children increase significantly. Future research is needed to examine the balance between hot- and cold-temperature related mortality and morbidity among children; evaluate the impacts of cold spells on cause-specific mortality in children; identify the most sensitive temperature exposure and health outcomes to quantify the impact of temperature extremes on children; elucidate the possible modifiers of the temperature and children's health relationship; and project children's disease burden under different climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aburden of disease 3achildren 3aclimate change 3acold 3adatabases 3adigestive system diseases 3aeczema 3aelectrolytes 3afever 3aheat 3ainfectious diseases 3akidney diseases 3amalaria 3amice 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asystematic review1 aEtzel, Ruth A.1 aSu, Hong1 aHuang, Cunrui1 aGuo, Yuming1 aTong, Shilu0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 Aug., v. 117 p.120-131dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014200174300001600316520101400332592002801346650002301374650002001397650001901417650002201436650001201458650001801470650003301488653001101521653002901532653003701561653004001598653003301638653002801671700001601699700002701715700001901742773010001761856008701861852000901948655001201957IND60526006920221117192646.0190402e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052600692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.11.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaghshineh, Mahsa12aA green analytical method for rapid determination of pectin degree of esterification using micro sequential injection lab-on-valve system  ap. 513-520.  aA novel method for automated determination pectin degree of esterification (DE) using micro sequential injection lab-on-valve (μSI-LOV) system is developed. A face-centered central composite response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimise system parameters. A calibration graph for determination of non-esterified galacturonic acid (GalA) content in pectin solutions with linear range of 0.08–0.34% (w/v) and the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.057% (w/v) under optimal condition was achieved. The difference between concentrations (w/v, %) of total GalA and non-esterified GalA was applied to estimate DE (%) of pectin samples. Results indicated a good agreement (tstat<tcrit) and correlation (R2=0.998) between proposed automated method and the manual reference method. The current method provided precision of less than 6% RSD, (n=10) with sample throughput of 15 samples h−1.

In 2013, a drone-based airborne fluid lensing campaign conducted over the coral reef of Ofu Island, American Samoa, revealed complex 3D morphological, ecological, and bathymetric diversity at the cm-scale over a regional area. In this paper, we develop and validate supervised machine learning algorithm products tailored for accurate automated segmentation of coral reefs using airborne fluid lensing multispectral 3D imagery. Results show that airborne fluid lensing can significantly improve the accuracy of coral habitat mapping using remote sensing.The machine learning algorithm is based on multidimensional naïve-Bayes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Provided a user-selected training subset of 3D multispectral images, comprising ~1% of the total dataset, the algorithm separates living structure from nonliving structure and segments the coral reef into four distinct morphological classes – branching coral, mounding coral, basalt rock, and sand. The user-selected training data and algorithm classification results are created and verified, respectively, with sub-cm-resolution ground-truth maps, manually generated from extensive in-situ mapping, underwater gigapixel photogrammetry, and visual inspection of the 3D dataset with subject matter experts.The algorithm generates 3D cm-resolution data products such as living structure and morphology distribution for the Ofu Island coral reef ecosystem with 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. By comparison, classification of m-resolution remote sensing imagery, representative of the effective spatial resolution of commonly-used airborne and spaceborne aquatic remote sensing instruments subject to ocean wave distortion, typically produces data products with 68% accuracy. These results suggest existing methodologies may not resolve coral reef ecosystems in sufficient detail for accurate determination of percent cover of living structure and morphology breakdown.The methods presented here offer a new remote sensing approach enabling repeatable quantitative ecosystem assessment of aquatic systems, independent of ocean wave distortion and sea state. Aquatic remote sensing imagery, free from refractive distortion, appears necessary for accurate and quantitative health assessment capabilities for coral reef ecosystems at the cm-scale, over regional areas. The accurate and automated determination of percent cover and morphology distribution at cm-resolution may lead to a significantly improved understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and responses in a rapidly-changing global climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3abasalt 3aclimate 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3amultispectral imagery 3aoceans 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3asand 3awater waves 3aAmerican Samoa 0aCoral reefs 0aFluid lensing 0aSupervised machine learning 0aAirborne remote sensing 0aHabitat mapping 0aAmerican Samoa1 aInstrella, Ron0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 235 p.111475-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005200145245009400197300001800291500002000309520111200329592002801441596005901469596008401528596008401612650001501696650002201711650001401733650002001747650001201767650002501779650002001804650001301824650001901837700005201856700001401908700001401922700002001936700001901956773012601975856007902101852000902180655001202189IND60744855920221118103844.0210720e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485592DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.134102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2664-850210aNOVOWrap: An automated solution for plastid genome assembly and structure standardization  ap. 2177-2186.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlastid genomes play an important role in genomics and evolutionary biology. Next‐generation sequencing has revolutionized plastid genomic data acquisition to the point that genome assembly has become a bottleneck for widespread utilization of plastid genome data. To solve this problem, we developed an open‐source, cross‐platform tool known as, NOVOWrap, which includes both command‐line and graphical interfaces for automatically assembling plastid genomes on personal computers. With minimal inputs, settings, and user intervention, NOVOWrap can automatically assemble plastid genomes, validate results and standardize the structure using affordable computer resources. The performance of this software has been successfully benchmarked against the plastid genomes of 11 species belonging to lycopods, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. By liberating researchers from laborious and cumbersome computer manipulations and create reliable and standardized genomic data, NOVOWrap is expected to accelerate plastid genome assembly, ease the process of data exchange, and contribute to downstream analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872679cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDA19050303cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  aXDA23080204cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aecology 3aevolutionary biology 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3aplastid genome1 aXu, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9678-47721 aChen, Hao1 aYang, Jie1 aZhang, Xianchun1 aZhou, Shiliang0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2021 Aug., v. 21, no. 6 p.2177-2186dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.134103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245004500173300001400218520098700232592002801219650001701247650002201264650002301286650001901309650001501328650001101343650001601354650001501370650004401385650001601429650001401445650001001459650001601469650001101485700001901496773010301515856008501618852000901703655001201712IND60085490620221118160636.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008549062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2011.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarvalin, Cyrille10aMicrobial glucuronidation of polyphenols  ap. 43-52.  aIn a typical series of experiments, several polyphenol O-β-d-glucuronides (including human metabolites) deriving from two flavonoids (naringenin, quercetin) and several stilbenoids (trans-resveratrol, rhapontigenin, deoxyrhapontigenin) have been obtained from the aglycones or their natural glycosides (Naringenin-7-O-glucoside, rutin, piceid, rhapontin or deoxyrhapontin), in a one step biotransformation and in moderate to high yields by incubation with a Streptomyces sp. strain M52104. Regioselectively glucuronidated products have been separated by chromatographic methods, then extensively characterized by MS and NMR. In all cases glucuronidation is β-stereospecific, but not completely regioselective. When present, the 4′(para)-hydroxyl group is generally favoured, then the 7-OH-group of flavonoids (corresponding to the 3-OH of stilbenoids). Several pure O-β-d-glucuronidated derivatives, commercially not available, have been prepared in high purity by this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3abiotransformation 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3aglycosides 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3anaringenin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3arutin 3astilbenoids 3ayields1 aAzerad, Robert0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2011 Dec., v. 73, no. 1-4 p.43-52dElsevier B.V.x1381-11777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2011.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010500176300001400281520124100295592002801536650002801564650001001592650001101602650002301613650003001636650001601666650002001682650002701702650001001729651001401739651001101753651001501764653001701779653002801796653002001824653001101844653002001855653002801875700002001903773010001923856008902023852000902112655001202121IND60532870820221120030839.0190410e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053287082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMottern, Jason L.14aThe dead can talk: Museum specimens show the origins of a cryptic species used in biological control  ap. 30-39.  aThe parasitoid wasp species Cales noacki Howard (Aphelinidae) is an important biological control agent against woolly whitefly, Aleurothrixus floccosus (Aleyrodidae), in citrus-growing regions worldwide. We recently discovered two cryptic species of Cales on citrus in California: C. noacki and Cales rosei Mottern. Examination of historical biological control records is combined with a geometric morphometric analysis of fore wing shape to reconstruct aspects of the biological control history of Cales. Our analyses indicate that C. rosei is most likely descended from populations introduced from Argentina in the mid 1970s, with newly collected specimens from California clustering with Argentinian slide-mounted specimens from the original importation. Our analyses support a Chilean origin of C. noacki. Morphometrics confirms the earlier synonymy of Diaspidophilus pallidus Brèthes with C. noacki. A potential third species was imported from Brazil and Tucumán, Argentina, although it does not appear to have established in the field. The implications of these results for future studies on the bionomics of Cales and also the utility of geometric morphometric analyses for species identification and description are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleurothrixus floccosus 3aCales 3aCitrus 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3amorphometry 3aparasitic wasps 3aspecies identification 3awings 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aCalifornia 0aCales noacki 0aAleurothrixus floccosus 0aWoolly whitefly 0aCitrus 0aCryptic species 0aGeometric morphometrics1 aHeraty, John M.0 tBiological control.g2014 Apr., v. 71 p.30-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245016300207520219300370592002802563650000802591650001602599650001302615650002702628650001802655650002302673653001602696653001402712653001902726653001902745700002202764700002002786700001702806773011902823856008602942852000903028655001203037IND60715933820221120093906.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, WeiCheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9452-480610aPoroelastic theory of consolidation for a two-layer system with an upper unsaturated soil and a lower saturated soil under fully permeable boundary conditions  aSoils are naturally present in the form of stratified layers, each being distinguishable from adjacent layers by a distinctive set of hydraulic and elasticity properties. Lo et al. (2020) have recently presented a theoretical model of poroelasticity that provides a detailed description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid flow in a two-layer soil system that is made up of upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by a vertical constant surface load under semi-permeable boundary drainage conditions. Due to the existence of different moisture contents (partial and full saturations) in the upper and lower layers, excess pore fluid pressure does not exhibit a symmetric distribution with respect to depth. Therefore, an exact, analytical solution for fully permeable boundary drainage conditions cannot be determined readily by applying scaling transformations and spatial translations from our recent result even though the coupled model equations possess an invariance feature.In this paper, a well-defined boundary-value problem based on the decoupled model equations of poroelasticity generalized for a two-fluid system is rigorously formulated for a double-layer (unsaturated-saturated) soil profile that allows water drainage at both top and bottom surfaces. Using Laplace time transformation, we derive the closed-form, exact-analytical solution accounting for the intricate interaction between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in such a two-layer system. The solution takes a more complicated form than that for the semi-permeable case. Boundary drainage conditions indeed affect the development of excess pore water and air pressures along with the time evolution of total settlement. We show that when the bottom boundary of the saturated layer overlain by the unsaturated layer with a lower hydraulic conductivity is impervious, the curve describing the relationship between the depth and excess water pressure at the interface has a negative slope, whereas the slope is positive when the boundary is pervious. The total settlement in the lower saturated layer would thus achieve an equilibrium state faster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adeformation 3adrainage 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asoil profiles 3atheoretical models 0aUnsaturated 0aSaturated 0aTwo-layer soil 0aPoroelasticity1 aBorja, Ronaldo I.1 aDeng, Jiao-Hong1 aLee, Jhe-Wei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 May, v. 596 p.125700-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001600311520142800327536021101755592002801966596002901994650002302023650001302046650001602059650001702075650001802092650001502110650002402125650001202149650001002161650001102171650001202182650002002194650001402214650002102228650001302249650003202262650002402294651001302318653002302331653002402354653002002378653003002398653002002428700001902448700002102467700002002488700001702508773015002525856008502675852000902760655001202769IND60595520320221117212137.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059552032DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2018.14404742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleko, David10aSmallholder dairy cattle feeding technologies and practices in Tanzania: failures, successes, challenges and prospects for sustainability  ap. 201-213.  aIn Tanzania, milk production under smallholder farming systems is season sensitive, fluctuations of feeds in both quantity and quality being the major driver. A dry season decline in milk production of over 40% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states “Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?”. We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers’ cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.  aThe authors are grateful for a capacity building competitive grant number (RU 2015 CARP 06) provided by the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) for funding this study.  aPublisher supplied data  aRU 2015 CARP 06cRUFORUM 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aFabaceae 3acorn stover 3adairy cattle 3adairy farming 3adry season 3aextension education 3afarmers 3afeeds 3aforage 3amarkets 3amilk production 3anutrition 3aon-farm research 3apastures 3apublic-private partnerships 3asmall-scale farming 3aTanzania 0aPasture production 0aforage conservation 0afeed technology 0asmallholder dairy farming 0adairy nutrition1 aMsalya, George1 aMwilawa, Angello1 aPasape, Liliane1 aMtei, Kelvin0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 16, no. 2 p.201-213dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2018.14404743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011200159300001600271520118800287592002801475650002501503650002501528650001201553650001401565650001201579650000901591650001201600650001001612650000901622653001201631653001701643653003101660653002301691653001701714653001701731653001201748700002001760700002601780700002901806773010501835856007901940852000902019655001202028IND60478442320221116140608.0160124e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047844232DNAL7 a10.1556/AVet.2015.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasmin, Cut10aMaturation and fertilisation of sheep oocytes cultured in serum-free medium containing silk protein sericin  ap. 110-117.  aSericin is a water-soluble component of silk and has been used as a biomaterial due to its antibacterial and ultraviolet radiation-resistant properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of sericin supplementation in a maturation medium on the meiotic competence and fertilisability of sheep oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in TCM199 supplemented with sericin at various concentrations of 0 (control), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5%, either with or without bovine serum albumin (BSA). When the COCs were matured without BSA, the supplementation of 0.1% sericin significantly increased the rates of maturation to metaphase II and the total fertilisation of oocytes compared with the other concentrations of sericin. When the COCs were matured with BSA, the beneficial effects of 0.1% sericin supplementation on the maturation and fertilisation of oocytes were not observed. Our findings indicate that supplementation with 0.1% sericin during maturation culture may improve the nuclear maturation and fertilisability of sheep oocytes. Moreover, it may be possible to replace BSA with sericin in chemically defined media without the risk of disease transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3adisease transmission 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3arisk 3asericin 3asheep 3asilk 0aAlbumin 0aantioxidants 0a<i>in vitro</i> maturation 0ameiotic competence 0aovine oocyte 0asilk protein 0asericin1 aOtoi, Takeshige1 aSetiadi, Mohamad Agus1 aKarja, Ni Wayan Kurniani0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 63, no. 1 p.110-117dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-62907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAVet.2015.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011800170300001600288520150900304592002801813596006001841650002201901650001501923650001501938650001101953650001601964650002001980650001002000650000902010650001602019650001802035650001802053650004302071650005202114650001602166650001702182650001202199650001602211650000902227650001502236700002102251700002202272700001902294700002302313700002102336773013602357856008302493852000902576655001202585IND60654902920221120130502.0190920e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065490292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01636-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshihara, Shizue10aAbsorption of zinc ions dissolved from zinc oxide nanoparticles in the tobacco callus improves plant productivity  ap. 377-385.  aZinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) are soluble in water and can release Zn²⁺, an essential mineral that promotes the growth of plant cells. When ZnO NPs were administered to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samusun-NN) callus under white light irradiation, a concentration-dependent increase in weight was observed. Specifically, an increase in chlorophyll levels was triggered by blue light and induced by ZnO NPs. mRNA-seq analysis showed that during the early stages of tobacco callus exposure to ZnO NPs and white light irradiation, there was considerable fluctuation in the expression of genes related to salt stress. After 24 h, the expression of cellular component and growth-related genes also fluctuated. Analysis by RT-qPCR revealed that, after 1 day of ZnO NPs exposure, the expression levels of photosynthesis-related genes were enhanced. The Zn content of control-treated callus was 0.19 mg g⁻¹ dry weight, whereas that of callus cultured with the ZnO bulk particles (BPs), with a particle diameter of 2000 nm, was 2.59 mg g⁻¹ dry weight, and for callus cultured with ZnO NPs, with a particle diameter 34 nm, the Zn content was 3.37 mg g⁻¹ dry weight. These results indicate that ZnO particles supplied large amounts of Zn to the callus, suggesting that the smaller the particle size, the larger the surface area of particles dissolve zinc ions more efficiently and the more ions are supplied to tobacco callus cells, and resulting in an increase in plant productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  a18K19882cJapanese Society for the Promotion of Science 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabsorption 3ablue light 3acallus 3achlorophyll 3agene expression 3agenes 3aions 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalt stress 3asurface area 3atobacco 3awhite light 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aYamamoto, Kasumi1 aNakajima, Yoshino1 aTakeda, Satomi1 aKurahashi, Kensuke1 aTokumoto, Hayato0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Aug., v. 138, no. 2 p.377-385dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01636-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01159naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013100155300001800286520022500304592002800529650002300557650001700580650001100597700001700608700001900625700001600644773012800660856007200788852000900860655001200869IND60657401420221122033818.0190816e20030530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065740142DNAL7 a10.1039/b303696k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Minkee10aFacile synthesis of high quality mesoporous SBA-15 with enhanced control of the porous network connectivity and wall thickness  ap. 1340-1341.  aConvenient and commercially viable synthesis conditions are described, providing efficient and reproducible control of pore connectivity and pore wall thickness for the synthesis of high quality SBA-15 mesoporous silica.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aporous media 3asilica1 aHeo, Wonjoon1 aKleitz, Freddy1 aRyoo, Ryong0 tChemical communications.g2003 May 30, , no. 12 p.1340-1341dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b303696k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011400155300002000269520121000289592002801499650001401527650002101541650001201562650004401574650001301618700002401631700001801655700002101673700002701694700001901721773012301740856007501863852000901938655001201947IND60558305620170926000000.0161115e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830562DNAL7 a10.1021/jp309412r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing10aHydrogen-Bond and Solvent Dynamics in Transition Metal Complexes: A Combined Simulation and NMR-Investigation  ap. 14406-14415.  aSelf-assembling ligands through complementary hydrogen-bonding in the coordination sphere of a transition metal provides catalysts with unique properties for carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom formation. Their most distinguishing chemical bonding pattern is a double-hydrogen-bonded motif, which determines much of the chemical functionality. Here, we discuss the possibility of double proton transfer (DPT) along this motif using computational and experimental methods. The infrared and NMR spectral signatures for the double-hydrogen-bonded motif are analyzed. Atomistic simulations and experiments suggest that the dynamics of the catalyst is surprisingly complex and displays at least three different dynamical regimes which can be distinguished with NMR spectroscopy and analyzed from computation. The two hydrogen bonds are kept intact and in rapid tautomeric exchange down to 125 K, which provides an estimate of 5 kcal/mol for the barrier for DPT. This is confirmed by the simulations which predict 5.8 kcal/mol for double proton transfer. A mechanistic interpretation is provided and the distribution of the solvent shell surrounding the catalyst is characterized from extensive simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents1 aHäussinger, Daniel1 aGellrich, Urs1 aSeiche, Wolfgang1 aBreit, B.q(Bernhard),1 aMeuwly, Markus0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 13, v. 116, no. 49 p.14406-14415dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp309412r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100001300179245009200192300001800284506007600302520129300378592002801671506003701699650001601736650000801752650001801760650003201778650002101810650002401831650002801855650001001883650005201893650001401945650001701959650002201976700001901998700001802017700001902035773010202054856003902156852000902195655001202204IND50068927720221207092941.0130831e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006892772DNAL7 a10.1360/03wc05502doi7 aPMC70887682pmcid7 a322147102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Xu10aInhibition of BmNPV replication in Bombyx mori cell by dsRNA triggered RNA interference  ap. 1261-1266.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA interference (RNAi) causes degradation of targeted endogenous RNA in many diverse organisms. To investigate the effect of dsRNA on silkworm cells, we transfected three kinds of synthetic dsRNAs of 435 bp(Ap₁), 300 bp(Ap₂) and 399 bp(AH) in length against the various regions of BmNPV’s DNA polymerase gene and DNA helicase gene, which are indispensable for viral replication in silkworm cells by TransMessengerᵀᴹ transfection Reagent. Results indicated that in the experiment where silkworm cells were infected with wild-strain BmNPV of the three dsRNAs, Ap₂ and AH can effectively suppress the replication of virus, but Ap₁ had no effect on the inhibition of viral replication. Ap₂ and AH can reduce the infective titer of BmNPV with a peak change of approximately 3–4 logs on day 4 post-infection. The results of reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA dot blotting also indicated that the expression level of the two target genes and the quantity of viral DNA both distinctly decreased under the influence of Ap₂ or AH. Furthermore, using fluorescence microscopy we analyzed the distribution patterns of dsRNA. Our studies revealed that a majority of dsRNA was localized in the nuclear periphery discontinuously after 24 h of transfection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombyx mori 3aDNA 3aDNA helicases 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aRNA interference 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asilkworms 3atransfection 3avirus replication1 aChenggang, Zhu1 aYongfeng, Jin1 aYaozhou, Zhang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 June, v. 49, no. 12 p.1261-1266dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/03wc0550  aDNAL 7aarticle03779naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245013200202300001200334506007600346520155100422592002801973596007102001596007802072596007802150596005902228596006902287506003702356650002602393650003002419650001902449650001802468650002302486650002302509650003102532650001802563650001002581650002302591650004202614650001702656650001302673650002002686650002202706650004302728650005202771650001202823700001402835700002002849700001902869700001602888700001402904700001902918700001502937773011002952856008203062852000903144655001203153IND60675835820221207104627.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067583582DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-019-1234-52doi7 aPMC68363512pmcid7 a316991112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jiang10aIdentification of microRNAs regulated by tobacco curly shoot virus co-infection with its betasatellite in Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 130.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 21–24 nucleotide endogenous non-coding small RNAs that play important roles in plant development and defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) is a monopartite begomovirus, cause leaf curling and plant stunting symptoms in many Solanaceae plants. The betasatellite of TbCSV (TbCSB) induces more severe symptoms and enhances virus accumulation when co-infect the plants with TbCSV. METHODS: In this study, miRNAs regulated by TbCSV and TbCSB co-infection in Nicotiana benthamiana were characterized using high-throughput sequencing technology. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing analysis revealed that a total of 13 known miRNAs and 42 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed in TbCSV and TbCSB co-infected N. benthamiana plants. Several potential miRNA-targeted genes were identified through data mining and were involved in both catalytic and metabolic processes, in addition to plant defense mechanisms against virus infections according to Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. In addition, the expressions of several differentially expressed miRNAs and their miRNA-targeted gene were validated through quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) approach. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of miRNAs are identified, and their target genes, functional annotations also have been explored. Our results provide the information on N. benthamiana miRNAs and would be useful to further understand miRNA regulatory mechanisms after TbCSV and TbCSB co-infection.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 31772127cthe National Natural Science Founding of China  aXDJK2017A006cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aXDJK2017D164cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2015M572431cthe China Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aXm2015120cthe Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aTobacco curly shoot virus 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3acatalytic activity 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aleaf curling 3amicroRNA 3amixed infection 3aplant development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses1 aWu, Gentu1 aZhou, Zhongpiao1 aZhang, Jiayuan1 aLi, Mingjun1 aSun, Miao1 aJiang, Kairong1 aQing, Ling0 tVirology journal.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.130-130dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1234-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011200174300001600286520206000302592002802362650002502390650001702415650002202432650001702454650001002471650001202481650001302493650001902506650001902525650002002544650002002564650001602584650001402600650001102614650002302625650001302648650001702661650001602678650001402694650001102708650001602719650001502735650001602750700002102766700001902787700001902806773013602825856008302961852000903044655001203053IND60654903120221120113827.0190920e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065490312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01625-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanbari, Mohammad A.10aEffects of polyploidization on petal characteristics and optical properties of Impatiens walleriana (Hook.)  ap. 299-310.  aImpatiens walleriana (Hook.) (2n = 2x = 16) is a popular flowering species in the Balsaminaceae family. In order to investigate the effects of polyploidy induction in this species, shoot tip explants measuring 1.5 cm in length were treated with 0, 15, 30, and 60 μM oryzalin for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h in vitro. After conducting the flow cytometric analysis of the plantlets, it was revealed that 68.75% of the explants treated with 60 μM oryzalin for 24 h became tetraploid (2n = 4x = 32), indicating that this treatment is the most effective for tetraploidy induction. The tetraploid plants exhibited increased leaf area, leaf thickness, ovary width, pollen cell length, and stomatal size, as well as a greater number of chloroplasts within stomatal guard cells. Furthermore, tetraploid plants showed decreases in plant height, stomatal guard cell density, and number of flowers. Epidermal conical cells were enlarged by about 1.7 times in tetraploid flowers. Optical examination of petals revealed that reflection of light from the tetraploid petals was reduced among almost all spectra. Reflection was reduced in the spectral region between 350 and 400 nm, which may have occurred as a result of changes in size of the epidermal conical cells. Furthermore, the petals in the tetraploid flowers had more total anthocyanin content. The latter two observations may explain the deepening of color in tetraploid petals. The new features observed in tetraploid flowers may be useful for generating new traits in classical breeding programs. It is also possible that these changes may be caused by alterations in gene expression and protein activity and can thus be examined to identify the genetic factors associated with flowering time and flower morphology in tetraploid I. walleriana. Further investigations are needed to study the interactions between tetraploid I. walleriana and pollinators. The latter can be important for understanding the evolutionary relationship between pollinators and the polyploidy process in this plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aImpatiens walleriana 3aanthocyanins 3abreeding programs 3achloroplasts 3acolor 3acorolla 3aexplants 3aflow cytometry 3aflowering date 3agene expression 3agenetic factors 3aguard cells 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aoptical properties 3aoryzalin 3aplant height 3aplant ovary 3aplantlets 3apollen 3apollinators 3ashoot tips 3atetraploidy1 aJowkar, Abolfazl1 aSalehi, Hassan1 aZarei, Mehrnaz0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Aug., v. 138, no. 2 p.299-310dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01625-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245015700164300001600321520083200337592002801169650001901197650000901216650002601225650000901251650001901260650003101279650001701310650001301327653002701340653002601367653001701393653001801410653001601428700002501444700002801469773010301497856007601600852000901676655001201685IND60478442620221116140642.0160112e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047844262DNAL7 a10.1556/004.2015.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczubiał, Marek10aHeat shock protein 70 and nitric oxide concentrations in non-tumorous and neoplastic canine mammary tissues: preliminary results – Short communication  ap. 209-214.  aThe concentrations of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and nitric oxide ions (NO), measured as nitrite, were determined in canine mammary tumours and nontumorous mammary gland tissues. The concentrations of Hsp70 and NO were significantly higher in both benign and malignant tumours than in non-tumorous mammary tissues. Hsp70 concentration decreased with the increase in the grade of histological malignancy. A strong positive correlation was found between the concentrations of Hsp70 and NO in the benign tumours as well as in grade I and grade II malignant tumours. The results indicate that the process of neoplastic transformation in the canine mammary gland is related to a significant increase in Hsp70 and NO concentration in tumour tissues, and an interdependence between Hsp70 and nitrite ion production can be observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal tissues 3adogs 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aions 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 0aCanine mammary tumours 0aheat shock protein 70 0anitric oxide 0amammary gland 0afemale dogs1 aUrban-Chmiel, Renata1 aŁopuszyński, Wojciech0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2015 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.209-214dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-27057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.2015.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013700155300001800292520091100310592002801221650001301249650001301262650001101275651001001286700001801296700001501314700001701329773010201346856003901448852000901487655001201496IND50068927920221122232745.0130831e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006892792DNAL7 a10.1360/04wd00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRendeng, Shi10aDiscovery of the boninite series volcanic rocks in the Bangong Lake ophiolite mélange, western Tibet, and its tectonic implications  ap. 1272-1278.  aThe boninite series volcanic rocks, mainly composed of basaltic andesite, andesitic lava breccia and andesite porphyrite, were recognized for the first time in the Bangong Lake ophiolite mélange, western Tibet. These rocks have a strong boninitic affinity, with high SiO₂ (55.61%–59.23%, weight percent), MgO (6.63%–13.08%, 9.13% on average (weight percent)), Al₂O₃/TiO₂ ratios (36–54), Mg# (0.61–0.74), Ni (116 ppm on average) and Cr (354 ppm on average), low TiO₂ (0.23%–0.39%, weight percent), and strong LILEs enrichment relative to the depleted HFSEs. Cl-chondrite normalized (La/Gd)N and (Gd/Yb)N ratios of about 1.70 and 0.83, respectively, produce prominent “U-shaped” normalized REE (rare earth element) patterns. Such a close compositional affinity to boninite indicates that these volcanic rocks were formed in a forearc setting produced by the intra-oceanic subduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandesite 3achromium 3anickel 3aChina1 aJingsui, Yang1 aZhiqin, Xu1 aXuexiang, Qi0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 June, v. 49, no. 12 p.1272-1278dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wd0006  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009200176300001400268520190100282592002802183650002302211650002302234650002602257650002802283650002202311650002602333650001402359650001102373650001602384650001502400650002302415650001502438650001002453650002302463650001902486650001102505650003702516650001502553650001602568700002202584700002302606700002402629700001902653700002802672773008402700856008502784852000902869655001202878IND60083276220221118162034.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008327622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuárez-Quiroz, M.L.10aAnti-Aspergillus activity of green coffee 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid and its alkyl esters  ap. 51-56.  aThe antifungal activities of 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid (5-CQA) and of methyl, butyl, octyl, and dodecyl esters or 5-CQA, were tested on five toxigenic moulds from the Aspergillus genus (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus westerdijkiae). These mycotoxin producers' moulds may contaminate many types of food crops throughout the food chain posing serious health hazard to animals and humans. The use of chemical methods to decrease mycotoxin producer moulds contamination on food crops in the field, during storage, and/or during processing, has been proved to be efficient. In this work, the antifungal effect of 5-CQA and a homologous series of 5-CQA esters (methyl, butyl, octyl, dodecyl), was investigated using the microdilution method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC₅₀ and MIC₈₀). All molecules presented antifungal activity, and two esters showed a MIC for all fungi: octyl (MIC₅₀ ≤ 0.5–0.75 mg/mL, MIC₈₀ = 1.0–1.5 mg/mL) and dodecyl (MIC₅₀ = 0.75–1.25 mg/mL) chlorogenates. Dodecyl chlorogenate showed a MIC₈₀ (1.5 mg/mL) only for A. parasiticus. The maximum percent of growth inhibition on aspergillii was observed with octyl (78.4–92.7%) and dodecyl (54.5–83.7%) chlorogenates, being octyl chlorogenate the most potent antifungal agent. It was thus concluded that lipophilization improved the antifungal properties of 5-CQA, which increased with the ester alkyl chain length, exhibiting a cut-off effect at 8 carbons. As far as we know, it is the first report demonstrating that lipophilization may improve the antifungal activity of 5-CQA on five toxigenic moulds from the Aspergillus genus. Lipophilization would be a novel way to synthesize a new kind of antifungal agents with a good therapeutic value or a potential use as preservative in food or cosmetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus nomius 3aAspergillus ochraceus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3acosmetics 3aesters 3afield crops 3afood chain 3afood contamination 3afood crops 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3ahealth hazards 3ahumans 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycotoxins 3aquinic acid1 aAlonso Campos, A.1 aValerio Alfaro, G.1 aGonzález-Ríos, O.1 aVilleneuve, P.1 aFigueroa-Espinoza, M.C.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2013 , v. 61-62 p.51-56dElsevier Ltdx0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009900157300002000256500001900276520130800295592002801603650001101631650001901642650001401661650002101675650002401696650001401720650001901734650001301753650001701766700001401783700001501797700001401812700001501826700001601841700001601857700001601873773014501889856007402034852000902108655001202117IND60711125520221118063659.0200917e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071112552DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta06714h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yanjun13aAn artificial photosynthetic system with CO₂-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency exceeding 20%  ap. 18310-18317.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aArtificial photosynthetic systems store solar energy in chemical fuels via CO₂ reduction or renewable hydrogen evolution from water splitting. But only relatively moderate CO₂-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency (ηSTF < ca. 18%) was achieved previously even using the most active gold-based electrocatalyst for the CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR), which is much lower than the current highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH = 30%). Here, we report a strategy based on a monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electrocatalyst (npm-Ag) to increase the density of active sites while breaking the three-phase diffusion-limit length of previous membrane electrodes, improving the effective thickness of the catalyst layer from tens of nanometers to several micrometers without any polymer additive. The npm-Ag showed exceptionally selective reduction of CO₂ to CO at low overpotentials (ca. 80%@40 millivolts, ca. 100%@90–290 millivolts). The catalyst also allowed a nearly full use of the photocurrent of the state-of-the-art solar cells and gave a projected maximum ηSTF of ca. 25%. Combined with a NiFe-based O₂-evolving anode, a stable CO₂-reducing photosynthetic system with an ηSTF of ca. 20.1% was demonstrated experimentally for 28 hours in the absence of a DC/DC converter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectric current 3ahydrogen production 3ananopores 3aphotosynthesis 3apolymers 3asolar energy1 aQian, Yao1 aChen, Anqi1 aQin, Tian1 aZhang, Fan1 aTang, Hehua1 aQiu, Zetian1 aLin, Bo-Lin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 35 p.18310-18317dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta06714h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03753naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245013000206520196100336592002802297650001702325650001102342650001202353650001402365650001202379650001902391650001502410650001402425650001602439650002502455650001102480650001902491650001502510650002202525650000902547650002302556650002802579650001502607650001502622651001002637653001602647653002302663653001902686653001802705653002402723653001802747700005802765700001802823700001402841700001202855700005402867700001702921700001402938773010402952856008603056852000903142655001203151IND60715934020221120093817.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2205-492610aSeasonal variations of groundwater recharge in a small subtropical agroforestry watershed with horizontal sedimentary bedrock  aGroundwater recharge supports sustainable development for drinking water and irrigated agriculture in vast areas worldwide. Human activities and climate change (e.g., uneven precipitation) have significantly impacted groundwater dynamics. A long term monitoring and sampling campaign was conducted for the major water bodies to investigate the evolution of groundwater and its capacity to support sustainable development in a subtropical agroforestry catchment in the middle of the Sichuan Basin with horizontal sedimentary bedrock (red beds), where seasonal droughts are notable. Major hydrochemical indicators, including δD and δ¹⁸O were measured to trace the water movement. The results showed that the chemical type of shallow groundwater was Ca•Mg-HCO₃ or Ca-HCO₃, which was mainly controlled by the weathering and hydrolysis of rocks. The interaction processes in the rainy season were stronger than those in the dry season. The isotopic signature in rainwater showed distinct seasonal pattern was strengthened by the local basin climate. The isotopic signals of groundwater responding to rainfall showed that recharge cycles of shallow groundwater in the rainy season lasted approximately 45–75 days. The optimized estimation based on mixing model and chloride ion balance (CMB) showed that the rainfall recharge ratio to shallow groundwater averaged about 27.83% (4.3%–58.0%) at event scale and the annual rainfall recharge ratios averaged about 19.36% (12.2%–45.7%). Groundwater in this region was renewed rapidly, as its groundwater storage capacity could be low with horizontal sedimentary bedrock. By revealing the water chemistry dynamics of shallow groundwater in the study area, this work preliminarily identified the groundwater recharge sources and estimated the recharge ratios by rainfall in a typical hilly area with red beds, thus providing a scientific basis for further regional assessment of groundwater resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abasins 3abedrock 3achlorides 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry season 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrolysis 3airrigated farming 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asustainable development 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aChina 0aGroundwater 0aIsotopic signature 0aRecharge ratio 0aCritical zone 0aSubtropical monsoon 0aSichuan Basin1 aTang, Jialiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8006-153X1 aZhang, Xifeng1 aWang, Rui1 aZhu, Bo1 aLi, Naiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6731-95051 aLiang, Chuan1 aZhao, Pei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 May, v. 596 p.125703-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012700162300002000289520184100309592002802150650000802178650001602186650001702202650001602219650001102235650001002246650001302256650002402269650002102293650001502314650001602329650001102345650001602356650001502372650001302387650001102400700002402411700002302435773012302458856007502581852000902656655001202665IND60558305820221118035559.0161115e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830582DNAL7 a10.1021/jp30966772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenz, Stefan
A. P.10aGlycosidic Bond Cleavage in Deoxynucleotides: Effects of Solvent and the DNA Phosphate Backbone in the Computational Model  ap. 14275-14284.  aDensity functional theory (B3LYP) was employed to examine the hydrolysis of the canonical 2′-deoxynucleotides in varied environments (gas phase or water) using different computational models for the sugar residue (methyl or phosphate group at C5′) and nucleophile (water activated through full or partial proton abstraction). Regardless of the degree of nucleophile activation, our results show that key geometrical parameters along the reaction pathway are notably altered upon direct inclusion of solvent effects in the optimization routine, which leads to significant changes in the reaction energetics and better agreement with experiment. Therefore, despite the wide use of gas-phase calculations in the literature, small model computational work, as well as large-scale enzyme models, that strive to understand nucleotide deglycosylation must adequately describe the environment. Alternatively, although inclusion of the phosphate group at C5′ also affects the geometries of important stationary points, the effects cancel to yield unchanged deglycosylation barriers, and therefore smaller computational models can be used to estimate the energy associated with nucleotide deglycosylation, with the 5′ phosphate group included if full (geometric) details of the reaction are desired. Hydrogen-bonding interactions with the nucleobase can significantly reduce the barrier to deglycosylation, which supports suggestions that discrete hydrogen-bonding interactions with active-site amino acid residues can play a significant role in enzyme-catalyzed nucleobase excision. Taken together with previous studies, the present work provides vital clues about the components that must be included in future studies of the deglycosylation of isolated noncanonical nucleotides, as well as the corresponding enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLewis bases 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3aenergy 3agases 3ageometry 3aglycosidic linkages 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3amethodology 3amodels 3anucleotides 3aphosphates 3asolvents 3asugars1 aKellie, Jennifer L.1 aWetmore, Stacey D.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 13, v. 116, no. 49 p.14275-14284dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30966773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011400159300002000273500001900293520120000312592002801512650001401540650003401554650001401588700001501602700001701617700001401634700001901648700001701667700001701684700001501701700002001716700001801736700002001754773014501774856007401919852000901993655001202002IND60711125620221118063610.0200917e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071112562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta06907h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Chengliang10aNear infrared electron acceptors with a photoresponse beyond 1000 nm for highly efficient organic solar cells  ap. 18154-18161.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping near infrared (NIR) organic semiconductors is indispensable for promoting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), but addressing the trade-off between voltage and current density thus achieving high efficiency with low energy loss is still an urgent challenge. Herein, NIR acceptors (H1, H2 and H3) with a photoresponse beyond 1000 nm were developed by conjugating dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole to 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile via varied alkyl thiophene bridges. It was found that the linear outward chains in thiophene bridges could mitigate both the conformation disorder of H3 and the electronic disorder of the PBDB-T:H3 blends, which could help to form a favorable blend morphology, facilitating highly efficient photoelectric conversion in the resultant OSCs. As a result, devices based on PBDB-T:H3 achieve a high efficiency of 13.75% with a low energy loss of 0.55 eV, which is one of the highest efficiencies and the lowest energy loss among OSCs with an optoelectronic response near 1000 nm. This work provides a new design strategy towards NIR acceptors for efficient OSCs and future exploration of functional optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aelectric potential difference 3athiophene1 aLi, Yaokai1 aLiu, Yanfeng1 aLi, Yuhao1 aZhou, Guanqing1 aLi, Shuixing1 aZhu, Haiming1 aLu, Xinhui1 aZhang, Fengling1 aLi, Chang-Zhi1 aChen, Hongzheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 35 p.18154-18161dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta06907h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01097naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245006000158300001800218520022200236592002800458650002300486650002300509650001100532700001900543700001600562700001900578773012900597856007200726852000900798655001200807IND60657401720221118000511.0190816e20030612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065740172DNAL7 a10.1039/b303706a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Paul A.10aSynthesis of a model DEF-ring core of hexacyclinic acid  ap. 1560-1561.  aThe first synthesis of a DEF-ring system of hexacyclinic acid is reported.

They are adapted to harsh growth conditions and show high native phytoremediation abilities. For environmental cleanup, these species can be improved by genetic manipulation. Laccases are ligninolytic enzymes that oxidise a broad range of substrates by a radical-catalysed reaction mechanism using oxygen as the electron acceptor. Fungi of the genus Pycnoporus produce laccases with important biotechnological, industrial and environmental applications. Here we describe a successful attempt of Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated stable transformation of Nicotiana glauca, a species naturally resistant to metal-contaminated soils. The coding region of a Pycnoporus sanguineus laccase gene was fused with the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia calreticulin apoplast targeting signal and driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (2X35S). The obtained transgenic N. glauca callus cells secreted a recombinant fungal laccase into the growth medium and were capable to degrade an anthraquinone dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue R. Under phenol and cadmium stresses, the transgenic calli not only maintained their growth capacity but their relative growth rate was greater compared to callus transformed with empty vector. This work shows that stable expression of a fungal laccase in a plant species resistant to heavy metals presents a successful strategy that potentially can be used to combat combined organic and inorganic contamination.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN205315cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (MX)  aIN200818cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (MX) 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aNicotiana glauca 3aNicotiana plumbaginifolia 3aPycnoporus sanguineus 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aanthraquinones 3aapoplast 3acadmium 3acallus 3acalreticulin 3acatalytic activity 3aculture media 3adyes 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetically modified plants 3aheavy metals 3alaccase 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apromoter regions 3areaction mechanisms1 aFolch-Mallol, Jorge Luis1 aDubrovsky, Joseph G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2072-46500 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Aug., v. 138, no. 2 p.311-324dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01626-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011600166520241700282592002802699650001902727650001902746650001502765650002002780650001102800650001602811650002402827650002902851650001402880650001502894650002202909650001502931650002302946650001102969650000902980650002802989650002003017651001003037653004803047653001903095653003003114653005203144653001603196700005403212700001703266700002003283700001403303773010403317856008603421852000903507655001203516IND60715934120221120093856.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Qiong10aFuzzy multi-objective modelling for managing water-food-energy-climate change-land nexus towards sustainability  aWater, food, energy, climate change and land subsystems are closely intertwined, and play remarkable roles in regional resources management system. Quantification of connections, synergies, and tradeoffs across these subsystems is needed in a more integrated and comprehensive manner, which is challenging due to the complexities and uncertainties involved therein. This paper proposed an inexact optimization approach from a novel water-food-energy-climate change-land (WORLD) nexus perspective, which has potential to promote social-economic development, guarantee livelihood security, and achieve low-carbon target. The approach is capable of (1) helping decision makers identify optimal policy alternatives among water, land, and energy, balancing economic benefit, water supply guarantee rate, hydroelectric generation, water-land utilization, crop yield, and greenhouse gas emission, via a multi-objective non-linear optimization model; (2) providing decision makers insights into in-depth analysis of optimal water-land resources allocation strategies associated with different levels of water supply, optimistic-pessimistic attitude, and climate change and where the effort could be made towards regional sustainability; (3) dealing with fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously occurring in objective functions and constraints as well as tracking fluctuating attitudes of decision-makers. The effectiveness of proposed model was verified in a real-world case in Zhanghe Irrigation District, Hubei Province, China. The changing range of economic benefit, crop yield, energy production, and environmental impacts were obtained based on optimal water-land resources allocation under different confidence levels and risk attitudes. Results under climate change scenarios show that climate change exacerbated local water shortage, especially in RCP 8.5, which requires 4.24 × 10⁸ m³ of compensatory external water. Results also show that CO₂ emission contributed 94.9% of GHGs emission, while fertilizers application contributed to 58% of total CO₂ emission amount, calling for effective fertilizer utilization management. Compared with single objective models, proposed model performs better on providing coordinated policy solutions. The proposed approach can help manage resources in WORLD nexus system in a sustainable way, and is portable to other similar regions to promote sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adecision making 3aenergy 3afertilizers 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrology 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3arisk 3asustainable development 3awater shortages 3aChina 0aWater-food-energy-climate change-land nexus 0aSustainability 0aMulti-objective modelling 0aMe-measure fuzzy chance-constrained programming 0aUncertainty1 aZhang, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4648-58511 aWang, Youzhi1 aZhang, Xiaoxing1 aGuo, Ping0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 May, v. 596 p.125704-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014700209520188500356592002802241650001602269650001502285650001402300650001302314650002202327650002002349650001802369651001002387653004202397653002702439653003602466653003202502653003902534700002002573773010502593856008602698852000902784655001202793IND60715934220221120093857.0211017e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Jichuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0199-399410aIncentive coordination for transboundary water pollution control: The case of the middle route of China’s South-North water Transfer Project  aThe transboundary water pollution control is often complex and challenging due to the multiple jurisdictions or countries involved. However, current studies fail to comprehensively examine the issue of incentives in transboundary water pollution control, nor do they consider dynamic changes in the behavior of local actors. Multiple administrative boundaries and multiple actors are spanned in the middle route of China’s South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP-MR) making it an ideal case for applying the theory of neoliberal environmentality to examine the governance of transboundary water pollution, as it provides a lens to carefully observe how incentive coordination as a techne of neoliberal environmentality shapes the behavior of local actors to improve water quality. By constructing a baseline scenario, an eco-compensation scenario, and an incentive-coordination scenario, this paper provides a differential game modeling approach to examine and compare the behavioral differences of local actors under different scenarios, and to understand the benefits distribution mechanism under Chinese non-democratic and non-western system. The findings demonstrate that incentive coordination for transboundary water pollution control has the same political and economic roots as neoliberal environmentality. Moreover, compared to eco-compensation modeled as a leader–follower game, incentive coordination as a social planner optimization makes local actors’ interests more compatible with improving water quality, and thus is more similar to the voluntary transactions envisaged by PES. Finally, the neoliberal incentive structure constructed by incentive coordination for transboundary water pollution control can help to improve the effectiveness of water pollution control under the existing eco-compensation systems that rely on command-and-control instruments.  aPublisher supplied data 3agame theory 3agovernance 3ahydrology 3apolitics 3apollution control 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aChina 0aTransboundary water pollution control 0aIncentive coordination 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aNeoliberal environmentality 0aSouth-North Water Transfer Project1 aWebber, Michael0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 July, v. 598 p.125705-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007300155300002000228520116300248592002801411650002101439650002201460650000901482650002301491650001401514650002001528700001901548773012301567856007501690852000901765655001201774IND60558306020221118035609.0161115e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830602DNAL7 a10.1021/jp309751e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, Dan10aExtension of Brownian Dynamics for Studying Blockers of Ion Channels  ap. 14285-14294.  aWe present new Brownian dynamics techniques for studying blockers of ion channels. By treating the channel as a fixed body, simulating the blocker molecules using rigid bodies, and using an implicit water force field with explicit ions, we are able to carry out fast simulations that can be used to investigate the dynamics of block and unblock, deduce binding modes, and calculate binding affinities. We test our program using the NavAb bacterial sodium channel, whose structure was recently solved (Payandeh et al. Nature, 2011, 475, 353–358) in conjunction with the μ-conotoxin PIIIA blocker. We derive an ohmic current–voltage relationship for channel permeation, calculate potentials of mean force for blocker unbinding, and deduce multiple binding modes for the blocker. Our results are shown to be compatible with other computational and experimental results. Finally, we discuss future improvements such as the inclusion of flexible side chains. After these improvements are carried out, we anticipate our program will be an extremely useful new tool that could be used to help develop new drugs to treat a range of ion-channel related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3achemical elements 3aions 3amolecular dynamics 3anew drugs 3asodium channels1 aChung, Shin-Ho0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 13, v. 116, no. 49 p.14285-14294dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp309751e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245020100172300001400373520084800387592002801235650000801263650002701271650002101298650002001319650001801339650000901357650003001366650001401396650002201410650001401432650002101446700002101467700001901488700002601507700002101533700002101554700001601575700002101591700002401612773008501636856008501721852000901806655001201815IND60083276520221118161657.0141101e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008327652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2013.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRees, D.G.

Based on endogenous growth theory, the study focuses on FDI, R&D, and human capital as important factors for sustained economic growth; the interactions among factors are set as the main variables affecting economic growth (GDP). In particular, this study attempts a two-step empirical analysis. First, data mining and semantic network analysis (SNA) are performed using variables as keywords; reliability and realism are reflected as variables. Second, using the vector error correction model (VECM), the study analyzes short and long run mutual influences between variables. The results show that, in data mining and SNA with FDI and R&D as keywords, words related to human capital show high frequency, centrality, and clustering. This finding implies that FDIHC and RDHHC have robustness as variables and can be used as interaction variables. According to the VECM results, FDIHC and RDHHC have positive influences on GDP in the short and long run. The results of a variance decomposition test show that RDHHC has strong mid- to long-run impacts on GDP, FDIHC, and R&D itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aforeign direct investment 3ahuman capital 3amodels 3asustainable development 3avariance0 tSustainability.g2018 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100620633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245014300204300001200347506007600359520152400435592002801959596005701987506003702044650001202081650001502093650001702108650002202125650001502147650001902162650001502181650004302196650001802239650001102257650001602268650001302284650002802297650001502325650001902340650004102359650002302400650002102423650002902444650002902473650000902502700002102511700005802532773010702590856008202697852000902779655001202788IND60675836320221207111424.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067583632DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-019-0514-92doi7 aPMC68366592pmcid7 a317198342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRende, Umut10aTwo-step derivatization for determination of sugar phosphates in plants by combined reversed phase chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sugar phosphates are important intermediates of central carbon metabolism in biological systems, with roles in glycolysis, the pentose–phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and many other biosynthesis pathways. Understanding central carbon metabolism requires a simple, robust and comprehensive analytical method. However, sugar phosphates are notoriously difficult to analyze by traditional reversed phase liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Here, we show a two-step derivatization of sugar phosphates by methoxylamine and propionic acid anhydride after chloroform/methanol (3:7) extraction from Populus leaf and developing wood that improves separation, identification and quantification of sugar phosphates by ultra high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS). Standard curves of authentic sugar phosphates were generated for concentrations from pg to ng/μl with a correlation coefficient R² > 0.99. The method showed high sensitivity and repeatability with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 20% based on repeated extraction, derivatization and detection. The analytical accuracy for Populus leaf extracts, determined by a two-level spiking approach of selected metabolites, was 79–107%. CONCLUSION: The results show the reliability of combined reversed phase liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for sugar phosphate analysis and demonstrate the presence of two unknown sugar phosphates in Populus extracts.  aPublisher supplied data  aKAW 2011.02.12cKnut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPopulus 3aanhydrides 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon metabolism 3achloroform 3aderivatization 3aglycolysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aphosphates 3apropionic acid 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3astandard deviation 3asugar phosphates 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3awood1 aNiittylä, Totte1 aMoritz, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4258-31900 tPlant methods.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.127-127dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0514-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001400276520125600290592002801546650005601574650002701630650001601657650001001673650001001683650003701693650002201730650002701752650001301779650002401792650001001816650001201826651001001838700001601848700001301864700001601877700001401893700001701907700001601924700001401940700001301954700001901967773008501986856008502071852000902156655001202165IND60083276820221118161736.0141101e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008327682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2013.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jiexiong10aMolecular epidemiology of PRRSV in South China from 2007 to 2011 based on the genetic analysis of ORF5  ap. 30-36.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has proven to be highly genetically variable; however, comprehensive information regarding the virus's genetic diversity in South China is limited. In this study, a total of 3199 clinical samples were collected from 267 pig farms suspected of PRRSV infection between 2007 and 2011. The ORF5 genes of 51 PRRSV-positive samples were sequenced and analyzed. The 51 study strains were divided into three primary subgenotypes. Fourty-five of the strains belonged to subgenotype I and were closely related to the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains. The subgenotype I strains were generally clustered into genetically similar groups by year. Only one of the strains belonged to subgenotype II, clustering with the classical North American type, VR2332. Five of the strains were grouped into subgenotype III, which occupied a separate branch and was closely related to the recently isolated novel field strains, QYYZ and GM2. The 5 subgenotype III strains shared an amino acid identity with the remaining 46 study strains ranging from 79.6%–83.6%. Amino acid analysis showed extensive mutations in subgenotype III; the diverse genetic mutations of these novel strains are of great concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3afarms 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3amolecular epidemiology 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 3aswine 3aviruses 3aChina1 aZhu, Wanjun1 aChen, Ye1 aWei, Chunya1 aZhou, Pei1 aZhang, Minze1 aHuang, Zhen1 aSun, Long1 aSu, Shuo1 aZhang, Guihong0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2013 Oct., v. 63 p.30-36dElsevier Ltdx0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2013.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245008600181300001800267500001900285520156300304592002801867650001801895650001801913650001401931650001301945650001401958650001001972650002101982650001502003650001602018650003102034650001102065650001502076650001602091650001902107700003102126700002402157700006702181700003102248773012402279856008202403852000902485655001202494IND60711209320221120061440.0200918e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071120932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-020-02511-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvestre-De-León, Robinzon10aBiocatalytic Degradation of Proteins and Starch of Extruded Whole Chickpea Flours  ap. 1703-1716.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the effects of extrusion cooking of whole chickpea flour in preparation for its further hydrolyses with proteases and amylases were evaluated. The thermoplastic extrusion process was carried out varying processing moisture (15.6% or 22.55%), final barrel temperature (143°C or 150 °C), and screw speed (450 rpm, 580 rpm, or 700 rpm) to generate three specific mechanical energy (SME) inputs (127.95 Wh/kg, 161.58 Wh/kg, and 199.13 Wh/kg). After extrusion, flours were hydrolyzed with alcalase and α-amylase in order to maximize soluble compounds after hydration. In general, extrusion did not affect chemical composition but caused structural modifications that influenced functional properties and in vitro protein and starch digestibilities. Extruded chickpea flours presented higher content of soluble proteins and increased starch hydrolysis after alcalase and α-amylase treatment, respectively. It was found that extrusion treatment of chickpea with a SME input of 127.95 Wh/kg produced at 22.5% processing moisture, 150 °C of final temperature, and 580 rpm of screw speed in combination with the later alcalase/α-amylase treatments achieved the highest degree of starch hydrolysis (84%) and the release of both soluble proteins (70%) and total soluble solids (62%). These results suggest that amylolytic and proteolytic digestion combined with the extrusion process could transform the whole chickpea flour into a valuable soluble food ingredient with adequate contents of proteins and starch-derived dextrins and sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abioprocessing 3achickpeas 3adextrins 3aextrusion 3aflour 3afood composition 3ahydrolysis 3aproteolysis 3aspecific mechanical energy 3astarch 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 3athermoplastics1 aEspinosa-Ramírez, Johanan1 aHeredia-Olea, Erick1 aPérez-Carrillo, Esther1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2636-62811 aSerna-Saldívar, Sergio O.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2020 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.1703-1716dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-020-02511-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04417naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005400188245012200242300001200364506007600376520220300452592002802655596005902683596014402742596014202886596007503028506003703103650002703140650002803167650001203195650001503207650001703222650003903239650002103278650002203299650001603321650002103337650002103358650001003379650001503389650002903404650001803433650001003451700001603461700001803477700001503495700001503510700001703525700001603542700001803558700001603576700001303592773010703605856008203712852000903794655001203803IND60675836420221207111422.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067583642DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-019-0513-x2doi7 aPMC68365022pmcid7 a317198352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3043-985012aA novel strategy to enhance terpenoids production using cambial meristematic cells of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f.  ap. 129.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (T. wilfordii) is an important medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-tumor activities. The main bioactive ingredients are diterpenoids and triterpenoids, such as triptolide, triptophenolide and celastrol. However, the production of terpenoids from original plants, hairy roots and dedifferentiated cells (DDCs) are not satisfactory for clinical applications. To find a new way to further improve the production of terpenoids, we established a new culture system of cambial meristematic cells (CMCs) with stem cell-like properties, which had strong vigor and high efficiency to produce large amounts of terpenoids of T. wilfordii. RESULTS: CMCs of T. wilfordii were isolated and cultured for the first time. CMCs were characterized consistent with stem cell identities based on their physiological and molecular analysis, including morphology of CMCs, hypersensitivity to zeocin, thin cell wall and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis, combination of transcriptional data analysis. After induction with methyl jasmonate (MJ), the maximal production of triptolide, celastrol and triptophenolide in CMCs was 312%, 400% and 327% higher than that of control group, respectively. As for medium, MJ-induced CMCs secreted 231% triptolide and 130% triptophenolide at the maximum level into medium higher than that of control group. Maximal celastrol production of induced CMCs medium was 48% lower than that of control group. Long-term induction significantly enhanced the production of terpenoids both in cells and medium. The reason for increasing the yield of terpenoids was that expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) were upregulated in CMCs after induction. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, CMCs of T. wilfordii were isolated, cultured, characterized and applied. Considering the significant enrichment of terpenoids in CMCs of T. wilfordii, CMCs could provide an efficient and controllable platform for sustainable production of terpenoids, which can be a better choice than DDCs.  aPublisher supplied data  a81773830cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKZ201710025022cBeijing Natural Science Foundation Program and Scientific Research Key Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education  aCIT&TCD20170324cThe Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan to W.G  anocThe National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3aantineoplastic activity 3acambium 3acell walls 3aditerpenoids 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunosuppression 3aingredients 3amedicinal plants 3amethyl jasmonate 3aroots 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3atriterpenoids 3avigor1 aChen, Shang1 aWang, Xiujuan1 aZhang, Rui1 aTu, Lichan1 aHu, Tianyuan1 aLiu, Xihong1 aZhang, Yifeng1 aHuang, Luqi1 aGao, Wei0 tPlant methods.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.129-129dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0513-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011400173300001600287520127100303592002801574650001801602650002001620650000901640650001401649650002001663650002401683650002701707650001301734650001301747650002501760650001301785650001901798650005201817650001301869650001501882650002201897650001501919651001401934651001101948651001001959651001101969700002101980700001702001700006702018773013602085856008302221852000902304655001202313IND60654903820221120113922.0190920e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065490382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01618-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAminedi, Raghavendra10aHigh efficiency in planta transformation of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) based on spraying of floral buds  ap. 229-237.  aBrassica juncea (Indian mustard) and its sub-varieties include whole range of oilseed and vegetable mustard in China, Canada, Australia, Europe and other regions of the world. Application of genomics in varietal improvement of this crop has been limited in the past. Recently, published genome sequence has generated enormous amount of sequence information and set the stage for high-throughput functional genomics in this crop. However, high efficiency transformation has always been elusive and a major constraint in genetic improvement of this crop. Here, we report a method for high frequency in planta transformation of Indian mustard based on floral spray of Agrobacterium suspension. Successful genetic transformation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription quantitative PCR and assay for the reporter gene expression. The transformation efficiency was scored by PCR based analysis of transgene integration and expression in T₁ plants. Transformation efficiency varied depending on the genotype, light conditions during co-cultivation and age of the experimental plant material. This method being simple and highly reproducible will be immensely beneficial for functional genomics and transgenic development programme in B. juncea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aBrassica juncea 3abuds 3acoculture 3agene expression 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic transformation 3agenomics 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3aoilseeds 3areporter genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspraying 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3avegetables 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aChina 3aEurope1 aDhatwalia, Deepa1 aJain, Varsha1 aBhattacharya, Ramcharan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6274-06430 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Aug., v. 138, no. 2 p.229-237dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01618-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245008800179300001400267520136000281592002801641650002301669650003001692650001101722650001501733650001701748650002001765650001601785653001001801653003301811653002301844653001101867653002301878700002401901773010001925856008902025852000902114655001202123IND60532871920221122050110.0190410e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053287192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoitberg, Bernard D.10aNatural enemies on the landscape – Integrating life-history theory and landscapes  ap. 39-47.  aThe relationship between patch exploitation by individual parasitoids and landscape levels of control by such parasitoids is complex and not well understood. Here we build on a classic concept of the structure function as a way of describing the landscape of a biological control agent from the agent’s perspective. We include such structure functions into patch exploitation theory as way of connecting the two aforementioned levels. An important feature is that for any given focal individual, its resource-specific structure functions can differ dramatically in the environment; we explain how one might employ multivariate functions into our theory. Further, rather than employ these functions in a strictly descriptive manner we embed them in state-dependent life history. Parasitoid states include, eggload, energy state, mass and their impacts on the Darwinian fitness from patch exploitation. When taken together, our approach allows us to determine optimal exploitation decisions for agents across various landscapes and more importantly, to predict response of biocontrol agents to changes in landscape as a function of changes in agricultural practices. Finally, we show how these optimal decisions can be used to calculate pest-killing rates for biological control agents, and ultimately to facilitate the selection and management of agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aenergy 3alandscapes 3alife history 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 0aModel 0aState dependent life history 0aPatch exploitation 0aTheory 0aStructure function1 aGillespie, David R.0 tBiological control.g2014 Aug., v. 75 p.39-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169520204400281592002802325650001302353650001402366650002302380650002702403650002002430650002002450650001702470650001402487650001302501653001902514653001802533653002302551653000702574653003002581700001802611700001402629700001802643700001602661700001702677700005702694773011402751856008602865852000902951655001202960IND60782182420221120063951.0220816e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078218242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Bingying10aHigh-efficiency recycling method for Mo and Ni from spent catalyst via soda roasting and solvent extraction  aThe catalyst Mo–Ni/Al₂O₃ is commonly used in the hydrodesulfurization of petroleum fractions. The catalyst is discarded when its catalytic activity does not meet the requirement of the process, and the spent catalyst is usually classified as hazardous waste due to its significant heavy-metal content. The spent catalyst usually has a high commercial recovery value as a secondary resource for high-value metals, but the simple and high efficiency recovery method is still lacking. A high-efficiency recovery method for Mo and Ni from spent Mo–Ni/Al₂O₃ catalyst via soda roasting and solvent extraction was developed in this study. MoO₃ interacts with Al₂O₃ and forms a new phase, Al₂(MoO₄)₃, during blank roasting at 600–700 °C. Al₂(MoO₄)₃ further transforms into NaMoO₄ during soda roasting at 950 °C, and over 99.1% of Mo can be leached using hot water (60 °C). Solvent extraction with the trioctyl tertiary amine (N235) is employed to separate Mo from the leaching solution, and approximately 99.45% of Mo can be enriched through single-stage extraction. Around 99.2% of Mo can be stripped from loaded N235 using 8 M NH₃•H₂O. Further, PO₄³⁻ and SiO₃²⁻ can be removed from the stripping solution using Mg(NO₃)₂, and Mo is recycled in the form of MoO₃, i.e., a product of the ammonium precipitation and calcining process. Over 99.3% of Ni can be leached from the solid residue using 30% volume fraction of H₂SO₄ and the solvent extraction can be enriched using diiso-octylphosphate (DP). Ni is finally recycled from the stripping solution as NiSO₄•2H₂O via evaporative crystallization. The total Mo and Ni recovery efficiencies of the newly developed integrated approach are 97.8% and 98.1%, respectively. Al is also recycled in the form of α-Al₂O₃ via chemical precipitation and calcination. The proposed approach is simple, with a high recovery rate and high selectivity, and can be applied to the recycling and disposal of spent Mo–Ni/Al₂O₃ catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical precipitation 3acrystallization 3ahazardous waste 3aheavy metals 3apetroleum 3asolvents 0aSpent catalyst 0aSoda-roasting 0aSolvent extraction 0aMo 0aRecycling valuable metals1 aJiang, Haohao1 aZeng, Man1 aPeng, Mingguo1 aHu, Linchao1 aZhang, Wenyi1 aMao, Linqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3406-59240 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 367 p.132976-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011000171300001800281500001900299520152100318592002801839596007501867596007501942596007502017650001802092650001502110650001802125650000902143650001202152650002702164650000902191650002502200700006502225773012402290856008202414852000902496655001202505IND60711209720221120052225.0200918e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071120972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-020-02519-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidotto, Danilo C.10aImpact of Dry Heating in an Alkaline Environment on the Structure and Foaming Properties of Whey Proteins  ap. 1755-1764.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDry heating (DH) in an alkaline environment has been proposed as a treatment that can improve some techno-functional properties of whey proteins, such as their water-holding capacity and gelling properties. Nevertheless, information concerning the impact of DH in an alkaline environment on the foaming properties of whey proteins is not available in the literature. In this context, lyophilized whey protein isolate (WPI) powders with and without added lactose were submitted to DH treatments (60 and 80 °C) under neutral and alkaline environments for 48 h. Even without DH, the alkaline environment induced the formation of insoluble protein aggregates stabilized by disulfide and non-disulfide covalent interactions. The amount of insoluble protein aggregates enhanced with the increase in the intensity of DH. No insoluble aggregates were observed for samples produced in a neutral environment. Furthermore, no difference in the apparent secondary structure of the proteins in the soluble fraction of neutral or alkaline equivalent samples could be evidenced. In addition, the intensity of the population of soluble protein aggregates rose by increasing the intensity of DH treatment; however, it was comparable between neutral and alkaline equivalent samples. DH in an alkaline environment at 80 °C for 48 h significantly enhanced the stability of the foams produced by the soluble fraction of lactose-added samples, corroborating its potential to improve useful techno-functional properties of whey proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/09304-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/09214-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/03822-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3abioprocessing 3adisulfides 3afreeze drying 3aheat 3alactose 3awater holding capacity 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate1 aTavares, Guilherme M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4015-11080 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2020 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.1755-1764dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-020-02519-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166300001600288520134800304592002801652650003701680650001401717650001301731650002001744650001301764650002101777650002901798650001401827650001801841650001301859650001101872650001601883650001801899653002101917653002401938653001801962653001101980653002501991700001302016700001302029700001602042700001902058700001502077773011402092856008502206852000902291655001202300IND60610727620221122072249.0180829e20170605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061072762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun10aRelease of hydrogen sulfide during microwave pyrolysis of sewage sludge: Effect of operating parameters and mechanism  ap. 117-122.  aThe effects of sludge characteristics, pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and catalysts on the release of H2S and mechanism of H2S formation during sludge pyrolysis were investigated in a microwave heating reactor (MHR). The evolution of sulfur-containing compounds in the pyrolysis chars obtained at temperature range of 400–800°C was characterized by XPS. For a given temperature, the maximum concentration of H2S appeared at moisture content of 80%. Compared to the influence of heating rate on the H2S yields, pyrolysis temperature and catalyst played a more significant role on the release of H2S during microwave pyrolysis process. The H2S concentration increased with increasing temperature from 400°C to 800°C while decreased with increasing heating rate. Both the Nickel-based catalyst and Dolomite displayed significant desulfurization effect and Ni-based catalyst exhibited the larger desulfurization capability than that of Dolomite. The organic sulfur compounds accounted for about 60% of the total sulfur in the sludge which was the main reason for the formation of H2S. The mechanism analysis indicated that the cleavage reactions of mercaptan and aromatic-S compounds at temperatures below 600°C and the cracking reaction of sulfate above 700°C respectively were responsible for the H2S release during sludge pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acracking 3adesulfurization 3adolomite 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atemperature 3awater content 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aMicrowave pyrolysis 0aSewage sludge 0aEffect 0aOperating parameters1 aZuo, Wei1 aTian, Yu1 aYin, Linlin1 aGong, Zhenlong1 aZhang, Jie0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 June 05, v. 331 p.117-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245017600174520163100350592002801981650004902009650001002058650002202068650001502090650001502105650001902120650001502139650002202154650002402176650001102200650002002211653003002231653002102261653002602282653002602308700001402334700001702348700001702365700001702382700001902399700001902418700001302437700001302450700001602463773009102479856009002570852000902660655001202669IND60761726620221119100811.0220214e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076172662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1334312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jiangfu10aUltrafast photodegradation of nitenpyram by Ag/Ag3PO4/Zn–Al LDH composites activated by persulfate system: Removal efficiency, degradation pathway and reaction mechanism  aIn this study, an investigation is conducted into the degradation of nitenpyram (NTP) using highly efficient APMMO/PDS/Vis system. As photocatalysts, silver phosphate (AP) and calcined Zn–Al layered double hydroxides (MMO) exhibit high efficiency in achieving charge separation. Besides, the injection of electrons into peroxydisulfate (PDS) from the APMMO can contribute to obtaining the species in the active state with higher efficiency. Based on the APMMO/PDS/Vis system, 50 mg/L of nitenpyram (NTP, 50 mL) can be completely removed in 60 min using 0.8 g/L photocatalyst and 0.2 g/L PDS under the optimum condition and visible light (780 nm > λ > 420 nm). Meanwhile, as demonstrated under visible light within 30 min, an ultrahigh degradation efficiency can be achieved by NTP based on APMMO1/PDS/Vis system. Besides, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique and radical quenching experiments suggested ¹O₂, h⁺, SO₄⁻•, •O₂⁻, and •OH are all contributory to the removal of pollutants. Given the outcomes achieved by LC/MS system and mass spectrometry, the primary degradation intermediates of NTP end up being converted into photodegradation products (such as 2-Chloropyridine, 6-Chloropurine Riboside and dl-Leucine). Additionally, there are three potential photodegradation pathways to NTP degradation have been deployed. Moreover, the NTP light degradation occurring in APMMO1/PDS/Vis system is competent under the three types of real water sample. Accordingly, the high-efficiency APMMO1/PDS/Vis system is fit for use in water pollution control for agricultural productions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3alight 3amass spectrometry 3anitenpyram 3aphosphates 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollution control 3areaction mechanisms 3asilver 3awater pollution 0aLayered double hydroxides 0aSilver phosphate 0aPersulfate activation 0aCatalytic degradation1 aLi, Wenbo1 aTang, Rongdi1 aXiong, Sheng1 aGong, Daoxin1 aDeng, Yaocheng1 aZhou, Zhanpeng1 aLi, Ling1 aSu, Long1 aYang, Lihua0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 292 p.133431-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1334313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245016300193300001600356520166800372592002802040650001302068650004302081650001402124650001902138650002202157650001302179650001402192650001702206650002702223650003502250650001202285650005202297650002102349650001902370650002002389650002202409650001302431650001702444650002402461650003602485650002302521651001102544700002202555700002802577773010802605856004802713852000902761655001202770IND50061782020221120220911.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006178202DNAL7 a229452682pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-012-1968-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrascaroli, Elisabetta10aGenetic diversity analysis of elite European maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines using AFLP, SSR, and SNP markers reveals ascertainment bias for a subset of SNPs  ap. 133-141.  aRecent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have triggered a shift toward single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A systematic bias can be introduced if SNPs are ascertained in a small panel of genotypes and then used for characterizing a larger population (ascertainment bias). With the objective of evaluating a potential ascertainment bias of the Illumina MaizeSNP50 array with respect to elite European maize dent and flint inbred lines, we compared the genetic diversity among these materials based on 731 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), 186 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 41,434 SNPs of the MaizeSNP50 array (SNP-A), and two subsets of it, i.e., 30,068 Panzea (SNP-P) and 11,366 Syngenta markers (SNP-S). We evaluated the bias effects on major allele frequency, allele number, gene diversity, modified Roger’s distance (MRD), and on molecular variance (AMOVA). We revealed ascertainment bias in SNP-A, compared to AFLPs and SSRs. It affected especially European flint lines analyzed with markers (SNP-S) specifically developed to maximize differences among North American dent germplasm. The bias affected all genetic parameters, but did not substantially alter the relative distances between inbred lines within groups. For these reasons, we conclude that the SNP markers of the MaizeSNP50 array can be employed for breeding purposes in the investigated material. However, attention should be paid in case of comparisons between genotypes belonging to different heterotic groups. In this case, it is advisable to prefer a marker subset with potentially low ascertainment bias, like in our case the SNP-P marker set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3adent corn 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainbred lines 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAlleles 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHybrid Vigor 2aModels, Statistical 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aEurope1 aSchrag, Tobias A.1 aMelchinger, Albrecht E.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2013 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.133-141dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-012-1968-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009800211520168300309592002801992650001902020650000802039650001202047650002502059650001302084650002102097650001102118650002502129650001802154650001902172650001602191650001802207650001502225650001502240653002002255653001502275653002402290653002102314653001602335700002202351700006602373700002502439700002102464700001802485773011402503856008602617852000902703655001202712IND60782182920221120054600.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078218292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Md Sazan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6843-328112aA study on heat and mass transfer through vegetated porous concrete for environmental control  aPorous concrete is an alternative building material that allows for air and water circulation, while exhibiting adequate compressive strength suitable for infrastructure. In this study, a novel vegetation-covered bio-receptive porous concrete prototype was tested for its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit control capacity using water as the energy transferring medium. Energy-transferring coils allowing waterflow were placed evenly in a cylindrical-shaped porous concrete cast that upon hardening, was sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and hydroponically grown for 60 days. The vegetation-covered porous concrete cylinder was connected with air duct followed by three centrifugal fans while performing heating, cooling, humidification, and dehumidification tests to determine heat and mass transfer capacity. Maximum possible heating and cooling heat transfer were 238.8 ± 4.1 W and −116.65 ± 7.99 W, respectively. Maximum possible humidification and dehumidification mass transfer was 3.42 ± 0.34 g kg⁻¹, and -9.04 ± 0.9 g kg⁻¹, respectively. Vegetated porous concrete showed passive dehumidification of −4.57 ± 0.22 g kg⁻¹ without requiring any external energy. The zero-energy dehumidification capacity of vegetated porous concrete supports the tendency of a green biomass layer in neutralizing the extreme air properties. Results illustrate a new application in green infrastructure for this permeable building material by demonstrating the capacity of vegetated porous concrete in HVAC control, showing potential in green wall applications as a environmentally controlled plant growing-substrate for hydroponics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aair 3abiomass 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3adehumidification 3aenergy 3agreen infrastructure 3aheat transfer 3ahumidification 3ahydroponics 3amass transfer 3aprototypes 3awater flow 0aPorous concrete 0aVegetation 0aTemperature control 0aHumidity control 0aHVAC system1 aMacPherson, Sarah1 aAkbarzadeh, Abdolhamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0097-03411 aGuérini, Alexandre,1 aChapelat, Julien1 aLefsrud, Mark0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132984-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013500165300001200300520120500312592002801517596005901545596006101604596004001665650002101705650002901726650002201755650001601777650001201793650001301805650001601818650001201834650002301846650000701869650001401876650001401890650002001904650001401924650001901938650001101957650001101968700001601979700003201995700002002027700001902047700005702066773014302123856008202266852000902348655001202357IND60654904220221120113856.0190817e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065490422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-019-2698-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaro, Gabriel10aTrk1, the sole potassium-specific transporter in Candida glabrata, contributes to the proper functioning of various cell processes  ap. 124.  aCandida glabrata is a haploid yeast that is considered to be an emergent pathogen since it is the second most prevalent cause of candidiasis. Contrary to most yeasts, this species carries only one plasma membrane potassium transporter named CgTrk1. We show in this work that the activity of this transporter is regulated at the posttranslational level, and thus Trk1 contributes to potassium uptake under very different external cation concentrations. In addition to its function in potassium uptake, we report a diversity of physiological effects related to this transporter. CgTRK1 contributes to proper cell size, intracellular pH and membrane-potential homeostasis when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, lithium influx experiments performed both in C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae indicate that the salt tolerance phenotype linked to CgTrk1 can be related to a high capacity to discriminate between potassium and lithium (or sodium) during the transport process. In summary, we show that CgTRK1 exerts a diversity of pleiotropic physiological roles and we propose that the corresponding protein may be an attractive pharmacological target for the development of new antifungal drugs.  aPublisher supplied data  aXXcPlan Propio Investigación, University of Córdoba  aXXIIcPlan Propio Investigación, University of Córdoba  a16-03398ScCzech Science Foundation 3aCandida glabrata 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantifungal agents 3acandidiasis 3acations 3ahaploidy 3ahomeostasis 3alithium 3amembrane potential 3apH 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3ayeasts1 aBieber, Jan1 aRuiz-Castilla, Francisco J.1 aMichán, Carmen1 aSychrova, Hana1 aRamos, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9797-15610 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.124-124dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2698-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245003500161520126200196592002801458650001301486650001501499650002201514650001201536653002401548653002001572653001701592653001801609773011501627856007601742852000901818655001201827IND60727288620221120200555.0210210e20201230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072728862DNAL7 a10.3897/rio.6.e623692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirillo, Marco10aRing-first Mitral Valve Repair  aMitral valve repair is one of the most frequent interventions in cardiac surgery. It involves eliminating the dysfunctional part(s) of the mitral valve and reconstructing, using the residual tissue or with the addition of prosthetic components, a properly functioning valve, without residual stenosis or regurgitation. A fundamental component of mitral repair is the implantation of a ring (annuloplasty) which reconstitutes the normal, saddle-shaped geometry of the valve. Such ring is usually implanted at the end of the surgical reconstruction regardless of the repair techniques. The implantation of the ring can however change the final anatomy of the valve in an unexpected way and therefore force new corrective surgical actions. We therefore propose a research project that plans the execution of annuloplasty as the first surgical step and then the correction of the valvular disease affecting the leaflets and chordae. The sizing of the ring is always performed on parts of the valve that are usually not changed during the reconstructive surgery, therefore it is possible to decide its size before surgically correcting the valve. In this way we could act on the leaflets and chordae in the definitive geometrical arrangement of the mitral valve.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3aprostheses 3aresearch projects 3asurgery 0aMitral valve repair 0acardiac surgery 0aannuloplasty 0achordal flail0 tResearch Ideas and Outcomes.g2020 Dec. 30, v. 6 p.e62369-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27349x2367-71637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e623693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006200155245009300217520194700310592002802257650001802285650001802303650002302321650001502344650002302359650001502382650002902397650001502426650000902441650002002450650002002470650001402490650001302504653001902517653002302536700002602559700006102585700002002646700002602666700006002692773009102752856009002843852000902933655001202942IND60761726720221119100729.0220214e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076172672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1334322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Ana Rita R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0689-639X10aMixture toxicity prediction of substances from different origin sources in Daphnia magna  aDue to several anthropogenic activities, water bodies have been heavily impacted by contaminants identified in aquatic ecosystems, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, agricultural and industrial chemicals. Risk assessment based on chemical mixtures is still default in many monitoring studies, with decisions being based solely on a chemical-by-chemical basis. The present study aimed to improve risk assessment procedures in water bodies by focusing on mixtures of chemical substances of different origins. The goal was to analyze potential interactions occurring at different complexity levels (binary and quaternary mixtures) using standardised toxicity assays. Mixture toxicity effects were assessed using Daphnia magna as the model organism and the compounds sodium fluoride, boric acid, ammonium hydroxide and acetaminophen as general representatives of contaminants in the aquatic ecosystem. The results revealed interactions between the compounds, mainly showing antagonism but also dose level and dose ratio-dependent deviations. Overall antagonism was the dominant deviation pattern, particularly at low doses, though synergism was also detected at higher doses or specific ratios. Synergism at low doses was found for the binary mixture of ammonium hydroxide and acetaminophen, two common pollutants, which denotes an enhanced risk to aquatic ecosystems. Independent Action provided more accurate predictions for the quaternary mixture, whereas Concentration Addition overestimated the toxicity of the mixture. Regarding the environmental risk assessment of water bodies, the interaction between chemicals in a mixture should not be neglected. The complexity of the mixture interactions found in the present study highlights the importance of complementing chemical screenings of water bodies with mixture toxicity data, particularly when considering chemicals of multiple origins whose joint action remains unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacetaminophen 3aammonium hydroxide 3aantagonism 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aboric acid 3aenvironmental assessment 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asodium fluoride 3asynergism 3atoxicity 0aBinary mixture 0aQuaternary mixture1 aGonçalves, Sandra F.1 aPavlaki, Maria D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3078-79271 aMorgado, Rui G.1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aLoureiro, Susana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5393-96230 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 292 p.133432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1334323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012900165300001400294520203100308592002802339650001602367650002002383650001302403650000902416650001402425650001402439650002702453650001502480650001202495650001502507650003702522650001702559650001902576650002002595650001902615651001002634700001302644700001202657700001302669773008702682856008402769852000902853655001202862IND60097595520221119173608.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2011.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerera, F.10aEffects of prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure and environmental tobacco smoke on child IQ in a Chinese cohort  ap. 40-46.  aOBJECTIVE: This study of a birth cohort in the city of Tongliang in Chongqing, China, evaluated the relationship between two prenatal exposures (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAH) and environmental tobacco smoke(ETS)) and child intelligence quotient (IQ) as measured by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at age 5 years. A coal-fired power plant was the major source of ambient PAH in this city. We tested the hypothesis that, after adjusting for potential confounders, prenatal exposure to these pollutants would be associated with lower IQ scores at 5 years of age. METHODS: Nonsmoking mothers and children were enrolled before delivery. PAH exposure was measured by DNA adducts in umbilical cord white blood cells using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Fluorescence. Estimated exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was based on personal interview. At age 5 years, scores for verbal, performance, and full scale IQ were obtained. Multiple regression was used to test the main effects of adducts and environmental tobacco smoke on IQ and to explore the interactions between these exposures on IQ. Results: after adjusting for potential confounders, neither DNA adducts nor exposure to environmental tobacco smoke had significant main effects on IQ. However, significant interactions between adducts and environmental tobacco smoke were observed on full scale (p=0.025) and verbal (p=0.029) IQ scores, indicating that the adverse effects of prenatal PAH exposure became greater as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increased. The interaction on performance IQ score was not significant (p=0.135). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that exposure of pregnant women to emissions of PAHs from the coal-burning plant, in combination with prenatal exposure to envrionmental tobacco smoke, may have adversely affected cognitive function of children at age 5. The polluting coal-fired plant has since been closed by the government, with likely important benefits to child health and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA adducts 3aadverse effects 3achildren 3acoal 3acognition 3aemissions 3aenvironmental exposure 3aleukocytes 3amothers 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apower plants 3apregnant women 3asmoking (habit) 3aumbilical cord 3aChina1 aLi, T.Y.1 aLin, C.1 aTang, D.0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 Apr., v. 114 p.40-46dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2011.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009400160520154900254592002801803650002801831650002501859650001201884650001401896650002301910650001301933650001701946650001401963650001201977650001301989650001402002650005202016700002502068700001902093700003102112700002302143700002802166700002102194773012202215856007502337852000902412655001202421IND60763531620221118063735.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076353162DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140202322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuriato, Gaia 10aCapsaicin and Its Effect on Exercise Performance, Fatigue and Inflammation after Exercise  aCapsaicin (CAP) activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV₁) channel on sensory neurons, improving ATP production, vascular function, fatigue resistance, and thus exercise performance. However, the underlying mechanisms of CAP-induced ergogenic effects and fatigue-resistance, remain elusive. To evaluate the potential anti-fatigue effects of CAP, 10 young healthy males performed constant-load cycling exercise time to exhaustion (TTE) trials (85% maximal work rate) after ingestion of placebo (PL; fiber) or CAP capsules in a blinded, counterbalanced, crossover design, while cardiorespiratory responses were monitored. Fatigue was assessed with the interpolated twitch technique, pre-post exercise, during isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were detected in cardiorespiratory responses and self-reported fatigue (RPE scale) during the time trial or in TTE (375 ± 26 and 327 ± 36 s, respectively). CAP attenuated the reduction in potentiated twitch (PL: −52 ± 6 vs. CAP: −42 ± 11%, p = 0.037), and tended to attenuate the decline in maximal relaxation rate (PL: −47 ± 33 vs. CAP: −29 ± 68%, p = 0.057), but not maximal rate of force development, MVC, or voluntary muscle activation. Thus, CAP might attenuate neuromuscular fatigue through alterations in afferent signaling or neuromuscular relaxation kinetics, perhaps mediated via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) pumps, thereby increasing the rate of Ca²⁺ reuptake and relaxation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aathletic performance 3acalcium 3acapsaicin 3across-over studies 3aexercise 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3amuscles 3aplacebos 3areticulum 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels1 aVenturelli, Massimo 1 aMatias, Alexs 1 aSoares, Edgard M.

In the present work, these forces were measured using a force sensor embedded in the walls of a vibrating tub finisher loaded with various amounts of steel media and subject to different vibration frequencies. It was found that wall-media contact forces increased with the depth of media above the sensor and with the normal wall velocity, which explained why wall forces remained approximately unchanged with varying media mass, but increased with increasing tub frequency. The average impulse of the wall on the media increased with increasing media mass and decreased with increasing frequency of vibration. The work done by the walls was also measured and was found to increase with increasing tub frequency for a fixed media mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3apowders 3asteel 3avibration 0aVibratory finishing 0aForce measurement 0aVibrated granular media 0aWall forces 0aVibrational fluidization1 aSpelt, Jan K.0 tPowder technology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 360 p.911-920dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.10.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014500162300001600307520131600323592002801639650000901667650003101676650003101707650001701738650000901755650002101764650001001785650001401795650001801809650001501827650002701842650003601869650003601905650002401941650001101965650000901976650001201985650002701997650001802024650002702042650000902069650001602078650002502094650001502119653002602134653001502160653003302175653002702208653002602235700001702261700001702278700001802295700001802313700001802331700001802349700002002367773011102387856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60086552020221116142848.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008655202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Namki10aCognitive-enhancing effects of Rhus verniciflua bark extract and its active flavonoids with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities  ap. 355-361.  aThe neuroprotective potential of flavonoids within the brain comprises anti-apoptosis of neuronal cells, anti-neuroinflammation and enhancement of cognitive function. We reported that Rhus vernciflua inhibits glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured rat cortical cells. Here we narrowed it down to get neuroprotective fractions from the plant yielding flavonoid-rich ethyl acetate fraction (PREF). Among its active flavonoids, fisetin exhibited not only inhibitory effect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 but also memory enhancing effects via reactivation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)–brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway in memory-impaired mice by scopolamine. Butein also showed a similar activity to fisetin even though to a lesser extent. The neuroprotection by PREF and selected flavonoids may involve maintenance of antioxidant defense mechanism including glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Conclusively, we demonstrate the R. vernciflua bark extract and its active flavonoids with potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects might be good therapeutic candidates as cognitive-enhancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhus 3aToxicodendron vernicifluum 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abark 3abinding proteins 3abrain 3acognition 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3alipopolysaccharides 3amemory 3amice 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3ascopolamine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 0aRhus verniciflua bark 0aFlavonoids 0aCognitive-enhancing activity 0aAnti-neuroinflammation 0aCREB–BDNF signaling1 aLee, Ki Yong1 aHuh, Jungmoo1 aChoi, Ji Hoon1 aYang, Heejung1 aJeong, Eun Ju1 aKim, Hong Pyo1 aSung, Sang Hyun0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 58 p.355-361dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013600164520218200300592002802482650002302510650002802533650001102561650001002572650001802582650002302600650001102623650002502634650002102659650001102680650001502691650002002706650001902726650001002745700002002755700001802775700002102793700001702814700002002831700002202851773013002873856007403003852000903077655001203086IND60750085220221120084432.0210910e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008522DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131735032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Roberto 10aComparing Interpretation of High-Resolution Aerial Imagery by Humans and Artificial Intelligence to Detect an Invasive Tree Species  aTimely, accurate maps of invasive plant species are critical for making appropriate management decisions to eliminate emerging target populations or contain infestations. High-resolution aerial imagery is routinely used to map, monitor, and detect invasive plant populations. While conventional image interpretation involving human analysts is straightforward, it can require high demands for time and resources to produce useful intelligence. We compared the performance of human analysts with a custom Retinanet-based deep convolutional neural network (DNN) for detecting individual miconia (Miconia calvescens DC) plants, using high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery collected over lowland tropical forests in Hawai’i. Human analysts (n = 38) examined imagery at three linear scrolling speeds (100, 200 and 300 px/s), achieving miconia detection recalls of 74 ± 3%, 60 ± 3%, and 50 ± 3%, respectively. The DNN achieved 83 ± 3% recall and completed the image analysis in 1% of the time of the fastest scrolling speed tested. Human analysts could discriminate large miconia leaf clusters better than isolated individual leaves, while the DNN detection efficacy was independent of leaf cluster size. Optically, the contrast in the red and green color channels and all three (i.e., red, green, and blue) signal to clutter ratios (SCR) were significant factors for human detection, while only the red channel contrast, and the red and green SCRs were significant factors for the DNN. A linear cost analysis estimated the operational use of a DNN to be more cost effective than human photo interpretation when the cumulative search area exceeds a minimum area. For invasive species like miconia, which can stochastically spread propagules across thousands of ha, the DNN provides a more efficient option for detecting incipient, immature miconia across large expanses of forested canopy. Increasing operational capacity for large-scale surveillance with a DNN-based image analysis workflow can provide more rapid comprehension of invasive plant abundance and distribution in forested watersheds and may become strategically vital to containing these invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiconia calvescens 3aartificial intelligence 3acanopy 3acolor 3acost analysis 3acost effectiveness 3ahumans 3aimage interpretation 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3atrees1 aPerroy, Ryan L.1 aLeary, James 1 aJenkins, Daniel 1 aPanoff, Max 1 aMandel, Travis 1 aPérez, Patricia,0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131735033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245009300217300001400310506007600324520178700400592002802187506003702215650002502252650001602277650001302293650002402306650001202330650001102342650001502353650001102368650001202379650001702391650001502408650000902423650002202432650001202454651001202466700003102478700002902509700002402538700002002562700001802582773008702600856008402687852000902771655001202780IND60097595720221207104045.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.0072doi7 aPMC33192892pmcid7 a224059962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuarez-Lopez, Jose R.10aLower acetylcholinesterase activity among children living with flower plantation workers  ap. 53-59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Children of workers exposed to pesticides are at risk of secondary pesticide exposure. We evaluated the potential for lower acetylcholinesterase activity in children cohabiting with fresh-cut flower plantation workers, which would be expected from organophosphate and carbamate insecticide exposure. Parental home surveys were performed and acetylcholinesterase activity was measured in 277 children aged 4–9 years in the Secondary Exposure to Pesticides among Infants, Children and Adolescents (ESPINA) study. Participants lived in a rural county in Ecuador with substantial flower plantation activity. RESULTS: Mean acetylcholinesterase activity was 3.14U/ml, standard deviation (SD) of 0.49. It was lower by 0.09U/ml (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.19, −0.001) in children of flower workers (57% of participants) than non-flower workers’ children, after adjustment for gender, age, height-for-age, hemoglobin concentration, income, pesticide use within household lot, pesticide use by contiguous neighbors, examination date and residence distance to nearest flower plantation. Using a 4 level polychotomous acetylcholinesterase activity dependent variable, flower worker cohabitation (vs. not) had odds ratio 3.39 (95% CI 1.19, 9.64) for being <15th percentile compared to the highest tertile. Children cohabitating for ≥5 years (vs. never) had OR of 4.11 (95% CI: 1.17, 14.38) of AChE activity within <15th percentile compared to the highest tertile. CONCLUSIONS: Cohabitation with a flower worker was related to lower acetylcholinesterase activity in children. This supports the hypothesis that the amount of take-home pesticides from flower workers suffices to decrease acetylcholinesterase activity, with lower activity associated with longer exposure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aadolescents 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3aflowers 3agender 3ahemoglobin 3aincome 3ainfants 3ainsecticides 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3asecondary contact 3asurveys 3aEcuador1 aJacobs, David R., Jr.cJr.1 aHimes, J.

The layered structure of clay minerals, however, may adsorb cations and may, thus, interfere with the ruminants’ supply of essential trace metals, such as Zn, Mn, Cu, and Fe. As quantitative knowledge about interactions between clay ingestion and essential trace metal metabolism are largely lacking, this in vitro study focussed on the effect of clay on the solubility of dietary Zn and other bivalent trace metals in the digestive tract of ruminants. Therefore, buffered rumen fluid was used for the simulation of ruminal conditions (RC), acidified rumen fluid (pH 2) was used for abomasal conditions (AC), and duodenal chyme was used for duodenal conditions (DC). These media were added with gradient levels of zinc and incubated at 39 °C for 24 h in the absence or presence of clay minerals. Soluble Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe were derived by centrifugation (10,000× g) of incubated media, and the supernatants were analysed. Clay depressed the solubility of added Zn in ruminal (65.3% vs. 16.5%), abomasal (97.7% vs. 33.7%), and duodenal conditions (41.3% vs. 21.1%), the results of which were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Moreover, clay reduced dissolved Cu (µg/mL) (RC: 0.13 vs. 0.10; AC: 0.16 vs. 0.13; DC: 0.10 vs. 0.08) and Mn (µg/mL) (RC: 3.00 vs. 1.80; AC: 5.53 vs. 4.80; DC: 3.18 vs. 1.77) (p < 0.05 in all cases). The presence of clay minerals increased the concentrations of solubilised Fe (µg/mL) in abomasal (1.80 vs. 2.86, p < 0.05) and duodenal conditions (1.76 vs. 2.67; p < 0.05). In total, the present in vitro study demonstrates the potential of clay minerals ingested with ruminant feeds for depressing the solubility of dietary Zn, as well as the depression of dietary Cu and Mn along the passage of the digesta from the rumen until the duodenum. Additionally, clay minerals may release Fe into the digesta.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3aclay 3adigesta 3adigestive tract 3aduodenum 3ageophagia 3ametabolism 3apH 3aruminants 3asoil 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3azinc1 aBuffler, Marzell 1 aWindisch, Wilhelm 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245008200155300001800237500002000255520188000275592002802155596005602183650006002239650001802299650001402317650001202331650001402343650001002357650001102367650002302378650001002401650001302411700002802424700006302452700001502515700005702530773012202587856007202709852000902781655001202790IND60744852720221118102400.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485272DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.35532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoo, Min Yi10aDiversity and origins of giant guitarfish and wedgefish products in Singapore  ap. 1636-1649.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGiant guitarfishes (Glaucostegidae) and wedgefishes (Rhinidae) are some of the most threatened marine taxa in the world, with 15 of the 16 known species exhibiting global population declines and categorized as Critically Endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. The recent inclusion of all species in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) necessitates more rigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities. Challenges in regulating the trade of giant guitarfish and wedgefish products due to difficulties in visual identification of processed products and labelling issues impede enforcement. The aim of this study is to characterize the diversity and origins of associated traded products that were commercially available in Singapore, one of the world's top importers and re‐exporters of shark and ray products. A total of 176 samples of elasmobranch products were obtained between June and December 2019 from fishery ports and various retailers in Singapore. By applying cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene barcoding, 31 elasmobranch species were detected, with 55% of the species considered threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) based on the IUCN Red List and 35% of species listed in CITES Appendix II. Four species of giant guitarfishes and wedgefishes were commercially available to consumers in fresh forms of whole fish, fillet, and fin, as well as dried and cooked meats. DNA barcoding has proven to be an effective tool for identifying elasmobranch products that are impossible to recognize visually and would aid enforcement of CITES trade regulations. This work underscores the urgent need to step up enforcement of marine wildlife regulations and draw public attention to the elasmobranch trade.  aPublisher supplied data  aMSRDP‐P03cNational Research Foundation Singapore 3aConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species 3aDNA barcoding 3aSingapore 3afillets 3afisheries 3agenes 3asharks 3athreatened species 3atrade 3awildlife1 aChoy, Christina Pei Pei1 aIp, Yin Cheong Aden1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9472-11611 aRao, Madhu1 aHuang, Danwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3365-55830 tAquatic conservation.g2021 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1636-1649dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.35533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245015800201300001800359500002000377520223200397592002802629596005102657596004602708596004702754596004902801596006402850650002002914650003502934650001502969650001302984650003002997650001503027650001403042650002203056650001303078650001403091650000903105650002703114650002203141650001403163650001903177650002403196650002503220650001103245650001203256650001003268651001303278700002103291773012203312856007203434852000903506655001203515IND60744852820221118102428.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485282DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.35102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCall, Brittany L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3225-140810aConservation genetic assessment of the paleback darter, Etheostoma pallididorsum, a narrowly distributed endemic in the Ouachita Highlands, Arkansas, USA  ap. 1817-1830.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe paleback darter, Etheostoma pallididorsum, is considered imperilled and has recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Previous allozyme‐based studies found evidence of a small effective population size, warranting conservation concern. The objective of this study was to assess the population dynamics and the phylogeographical history of the paleback darter, using a multilocus microsatellite approach and mitochondrial DNA. The predictions of this study were that: paleback darter populations will exhibit low genetic diversity and minimal gene flow; population structure will correspond to the river systems from which the samples are derived; reservoir dams impounding the reaches between the Caddo and Ouachita rivers would serve as effective barriers to gene flow; and the Caddo and Ouachita rivers are reciprocally monophyletic. Microsatellite DNA loci revealed significant structure among sampled localities (global Fₛₜ = 0.17, P < 0.001), with evidence of two distinct populations representing the Caddo and Ouachita rivers. However, Bayesian phylogeographical analyses resulted in three distinct clades: Caddo River, Ouachita River, and Mazarn Creek. Divergence from the most recent ancestor shared among the river drainages was estimated at 60 Kya. Population genetic diversity was relatively low (Hₑ = 0.65; mean alleles per locus, A = 6.26), but was comparable with the population genetic diversity found in the close relatives slackwater darter, Etheostoma boschungi (Hₑ = 0.65; A = 6.74), and Tuscumbia darter, Etheostoma tuscumbia (Hₑ = 0.57; A = 5.53). These results have conservation implications for paleback darter populations and can be informative for other headwater specialist species. Like other headwater species with population structuring and relatively low genetic diversity, the persistence of paleback darter populations is likely to be tied to the persistence and connectivity of local breeding and non‐breeding habitat. These results do not raise conservation concern for a population decline; however, the restricted distribution and endemic status of the species still renders paleback darter populations vulnerable to extirpation or extinction.  aPublisher supplied data  aAR‐T‐60cArkansas Game and Fish Commission  aDUE‐156954cNational Science Foundation  aDBI‐1561743cNational Science Foundation  cArkansas Center for Biodiversity Collections  cArkansas State University Department of Biological Sciences 3aBayesian theory 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aEtheostoma 3aancestry 3aeffective population size 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3amonophyly 3aphylogeography 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3astreams 3awater 3aArkansas1 aFluker, Brook L.0 tAquatic conservation.g2021 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1817-1830dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.35103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245003600164300001600200520060000216592002800816650001500844650002500859650000900884650001200893650001100905650001200916650001700928773012500945856007901070852000901149655001201158IND60300800220221120203927.0150703e20121116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030080022DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12311692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoy, Ronald R.10aConvergent Evolution of Hearing  ap. 894-895.  aHow do human ears work?

In this method, the extraction was implemented by ultrasonic‐assisted extraction for 30 min with disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid‐McIlvaine buffer (pH 5) containing 6% sodium chloride w/v, purified by thin‐film microextraction and combined with 96‐well plate system to improve the efficiency. Optimization of thin‐film microextraction conditions was performed by methods of single factor and response surface, and finalized as: condition time: 20 min; adsorption time: 55 min; washing time: 5 s with water; desorption time: 30 min with acetonitrile/water (8:2, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid v/v. Evaluation of different extractive phases showed that polystyrene‐divinylbenzene‐polyacrylonitrile was the optimum coating. The analysis was performed by ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Recovery, inter‐ and intraday precision, linearity, limit of detection, and quantitation were evaluated. The average recoveries of 18 antibiotics were 66.6–93.5% at three spiked levels, intraday precision was 1–8.4%, and interday precision was 3.0–16.4%. The linearity was good for r² > 0.99. Limits of detection and quantification were found in the range of 1–14 and 4–48 µg/kg, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cZhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences  aZJNY2017001cZhejiang Provincial Major Scientific Research Project for Agriculture  cInternational Cooperation item supported by Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3abuffers 3acoatings 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3afeeds 3afilms (materials) 3aformic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahigh-throughput screening methods 3amicroextraction 3apH 3asodium chloride 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awashing1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aZhao, Huiyu1 aJi, Xiaofeng1 aLi, Xiaodan1 aWang, Jianmei1 aWu, Huizhen1 aXu, Jie1 aLi, Zuguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8006-94400 tJournal of separation science.g2019 Sept., v. 42, no. 18 p.2968-2976dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2019001443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009200173300001400265520184000279592002802119650001802147650002302165650001402188650002502202650001502227650000802242650001402250650002402264650001202288650001002300773008602310856008402396852000902480655001202489IND60097596220221119172334.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeichenthal, Scott10aSelected physiological effects of ultrafine particles in acute cardiovascular morbidity  ap. 26-36.  aUltrafine particles (UFPs) have emerged as a potentially important environmental health concern as they are produced in large numbers by vehicle emissions and may contribute to previously reported associations between traffic pollution and acute cardiovascular morbidity. This review examines recent epidemiological evidence of UFP exposures and selected physiological outcomes that may be modified as part of the underlying causal pathway(s) linking particulate air pollution and acute cardiovascular morbidity. Outcomes examined included changes in heart rate variability (HRV) (autonomic function), ST-segment depression (myocardial ischemia), QT-interval (ventricular repolarization), and endothelial vasomotor function. Twenty-two studies were reviewed in total: 10 prospective panel studies and 12 randomized cross-over studies. Sixteen studies identified a significant relationship between UFPs and at least one of the above outcomes and current evidence generally supports the biological plausibility of a relationship between UFPs and acute cardiovascular morbidity. However, discrepancies were apparent in the direction of observed associations, particularly for HRV and ventricular repolarization. Reasons for these discrepancies may include differences in particle composition, time-point of clinical evaluation, and population susceptibilities. Nevertheless, evidence to date suggests that UFPs have a measureable impact on physiological measures known to be altered in cases of acute cardiovascular morbidity. Moving forward, expanded use of personal exposure measures is recommended for prospective panel studies to minimize exposure misclassification. In addition, effort should be made to include more women in studies of the acute cardiovascular effects of UFPs as findings to date generally reflect responses in men.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3across-over studies 3aemissions 3aenvironmental health 3aheart rate 3amen 3amorbidity 3amyocardial ischemia 3atraffic 3awomen0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 May, v. 115 p.26-36dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245011200165500001400277520142400291592002801715650002001743650002901763650001601792650001301808650001201821650001501833650000901848650001501857650002401872650001301896650001201909650002301921650002101944650001001965650001301975651001201988700002102000700002002021700001502041700001602056700001502072700001702087700002502104700002702129700002302156700002602179700002402205773012002229856007502349852000902424655001202433IND60731997720221120205622.0210326e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073199772DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110308802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCremonesi, Giacomo 10aCamera Trapping to Assess Status and Composition of Mammal Communities in a Biodiversity Hotspot in Myanmar  aNAL-light  aTropical forests comprise a critically impacted habitat, and it is known that altered forests host a lower diversity of mammal communities. In this study, we investigated the mammal communities of two areas in Myanmar with similar environmental conditions but with great differences in habitat degradation and human disturbance. The main goal was to understand the status and composition of these communities in an understudied area like Myanmar at a broad scale. Using camera trap data from a three-year-long campaign and hierarchical occupancy models with a Bayesian formulation, we evaluated the biodiversity level (species richness) and different ecosystem functions (diet and body mass), as well as the occupancy values of single species as a proxy for population density. We found a lower mammal diversity in the disturbed area, with a significantly lower number of carnivores and herbivores species. Interestingly, the area did not show alteration in its functional composition. Almost all the specific roles in the community were present except for apex predators, thus suggesting that the effects of human disturbance are mainly effecting the communities highest levels. Furthermore, two species showed significantly lower occupancies in the disturbed area during all the monitoring campaigns: one with a strong pressure for bushmeat consumption and a vulnerable carnivore threatened by illegal wildlife trade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aanthropogenic activities 3abody weight 3abushmeat 3acameras 3acarnivores 3adiet 3aecosystems 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amammals 3apopulation density 3aspecies richness 3atrade 3awildlife 3aMyanmar1 aBisi, Francesco 1 aGaffi, Lorenzo 1 aZaw, Thet 1 aNaing, Hla 1 aMoe, Kyaw 1 aAung, Zarni 1 aMazzamuto, Maria  V.1 aGagliardi, Alessandra 1 aWauters, Lucas  A.1 aPreatoni, Damiano G.,1 aMartinoli, Adriano 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013100171300001600302520106300318592002801381650002701409650001201436650002001448650001701468650001901485650002001504650002801524650002801552650001501580650001701595650002601612650002801638650003601666650001501702650001201717653001701729653001701746653002001763653001401783653000901797653001201806700001701818700001701835700001701852773010001869856008701969852000902056655001202065IND60526005320221121225237.0190402e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052600532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yansheng10aContribution of polyamines metabolism and GABA shunt to chilling tolerance induced by nitric oxide in cold-stored banana fruit  ap. 333-339.  aEffect of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) on polyamines (PAs) catabolism, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, proline accumulation and chilling injury of banana fruit under cold storage was investigated. Banana fruit treated with NO sustained lower chilling injury index than the control. Notably elevated nitric oxide synthetase activity and endogenous NO level were observed in NO-treated banana fruit. PAs contents in treated fruit were significantly higher than control fruit, due to the elevated activities of arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase. NO treatment increased the activities of diamine oxidase, polyamine oxidase and glutamate decarboxylase, while reduced GABA transaminase activity to lower levels compared with control fruit, which resulted the accumulation of GABA. Besides, NO treatment upregulated proline content and significantly enhanced the ornithine aminotransferase activity. These results indicated that the chilling tolerance induced by NO treatment might be ascribed to the enhanced catabolism of PAs, GABA and proline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine decarboxylase 3abananas 3achilling injury 3acold storage 3acold tolerance 3adiamine oxidase 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aornithine-oxo-acid transaminase 3apolyamines 3aproline 0aNitric oxide 0aBanana fruit 0aChilling injury 0aPolyamine 0aGABA 0aProline1 aLuo, Zisheng1 aMao, Linchun1 aYing, Tiejin0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.333-339dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011600163520199200279592002802271650001502299650002502314650001502339650001702354650002902371651001002400700002002410700002102430700002102451700002202472700001902494700002102513700003002534700002202564700002302586700002102609773013002630856007402760852000902834655001202843IND60750085820221122060752.0210910e20210904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008582DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131735092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Giorgi, Andrea 10aMonitoring the Recovery after 2016 Hurricane Matthew in Haiti via Markovian Multitemporal Region-Based Modeling  aThe aim of this paper is to address the monitoring of the recovery phase in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew (28 September–10 October 2016) in the town of Jérémie, southwestern Haiti. This is accomplished via a novel change detection method that has been formulated, in a data fusion perspective, in terms of multitemporal supervised classification. The availability of very high resolution images provided by last-generation satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors makes this analysis promising from an application perspective and simultaneously challenging from a processing viewpoint. Indeed, pursuing such a goal requires the development of novel methodologies able to exploit the large amount of detailed information provided by this type of data. To take advantage of the temporal and spatial information associated with such images, the proposed method integrates multisensor, multisource, and contextual information. Markov random field modeling is adopted here to integrate the spatial context and the temporal correlation associated with images acquired at different dates. Moreover, the adoption of a region-based approach allows for the characterization of the geometrical structures in the images through multiple segmentation maps at different scales and times. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated on multisensor pairs of COSMO-SkyMed SAR and Pléiades optical images acquired over Jérémie, in the aftermath of and during the three years after Hurricane Matthew. The effectiveness of the change detection results is analyzed both quantitatively, through the computation of accuracy measures on a test set, and qualitatively, by visual inspection of the classification maps. The robustness of the proposed method with respect to different algorithmic choices is also assessed, and the detected changes are discussed in relation to the recovery endeavors in the area and ground-truth data collected in the field in April 2019.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahurricanes 3aprobabilistic models 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aHaiti1 aSolarna, David 1 aMoser, Gabriele 1 aTapete, Deodato 1 aCigna, Francesca 1 aBoni, Giorgio 1 aRudari, Roberto 1 aSerpico, Sebastiano Bruno1 aPisani, Anna Rita1 aMontuori, Antonio 1 aZoffoli, Simona 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 04, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131735093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04113naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245015500163520269500318592002803013650001903041650001703060650001603077650002403093650002003117650001103137650002103148650001403169650001003183650002603193650002203219650001903241650002203260650001503282650002003297650002003317650001703337700002603354700002303380700002303403700002303426773012203449856007503571852000903646655001203655IND60763532320221123024936.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076353232DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140203362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajman, Katarzyna 10aEffect of Heat-Treated Garlic (Allium sativum L.) on Growth Parameters, Plasma Lipid Profile and Histological Changes in the Ileum of Atherogenic Rats  aDietary supplementation with raw garlic has a preventive and healing effect in cardiovascular diseases, but it could also damage the intestinal mucosa, resulting in impairment of nutrient absorption. Garlic processing, including heat treatment, changes the content and biological activity of garlic, so it is crucial to find food-processing methods that will preserve the health-promoting properties of garlic while minimizing its negative impact on the digestive system. Therefore, in this study, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L.) on growth parameters, plasma lipid profile, and morphological parameters in the ileum of Wistar rats subjected to various types of heat treatment (90 s blanching garlic, 10 min boiling in water, 10 min pan frying without fat, microwave heating fresh garlic, 90 s blanching and microwave heating garlic, 10 min boiling in water and microwave heating garlic, and 10 min pan frying without fat and microwave heating garlic) was determined in an atherogenic diet (containing 1% addition of cholesterol). In the conducted research, it was found that the diet supplemented with heat-treated garlic used in the atherogenic diet improved the consumption and growth parameters of rats, depending on the type and time of its use. The highest consumption was recorded in atherogenic groups supplemented with garlic subjected to a longer (10 min) heat treatment and was then heated in a microwave oven. Garlic subjected to the shortest heat treatment proved to be most effective, and a significant improvement in the lipid profiles of rats’ plasma with atherogenic was observed. Extending the time of heat treatment of garlic and, additionally, its microwaving significantly weakened the action of garlic in the body, but still retained its hypolipidemic effect. The greatest influence on the structural changes in the mucosa of the rats’ iliac intestine, manifested by degeneration of the mucosa, shortening the length of the intestinal villi, damage to the brush border, and thus impairment of the intestinal absorption, was exerted by supplementing the atherogenic diet with garlic subjected to short-term heat treatment. Among the processes used, blanching was the least favorable, and the long-lasting thermal processes (cooking, frying for 10 min) had a positive effect on the mucosa of the rats’ intestines. The results obtained in this study confirm that the selection of an appropriate method of thermal processing of garlic may allow for the maintenance of preventive and therapeutic efficacy of garlic in cardiovascular diseases, while ensuring the safety of its long-term use in the context of degenerative changes in the gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3adietary supplements 3adigestive tract 3agarlic 3ahealth promotion 3ahistology 3aileum 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestinal mucosa 3alipemic effect 3alipid composition 3amicrovilli 3amicrowave ovens 3anutrient uptake 3atherapeutics1 aSadowska, A.q(Anna),1 aBuczak, Krzysztof 1 aLeontowicz, Hanna 1 aLeontowicz, Maria 0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140203363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006400169300001600233520238500249592002802634650001602662650001202678650002102690650002602711650001502737650002002752650002002772650002502792650001902817650001502836650002902851650002502880650002102905650001202926650000902938650001102947650001402958650001902972650001702991650001703008651001503025700002403040700005903064700001803123700002103141773015203162856008203314852000903396655001203405IND60684876420221123040543.0200226e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068487642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-019-01716-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinans, Kiara S.10aLife cycle assessment of California unsweetened almond milk  ap. 577-587.  aPURPOSE: Plant-based alternatives to dairy milk have grown in popularity over the last decade. Almond milk comprises the largest share of plant-based milk in the US market and, as with so many food products, stakeholders in the supply chain are increasingly interested in understanding the environmental impacts of its production, particularly its carbon footprint and water consumption. This study undertakes a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a California unsweetened almond milk. METHODS: The scope of this LCA includes the production of almond milk in primary packaging at the factory gate. California produces all US almonds, which are grown under irrigated conditions. Spatially resolved modeling of almond cultivation and primary data collection from one almond milk supply chain were used to develop the LCA model. While the environmental indicators of greatest interest are global warming potential (GWP) and freshwater consumption (FWC), additional impact categories from US EPA’s TRACI assessment method are also calculated. Co-products are accounted for using economic allocation, but mass-based allocation and displacement are also tested to understand the effect of co-product allocation choices on results. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The GWP and FWC of one 48 oz. (1.42 L) bottle of unsweetened almond milk are 0.71 kg CO₂e and 175 kg of water. A total of 0.39 kg CO₂e (or 55%) of the GWP is attributable to the almond milk, with the remainder attributable to packaging. Almond cultivation alone is responsible for 95% of the FWC (167 kg H₂O), because of irrigation water demand. Total primary energy consumption (TPE) is estimated at 14.8 MJ. The 48 oz. (1.42 L) PET bottle containing the almond milk is the single largest contributor to TPE (42%) and GWP (35%). Using recycled PET instead of virgin PET for the bottle considerably reduces all impact indicators except for eutrophication potential. CONCLUSIONS: For the supply chain studied here, packaging choices provide the most immediate opportunities for reducing impacts related to GWP and TPE, but would not result in a significant reduction in FWC because irrigation water for almond cultivation is the dominant consumer. To provide context for interpretation, average US dairy milk appears to have about 4.5 times the GWP and 1.8 times the FWC of the studied almond milk on a volumetric basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmond milk 3aalmonds 3acarbon footprint 3aco-product allocation 3acoproducts 3acrop production 3adata collection 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming potential 3airrigated conditions 3airrigation water 3amarkets 3amilk 3amodels 3apackaging 3aprimary energy 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3aCalifornia1 aMacadam-Somer, Ilan1 aKendall, Alissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1964-90801 aGeyer, Roland1 aMarvinney, Elias0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.577-587dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-019-01716-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245015800158520206500316592002802381650002802409650001702437650002102454650001302475650002002488650001502508651001002523700001502533700001702548700001402565773011802579856007702697852000902774655001202783IND60768399820221121024007.0220225e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076839982DNAL7 a10.3390/land110202792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Erling 10aSpin-Offs, Innovation Spillover and the Formation of Agricultural Clusters: The Case of the Vegetable Cluster in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China  aAgricultural clusters play a powerful role in promoting the agricultural transformation and rejuvenation of rural areas. However, no in-depth exploration has been made on how agricultural clusters form and evolve, especially in the context of China’s long-term small-scale rural economy. The purpose of this article is to reveal the formation process and evolution mechanism of agricultural clusters by case study research. With the knowledge flow as the starting point, this article takes the Vegetable Cluster in Shouguang City of Shandong Province, China as an example to construct a theoretical framework in the three dimensions of points (spin-offs of enterprises or farmers), lines (network-spillovers of various innovation) and planes (the formation of new regional industry spaces) and put forward theoretical hypotheses. It is shown that: (1) The local spin-off of seed farmers is the main path in the transformation of traditional farmers into enterprises. (2) The network-spillover and adoption of innovative knowledge promote the derivation of specialized farmers or enterprises and realize regional agricultural specialization and spatial agglomeration. (3) The formation of the agricultural cluster resulted from the joint effects of spin-off derived from the entrepreneurial spirit of the farmers, network-spillover of various agricultural innovations and spatial integration of the agricultural landscape. The formation of local agricultural innovation systems marks the maturity of an agricultural cluster. This article contribute to the field by studying one source of Alfred Marshall’s knowledge of external economy from the perspective of spin-offs and innovative spillovers, analyzing the agricultural increasing returns to scale neglected by Krugman, and exploring the micro mechanism of farmers’ enterprise-oriented evolution and the formation of agricultural clusters in underdeveloped rural areas. The research results are of profound referential significance for the cultivation of agricultural clusters in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural landscapes 3acase studies 3aentrepreneurship 3aindustry 3arural economics 3avegetables 3aChina1 aXu, Yanan 1 aRen, Shixin 1 aLee, Jay 0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 11, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017100165300002000336500001900356520203000375592002802405650001502433650001102448650002502459650001402484650001502498650001902513650001402532650001302546650002002559650001202579650002002591650001002611650001402621650002002635650002102655650001402676650002002690650000902710650001302719650001702732700002102749700002102770700002502791700002802816700001902844773016902863856008203032852000903114655001203123IND60696418820221117160425.0200524e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069641882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08565-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwad, Ashraf10aProtective potency of Astragalus polysaccharides against tilmicosin- induced cardiac injury via targeting oxidative stress and cell apoptosis-encoding pathways in rat  ap. 20861-20875.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTilmicosin (Til) was purposed to be used in the treatment of a wide range of respiratory diseases in livestock. However, undesirable adverse effects, cardiac toxicity, in particular, may be associated with Til therapy. In the present study, the response of adult rats administered Til subcutaneously at different doses (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg b.w.; single injection) was evaluated. Astragalus polysaccharide (AP) at two doses (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w.; intraperitoneally) was investigated for its potential to counteract the cardiac influences, involving the oxidative stress-induced damage and apoptotic cell death, elicited by the Til treatment at a dose of 75 mg/kg b.w. in rats. Til induced mortalities and altered the levels of the biomarkers for the cardiac damage, particularly in the rats treated with the doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg b.w.; similarly, morphological alterations in cardiac tissue were seen at all studied doses. AP was found to cause a significant (P ˂ 0.05) decline in the levels of impaired cardiac injury markers (troponin, creatine phosphokinase, and creatine phosphokinase-MB), improvement in the antioxidant endpoints (total antioxidant capacity), and attenuation in the oxidative stress indices (total reactive oxygen species, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, lipid peroxides [malondialdehyde], and protein carbonyl), associated with a significant (P ˂ 0.05) modulation in the mRNA expression levels of the encoding genes (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, P53, Apaf-1, and AIF), related to the intrinsic pathway of apoptotic cell death in the cardiac tissue. AP administration partially restored the morphological changes in the rat’s heart. The highest protective efficacy of AP was recorded at a dose level of 200 mg/kg b.w. Taken together, these results indicated that AP is a promising cardioprotective compound capable of attenuating Til-induced cardiac impact by protecting the rat cardiac tissue from Til-induced apoptosis when administered concurrently with and after the Til injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acardiotoxicity 3acaspase-3 3acreatine 3acreatine kinase 3adecline 3agene expression 3aheart 3alivestock 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3aresearch 3atherapeutics1 aKhalil, Samah R.1 aHendam, Basma M.1 aAbd El-Aziz, Reda M.1 aMetwally, Mohamed M.

In this study, three potential Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols, showing similar UV absorption spectra to that of ergosterol, in the thraustochytrid Schizochytrium sp. S31, were estimated by the ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) − APCI−MS/MS method. The proposed structures of three Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols were ergosta‐5,7,24(28)‐trien‐3β‐ol, ergosta‐5,7‐dien‐3β‐ol, and 24‐ethylcholesta‐5,7,22‐trien‐3β‐ol. The contents of astaxanthin, ergosterol, and the other three Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols in Schizochytrium sp. S31 during the cultivation performed in three separate batches were analyzed by a fast UPLC–PDA method. The results demonstrated that astaxanthin, ergosterol, and ergosta‐5,7‐dien‐3β‐ol were the predominant carotenoid and Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols, respectively, and their contents kept increasing during the growth and reached a maximum after 23 days of cultivation. The estimated maximum contents of astaxanthin and four Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols, including ergosterol, ergosta‐5,7‐dien‐3β‐ol, ergosta‐5,7,24(28)‐trien‐3β‐ol, and 24‐ethylcholesta‐5,7,22‐trien‐3β‐ol were 2.31, 4.02, 3.43, 0.30, and 0.97 mg g⁻¹ dry biomass, respectively. These findings are different to other strains reported in the composition and accumulation of Δ⁵,⁷‐sterols and carotenoids. The present study suggests that Schizochytrium sp. S31 might be a promising marine microorganism for the productions of high‐value natural pigment astaxanthin, the provitamin D₂ ergosterol, and the provitamin D₄ ergosta‐5,7‐dien‐3β‐ol, and taken as a model organism to study the sterologenesis of the microorganisms because of its complexity of sterol compositions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017B020218004cthe Fund of Guangdong Research and Construction of Public Service Abilities  aYCN2017‐17cthe project from the Department of Ocean and Fishery of Guangdong Province 3aSchizochytrium 3aabsorption 3aastaxanthin 3abiomass 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aergosterol 3aoils 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhu, Qing1 aLiao, Yi‐Nan1 aWang, Qin‐Qing1 aLi, Yan1 aDong, Xi‐Yang1 aPeng, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9624-19701 aYuan, Jian‐Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9180-40681 aWang, Jiang‐Hai0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2020 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.839-850dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.123643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245006900165300001000234500000900244520141800253592002801671650002001699650002601719650002901745650002501774650002801799650001301827650000901840650002201849650001201871700001601883773010801899852000902007856008302016655001202099IND4412261420221122135335.0191122e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441226142DNAL7 a10.1094/CM-2008-0730-01-RV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Cynthia10aEnhanced-Efficiency Fertilizers for Use on the Canadian Prairies  ap. 0.  aepub  aIn spite of the management practices adopted by Canadian producers to mimize fertilizer losses, N-use efficiency is normally estimated to be less than 50% in the year of application. Various types of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers such as nitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, and coated N fertilizers are available that attempt to address the constraints associated with traditional N management in order to improve N-use efficiency and/or the operational efficiency of Canadian agricultural systems. Enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers can chemically or physically influence the movement and transformations of N in order to improve synchrony between nutrient supply and crop uptake, reduce nutrient losses, and improve nutrient-use efficiency. Pathways and magnitude of N loss are influenced by soil characteristics, weather conditions, and crop management practices, as well as by fertilizer source and management practices. Therefore, the effectiveness of the various enhanced-efficiency fertilizers will be strongly dependent on the environmental conditions that influence potential losses. Under environmental conditions where the potential for N loss is high, enhanced-efficiency fertilizers may provide an effective method of improving N use, particularly where other agronomic factors are optimized so that the crop is able to convert the N supplied into usable yield with the greatest efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop management 3aenvironmental factors 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aprairies 3asoil 3aurease inhibitors 3aweather1 aWu, Ronggui0 tCrop management.g2008 July, v. 7, no. 1 p.0-0dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2008-0730-01-RV3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03252naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012000164300002000284500001900304520165900323592002801982596005302010596008402063596006702147650002702214650001202241650001602253650001602269650002102285650002402306650001602330650001402346650001502360650001602375650001302391650001002404650001902414651001002433700001402443700001702457700001802474700001802492773016902510856008202679852000902761655001202770IND60696418920221117160350.0200524e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069641892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08519-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yun-He10aInput and output of cadmium (Cd) for paddy soil in central south China: fluxes, mass balance, and model predictions  ap. 21847-21858.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is important to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cadmium (Cd) input and output in different contamination zones. In this study, we choose 15 sampling areas in three types of contamination zones (industrial and mining, suburb, and rural) to systematically study the inventory of soil Cd input and output in Changzhutan (CZT) urban agglomerations, Hunan Province, China. The results showed that the value of total Cd input in industrial and mining (34.58 g/ha/year) was respectively about 2 and 3 times of that in suburb and in rural. Meanwhile, the total output flux in industrial and mining also presented highest value (38.67 g/ha/year) among the zones. As for the contributions, atmospheric deposition was responsible for 85–89% of the total input fluxes, which was significantly higher than those of irrigation water and fertilizer. Crop harvesting, especially straw removal, was the dominant output pathway, contributing 66–78%. Moreover, Cd annual balance illustrated that the net input fluxes under straw removal scenario were negative in all zones, and it was opposite under straw returning scenario. Further, the changes of soil Cd concentrations under straw returning and straw removal scenario were compared by a dynamic mathematical model. The modeling results presented that the soil Cd content continued to increase under straw returning in 100 years, while it was declining under straw removal scenario. This prediction indicated straw removal was an important remediation for Cd-polluted paddy soil, especially in Hunan. Nevertheless, more treatment measures need to conduct to reach the safety limits in paddy soil.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-01-28cAgriculture Research System of China  a2016YFD0800705; 2016YFD0200401-6cNational Key Research and Development Program  a2017NK2142cHunan Provincial Science and Technology Department 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3afertilizers 3ainventories 3airrigation water 3amathematical models 3apaddy soils 3apollution 3aprediction 3aremediation 3aresearch 3astraw 3asuburban areas 3aChina1 aZhu, Jian1 aLiu, Sai-Hua1 aPan, Shu-Fang1 aJi, Xiong-Hui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 June, v. 27, no. 17 p.21847-21858dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08519-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001600277500001500293520111900308592002801427650001401455650002501469650002301494650002801517650001501545650002101560650002201581650001601603650001401619650001501633650001601648650002501664650000901689650002001698650002501718650001301743650002701756650000901783650001901792650001601811653000801827653000801835653000801843653000801851653000801859653000801867653001401875653001901889653000801908653000701916653000801923653002401931653000801955653000701963653002101970653001701991653000802008653002402016700001802040700001702058700001802075700001802093700002002111700001902131700002002150700001902170773011102189856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60086552720221116142913.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008655272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, HoSung,10aProtective role of phosphatidylcholine against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity and oxidative stress in rats  ap. 388-393.  a2019-12-06  aAlthough cisplatin is widely used in the treatment of cancers, clinical use of cisplatin is limited due to its nephrotoxicity. Pathophysiological mechanism of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity is a complex process and has not been fully understand. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have been presumed to be involved in this damage process. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) has antioxidant effect and prevents oxidative stress. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate potential protective effects of PC on cisplatin-induced renal damage in rat. We examined the protective effects of PC on cisplatin-induced renal damage by assessment of serum creatinine, BUN, lipid peroxidation, total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase activity and histophathological changes. PC ameliorated cisplatin-induced increases in serum creatinine, urea and oxidative stress. PC also decreased tubular degeneration and hypertrophy of glomeruli. PC may have a protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats via enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acisplatin 3aphosphatidylcholines 3alipid peroxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3acreatinine 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aglutathione 3aneoplasms 3atoxicology 3ablood serum 3asuperoxide dismutase 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aurea 3anephrotoxicity 3ahypertrophy 0aGPx 0aCAT 0aPMN 0aMDA 0aARF 0aROS 0aCisplatin 0aRenal toxicity 0aSOD 0aPC 0aGSH 0aPhosphatidylcholine 0aBUN 0aGR 0aOxidative stress 0aantioxidants 0aPAS 0aAcute renal failure1 aKim, Bum Keun1 aNam, Yunsung1 aSohn, Uy Dong1 aPark, Eon Sub1 aHong, Soon Auck1 aLee, Jong Hyuk1 aChung, Yoon Hee1 aJeong, Ji Hoon0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 58 p.388-393dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002900156245008800185300001800273520140100291592002801692650002201720650002101742650001801763650001101781650001301792650001501805650002401820650001701844650001601861650002101877650001401898650001401912650000901926650002401935650002001959650001301979650004801992650002502040650001202065650001802077650003302095650001602128650001702144650001102161650002102172650002302193650001002216650002102226700001802247700002902265700001902294700001802313773013102331856004002462852000902502655001202511IND4468691320221118232439.0120423e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446869132DNAL7 a222903992pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.55292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo‐Giménez, Arturo10aEffect of supplementing compost with grapeseed meal on Agaricus bisporus production  ap. 1665-1671.  aBACKGROUND: This work assesses the agronomic performance of grapeseed meal, before and after oil extraction, in nutritional compost supplement when growing the mushroom species Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach. The effect of formaldehyde treatment before using this compost is also considered. Materials were applied at different doses at spawning. Along with non‐supplemented compost, three commercial nutritional supplements were used as controls. RESULTS: In general terms, grapeseed meal performance was similar to that of commercial delayed‐release nutrients, but improved the non‐supplemented compost response. We highlight that grapeseed enhances performance as larger yields of harvested mushrooms were obtained with greater dry weight content; however, their protein content was lower. The best performance was displayed by fresh formaldehyde‐treated grapeseed (6000 ppm) when applied to the 10 g kg−1 compost dose. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that grapeseed meal offers a great potential to be applied on a commercial scale. The addition of grapeseed resulted in an enhanced performance as shown by the higher number of harvested mushrooms. The use of grapeseed meal (extracted or non‐extracted), a low‐cost ingredient with high levels of carbohydrates, may suppose an economic profit on the basis of the positive effect of adding carbon in the mushroom cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aagronomic traits 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acomposts 3acrop yield 3adietary supplements 3aformaldehyde 3aingredients 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3anutrients 3aoils 3aprofits and margins 3aprotein content 3aspawning 2aAgaricusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBiomass 2aCarbohydrates 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFertilizers 2aFormaldehyde 2aHumans 2aHumic Substances 2aPlant Preparations 2aSeeds 2aVitisxchemistry1 aZied, Diego C1 aÁlvarez‐Ortí, Manuel1 aRubio, Manuela1 aPardo, Jose E0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 June, v. 92, no. 8 p.1665-1671dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5529  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245003600168300001600204520142600220592002801646650001301674650001301687650001501700650000901715650002001724650001201744773012501756856007901881852000901960655001201969IND60300800520221120203544.0150703e20121116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030080052DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12305322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Benjamin P.12aA Vitrage of Asteroid Magnetism  ap. 897-898.  aIn the early solar system, some protoplanets experienced large-scale melting, leading to the formation of a metallic core overlain by a rocky mantle. This differentiated structure has persisted to the present day in large bodies such as Earth. In Earth's core, vigorous churning of molten metallic liquid generates the geomagnetic field in a process known as the dynamo (1). Although we have no samples of Earth's core, many smaller protoplanets were catastrophically shattered over the intervening eons, producing the present-day asteroid belt and providing us with meteorite samples from their deep interiors. These samples provide a natural cross section of asteroid interiors, with stony meteorites thought to have formed at shallow depths and iron meteorites in the core. Intermediate in composition between these two types are the pallasites, spectacular mixtures of translucent, gem-quality olivine crystals and iron-nickel metal that, when backlit, take on the quality of a medieval stained-glass window (vitrage) (see the first figure). The origin of pallasites and the nature of their parent body (2) have perplexed meteoriticists since the first, eponymous meteorite Pallas was described in 1794 (3). On page 939 of this issue, Tarduno et al. (4) suggest that the pallasite parent body was the product of a near-catastrophic impact of a molten body onto a differentiated protoplanet with an active core dynamo.  aPublisher supplied data 3achurning 3acrystals 3ageophysics 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3amelting0 tScience.g2012 Nov. 16, v. 338, no. 6109 p.897-898dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12305323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010900172500001900281520178300300592002802083650001102111650001302122650001902135650001202154650001102166650001102177650001602188650000902204650001102213651001802224651001402242653002502256653001502281653002702296653002702323700001702350773010902367856008802476852000902564655001202573IND60727647620221118233237.0210320e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072764762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1034472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh, Omid10aRapid Arctic warming and its link to the waviness and strength of the westerly jet stream over West Asia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRapid sea-ice loss and warming of the Arctic within the past few decades have contributed to changes in the strength and location of midlatitude jet streams. Using ERA-Interim data for the period 1979–2018, warming of the Arctic compared to midlatitudes and its impact on the waviness and strength of the westerly jet stream over West Asia are investigated. Pre- and post-Arctic amplification periods are defined as 1979–1993 and 2004–2018, respectively. Near-surface temperature variability is decreased in the Arctic in the post-Arctic amplification period when a larger area of open ocean has been exposed to the atmosphere. In both pre- and post-Arctic amplification periods, near-surface temperature variabilities in spring and summer were less than half as much of its variability in winter. During the period 1979–2018, both the Arctic and West Asia have warmed, with much higher warming of the Arctic in autumn and winter. Indeed, in contrast to the continental cooling pattern observed in parts of North and Northeast Asia, West Asia has warmed in recent decades. Following a decrease in the meridional temperature gradient, the upper-tropospheric jet stream over West Asia has been reduced in the post-Arctic amplification period in all seasons except autumn. In the post-Arctic amplification period, the zonal wind shear has been also reduced over West Asia in all seasons, while waviness of the Z500 isopleth has been increased in winter. A higher meridional mid-tropospheric waviness is found over the study region (20–75°E) in summer compared to winter because in summer the western part of this region is influenced by a strong subtropical high pressure, while its eastern part is influenced by the Indian monsoon and associated trough of low pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3alatitude 3amonsoon season 3asea ice 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aWest Asia 0aRapid Arctic warming 0aJet stream 0aMeridional wave extent 0aExtreme weather events1 aLin, Zhaohui0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2021 Apr., v. 199 p.103447-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1034473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245013400156520197600290592002802266650002202294650001502316650001302331650001502344650001202359650002302371650002402394650001602418650001202434650001702446650001302463773011802476856007702594852000902671655001202680IND60768400120221118151932.0220225e20220213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076840012DNAL7 a10.3390/land110202822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ran 10aIncomplete Urbanization and the Trans-Local Rural-Urban Gradient in China: From a Perspective of New Economics of Labor Migration  aThe urbanization in China is “incomplete” and the migration of non-hukou migrants is circular, wherein rural migrants often keep their rural land in the home village as a social safety net. The informal housing market is one of the main housing providers for migrant workers. Existing studies see informal housing as the migrants’ passive choice under the discriminatory hukou system, while underplaying the migrants’ familial multi-site tenure strategies between village homes and city places. As suggested by New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM), attachment to a place of origin (such as keeping hometown lands), while choosing informal housing at the destination, is a familial utility maximization strategy that can control risks when migrating between locations. Informal housing areas, therefore, become a trans-local rural-urban gradient and semi-urban landscape. We use the 2017 Migrant Dynamics Monitoring Survey data and the binary logistic regression to examine (a) whether hometown landowning is a significant predictor of the migrants’ choosing of a temporary stay in informal settlements in urban destinations, and (b) which kind of hometown land arrangement (farmland or homestead holding or both of them) is the strongest indicator of the higher probability of staying in informal settlements in urban destinations? The data analysis reveals that homestead in hometown is a more prominent pulling factor than farmland to “glue” rural migrants together within an integrated rural land “insurance regime” between the migrant-sending and -receiving places. The land-use and informal housing governance (including urban village demolition) ignore the trans-local nature of the migratory networks and semi-urbanizing dynamics. The traditional analysis of the rural-urban gradient with many landscapes should consider the functional and tenurial linkage between the locations at different points along with the complex migration activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3agovernance 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amarkets 3amigratory behavior 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3avillages0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 13, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245015500165500001400320520123400334592002801568650001601596650002001612650000901632650002001641650001901661650001401680650001101694650001601705650002001721650001401741700002801755700002101783700002501804700002401829700002001853773012001873856007501993852000902068655001202077IND60731998120221120220017.0210326e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073199812DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110308842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaslin, Emmanuelle 10aMammary Gland Structures Are Not Affected by an Increased Growth Rate of Yearling Ewes Post-Weaning but Are Associated with Growth Rates of Singletons  aNAL-light  aThe experiment aimed to examine the impacts of an increased growth rate of ewes between three and seven months of age on udder development using ultrasound and to establish whether ultrasonography could be used to identify ewe mammary structures that may be indirect indicators of singleton growth to weaning. Udder dimensions, depths of gland cistern (GC), parenchyma (PAR) and fat pad (FP) were measured in late pregnancy (P107), early lactation (L29), and at weaning (L100) in 59 single-bearing yearling ewes selected from two treatments. The ‘heavy’ group (n = 31) was preferentially fed prior to breeding achieving an average breeding live-weight of 47.9 ± 0.38 kg at seven months of age. The ‘control’ group (n = 28) had an average breeding live-weight of 44.9 ± 0.49 kg. Udder dimensions, GC, PAR and FP did not differ between treatments. Lamb growth to L100 was positively associated (p < 0.05) with PAR at P107 and GC at L29. There was no evidence of negative effects of the live-weight gain treatments on udder development of yearling ewes as measured by ultrasonography. The results suggest that this ultrasound method has the potential to identify pregnant yearling ewes which would wean heavier singletons.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3aearly lactation 3aewes 3aliveweight gain 3amammary glands 3apregnancy 3audders 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3ayearlings1 aCorner-Thomas, Rene  A.1 aKenyon, Paul  R.1 aMolenaar, Adrian  J.1 aMorris, Stephen  T.1 aBlair, Hugh  T.0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010400185300001600289520068500305592002800990650001201018650001101030650001401041650001501055650002501070650002601095650001301121650001301134650002701147650002901174650001301203650002301216650001001239650003901249650001301288650004501301650002901346650001701375650004701392651001001439700001501449700002201464700002401486700002401510700001901534700001901553773012901572856004801701852000901749655001201758IND50063803920221118232532.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006380392DNAL7 a232835352pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0944-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayasree, V.10aPersistence and Effects of Processing on Reduction of Chlorantraniliprole Residues on Cowpea Fruits  ap. 494-498.  aA field trial was conducted to study the dissipation kinetics of chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC on cowpea fruits.

Fe₃O₄/MIL‐101(Cr) was synthesized using reduction‐precipitation method, in which steps including pre‐synthesis and modification of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles were by‐passed. Various parameters including extraction solvent type and volume, ultrasonic extraction time, amount of Fe₃O₄/MIL‐101(Cr) microspheres, adsorption time, desorption volume and time were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the proposed method had the limit of detection (S/N = 3) and the limit of quantification (S/N = 10) of 1.08–18.10 and 3.60–60.20 pg/g, respectively. Relative standard deviations calculated for all herbicides with concentrations of 2 and 20 ng/g were in the range of 0.5 to 13% (n = 3). In addition, at the two above‐mentioned concentrations, the method achieved relative recoveries percentages of 79.3 to 116.7% when applied to determine the triazine herbicides in real samples spiked. This rapid, green, non‐polluting, pre‐concentrated extraction method was successfully developed and applied to analyze herbicides in rice samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a21405057cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21207047cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20180201050YYcScience and Technology Developing Foundation of Jilin Province of China  a201701011106JCcScience and Technology Developing Foundation of Jilin Province of China  a2018C034‐1cIndustrial Innovation Funds of Jilin Province of China 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3arice 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriazine herbicides 3aultrasonics1 aPiao, Huilan1 aQin, Zucheng1 aLi, Xiaolei1 aMa, Pinyi1 aSun, Ying1 aWang, Xinghua1 aSong, Daqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5868-06490 tJournal of separation science.g2019 Sept., v. 42, no. 18 p.2900-2908dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2019003453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009400161300001800255500002000273520209900293592002802392596010802420596002202528596002602550650003002576650001402606650002302620651001402643651001002657651001202667700007302679700002002752700003202772700003002804773012202834856007202956852000903028655001203037IND60744853520221118103725.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485352DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.35702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Miriam10aAdvances and challenges in marine conservation in Chile: A regional and global comparison  ap. 1760-1771.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite significant progress made in Chile, and globally, in establishing marine protected areas (MPAs), the actual contribution to marine biodiversity conservation needs to be revised, to focus on representativeness and the diversity of tools alongside effective implementation, management, and enforcement. This study makes progress in this direction, describing the most recent advances in marine conservation in Chile and analysing the contribution of the different conservation instruments as well as the distribution of designated areas across ecoregions. Furthermore, it examines the potential contribution of alternative area‐based instruments to balance ocean protection. The advances observed in Chile were compared among four South American countries and five leading countries in ocean conservation, analysing protection levels in coastal areas, continental exclusive economic zones, and overseas territories. Data on MPA boundaries and attributes were sourced from the World Database on Protected Areas and complemented the official information on MPAs and territorial user rights for fisheries and for indigenous people in South America. The current level of protection in Chile is among the highest in the world in area coverage and in the proportion of the continental exclusive economic zone assigned to fully protected areas. However, it exhibits the strongest imbalances in the distribution of designated MPAs between coastal and oceanic waters, in comparison with the leading countries and also within South America (Perú, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay), and among ecoregions. The patterns observed suggest that Chile has advanced, but concentrated, conservation efforts in low‐threat, remote ecoregions. There is an urgent need to progress towards high‐threat ecoregions, which implies balancing the needs of nature and people. The distribution of ancillary conservation instruments can help double the level of protection in threatened coastal areas, filling gaps in marine conservation and creating an opportunity to progress and diversify conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aCCM RC 1300004cIniciativa Científica Milenio from Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo de Chile  a1171603cFondecyt  cPew Charitable Trusts 3abiodiversity conservation 3adatabases 3aindigenous peoples 3aArgentina 3aChile 3aUruguay1 aRodríguez‐Ruiz, Montserrat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1303-38321 aGelcich, Stefan1 aHiriart‐Bertrand, Luciano1 aCastilla Z., Juan Carlos,0 tAquatic conservation.g2021 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1760-1771dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.35703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245012800174300001800302520152500320592002801845650001501873650001701888650001001905650001201915650001001927650002201937650002501959650002101984650001502005650002902020650000902049650001102058650000902069650001802078650001202096650002502108650001502133650003702148650001202185650001702197650004702214650002402261650001402285650001502299650001602314650001602330650001102346650001102357650001402368650000902382650002102391650002602412650000902438650002102447650001002468651001002478651001002488651001302498651001002511651001302521700001502534700001402549700002102563700002002584773013402604856004002738852000902778655001202787IND4468686620221118232559.0120315e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446868662DNAL7 a221312532pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.47212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWani, Suhas P10aEnhancing agricultural productivity and rural incomes through sustainable use of natural resources in the Semi Arid Tropics  ap. 1054-1063.  aBACKGROUND: A participatory watershed management approach is one of the tested, sustainable and eco‐friendly options to upgrade rain‐fed agriculture to meet growing food demand along with additional multiple benefits in terms of improving livelihoods, addressing equity issues and biodiversity concerns. RESULTS: Watershed interventions at study sites in Thailand (Tad Fa and Wang Chai) and India (Kothapally) effectively reduced runoff and the associated soil loss. Such interventions at Xiaoxincun (China) and Wang Chai improved groundwater recharging and availability. Enhanced productive transpiration increased rainwater use efficiency for crop production by 13–29% at Xiaoxincun; 13–160% at Lucheba (China), 32–37% at Tad Fa and 23–46% at Wang Chai and by two to five times at Kothapally. Watershed interventions increased significantly the additional net returns from crop production as compared with the pre‐watershed intervention period. Increased water availability opened up options for crop diversification with high‐value crops, including increased forage production and boosted livestock‐based livelihoods. CONCLUSION: In dryland tropics, integrated watershed management approach enabled farmers to diversify the systems along with increasing agricultural productivity through increased water availability, while conserving the natural resource base. Household incomes increased substantially, leading to improved living and building the resilience of the community and natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abiodiversity 3acrops 3afarmers 3afoods 3aforage production 3agroundwater recharge 3ahousehold income 3alivelihood 3aparticipatory management 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil 3atranspiration 3atropics 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 2aAgriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aEcosystem 2aEmployment 2aFood Supply 2aGroundwater 2aHumans 2aIncome 2aLivestock 2aRain 2aRural Population 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aSoil 2aTropical Climate 2aWater 3aChina 3aIndia 3aThailand 0aIndia 0aThailand1 aDixin, Yin1 aLi, Zhong1 aDar, William D.,1 aChander, Girish0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 92, no. 5 p.1054-1063dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4721  aDNAL 7aarticle04681naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007700161300001600238520278000254592002803034650001803062650001903080650001003099650001903109650001103128650002303139650001803162650003203180650001603212650001403228650002403242650002503266650003003291650001903321650001203340650001503352650001103367650001503378650002303393650001103416650001303427650002003440650001703460650001903477650001803496650001903514650001303533650001403546650002103560650001903581650002503600650002303625650001003648651001003658700001503668700001703683700001603700700001903716700001703735773015203752856008203904852000903986655001203995IND60684877120221121172129.0200226e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068487712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-019-01705-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yun10aLife cycle assessment of melange yarns from the manufacturer perspective  ap. 588-599.  aPURPOSE: Different proportions of colored fibers are able to spin into melange yarns with different colors and textures. With the advantages of energy saving, water saving, and emissions reduction in their production, melange yarns become more and more popular in manufacturers. However, the environmental performance of melange yarns with different colors has not been well investigated, which makes fashion designers unable to consider environmental performance when determining the color scheme of their design works. This study focuses on evaluating the environmental impacts of melange yarns spun from different colored fibers and identifying the environmental hotspots, in order to seek opportunities for improvement from the manufacturer’s perspective. METHODS: A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of melange yarns was performed, where the investigated phases include raw material acquisition, transportation, dyeing, mixing, and spinning. The functional unit is 1 ton of the finished melange yarns. The primary data of nine melange yarns spun from monochrome fibers, i.e., white, brown, blue, purple, green, yellow, red, black, and gray, were collected by on-site investigation in a large manufacturer in China. The environmental impacts of the nine melange yarns were evaluated using the ReCiPe method. The environmental impacts were indicated by 15 impact categories including climate change, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, ozone depletion, water depletion, metal depletion, fossil depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human ecotoxicity, ionizing radiation, particulate matter formation, and photochemical oxidant formation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results obtained from the LCA demonstrated that spinning phase and dyeing phase in the production of melange yarns are main contributors to environmental impacts. The electricity and tap water consumptions are found to be the dominant contributors to most of impact categories, except terrestrial ecotoxicity, metal depletion, and ionizing radiation, whereas these environmental impacts are related to the wastewater treatment process. The recycled water is beneficial to reduce environmental burdens and can bring over 30% environmental benefits to the category of freshwater ecotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Melange yarns spun from white fibers have the least impact on the environment because of the lower electricity and water consumptions. The potential hotspots identified are tap water use, reactive dyestuffs and auxiliaries use in the dyeing phase, and the electricity consumption in spinning phase. This work points out the future direction for the textile industry to improve the environmental performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aclimate change 3acolor 3acradle-to-gate 3adyeing 3aecosystem services 3aecotoxicology 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aeutrophication 3afossils 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aionization 3aionizing radiation 3amixing 3aoxidants 3aozone depletion 3aparticulates 3aphotochemistry 3araw materials 3arecycled water 3aspinning 3atap water 3atextile industry 3atransportation 3awastewater treatment 3awater conservation 3ayarns 3aChina1 aZhu, Libin1 aZhang, Cheng1 aRen, Feiyue1 aHuang, Haihong1 aLiu, Zhifeng0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.588-599dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-019-01705-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015900159520129000318592002801608650002101636650001801657650001401675650001401689650001901703650001501722650001101737650001201748650001501760650001701775650003201792650001601824650002201840650001601862650001301878650004401891650002001935650002701955650004401982700002302026700002902049700002302078700002302101700002002124700002502144700002402169700002002193700002302213700001802236700001902254773012202273856007502395852000902470655001202479IND60763533020221118063511.0220120e20220114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076353302DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140203402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Hammad 10aHydroethanolic Extract of Prunus domestica L.: Metabolite Profiling and In Vitro Modulation of Molecular Mechanisms Associated to Cardiometabolic Diseases  aHigh consumption of fruit and vegetables has an inverse association with cardiometabolic risk factors. This study aimed to chemically characterize the hydroethanolic extract of P. domestica subsp. syriaca fruit pulp and evaluate its inhibitory activity against metabolic enzymes and production of proinflammatory mediators. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry(UHPLC-HRMS) analysis showed the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanols, and glycoside flavonols, while nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) analysis showed, among saccharides, an abundant presence of glucose. P. domestica fruit extract inhibited α-amylase, α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, and HMG CoA reductase enzyme activities, with IC50 values of 7.01 mg/mL, 6.4 mg/mL, 6.0 mg/mL, and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively. P. domestica fruit extract inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced production of nitrite, interleukin-1 β and PGE₂ in activated J774 macrophages. The findings of the present study indicate that P. domestica fruit extracts positively modulate in vitro a series of molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic diseases. Further research is necessary to better characterize these properties and their potential application for human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus domestica 3aalpha-amylase 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afruit extracts 3afruit pulp 3afruits 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3ahuman health 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anitrites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathophysiology 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aSommella, Eduardo 1 aSantarcangelo, Cristina 1 aD’Avino, Danilo 1 aRossi, Antonietta 1 aDacrema, Marco 1 aMinno, Alessandro Di1 aDi Matteo, Giacomo 1 aMannina, Luisa 1 aCampiglia, Pietro 1 aMagni, Paolo 1 aDaglia, Maria 0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 14, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140203403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016600169520181600335592002802151650000802179650001502187650002002202650001102222650001702233650003002250650001902280650005002299650000902349650001702358650001902375650001502394650001102409650001202420651001002432653002802442653001802470653002402488653003902512700002702551700002402578700001902602773011402621856008202735852000902817655001202826IND60674120020221122121301.0200210e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067412002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastagna, Jessica10aAnalysis of equivalent black carbon multi-year data at an oil pre-treatment plant: Integration with satellite data to identify black carbon transboundary sources  aThis study analyzes a multi-year dataset of equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentration collected in 2012–2015 by a 7-wavelengths Aethalometer at Centro Olio Val d’Agri (COVA) in southern Italy, which is the largest European oil pre-treatment plant. These data, together with the local air circulation analysis, were used to identify the black carbon (BC) sources in Agri valley, specifically the COVA plant and vehicular traffic. During a limited period of 2012–2013, simultaneous measurements of PM₁₀ concentration were available for comparison with the EBC data, which revealed correlation values of 0.31–0.43 between PM₁₀ and EBC indicating a relevant contribution of BC to particulate matter at the site. On average, EBC/PM₁₀ ratio is 7%, a value equal to that found at an urban-background site in Rome measured during non-rush hours.Moreover, an ad hoc procedure combining EBC data, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory back-trajectories (HYSPLIT), and satellite fire data enabled detection of days affected by the transport of carbonaceous particles. Both Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were used as input for the algorithm, and the corresponding results were compared and discussed. VIIRS showed a better performance in detecting smaller/cooler hotspots especially in cases of flaring, as observed during flaring events at the COVA plant itself.Application of the procedure suggests that both regional and non-regional biomass burning episodes, which occur mainly during summer, could contribute to the BC load at the site.The approach applied to the case study of the present work can be useful for estimating the relative contributions of local and remote sources of BC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3abiomass burning 3acarbon 3acase studies 3afate and transport models 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aoils 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asummer 3atraffic 3aItaly 0aEquivalent black carbon 0aOil/gas plant 0aSatellite fire data 0aBlack carbon transboundary sources1 aCalvello, Mariarosaria1 aEsposito, Francesco1 aPavese, Giulia0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 235 p.111429-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.1114293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245014400174300001600318500002800334500001500362520128500377653003101662653002501693653001801718653001501736700001701751700001301768700001701781700001701798700001801815773012801833852000901961856009201970946001102062655001202073IND4416226620221118004130.0090213s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441622662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02540.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrincivalli, M.S.10aLactobacillus rhamnosus GG inhibits invasion of cultured human respiratory cells by prtF1-positive macrolide-resistant group A streptococci  ap. 368-372.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-11  aThis study was designed to determine whether the probiotic strain Lactobacillus GG, which is extensively used in the treatment and prevention of intestinal disorders, is able to inhibit invasion of cultured human respiratory cells by macrolide-resistant group A streptococci (GAS) carrying the prtF1 gene, which encodes the fibronectin (Fn)-binding invasin F1. Eight prtF1-positive erythromycin-resistant GAS strains were used to infect A549 monolayers in competition and displacement assays with Lactobacillus GG. Live (L-LGG) and heat-killed (HK-LGG) lactobacilli and their spent culture supernatant (SCS) significantly reduced (P < 0·001) GAS invasion efficiency in both assays. No antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus GG against GAS was detected. Both L-LGG and HK-LGG and all prtF1-positive GAS induced a strong agglutination reaction using Fn-coated particles. Lactobacillus GG exerts an antagonistic action against GAS by inhibiting cell invasion. Competitive binding of Lactobacillus GG and GAS to Fn might be involved in the inhibition process. The finding that Lactobacillus GG can prevent in vitro invasion of respiratory cells by GAS suggests new applications for this probiotic strain and warrants further studies of its capacity to prevent GAS throat infections. 0aLactobacillus rhamnosus GG 0agroup A streptococci 0acell invasion 0aA549 cells1 aPaoletti, C.1 aMagi, G.1 aPalmieri, C.1 aFerrante, L.1 aFacinelli, B.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.368-372dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02540.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02461naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245009100174300001600265500001500281520100500296650002701301650001401328650001901342650002101361650002201382650003001404650002001434650002001454650004101474650003101515650002301546650001101569653002201580653002501602653003001627700001801657700001401675700001801689700001701707700001601724773007101740852000901811856007801820930003301898945001301931946001101944655001201955IND2041864620221118004148.0940908s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204186462DNAL7 a241938272pmid7 a10.1007/BF002326272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoisey, C.R.10aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of white clover using direct shoot organogenesis  ap. 309-314.  a2019-12-05  aWhite clover (Trifolium repens L.) plants from the cultivars Grasslands Huia and Grasslands Tahora have been transformed using Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transfer. Transgenic plants regenerated directly from cells of the cotyledonary axil. To transform white clover, shoot tips from 3 day old seedlings were co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 carrying the plasmid vector pPE64. This vector contains the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (nptII) and beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (gus) both under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Kanamycin-resistant plants regenerated within 42 days after transfer onto selective media. Integration of the nptII and gus genes into the white clover genome was confirmed using Southern blotting, and histochemical analysis indicated that the gus gene was expressed in a variety of tissues. In reciprocal crosses between a primary transformant and a non-transformed plant the introduced gus gene segregated as a single dominant Mendelian trait. 3agenetic transformation 3acultivars 3atissue culture 3aTrifolium repens 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmid vectors 3agene expression 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3anucleic acid hybridization 3abeta-glucuronidase 3ashoots 0ashoot tip culture 0aregenerative ability 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aWhite, D.W.R.1 aDudas, B.1 aAppleby, R.D.1 aEaling, P.M.1 aScott, A.G.0 tPlant cell reports.g1994, v. 13, no. 6 p.309-314x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002326273Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03291naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245011000198300001800308500002400326506007600350520173700426506003702163650002102200650002702221650002102248650003802269650001102307650001702318650002302335650003002358650001302388650002502401650002202426650002402448650001402472700001902486700002002505700001402525700001602539700003002555773013502585852000902720856008002729655001202809IND4449852520221207114832.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985252DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01862-102doi7 aPMC30672722pmcid7 a211936662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaide, Galia10aIdentification and Characterization of Novel and Potent Transcription Promoters of Francisella tularensis  ap. 1608-1618.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo alternative promoter trap libraries, based on the green fluorescence protein (gfp) reporter and on the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) cassette, were constructed for isolation of potent Francisella tularensis promoters. Of the 26,000 F. tularensis strain LVS gfp library clones, only 3 exhibited visible fluorescence following UV illumination and all appeared to carry the bacterioferritin promoter (Pbfr). Out of a total of 2,000 chloramphenicol-resistant LVS clones isolated from the cat promoter library, we arbitrarily selected 40 for further analysis. Over 80% of these clones carry unique F. tularensis DNA sequences which appear to drive a wide range of protein expression, as determined by specific chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) Western dot blot and enzymatic assays. The DNA sequence information for the 33 unique and novel F. tularensis promoters reported here, along with the results of in silico and primer extension analyses, suggest that F. tularensis possesses classical Escherichia coli σ⁷⁰-related promoter motifs. These motifs include the -10 (TATAAT) and -35 [TTGA(C/T)A] domains and an AT-rich region upstream from -35, reminiscent of but distinct from the E. coli upstream region that is termed the UP element. The most efficient promoter identified (Pbfr) appears to be about 10 times more potent than the F. tularensis groEL promoter and is probably among the strongest promoters in F. tularensis. The battery of promoters identified in this work will be useful, among other things, for genetic manipulation in the background of F. tularensis intended to gain better understanding of the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis and virulence, as well as for vaccine development studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aWestern blotting 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3aclones 3afluorescence 3agenetic background 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alighting 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein synthesis 3avaccine development 3avirulence1 aGrosfeld, Haim1 aEhrlich, Sharon1 aZvi, Anat1 aCohen, Ofer1 aShafferman, A.q(Avigdor)0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.1608-1618dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01862-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02295naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245007300178300001600251500001500267520111800282650002701400650002201427650003001449650001301479650001101492650002001503650001801523650002301541650001101564653001701575653003001592700002001622700001601642773007101658852000901729856007801738930003301816945001301849946001101862655001201873IND2041863420221118004315.0940908s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204186342DNAL7 a241937602pmid7 a10.1007/BF002333152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConfalonieri, M.10aGenetic transformation of Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tumefaciens  ap. 256-261.  a2019-12-05  aTwo clones of Populus nigra L. were tested in vivo and in vitro for their susceptibility to three different Agrobacterium tumefaciens wild-type strains evaluating number and size of resulting calluses. Strain C58 proved to be the most virulent. Various parameters affecting Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of P. nigra clones were further analyzed using beta-glucuronidase gene transient expression. The clone Jean Pourtet proved to be more susceptible than the clone San Giorgio. A. tumefaciens strain A281 pKIWI105 proved to be the most virulent. The optimal procedure involved dipping of leaf discs into a bacterial suspension [7 X 10(8) cells/ml] for 20 min, followed by a 48 h co-cultivation period on semi-solid regeneration medium. Leaf explants were co-cultivated with two disarmed A. tumefaciens strains. Plantlets of San Giorgio were regenerated, tested for beta-glucuronidase activity and rooted on selective medium containing kanamycin. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blot hybridization confirmed the integration of the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene into the poplar genome. 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aexplants 3aclones 3agene expression 3aPopulus nigra 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aleaves 0awild strains 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aBalestrazzi, A.1 aBisoffi, S.0 tPlant cell reports.g1994, v. 13, no. 5 p.256-261x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002333153Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02443naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245011600175300001600291500001500307520109100322650001801413650002701431650003301458650002201491650003001513650002001543650002601563650002001589650002001609650002301629650002801652653001401680653003001694700001301724700001901737700001401756773007101770852000901841856007801850930003301928945001301961946001101974655001201985IND2041870120221118004042.0940908s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204187012DNAL7 a241938372pmid7 a10.1007/BF002326372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardonnet, N.10aProtection against virus infection in tobacco plants expressing the coat protein of grapevine fanleaf nepovirus  ap. 357-360.  a2019-12-05  aGrapevine fanleaf nepovirus (GFLV) is responsible for the economically significant "court-noue" disease in vineyards. Its genome is made up of two single-stranded RNA molecules (RNA1 and RNA2) which direct the synthesis of polyproteins P1 and P2 respectively. A chimeric coat protein gene derived from the C-terminal part of P2 was constructed and subsequently introduced into a binary transformation vector. Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing the coat protein under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter were engineered by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Protection against infection with virions or viral RNA was tested in coat protein-expressing plants. A significant delay of systemic invasion was observed in transgenic plants inoculated with virus compared to control plants. This effect was also observed when plants were inoculated with viral RNA. No coat protein-mediated cross-protection was observed when transgenic plants were infected with arabis mosaic virus (Arm), a closely related nepovirus also responsible for a "court-noue" disease. 3acoat proteins 3agenetic transformation 3aplant diseases and disorders 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmid vectors 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3adisease control 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3aGrapevine fanleaf virus 0aNicotiana 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aHans, F.1 aSerghini, M.A.1 aPinck, L.0 tPlant cell reports.g1994, v. 13, no. 6 p.357-360x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002326373Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01982naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245012900171300001600300500001500316520066200331650002500993650001801018650002201036650003501058650002801093650000801121650001101129650001201140650001001152653001301162653003001175653002101205653001401226700001501240700001401255700001401269700001401283773007101297852000901368856007801377930003301455945001301488946001101501655001201512IND2041869720221118004146.0940908s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204186972DNAL7 a241938332pmid7 a10.1007/BF002326332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, C.S.10aIsolation and characterization of two cDNA clones that are rapidly induced during the wound response of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 340-343.  a2019-12-05  aDifferential screening of a cDNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana constructed from the plant tissues harvested 1 h after wounding resulted in isolation of 2 wound-inducible cDNA clones.

Fifty-five patients were included in the study. The efficacy variables were the colony count of Streptococcus mutans from the stimulated saliva and periodontal indices on days 0, 7 and 30 after commencement of therapy. Twenty eight patients received chlorhexidine mouthrinse (Periogard®) and 27 Lippia sidoides essential oil mouthrinse (Cepakill®). The clinical and microbiological parameters were significantly reduced by both mouthrinses. No significant difference was seen between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the colony count of S. mutans in both groups (p < 0.05). Chlorhexidine treatment reduced more efficiently than L. sidoides, however, no statistical difference was seen, the efficacy of both groups was similar (p = 0.3). The results indicate that Chlorhexidine mouthrinse reduced plaque index, gingival bleeding and the number of CFU (colonies forming units) more efficiently than L. sidoides but did not reach statistical significance. This study demonstrated that Lippia sidoides EO mouthrinse is effective in reducing microbial plaque and gingival inflammation. 3aLippia 3aStreptococcus mutans 3achlorhexidine 3aessential oils 3agingivitis 3ahemorrhage 3ainflammation 3amicrobiological quality 3apatients 3asaliva 3atherapeutics 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChlorhexidinextherapeutic use 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDental Plaquexdrug therapy 2aDental Plaque Index 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aGingivitisxdrug therapy 2aHumans 2aLippiaxchemistry 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMouthwashesxtherapeutic use 2aOils, Volatilextherapeutic use 2aPeriodontal Index 2aPlant Oilsxtherapeutic use 2aStreptococcus mutansxdrug effects 2aTreatment Outcome 2aYoung Adult1 aSantos, Rinaldo Araujo dos1 aMartins, Jose Galberto1 aCarvalho, Cintia Oliveira1 aPaz, Mabel Calina1 aAzenha, Cláudio1 aRuela, Ronaldo Sousa1 aQueiroz, Dinalva Brito1 aRuela, Wagner Sousa1 aMarinho, Gloria1 aRuela, Francisca Isabel0 tPhytotherapy research.g2009 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1214-1219dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2489 7aarticle01987naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009500173300001800268500002400286520113100310650001001441650001501451650001601466650002201482650001301504700002301517773009301540852000901633856005501642655001201697IND4408942620221118004128.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440894262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16737.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Juan M.14aThe effect of space in plant-animal mutualistic networks: insights from a simulation study  ap. 1362-1370.  aIncludes references  aThe topology of plant-animal mutualistic networks has the potential to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interacting species. Many mechanisms have been proposed as explanations of observed network patterns; however, the fact that plant-animal interactions are inherently spatial has so far been ignored. Using a simulation model of frugivorous birds foraging in spatially explicit landscapes we evaluated how plant distribution and the scale of bird movement decisions influenced species interaction probabilities and the resulting network properties. Spatial aggregation and limited animal mobility restricted encounter probabilities, so that the distribution of animal visits per plant deviated strongly from the binomial distribution expected for a well-mixed system. Lack of mixing in turn resulted in a strong decrease in network connectance, a weak decrease in nestedness, stronger interactions, greater strength asymmetry and the unexpected presence/absence of some interactions. Our results suggest that spatial processes may contribute substantially to structure plant-animal mutualistic networks. 3abirds 3alandscapes 3aprobability 3asimulation models 3atopology1 aVázquez, Diego P.0 tOikos.g2008 Sept., v. 117, no. 9 p.1362-1370dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16737.x 7aarticle03504naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245014800193300001600341500002400357520113200381650002201513650002001535650002401555650001301579650002501592650001701617650001101634650001301645650001001658650000901668650002001677650001401697650002401711650001001735650001701745650001601762650001701778650002801795650002101823650001101844650001401855650002201869650001101891650002201902650001401924650001501938650002201953650003101975650005702006650001402063650003302077650004202110650009102152650001302243650004902256650002702305650002302332700002102355700002202376700001902398700001802417700001902435700002302454700002102477700001802498700002302516700003202539773008202571852000902653856004802662655001202710IND4431419620221118004040.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443141962DNAL7 a199673872pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-1074-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlachowsky, H.q(Henryk)10aTransgenic apple plants overexpressing the Lc gene of maize show an altered growth habit and increased resistance to apple scab and fire blight  ap. 623-635.  aIncludes references  aTransgenic apple plants (Malus × domestica cv. ‘Holsteiner Cox') overexpressing the Leaf Colour (Lc) gene from maize (Zea mays) exhibit strongly increased production of anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols (catechins, proanthocyanidins). Greenhouse plants investigated in this study exhibit altered phenotypes with regard to growth habit and resistance traits. Lc-transgenic plants show reduced size, transversal gravitropism of lateral shoots, reduced trichome development, and frequently reduced shoot diameter and abnormal leaf development with fused leaves. Such phenotypes seem to be in accordance with a direct or an indirect effect on polar-auxin-transport in the transgenic plants. Furthermore, leaves often develop necrotic lesions resembling hypersensitive response lesions. In tests, higher resistance against fire blight (caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora) and against scab (caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis) is observed. These phenotypes are discussed with respect to the underlying altered physiology of the Lc-transgenic plants. The results are expected to be considered in apple breeding strategies. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aMalus domestica 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aZea mays 3aabnormal development 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3abacteria 3acolor 3acorn 3afire resistance 3aflavanols 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agravitropism 3agreenhouses 3agrowth habit 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aproanthocyanidins 3ashoots 3atransgenic plants 3atrichomes 2aAscomycota 2aErwinia amylovora 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMalusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPloidies 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aSzankowski, Iris1 aFischer, Thilo C.1 aRichter, Klaus1 aPeil, Andreas1 aHofer, Monika.1 aDörschel, Claudia1 aSchmoock, Sylvia1 aGau, Achim E.1 aHalbwirth, Heidrun1 aHanke, M.-V.q(Magda-Viola)0 tPlanta.g2010 Feb., v. 231, no. 3 p.623-635dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-1074-4 7aarticle01282naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005800127300001400185500001500199520056500214650001000779650002600789650001100815650001100826653000900837653001200846773007900858852000900937939003300946946001300979655001200992IND9205460020221118003722.0920831e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920546002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilota, M.R.10aEffect of kiln schedule on wrap in Douglas-fir lumber  ap. 57-60.  a2019-12-04  aLumber from large and small Douglas-fir logs was dried by slow and fast schedules at conventional and elevated temperatures.

Currently, secondary manufacturing is the focus of the majority of research and government-sponsored promotional efforts. However, when attempting to increase the value of exports to offshore markets whose cultures are different from the producing region (such as Japan), incrementally adding value at the primary processing stage is a more viable long-term strategy. Empirical and anecdotal data are presented that show how British Columbia lumber producers incrementally added value to solid wood products exported to Japan by implementing small, successive processing and marketing innovations. Continuous technological innovation and increasing market knowledge are key elements to successfully expand value added wood product exports to Japan. 3aexports 3awood 3avalue added 3aUnited States 3aJapan 0aforest products0 tForest products journal.g1992 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.40-44x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01657naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245016100171300001600332520057900348650002600927650002800953650002200981650002601003650001901029650001401048653001101062700001301073700001401086773007601100852000901176856007801185939003301263946001101296655001201307IND9205462420221118003719.0920901e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920546242DNAL7 a242135492pmid7 a10.1007/BF002321692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeier, T.10aHigh uniformity of plants regenerated from cytogenetically variable embryogenic suspension cultures of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Klotzsch)  ap. 150-154.  aShoot tip explants, callus and embryogenic cell suspensions of Euphorbia pulcherrima have been examined for quantitative variation in nuclear DNA content by means of cytophotometry.

At the highest infestation level (75%), R. dominica caused significant (P < 0.05) increases in the mineral matter of wheat and sorghum grains owing to loss of endosperm contents, but the increase due to T. granarium damage was not significant. On the other hand, R. dominica did not significantly change the mineral content of maize but a significant (P < 0.05) reduction was noticed at 75% infestation by T. granarium. Mixed populations of both species showed intermediate changes in the mineral contents of the three cereal grains. Storage of uninfested grains up to 4 months did not induce any appreciable changes in the levels of the six minerals. Variations in mineral content in relation to distribution in seed components and to feeding habits of insects have been discussed in the paper. 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aTrogoderma granarium 3astored products 3apests 3amineral content 3acorn 3awheat 3agrain storage facilities 0astorage losses1 aKapoor, A.C.1 aSingh, R.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1992 July, v. 28, no. 3 p.147-151x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03456naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002300174245013800197300001600335500002400351520143100375650001901806650001201825650001001837650001401847650001901861650002001880650003101900650002001931650001301951650001301964650002401977650005402001650003802055650007402093650006502167650001102232650002802243650001402271650005302285650007502338650002302413653001502436653001902451700002102470700002702491700001902518773016002537852000902697856007702706930003302783945002502816946001302841655001202854IND4416453320221118003625.0090217e20090128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441645332DNAL7 a190907642pmid7 a10.1021/jf802709k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aBotton, Alessandro10aPeach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) Allergen-Encoding Genes Are Developmentally Regulated and Affected by Fruit Load and Light Radiation  ap. 724-734.  aIncludes references  aThe fruits of Rosaceae species may frequently induce allergic reactions in both adults and children, especially in the Mediterranean area. In peach, true allergens and cross-reactive proteins may cause hypersensitive reactions involving a wide diversity of symptoms. Three known classes of allergenic proteins, namely, Pru p 1, Pru p 3, and Pru p 4, have been reported to be mostly involved, but an exhaustive survey of the proteins determining the overall allergenic potential, their biological functions, and the factors affecting the expression of the related genes is still missing. In the present study, the expression profiles of some selected genes encoding peach allergen isoforms were studied during fruit growth and development and upon different fruit load and light radiation regimens. The results indicate that the majority of allergen-encoding genes are expressed at their maximum during the ripening stage, therefore representing a potential risk for peach consumers. Nevertheless, enhancing the light radiation and decreasing the fruit load achieved a reduction of the transcription rate of most genes and a possible decrease of the overall allergenic potential at harvest. According to these data, new growing practices could be set up to obtain hypoallergenic peach fruits and eventually combined with the cultivation of hypoallergenic genotypes to obtain a significant reduction of the allergenic potential. 3aPrunus persica 3apeaches 3agenes 3aallergens 3aplant proteins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3asolar radiation 3afruiting 3aripening 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntigens, Plantxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aFood Hypersensitivityximmunology 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxradiation effects 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPrunusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxradiation effects. 2aSequence Alignment 0afruit load 0aripening stage1 aAndreotti, Carlo1 aCosta, G.q(Guglielmo)1 aRamina, Angelo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Jan. 28, v. 57, no. 2 p.724-734dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf802709k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03137naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012600145300001600271500001500287520146100302650001301763650001101776650001701787650000901804650001201813650001001825650003101835650003701866650001901903650002001922650001201942650002301954650003901977650007602016650005402092650003102146650000902177650003402186650004002220650002502260650001402285653001502299653001902314653001302333653002802346653002702374653001302401700001502414773008902429852000902518939003302527946001102560655001202571IND9205456520221118003956.0920831e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920545652DNAL7 a13537582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollings, S.10aFurther studies on some physical and biochemical characteristics of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides of feline origin  ap. 529-535.  a2019-12-04  aThe ultrastructure of the appendages of 24 strains of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides spp. of cats was studied by transmission electron microscopy. All strains examined by thin section showed abundant fimbriae, outer membrane vesicles and capsules. Negative staining showed fimbriae which varied from long, fine and wavy in Bact. salivosus and cat Group 2 to shorter, less abundant and thicker fimbriae in cat strains of Bact. gingivalis as well as type strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis and P. asaccharolytica. Capsular material was very thick amorphous in human P. gingivalis, cat strains of Bact. gingivalis and in P. assaccharolytica but fine and fibrillary in preparations of Bact. salivosus and cat Group 2 organisms. Wet india ink preparations showed a large capsule although those of Bact. salivosus and Group 2 appeared largest. Five-day Group 2 broth cultures featured a thick ropy growth consistent with a large accumulation of extracellular slime. Enzymatic activities of the 24 strains measured by API ZYM system as well as the conventional biochemical tests showed it was possible to differentiate reliably Bact. salivosus from the other cat strains of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides species and from human P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis by a combination of these tests. These tests suggest that Bact. salivosus is unlikely to belong to the genus Prevotella. Its place within the genus Porphyromonas is still to be determined. 3afimbriae 3ahumans 3apigmentation 3acats 3aenzymes 3amouth 3aphysicochemical properties 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBacterial Capsulesxultrastructure 2aBacteroidesxclassificationxpathogenicityxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aBacteroides Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCat Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aCats 2aCell Membranexultrastructure 2aFimbriae, Bacterialxultrastructure 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aVirulence 0abacteroids 0aidentification 0acapsules 0aouter membrane vesicles 0aanatomy and morphology 0avesicles1 aLove, D.N.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1992 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.529-535x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02177naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014700128300001600275500001500291520126400306650001201570650002301582650001601605650002201621650000901643650002101652653002701673653001101700773009901711852000901810939003301819946001101852655001201863IND9205455020221118003940.0920831s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920545502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPherson, L.10aEffects of the consumption of fully cooked red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) on the growth rate of rats and the morphology of the gut wall  ap. 611-621.  a2019-12-04  aOver an 8-week period six rats were fed a fixed quantity of a diet consisting of a purified diet (AIN76A) into which red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L), previously cooked at 100 degrees C for 30 min, dried and ground, were incorporated at the level of 100 g kg-1. Another six rats were fed AIN76A as a control diet. Weekly weight, weight gain and efficiency of feed conversion were noted for each rat. Six days prior to the end of the experiment, faeces were collected daily from each rat and the moisture, protein and lipid content as well as the bacterial flora of the pooled sample for each rat were determined. At the end of the 8-week period the rats were anaethetised with ether and decapitated. Two areas of the gut wall were examined histologically, and the serum was analysed for protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, cholesterol, urea N, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, aspartine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lipase, total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chlorine and carbon dioxide. Whereas no damage to the gut wall of the control animals was observed, varying amounts of damage were evident in the test animals.

These studies indicate that natural perchlorate is likely deposited by atmospheric deposition. Perchlorate concentration of total (dry + wet) deposition is relatively unstudied yet these measurements will aid in understanding natural levels in the environment. We sampled total deposition monthly at six sites in Suffolk County, Long Island, NY from November 30, 2005 until July 5, 2007. The mean perchlorate concentration is 0.21 ± 0.04 (standard error) μg L⁻¹ with a maximum value of 2.78 μg L⁻¹ . Here we show up to an 18-fold increase above the mean concentration in July 2006 and July 2007 samples. It appears that this increase in perchlorate in total deposition is associated with Fourth of July fireworks. 3aperchlorates 3awet deposition 3apollution 3aexplosives 3aNew York 0aprecipitation1 aHanson, Gilbert N.1 aJackson, W.

Compared to their regional background, particulate Pb, Zn and Cd were found to be most enriched, suggesting anthropogenic inputs from bed sediments into the water column mainly due to physical disturbances induced by barges traffics. Conversely, no significant enrichments of particulate metals such as Cu, Cr and Ni were observed in Deûle SPM. Characterization of SPM with analyses of mineralogical and chemical compositions--using environmental scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (ESEM/EDS)--indicated the presence of micro-specimens attributed to anthropogenic minerals, mostly PbS and ZnS. The calculated enrichment index (or the geoaccumulation index, I geo), enrichment factor (EF) and the partition coefficient (K d) confirmed that SPM was strongly polluted in cadmium, lead and zinc, moderately polluted in copper and unpolluted in chromium and nickel. Based on the analytical data obtained for SPM from the BCR (European Community Bureau of Reference) sequential extraction scheme, it was concluded that: (i) the reducible phases were largely more important for the binding of Pb and Cd than that of Zn and Ni and in a lesser extent Cu and Cr; (ii) copper was found to be mostly associated with the sulphides/organics fraction; (iii) chromium with a lithogenic origin was extracted in the largest percentage in the residual phase; and (iv) zinc was bound to the exchangeable-carbonate phase in the largest percentage in the particles analysed, followed by nickel and cadmium, suggesting that these metals might be easily remobilized if changes in environmental conditions would occur. 3awater pollution 3arivers 3awater quality 3aheavy metals 3awater analysis 3amine spoil 3ametallurgy 3aFrance 0ahydrochemistry1 aLourino-Cabana, B.1 aBillon, G.1 aProix, N.1 aRecourt, P.1 aOuddane, B.1 aFischer, J.

The determination of heavy metals in water and sediments was carried out in a previous study. Zooplankton was analyzed quali- and quantitatively. Total density, by-group density (Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera), micro and mesozooplankton density, biomass, species richness (S), and species diversity (H) were studied. The results showed that total density of zooplankton was significantly higher in the river than in the channels and streams (p < 0.001), with dominance of rotifers but a higher copepod biomass. Calanoida dominated over Ciclopoidea and Harpacticoida. Total species richness was 74, showing the highest values (59 and 56) at the points corresponding to the Salado River at localities Manucho and San Justo (MSR, SJSR) and the lowest ones in North and South channels (NCH, SCH), with 16 and 17 species, respectively), and in the two sampling stations of Las Prusianas stream (LP1, LP2), between 13 and 38 species. The species diversity showed low values (1.8 to 2.3) in channels and streams, and higher values (3.0) in the Salado River, at Manucho and San Justo. Absolute biomass varied in the order SJSR > MSR > LP1 > NCH > SCH > LP2, similarly to absolute density, which varied in the order SJSR > MSR > LP1 > NCH > SCH > LP2. The comparison of the content of heavy metals in water between the control site (SJSR) and the most contaminated sites showed significant differences with the North and Las Prusianas 1 and 2 channels (ANOVA p = 0.001; 0.012 and 0.011, respectively) and non-significant differences, although close to the significance level, with the South Channel and Manucho (p = 0.08; p = 0.059). The following positive correlations were found: depth with mesozooplankton density, H and S (p < 0.001); temperature with microzooplankton density, H and S (p < 0.004), and dissolved oxygen with mesozooplankton density, H and S (p < 0.01), but not with microzooplankton, indicating a higher tolerance of the organisms belonging to this fraction. A negative correlation was found between biomass of copepods and concentration of Pb and Cu (p < 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). Rotifers were the most tolerant to heavy metal contamination, followed by copepods and cladocerans. Diversity (H) and richness (S) were good indicators of stress of contaminated systems. The clustering of biological variables and the concentration of heavy metals in water and sediments showed three groups of environments: the first one was the main course of the river, with lower contamination by heavy metals and higher density, biomass, H and S, which separated clearly from the other two groups of the tributaries, composed by channels and streams. In the tributaries, r strategists and a few tolerant species, such as Eucyclops neumani, proliferated. The results of this study show that zooplankton responds as good descriptor of water quality, constituting an efficient tool to assess heavy metal contamination. 3arivers 3awater pollution 3aheavy metals 3achromium 3acopper 3alead 3acadmium 3asediment contamination 3azooplankton 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation density 3aeutrophication 3awater quality 3aindicator species 3aArgentina1 aPaggi, J.

The goals of the study were to validate the use of TOUGH2-LGM by reproducing real field profiles obtained under different conditions and to evaluate the depth of O₂ penetration under several conditions. TOUGH2-LGM handles both advective and diffusive gas fluxes. The oxidation reaction was simulated by imposing a Neumann condition, i.e. CH₄ was extracted from pre-determined elements. The main variables of concern were the degree of water saturation of the PMOB, the pressure differential between its base and the surface, the position and thickness of the oxidation front and, finally, the oxidation rate, i.e. the rate at which CH₄ was removed from the system. Other important variables, such as the gas permeability and diffusion coefficient were obtained in the laboratory. Inspection of the results shows that TOUGH2-LGM was able to quite accurately reproduce the field profiles. The simulator also makes it possible to predict the depth of O₂ penetration as a function of pressure differential and humidity within the PMOB. This type of information is fundamental for the design of effective biocovers. 3agreenhouse gases 3asimulation models 3alandfills 3apollution control 3agas production (biological) 3abiofilters 3amethane 3amodel validation 3aoxidation 3aair pollution 3aQuebec 0amathematical models 0abiocovers1 aCabral, Alexandre1 aAllaire, Suzanne E.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Mar., v. 198, no. 1-4 p.253-267dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9843-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002500172245006800197300001600265500002400281500001500305520102000320650001301340650001101353650002101364650002301385650002901408650001701437650001501454650002101469650002001490650002301510653001801533653002101551653002301572700002501595773010001620852000901720856008501729930003301814945002501847946001101872655001201883IND4416399520221118003851.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9281-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aK001 0aJ1001 aMadritch, Michael D.10aRemoval of invasive shrubs reduces exotic earthworm populations  ap. 663-671.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInvasive species are a leading threat to native ecosystems, and research regarding their effective control is at the forefront of applied ecology. Exotic facilitation has been credited with advancing the success of several aggressive invasive species. Here, we suggest using the knowledge of exotic facilitations to control invasive earthworm populations. In northern hardwood forests, the invasive shrubs Rhamnus cathartica (buckthorn) and Lonicera x bella (honeysuckle) produce high quality leaf litter, and their abundance is positively correlated with exotic earthworms, which increase nutrient cycling rates. We performed an invasive plant removal experiment in two northern hardwood forest stands, one dominated by buckthorn and the other by honeysuckle. Removal of invasive shrubs reduced exotic earthworm populations by roughly 50% for the following 3 years. By targeting invasive species that are part of positive feedback loops, land managers can multiply the positive effects of invasive species removal. 3aLonicera 3ashrubs 3ahardwood forests 3aintroduced species 3aenvironmental management 3apest control 3aearthworms 3ainvasive species 3apopulation size 3aRhamnus cathartica 0ashrub removal 0aLonicera x bella 0apopulation ecology1 aLindroth, Richard L.0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.663-671dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9281-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03087naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100003600181245010200217300001600319500002400335520148100359650002201840650002101862650002401883650002301907650001401930650002401944650002301968650001901991650001202010650001702022650001502039650002202054650002102076650002302097651001302120653001902133653002502152653002302177700002702200700002202227700002102249773010002270852000902370856008502379930003302464945002502497946001102522655001202533IND4416399420221118003644.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9280-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF300 0aF600 0aJ1001 aRodríguez-Echeverría, Susana 10aBelowground mutualists and the invasive ability of Acacia longifolia in coastal dunes of Portugal  ap. 651-661.  aIncludes references  aThe ability to form symbiotic associations with soil microorganisms and the consequences for plant growth were studied for three woody legumes grown in five different soils of a Portuguese coastal dune system. Seedlings of the invasive Acacia longifolia and the natives Ulex europaeus and Cytisus grandiflorus were planted in the five soil types in which at least one of these species appear in the studied coastal dune system. We found significant differences between the three woody legumes in the number of nodules produced, final plant biomass and shoot ¹⁵N content. The number of nodules produced by A. longifolia was more than five times higher than the number of nodules produced by the native legumes. The obtained ¹⁵N values suggest that both A. longifolia and U. europaeus incorporated more biologically-fixed nitrogen than C. grandiflorus which is also the species with the smallest distribution. Finally, differences were also found between the three species in the allocation of biomass in the different studied soils. Acacia longifolia displayed a lower phenotypic plasticity than the two native legumes which resulted in a greater allocation to aboveground biomass in the soils with lower nutrient content. We conclude that the invasive success of A. longifolia in the studied coastal sand dune system is correlated to its capacity to nodulate profusely and to use the biologically-fixed nitrogen to enhance aboveground growth in soils with low N content. 3aAcacia longifolia 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3acolonizing ability 3amutualism 3asoil microorganisms 3aindigenous species 3aUlex europaeus 3aCytisus 3aplant growth 3anodulation 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen content 3acoastal dune soils 3aPortugal 0anative legumes 0aCytisus grandiflorus 0abiomass allocation1 aCrisóstomo, João A. 1 aNabais, Cristina 1 aFreitas, Helena 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.651-661dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9280-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002500172245014400197300001600341500002400357500001500381520180300396650001402199650003002213650001902243650002702262650002102289650002902310650001902339650001002358651001002368653002002378700002202398773011302420852000902533856008502542930003302627945002502660946001102685655001202696IND4416343520221118003711.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441634352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9842-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aJ5001 aKundu, Manik Chandra10aAgricultural Activities Influence Nitrate and Fluoride Contamination in Drinking Groundwater of an Intensively Cultivated District in India  ap. 243-252.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe assessed the potential of nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃-N) and fluoride (F) contamination in drinking groundwater of an intensively cultivated district in India as a function of its agricultural activities. Three hundred and forty two groundwater samples were collected from different types of wells with varying depths and analyzed for pH, EC, NO₃-N load and F content. Database on predominant cropping system, fertilizer and pesticide uses were also recorded for the district. The NO₃-N load in groundwater samples were low ranging from 0.01 to 5.97 mg L⁻¹ with only 6.7% of them contained greater than 3.0 mg L⁻¹. Samples from the habitational areas showed higher NO₃-N content over the agricultural fields. But all the samples contained NO₃-N below the 10 mg L⁻¹, the threshold limit fixed by WHO for drinking purpose. The content decreased with increasing depth of wells (r = -0.297, P <= 0.01) and increased with increasing rate of nitrogenous fertilizer application (r = 0.931, P <= 0.01) and was higher in areas where shallow-rather than deep-rooted crops are grown. Fluoride content in groundwater was also low (0.02 to 1.19 mg L⁻¹) with only 2.4% of them exceeding 1.0 mg L⁻¹ posing a potential threat of fluorosis in some locality. On average, its content varied little spatially and along depth of sampling aquifers indicating homogeneity in lithology of the district. The content showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.237, P <= 0.01) with the amount of phosphatic fertilizer (single super phosphate) used for agriculture. Results thus indicated that the groundwater of the study area is presently safe for drinking purpose but some anthropogenic activities associated with intensive cultivation had a positive influence on its loading with NO₃-N and F. 3afluorides 3agroundwater contamination 3awater analysis 3afertilizer application 3anitrate nitrogen 3aanthropogenic activities 3adrinking water 3awells 3aIndia 0awater pollution1 aMandal, Biswapati0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Mar., v. 198, no. 1-4 p.243-252dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9842-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090310b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002000163245014200183300001600325500002400341520151200365650002301877650002101900650002401921650002501945650001501970650002201985650002502007650001902032650003702051653002802088653002102116653002402137653002402161653002802185653002802213700001902241700002702260700002402287773010002311852000902411856008502420930003302505945002502538946001102563655001202574IND4416399020221118003752.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9275-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aX3301 aValéry, Loïc 10aEcosystem-level consequences of invasions by native species as a way to investigate relationships between evenness and ecosystem function  ap. 609-617.  aIncludes references  aBiodiversity is currently undermined worldwide principally as a result of human activities. The irreversibility of species extinction has encouraged the research community to investigate the potential effect of declining species or functional group diversity and/or composition on ecosystem function since the beginning of the 1990s. However, while changes in relative abundance among species (i.e., evenness) are more frequent than extinction of species and are able to cause important changes in ecosystem function, most studies have curiously not examined thoroughly the potential role of that diversity component. The few small-scale experimental manipulations that have so far examined the relationship between evenness and ecosystem function have produced ambiguous results, sometimes indicating an effect on selected functions, and sometimes not. Because one reason for the inconsistency of the previous results may be scale-dependency issues, we propose here an alternative approach, investigation of this relationship directly at the system-level through the opportunity offered by field studies of ecosystem-level consequences of invasions by native species. Indeed, the specificities of changes in ecosystem structure induced by native invaders compared to exotic ones could constitute a useful tool to improve our understanding of the relationship between evenness and ecosystem function as well as to evaluate the importance of the spatial arrangement of species in the stability of ecosystems. 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental impact 3aecosystems 3aspecies diversity 3afunctional diversity 3aeutrophication 3astructure-activity relationships 0anative invasive species 0aecosystem impact 0aecosystem stability 0aecosystem structure 0asystems theory approach 0aoligotrophic ecosystems1 aFritz, Hervé 1 aLefeuvre, Jean-Claude 1 aSimberloff, Daniel 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.609-617dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9275-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03230naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100002100199245010500220300001600325500002400341520177100365650001902136650002102155650002602176650002002202650004002222650001902262650001902281650002002300650001402320650002402334650002202358650002602380650001702406651001802423700002002441773010002461852000902561856008502570930003302655945002502688946001102713655001202724IND4416398720221118003736.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9272-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aK001 0aF900 0aF300 0aF600 0aJ5001 aCunard, Chelsea 10aIs patience a virtue?

Mill.) threatens North American forests by inhibiting tree regeneration. While glossy buckthorn commonly invades younger, developing forests, we hypothesized that this species is competitively excluded as secondary succession proceeds. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that glossy buckthorn mortality in New Hampshire forests is associated with low levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), low levels of nutrients in the soil, and greater abundance of shade tolerant tree species. Twenty-six living and 26 dead glossy buckthorn individuals were randomly selected on three, mid-successional study sites in southeastern New Hampshire, USA. Shrub ages, indicated by wood ring counts, showed that both living and dead shrubs were members of the same cohort, roughly 16-18 years of age. Living and dead shrubs were compared as to (1) tree basal area in the surrounding forest (estimated by plot sampling), (2) light intensity in the vicinity of the buckthorn crowns (measured by Sunfleck Ceptometer), (3) canopy openness and % total transmitted PAR (estimated by hemispheric photography), and (4) concentrations of available Ca, P, Mg, and K in the B horizon. Relative to live buckthorn shrubs, dead individuals were associated with greater basal area of shade tolerant species, decreased PAR in the vicinity of shrub crown, and decreased soil concentrations of Ca, P, and Mg. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that competition for light and perhaps nutrients limits the ability of glossy buckthorn to persist in late successional stands. If these relationships are causal, active removal of glossy buckthorn might not be required to reduce its abundance in late successional stands. 3aFrangula alnus 3ainvasive species 3aecological succession 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrients 3ashade tolerance 3amortality 3aecological invasion 3aplant competition 3acompetitive exclusion 3aforest trees 3aNew Hampshire1 aLee, Thomas D. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.577-586dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9272-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02740naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001800154245010100172300001600273500002400289500001500313520147600328650003001804650001001834650002301844650002401867650001401891650002301905651001601928653001501944653002901959653002701988700001902015700002102034773010002055852000902155856008502164930003302249945002502282946001102307655001202318IND4416398820221118003705.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9273-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3101 aAlvsvåg, J. 10aEvidence for a permanent establishment of the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in the Barents Sea  ap. 587-595.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the Atlantic the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) is naturally distributed on the northwestern side, i.e. eastern Canada and west Greenland. Until recently, there have been no observations of snow crab in eastern Atlantic. However, in 1990s single and occasional reports were made of crabs captured in the eastern part of the Barents Sea, presumably introduced through ballast water. Special attention during the annual bottom-trawl surveys in the Barents Sea during February 2004-2006 were given to include recordings of snow crab to evaluate if the introduced species has succeeded to establish a self-sustaining population in this region. Recordings of snow crabs were systematically noted and biological measurements carried out. The results confirm previous Russian observations of snow crabs in the northern region of Gåsebanken. In addition, a significant number of crabs were also found in the central region of the Barents Sea, mainly in deeper waters from 180 to 350 m depth. The sizes ranged from 14 to 136 mm carapace width. All females above 70 mm were berried with fertilised eggs. A major fraction (31% in 2005; 76% in 2006) of the crabs consisted of juveniles below 50 mm CW, providing evidence for successful recruitment. The small-sized crabs were exclusively found in Gåsebanken, identifying the main recruiting area at present for snow crab in the Barents Sea. The results obtained show that the snow crab is now adapted to the northeast Atlantic. 3ageographical distribution 3acrabs 3aintroduced species 3aChionoecetes opilio 3abody size 3apopulation ecology 3aBarents Sea 0aadaptation 0apopulation establishment 0apopulation recruitment1 aAgnalt, A.-L. 1 aJørstad, K.

How invasive plants affect native animals, and to what extent native animals respond to changes in their habitat and the novel selection pressures that follow, is not well known. We investigated the impacts of a habitat-altering invader, the Atlantic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, on the nesting success of Alameda song sparrows (Melospiza melodia pusillula), a California Species of Special Concern, in tidal marshes in three sites in San Francisco Bay. Date of laying was the most influential factor in determining daily survival rate of nests, but whether the nest was placed in exotic Spartina was the most important ecological variable. Nests placed in exotic Spartina had a success rate that was 30% lower than those placed in native vegetation. Nests in exotic Spartina were significantly more likely to fail due to tidal flooding than were nests placed in native vegetation, because the densest stands of exotic Spartina occurred at significantly lower elevations relative to the tides. Our results suggest that exotic Spartina may be an ecological trap for song sparrows in San Francisco Bay, attracting birds to nest sites that are often destroyed by tidal flooding. 3aSpartina alterniflora 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3asalt marshes 3aindigenous species 3awild birds 3anesting sites 3anests 3aterritoriality 3aCalifornia 0aecological impact 0aMelospiza melodia pusillula 0aCistothorus palustris 0anesting success 0atidal flooding 0aSan Francisco Bay1 aCohen, Andrew N. 1 aBeissinger, Steven R. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.565-575dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9271-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02805naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002900172245014500201300001600346500002400362520148500386650001301871650002101884650002601905650001501931650002401946650001501970650001001985650002601995651001902021653002302040653002202063653002302085773010002108852000902208856008502217930003302302945002502335946001102360655001202371IND4416398220221118003713.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441639822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9267-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aM001 0aM3101 aHirsch, Philipp Emanuel 10aFreshwater crayfish invasions: former crayfish invader Galician crayfish hands title “invasive” over to new invader spiny-cheek crayfish  ap. 515-521.  aIncludes references  aBiological invasions are a major threat to global biodiversity. Invasive freshwater crayfish in that context are especially prominent for their negative effects on both ecosystem integrity and native crayfish. However, some systems may have supported a crayfish species not originally native to the system without perceivable negative consequences for the ecosystem while other invasive crayfish species may constitute a major threat to ecosystem stability. Here I present an example how two crayfish, the spiny-cheek and the Galician crayfish both by researchers and governmental agencies considered non-native differ in their threats to the native ecosystem. Whereas the spiny-cheek crayfish is a recent potentially disease-transmitting and still spreading invader with high local densities the Galician crayfish might be part of the lake's fauna since several hundred years, appears in lower densities and is unlikely to be a vector of disease. Therefore, regardless of the Galician crayfish's actual date of introduction it is thus a rather “old and integrated” invader, which is now being faced and itself potentially threatened by the emergence of a “new and dangerous” invader: the spiny-cheek crayfish. This also exemplifies that in the face of often insufficient scientific information about dates of species introductions care should be taken in postulating species as invasive and dangerous without any form of risk assessment for their impact on the ecosystem. 3acrayfish 3ainvasive species 3aAstacus leptodactylus 3aCambaridae 3aecological invasion 3afreshwater 3alakes 3acompetitive exclusion 3aLake Constance 0aOrconectes limosus 0ainvasive crayfish 0amultiple invasions0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.515-521dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9267-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090303b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01321naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245004200130300001400172500001500186520061000201650002500811650002800836650001700864653000900881700001900890773007900909852000900988939003300997946001301030655001201043IND9205394520221118003906.0920827e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920539452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, D.W.10aBulk density of yellow-poplar sawlogs  ap. 30-32.  a2019-12-04  aBulk density (green weight per cubic foot of debarked logs) was determined for yellow-poplar sawlogs.

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11228-11232). One form, designated eIF-4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p220 and p26. The other form, designated eIF-(iso)4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p82 and p28, which are antigenically distinct from the subunits of eIF-4F. Both the p26 subunit of eIF-4F and the p28 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F are m7G cap-binding proteins. In this investigation, affinity-purified antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat germ eIF-4F and to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F were used to determine if isozyme forms of eIF-4F are present in maize and cauliflower. Extracts from wheat germ, maize root tips, and cauliflower inflorescences were partially purified by adsorption on m7GTP-Sepharose and elution with M7GTP (MGS eluate). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to the subunits of the wheat germ factors showed that the MGS eluate from maize contains polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F, as well as polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat eIF-4F. The MGS eluate from cauliflower also contains polypeptides that reacted with antibodies to the subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F. These results indicate that both maize and cauliflower contain the isozyme form of eIF-4F. In addition, it was found that the factors in the MGS eluate from maize support polypeptide synthesis in a system from wheat deficient in eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F, whereas the factors in the MGS eluate from cauliflower support polypeptide synthesis only to a small extent. 3awheat germ 3aTriticum aestivum 3aBrassica oleracea var. botrytis 3aZea mays 3aprotein synthesis 3aisozymes 2aBrassicaxmetabolism 2aChromatography, DEAE-Cellulose 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F 2aGenetic Variation 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeptide Initiation Factorsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aTriticumxmetabolism 2aZea maysxmetabolism 0ainitiation 0atranslation1 aWebster, C.1 aRoberts, J.K.M.1 aRavel, J.M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 May 15, v. 267, no. 14 p.10096-10100x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245014600134300002000280500001500300520142700315650001301742650002501755650001101780650001601791653001601807653002301823653001901846653002801865653002501893653001901918700001801937700001501955700001601970700001601986700002002002773009702022852000902119939003302128946001302161655001202174IND9205392320221118003716.0920827e19920515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920539232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujisawa-Sehara, A.10aDifferential trans-activation of muscle-specific regulatory elements including the myosin light chain box by chicken MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4  ap. 10031-10038.  a2019-12-04  aWe have isolated cDNAs encoding a chicken homologue of MRF4 (cMRF4) in addition to chicken MyoD (CMD1) and myogenin (c-myogenin) described previously. In an attempt to understand the roles that cMRF4, CMD1, and c-myogenin play in chicken myogenesis, the effects of these factors on muscle-specific cis-elements identified in regulatory regions of myosin alkali light chain (MLC) genes were examined. The promoter analysis of some of MLC genes has revealed two sorts of muscle-specific positive regulatory elements to date, an enhancer located upstream of the adult type LC1 gene and a cis-element, termed an MLC box, conserved among promoters of various MLC genes. The LC1 enhancer was exclusively trans-activated by CMD1. Although c-myogenin also activated transcription driven by the LC1 promoter, it was suggested that c-myogenin requires a cis-element(s) other than the CMD1-responsive enhancer. Chicken MRF4 could not trans-activate any of the constructs containing the LC1 promoter. In contrast, the promoter of the embryonic L23 gene was trans-activated by all of the three factors. From deletion and mutation analysis, the MLC box was shown to be involved in their positive regulation. These results extend previous observations that individual myogenic regulatory factors exhibit different capabilities in transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes by acting distinctively upon their regulatory elements. 3achickens 3aamino acid sequences 3amyosin 3atransposons 0aembl/d90536 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/d90536 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0apromoter genes1 aNabeshima, Y.1 aKomiya, T.1 aUetsuki, T.1 aAsakura, A.1 aNabeshima, Y.I.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 May 15, v. 267, no. 14 p.10031-10038x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02132naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014300126300001600269500001500285520116600300650002501466650001001491650002001501650002201521651001001543653002401553653001601577653001701593700001501610700001701625773009901642852000901741939003301750946001101783655001201794IND9205396320221118003549.0920827s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920539632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalih, O.M.10aChemical and nutritional composition of two famine food sources used in Sudan, mukheit (Boscia senegalensis) and Maikah (Dobera roxburghi)  ap. 367-377.  a2019-12-04  aThe nutritional value of seeds of mukheit (Boscia senegalensis (Pers) Lam ex Poir) and maikah (Dobera roxburghi Planch) widely used as food in times of famine in western Sudan have been investigated. The chemical composition of each food before and after the traditional debittering process is reported. Both foods compared favourably with the local staple cereals as regards the content of soluble carbohydrate and crude protein with values of 690 and 250 g kg-1 respectively for mukheit debittered by soaking in water at ambient temperature and 800 and 150 g kg-1 respectively for maikah debittered by boiling in water. The nutritional quality, of protein in mukheit debittered by soaking in water at ambient temperature appeared similar to that of sorghum but was markedly enhanced if debittering was performed by boiling, although the crude protein content of the food fell substantially during the latter procedure. The protein of debittered maikah had a chemical score of 85 indicating a quality superior to that of the local cereals. Maikah also represented an exceptionally, rich source of calcium and contained nutritionally, useful quantities of zinc. 3achemical composition 3aseeds 3anutritive value 3afood availability 3aSudan 0aboscia senegalensis 0afood supply 0afood quality1 aNour, A.M.1 aHarper, D.B.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1991, v. 57, no. 3 p.367-377x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01506naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300001600203520076500219650001900984650000901003650000901012650002001021653001701041700001801058773009901076852000901175939003301184946001101217655001201228IND9205396020221118003543.0920827s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920539602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanjoko, V.A.10aStudies of the distribution and bioavailability of soil zinc fractions  ap. 325-334.  aThis investigation was undertaken to study the distribution and availability of Zn in different soil fractions.

E9-E15.  aIncludes references  aDegradation of nutraceuticals in low- and intermediate-moisture foods heated at high temperature (>100 °C) is difficult to model because of the nonisothermal condition. Isothermal experiments above 100 °C are difficult to design because they require high pressure and small sample size in sealed containers. Therefore, a nonisothermal method was developed to estimate the thermal degradation kinetic parameter of nutraceuticals and determine the confidence intervals for the parameters and the predicted Y (concentration). Grape pomace at 42% moisture content (wb) was heated in sealed 202 x 214 steel cans in a steam retort at 126.7 °C for > 30 min. Can center temperature was measured by thermocouple and predicted using Comsol software. Thermal conductivity (k) and specific heat (Cp) were estimated as quadratic functions of temperature using Comsol and nonlinear regression. The k and Cp functions were then used to predict temperature inside the grape pomace during retorting. Similar heating experiments were run at different time-temperature treatments from 8 to 25 min for kinetic parameter estimation. Anthocyanin concentration in the grape pomace was measured using HPLC. Degradation rate constant (k₁₁₀ °C) and activation energy (Ea) were estimated using nonlinear regression. The thermophysical properties estimates at 100 °C were k = 0.501 W/m °C, Cp= 3600 J/kg and the kinetic parameters were k₁₁₀ °C= 0.0607/min and Ea= 65.32 kJ/mol. The 95% confidence intervals for the parameters and the confidence bands and prediction bands for anthocyanin retention were plotted. These methods are useful for thermal processing design for nutraceutical products. 3amodel food systems 3aanthocyanins 3anutrient retention 3agrape pomace 3aheat treatment 3afunctional foods 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3afruit quality 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDrug Stability 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aMathematics 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aThermodynamics 2aTime Factors 2aVitisxchemistry 0anonisothermal heating1 aDolan, K.D.1 aYang, L.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 , v. 73, no. 1 p.E9-E15dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00598.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/15  aOther US 7aarticle03112naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245007700206300001600283500002400299500001500323520139900338650001701737650002001754650001201774650002301786650002801809650001001837650001001847650003301857650002501890650000901915650002801924650001101952650001701963650001601980650004201996650001902038650001102057650000902068650002002077650003202097650001002129650000902139653002402148700001602172700001602188700001902204773010302223852000902326856009202335930003302427945002502460946001302485655001202498IND4400230020221118003745.0080120e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440023002DNAL7 a182113532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00574.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aQ5041 aWright, C.A.10aBeer Consumers' Perceptions of the Health Aspects of Alcoholic Beverages  ap.

This environment includes advertisements, public service announcements, product labels, various health claims, and warnings about the dangers of alcohol consumption. This study used focus groups and questionnaires to examine consumers' perceptions of alcoholic beverages based on their nutritional value and health benefits. The overall purpose of this study was to examine beer consumers' perceptions of the health attributes and content of alcoholic beverages. Volunteers were surveyed at large commercial breweries in California, Missouri, and New Hampshire. The anonymous, written survey was presented in a self-explanatory format and was completed in 5 to 10 min. The content and style of the survey were derived from focus groups conducted in California. The data are separated by location, gender, and over or under the age of 30. Parametric data on beverage rating were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) while the nonparametric data from True/False or Yes/No questions were analyzed using chi-square. Although statistically significant variances did exist between survey location, gender, and age, general trends emerged in areas of inquiry. The findings indicate that a great opportunity exists to inform consumers about the health benefits derived from the moderate consumption of all alcoholic beverages. 3afood beliefs 3anutritive value 3asurveys 3aconsumer attitudes 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3abeers 2aAdult 2aAlcohol Drinkingxpsychology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBeer 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aHealth Food 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTaste 2aWine 0aalcoholic beverages1 aBruhn, C.M.1 aHeymann, H.1 aBamforth, C.W.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 , v. 73, no. 1 p.H12-H17dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00574.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle03305naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140072000900149100001500158245012600173300001500299500002400314520190200338650001402240650001402254650001602268650001402284650001202298650001802310650000902328650001102337650002202348650002002370650001702390650001702407650001902424650002302443653005102466700001802517700001602535773011402551852000902665856008002674930003302754945002502787946001102812655001202823IND4416443520221118003820.0090217e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644352DNAL7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aRuth, M.R.10aEffects of feeding fish oil on mesenteric lymph node cytokine responses in obese leptin receptor-deficient JCR:LA-cp rats  ap. 96-103.  aIncludes references  aObjective: Aberrant immune responses have been identified in obesity; however, immune cells of lymph nodes residing in the inflammatory environment of visceral adipose tissue have been largely overlooked. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can reduce inflammation and modify T-cell function and therefore may improve immune function in obesity. Thus, we determined the effects of feeding fish oil (FO) containing EPA and DHA on mesenteric lymph node (MLN) immune cell function. Methods: In this study, 14-week-old obese, leptin receptor-deficient JCR:LA-cp rats (cp/cp) (n=10 per group) were randomized to one of three nutritionally adequate diets for 3 weeks: control (ctl, 0% EPA+DHA), low FO (LFO, 0.8% w/w EPA+DHA) or high FO (HFO, 1.4% w/w EPA+DHA). Lean JCR:LA-cp (Cp/cp or Cp/Cp) rats (n=5) were fed ctl diet. MLN cell phospholipid (PL) fatty acid composition, phenotypes and cytokine production were measured. Results: Obese ctl rats produced more IL-1β, IL-4 and IL-10, despite a higher proportion of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a lower (n-6):(n-3) PUFA ratio in MLN PL compared with lean ctl rats (P<0.05). Concanavalin A-stimulated IL-2 production did not differ from lean rats even though obese ctl rats had a lower proportion of CD4⁺CD25⁺ cells (P<0.05). Feeding FO to obese rats increased the incorporation of (n-3) PUFA into MLN PL and normalized production of IL-1β (HFO only), IL-4 and IL-10 to the levels similar to lean ctl rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first time that obese JCR:LA-cp rats have impaired responses of MLN immune cells to mitogen stimulation and altered PL fatty acid composition. Feeding FO lowered the ex vivo inflammatory response (HFO only) and production of Th2 cytokines, without changing IL-2 production from ConA-stimulated splenocytes, which may occur independent of leptin signalling. 3afish oils 3amesentery 3alymph nodes 3acytokines 3aobesity 3aanimal models 3arats 3aleptin 3ahormone receptors 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3avisceral fat 3aadipose tissue 3aexperimental diets 0aobese leptin receptor-deficient JCR:LA-cp rats1 aProctor, S.D.1 aField, C.J.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.96-103dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.2273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02691naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002800174245009400202300001600296500002400312520095600336650002201292650001301314650003101327650001401358650000901372650001401381650002901395650003101424650002701455650002701482650005201509650003901561650004701600650002201647650002001669650004501689650003901734650002801773653001601801700002701817773016001844852000902004856007702013930003302090945002502123946001302148655001202161IND4416443020221118003850.0090217e20090128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644302DNAL7 a191238142pmid7 a10.1021/jf80278422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aRufian-Henares, Jose A.10aAntimicrobial Activity of Coffee Melanoidins: A Study of Their Metal-Chelating Properties  ap. 432-438.  aIncludes references  aMelanoidins comprise a substantial proportion of severely heat-treated foods such as baked cereals or roasted coffee and are widely consumed dietary components. The antimicrobial activity of coffee melanoidins against different pathogenic bacteria has been studied, finding that such activity is due to their metal-chelating properties. Three different mechanisms have been observed: at low concentrations melanoidins exerted a bacteriostatic activity mediated by iron chelation from the culture medium; in the case of bacterial strains that are able to produce siderophores for iron acquisition, melanoidins chelate the siderophore-Fe3+ complex, which could decrease the virulence of such pathogenic bacteria; and, finally, coffee melanoidins also exerted a bactericide activity at high concentrations by removing Mg2+ cations from the outer membrane, promoting the disruption of the cell membrane and allowing the release of intracellular molecules. 3acoffee (beverage) 3aroasting 3aMaillard reaction products 3achelation 3airon 3amagnesium 3aantibacterial properties 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aGram-negative bacteria 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBacteriaxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aChelating Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCoffeexchemistry 2aIronxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolymersxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSiderophoresxchemistry 0amelanoidins1 aCueva, Silvia P. de la0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Jan. 28, v. 57, no. 2 p.432-438dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80278423Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle02340naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001900146245011700165300001600282500002400298500001500322520090600337650001601243650001101259650002401270650001901294650001901313650001101332650002201343653003701365653003801402653002901440653001001469700002101479700002401500700002101524700002001545773016001565852000901725856007701734930003301811945002501844946001301869655001201882IND4416442820221118003831.0090217e20090128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644282DNAL7 a10.1021/jf80256982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aPastene, Edgar10aAssociation between Polymerization Degree of Apple Peel Polyphenols and Inhibition of Helicobacter pylori Urease  ap. 416-424.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aApple peel extracts and their fractions pooled according to their molecular size were prepared and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori and Jack bean ureases. Urease Inhibitory effect of apple peel polyphenols (APPE) extracted from the Granny Smith variety was concentration-dependent and reversible. High molecular weight polyphenols (HMW) were more active against Helicobacter pylori and Jack bean ureases than low molecular weight polyphenols with IC50 values of 119 and 800 μg GAE/mL, respectively. The results suggest that monomeric compounds (mainly flavan-3-ols-and quercetin-O-glycosides) will not be implicated in the antiurease effect displayed by the apple peel polyphenolic extract. Thus, as a byproduct, apple peel is suitable for developing functional ingredients that could be useful for neutralizing an important Helicobacter pylori colonization factor. 3apolyphenols 3aapples 3aHelicobacter pylori 3apolymerization 3afruit extracts 3aurease 3aenzyme inhibition 0alow molecular weight polyphenols 0ahigh molecular weight polyphenols 0adegree of polymerization 0apeels1 aTroncoso, Miriam1 aFigueroa, Guillermo1 aAlarcón, Julio.1 aSpeisky, Hernan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Jan. 28, v. 57, no. 2 p.416-424dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80256983Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03573naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140072000900149100001500158245012200173300001400295500002400309520174300333650002502076650002202101650001002123650004802133650002502181650002502206650002302231650002202254650004302276650002502319650003502344650002302379650000802402650001002410650001602420651001202436653004902448653003802497700002002535700002002555700001702575700001902592700001902611700001802630700001702648700001802665700001702683773011302700852000902813856008002822930003302902945002502935946001102960655001202971IND4416443120221118003808.0090217e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644312DNAL7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aKallio, P.10aAssociation of sequence variations in the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 with adiponectin  ap. 80-88.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) binds to IGF and thus modulates IGF signaling pathway. We have shown earlier that the IGFBP5 gene was downregulated in the adipose tissue after 12-week carbohydrate diet with low insulinemic response. Objective: The aim was to examine the putative contribution of genetic variation of the IGFBP5 gene to the characteristics of metabolic syndrome and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS). Methods: DPS is a longitudinal study where 522 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to either lifestyle intervention group or control group. DNA was available from 507 subjects (mean body mass index (BMI) 31.2+4.5 kg/m2, age 55+7 years). The eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from HapMap database and genotyped by Taqman allelic discrimination protocol. The main results were confirmed in a larger cross-sectional study population (METSIM). In addition, the gene expression of IGFBP5 was studied in two previously published study populations (FUNGENUT and GENOBIN) of 124 subjects with insulin resistance (BMI 32.2+3.5 kg/m2, age 57.7+7.4 years). Results: Three out of eight IGFBP5 markers (rs9341234, rs3276 and rs11575134) were significantly associated with circulating adiponectin concentrations in men. Furthermore, mRNA expression studies of subcutaneous adipose tissue showed that mRNA concentrations of IGFBP5 correlated with adiponectin concentrations in all subjects and in women. None of the IGFBP5 SNPs were associated with T2DM. Conclusions: Our findings show that IGFBP5 has a gender-specific association with adiponectin, which may modulate the development of metabolic syndrome. 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3agenes 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3anutrition physiology 3abiochemical pathways 3ametabolic syndrome 3adisease incidence 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3alongitudinal studies 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agender differences 3amen 3awomen 3aadiponectin 3aFinland 0ainsulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 0aFinnish Diabetes Prevention Study1 aTolppanen, A.M.1 aKolehmainen, M.1 aPoutanen, K.1 aLindström, J.1 aTuomilehto, J.1 aKuulasmaa, T.1 aKuusisto, J.1 aPulkkinen, L.1 aUusitupa, M.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.80-88dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.1963Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03878naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163072000900181100001600190245015500206300001400361500002400375500001500399506007600414520218300490506003702673650000902710650001402719650001102733650003502744650001902779650002202798650001902820650003702839650001002876650002002886650001702906653001102923653002002934653002202954653001302976700001302989700001803002700001803020700001503038773011303053852000903166856008003175930003303255945002503288946001103313655001203324IND4416442020221207121002.0090217e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644202DNAL7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.2282doi7 aPMC32170352pmcid7 a190300072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aSegal, N.L.10aGenetic and environmental contributions to body mass index: comparative analysis of monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins and same-age unrelated siblings  ap. 37-41.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Earlier studies have established that a substantial percentage of variance in obesity-related phenotypes is explained by genetic components. However, only one study has used both virtual twins (VTs) and biological twins and was able to simultaneously estimate additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared environmental components in body mass index (BMI). Our current goal was to re-estimate four components of variance in BMI, applying a more rigorous model to biological and virtual multiples with additional data. Virtual multiples share the same family environment, offering unique opportunities to estimate common environmental influence on phenotypes that cannot be separated from the non-additive genetic component using only biological multiples. Methods: Data included 929 individuals from 164 monozygotic twin pairs, 156 dizygotic twin pairs, five triplet sets, one quadruplet set, 128 VT pairs, two virtual triplet sets and two virtual quadruplet sets. Virtual multiples consist of one biological child (or twins or triplets) plus one same-aged adoptee who are all raised together since infancy. We estimated the additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared random components in BMI using a linear mixed model. The analysis was adjusted for age, age², age³, height, height², height³, gender and race. Results: Both non-additive genetic and common environmental contributions were significant in our model (P-values<0.0001). No significant additive genetic contribution was found. In all, 63.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51.8-75.3%) of the total variance of BMI was explained by a non-additive genetic component, 25.7% (95% CI 13.8-37.5%) by a common environmental component and the remaining 10.7% by an unshared component. Conclusion: Our results suggest that genetic components play an essential role in BMI and that common environmental factors such as diet or exercise also affect BMI. This conclusion is consistent with our earlier study using a smaller sample and shows the utility of virtual multiples for separating non-additive genetic variance from common environmental variance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet 3aphenotype 3ahumans 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3acohort studies 3aphysical activity 3ahuman genetics 3agenotype-environment interaction 3atwins 3abody mass index 3aheritability 0atraits 0adizygotic twins 0amonozygotic twins 0asiblings1 aFeng, R.1 aMcGuire, S.A.1 aAllison, D.B.1 aMiller, S.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.37-41dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.2283Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02559naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001800165245007400183300001600257500002400273520081900297650003301116650002301149650002001172650001601192650002001208650002501228650001201253650003101265650002401296650004601320650002501366650004701391650002101438650001101459650002801470650003801498650004001536653001601576653002101592700001701613700001901630700001901649700002001668773016001688852000901848856007701857930003301934945002501967946001301992655001202005IND4416446720221118003817.0090217e20090128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644672DNAL7 a191174022pmid7 a10.1021/jf803072r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3801 aHsu, Ruei-Lin10aAmyloid-Degrading Ability of Nattokinase from Bacillus subtilis Natto  ap. 503-508.  aIncludes references  aMore than 20 unrelated proteins can form amyloid fibrils in vivo which are related to various diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, prion disease, and systematic amyloidosis. Amyloid fibrils are an ordered protein aggregate with a lamellar cross-β structure. Enhancing amyloid clearance is one of the targets of the therapy of these amyloid-related diseases. Although there is debate on whether the toxicity is due to amyloids or their precursors, research on the degradation of amyloids may help prevent or alleviate these diseases. In this study, we explored the amyloid-degrading ability of nattokinase, a fibrinolytic subtilisin-like serine protease, and determined the optimal conditions for amyloid hydrolysis. This ability is shared by proteinase K and subtilisin Carlsberg, but not by trypsin or plasmin. 3aBacillus subtilis var. natto 3aserine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3aproteolysis 3aanimal proteins 3amedicinal properties 3aamyloid 2aAlzheimer Diseasextherapy 2aAmyloidxmetabolism 2aBacillus subtilisxchemistryxenzymology. 2aBacteriaxenzymology 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHumans 2aPrion Diseasesxtherapy 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aSubtilisinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0anattokinase 0aamyloid proteins1 aLee, Kung-Ta1 aWang, Jung-Hao1 aLee, Lily Y.L.1 aChen, Rita P.Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Jan. 28, v. 57, no. 2 p.503-508dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf803072r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03966naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177100001700186245007900203300001600282500002400298500001500322520183700337650002202174650002002196650001702216650001102233650001802244650002102262650001402283650001202297650001302309650002202322650001202344650001602356650003402372650001002406650002202416650002802438650002502466650002102491650001102512650002602523650001102549650001902560650001802579650000902597650003702606650003002643650002502673650002102698650003002719650002302749653002302772653002302795653001902818700001402837700001802851700001802869700001702887700001902904773011502923852000903038856008003047930003303127945002503160946001103185655001203196IND4416447220221118003818.0090217e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441644722DNAL7 a190506732pmid7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.2262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aX3801 aCamastra, S.10aDaylong pituitary hormones in morbid obesity: effects of bariatric surgery  ap. 166-172.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aModerate obesity is known to be associated with multiple endocrine abnormalities. Less information is available on the hormonal status of patients with morbid obesity and on the effects of major weight loss. We studied 16 severely obese (BMI 40.6-69.9 kg/m2) nondiabetic patients and 7 nonobese (BMI range 24.6-27.7 kg/m2), sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. During 24 h in a metabolic ward, four meals were administered and hourly blood samples were drawn from a central venous catheter for the measurement of glucose, insulin, leptin, thyrotropic hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH) and prolactin. Insulin sensitivity was measured by a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Studies were repeated 6 months after biliopancreatic diversion, a mainly malabsorptive surgical approach, which caused an average weight loss of 35+/-4 kg (or 26+/-2% of initial weight). Compared with controls, patients were hyperinsulinaemic (290+/-31 vs 88+/-4 pmol l-1, P=0.0002), insulin resistant (23.5+/-2.8 vs 52.9+/-4.9 micromol min-1 kg(FFM)-1, P=0.0006) and hyperleptinaemic (52.5+/-5.8 vs 10.9+/-3 ng ml-1, P=0.0002). Plasma TSH levels were increased throughout the day-night cycle (averaging 2.02+/-0.18 vs 1.09+/-0.19 microunit ml-1 of controls, P=0.01), whereas serum GH levels were suppressed (0.46+/-0.10 vs 3.01+/-1.15, P=0.002). Following surgery, the hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance were fully normalized; in concomitance with a major drop in leptin levels (to 14.4+/-2.7 ng ml-1, P=0.02), TSH decreased and GH increased to near-normal levels. In the whole dataset, mean 24-h leptin levels were directly related to mean 24-h TSH levels after controlling for confounders this relationship was lost only after adjusting for fat mass. We conclude that in morbid obesity leptin is a determinant of changes in pituitary function. 3abariatric surgery 3apituitary gland 3asomatotropin 3aleptin 3ablood glucose 3adisease severity 3aprolactin 3aobesity 3apatients 3ametabolic studies 3ainsulin 3aweight loss 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 2aAdult 2aBariatric Surgery 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aObesity, Morbidxbloodxsurgery. 2aPituitary Hormonesxblood 2aPostoperative Period 2aProlactinxblood 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aThyrotropinxblood 0apituitary function 0apituitary hormones 0amorbid obesity1 aManco, M.1 aFrascerra, S.1 aIaconelli, A.1 aMingrone, G.1 aFerrannini, E.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.166-172dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.2263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02814naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002100174245010100195300001600296500002400312520087100336650001501207650001401222650002301236650002601259650001001285650002401295650002001319650001601339650001301355650001301368650001701381650003101398650001401429650002901443650006101472650002701533650002401560650003601584653005201620700002001672700002001692700001801712700001901730700001601749700002001765700001901785700001801804700001801822700001901840773016001859852000902019856007702028930003302105945002502138946001302163655001202176IND4416450620221118003856.0090217e20090128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441645062DNAL7 a191174172pmid7 a10.1021/jf802649w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aF9001 aMeng, Xiang-Qing10aSynthesis and Herbicidal Activity of 12-(Aryloxyacyloxyimino)-1,15-pentadecanlactone Derivatives  ap. 610-617.  aIncludes references  aA series of novel 12-(aryloxyacyloxyimino)-1,15-pentadecanlactone derivatives (3) were synthesized, and their structures including configuration of C=N bond were confirmed by 1H NMR, elemental analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis.

While volatile chemicals from certain soil microbes are sufficient to elicit growth and defense responses in Arabidopsis, whether such volatile signals can induce essential oil accumulation and chemical emissions has yet to be reported. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that the plant growth-promoting soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis GB03 releases volatile chemicals that elevate fresh weight essential oil accumulation and emissions along with plant size in the terpene-rich herb sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). The two major essential oil components from sweet basil, α-terpineol and eugenol, increased ca. 2- and 10-fold, respectively, in plants exposed to GB03 volatiles or with root inoculation as compared to water controls. On a fresh and dry weight basis, shoot and root biomass increases of ca. 2-fold were observed with GB03 volatile exposure or GB03 media inoculation as compared with controls. In testing the efficacy of GB03 volatiles to trigger plant growth and secondary compound production, a physical partition separating roots from bacterial media was provided to preclude nonvolatile microbial elicitors from contributing to GB03-stimulated basil responses. These results demonstrate that volatile bacterial elicitors can concomitantly increase essential oil production and biomass in an herbaceous species rich in commercially valued essential oils. 3avolatile compounds 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aterpineol 3abasil 3aOcimum basilicum 3aessential oils 3aBacillus subtilis 3aroot growth 3aalpha-terpineol 3aeugenol 3ashoots 2aBacillus subtilisxphysiology 2aBiomass 2aOcimum basilicumxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aOils, Volatilexchemistry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aVolatilization 0aplant growth1 aXie, Xitao1 aZhang, Huiming1 aPare, Paul W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Jan. 28, v. 57, no. 2 p.653-657dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80203053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090326b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03547naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168100001900177245009500196300001600291500018300307500002400490520160800514650002202122650001202144650001902156650001402175650001402189650001102203650002802214650002902242650001602271650003302287650003902320650001902359650002802378650001102406650001402417650001402431650002802445650004802473650002402521650001702545650001602562651001102578651002602589653002302615653003302638773011602671852000902787856008002796930003302876945002502909946001102934655001202945IND4416437820221118004136.0090217e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441643782DNAL7 a191369982pmid7 a10.1038/ijo.2008.2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aSjöström, L.10aBariatric surgery and reduction in morbidity and mortality: experiences from the SOS study  ap.

Bray, Leslie Kozak, and Eric Ravussin.  aIncludes references  aObesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Intentional weight loss results in improvement of cardiovascular risk factors, but most observational studies suggest that weight reduction is associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality. No prospective intervention studies on mortality have earlier been reported in obese subjects. The prospective, controlled Swedish Obese Subjects Study enrolled obese subjects who either underwent bariatric surgery (n=2010) or were allocated to a contemporaneously matched, conventionally treated obese control group (n=2037). This review sums up effects on morbidity and mortality over an average of 10 years. The mean weight change of the control group was less than +/- 2% over up to 15 years of weight recording. Maximum weight losses in the surgical subgroups were observed after 1-2 years. After 10 years, the weight losses from baseline were stabilized at 25, 16 and 14%, respectively. Bariatric surgery improved all traditional cardiovascular risk states except hypercholesterolemia over 10 years. There were 129 deaths in the control group compared with 101 in the surgery group. The unadjusted overall mortality was reduced by 23.7% (P=0.0419) in the surgery group (relative to controls), whereas the gender-, age- and risk factor-adjusted mortality reduction was 30.7% (P=0.0102). The most common causes of death were myocardial infarction (controls n=25, surgery n=13) and cancer (47/29). Bariatric surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss, improved risk factors and decreased overall mortality. 3abariatric surgery 3aobesity 3arisk reduction 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3anutritional intervention 3aweight loss 2aBariatric Surgeryxmortality 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmortality 2aCause of Death 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMorbidity 2aNeoplasmsxepidemiology 2aObesityxcomplicationsxmortalityxsurgery. 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aWeight Loss 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0aliterature reviews 0aSwedish Obese Subjects trial0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2008 Dec., v. 32, no. 7S p.S93-S97dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2008.2443Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01779naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013600171300001600307500002400323520076600347650001001113650000901123650001201132650002301144650001001167650001201177650001601189700002201205700002201227773010301249852000901352856009201361655001201453IND4446179720221118004220.0101208s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444617972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04092.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuer, Sonya K.10aBiparental incubation in the chestnut-vented tit-babbler Parisoma subcaeruleum: mates devote equal time, but males keep eggs warmer  ap. 278-283.  aIncludes references  aBiparental care in birds is less common during incubation than in other nesting stages. Males share in incubating eggs in a minority of bird species, and male effort is generally thought to be lower than females when sharing does occur. However, male assistance and incubation efficacy is poorly studied in such species. We examined sex differences in incubation effort in 12 pairs of a species with biparental incubation, the chestnut-vented tit-babbler Parisoma subcaeruleum. Males and females did not differ in the amount of time spent incubating during the day, time of day spent incubating, nor in their ability to rewarm eggs. Yet, males consistently maintained eggs at higher temperatures than their female partners, despite the absence of a brood patch. 3abirds 3aeggs 3afemales 3agender differences 3amales 3anesting 3atemperature1 aBassar, Ronald D.1 aMartin, Thomas E.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2007, v. 38, no. 3 p.278-283dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04092.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01696naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003100150245009700181300001800278500002400296520072100320650001301041650001601054650002501070650001201095650001101107700002901118700002201147700002201169773009201191852000901283856009001292655001201382IND4445880620221118003942.0101130s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444588062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein-Marcuschamer, Daniel10aTechnoeconomic analysis of biofuels: A wiki-based platform for lignocellulosic biorefineries  ap. 1914-1921.  aIncludes references  aWe present a process model for a lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery that is open to the biofuels academic community.

However, although most researchers report on skull homoplasies among hypercarnivorous taxa, evolutionary trends towards herbivory remain largely unexplored. In this study, we analyse the skull of the living herbivorous carnivorans to evaluate the importance of natural selection and phylogenetic legacy in shaping the skulls of these peculiar species. We quantitatively estimated shape variability using geometric morphometrics. A principal components analysis of skull shape incorporating all families of arctoid carnivorans recognized several common adaptations towards herbivory. Ancestral state reconstructions of skull shape and the reconstructed phylogenetic history of morphospace occupation more explicitly reveal the true patterns of homoplasy among the herbivorous carnivorans. Our results indicate that both historical constraints and adaptation have interplayed in the evolution towards herbivory of the carnivoran skull, which has resulted in repeated patterns of biomechanical homoplasy. 3aCarnivora 3abiomechanics 3aconvergent evolution 3aherbivores 3amorphometry 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3aresearchers 3askull 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarnivoraxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aDiet 2aFeeding Behavior 2aPhylogeny 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSkullxanatomy & histology1 aSERRANO‐ALARCÓN, F.J.1 aSLATER, G.J.1 aPALMQVIST, P.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.2579-2594dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02117.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02291naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008900171300001600260500002400276520135100300650002501651650002401676650002001700650002401720650002601744650001301770773011501783852000901898856009401907655001202001IND4445775720221118004241.0101126s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444577572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.1997.tb00002.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindig, J.J.14aThe calculation and significance testing of genetic correlations across environments  ap. 853-874.  aIncludes references  aGenetic correlations within a trait across environments (rg) are important in the analysis of phenotypic plasticity. Not all methods are, however, equally reliable. An overview of all different methods for estimation of rg with one generation data sets is given. Formulae for the relationship between causal variance components and family means are derived. When these formulae are used covariances derived from family means, thought to be incorrect, are exactly the same as those derived with the ANOVA method. The bias, precision and power of the different methods are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. For all methods bias is small and precision is high for the large balanced data sets analyzed here, except when the variance in one or both of the environments is close to 0. Significance testing causes more problems. Confidence intervals with or without z‐transformation are not suitable for testing, nor is testing for g*e interaction in an ANOVA suitable for testing whether the rg is different from 1. The F‐test in a mixed model ANOVA and a likelihood ratio test in a REML‐analysis can be used for testing a difference from 0 but not from 1 or other values. Jackknife and Bootstrap, however, are suitable tests both for differences with 0,1 and other values, though negative variances can make these tests difficult to apply. 3aanalysis of variance 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3agenetic correlation 3aphenotypic plasticity 3avariance0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g1997 Dec., v. 10, no. 6 p.853-874dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.1997.tb00002.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03655naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245011700177300001800294500002400312520246200336650001402798650001702812650002002829650002402849650003002873650001902903650001402922650002002936650001802956650001302974650001202987650001602999700002203015700002103037773011003058852000903168856009203177655001203269IND4445692620221118004045.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444569262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmedmark, Jenny E.E.10aDivergence time uncertainty and historical biogeography reconstruction - an example from Urophylleae (Rubiaceae)  ap. 2260-2274.  aIncludes references  aAim When hypotheses of historical biogeography are evaluated, age estimates of individual nodes in a phylogeny often have a direct impact on what explanation is concluded to be most likely. Confidence intervals of estimated divergence times obtained in molecular dating analyses are usually very large, but the uncertainty is rarely incorporated in biogeographical analyses. The aim of this study is to use the group Urophylleae, which has a disjunct pantropical distribution, to explore how the uncertainty in estimated divergence times affects conclusions in biogeographical analysis. Two hypotheses are evaluated: (1) long‐distance dispersal from Africa to Asia and the Neotropics, and (2) a continuous distribution in the boreotropics, probably involving migration across the North Atlantic Land Bridge, followed by isolation in equatorial refugia. Location Tropical and subtropical Asia, tropical Africa, and central and southern tropical America. Methods This study uses parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA data from 56 ingroup species, beast molecular dating and a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis (Bayes‐DIVA) to reconstruct the ancestral area of the group, and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis method to test biogeographical hypotheses. Results When the two models of geographic range evolution were compared using the maximum likelihood (ML) tree with mean estimates of divergence times, boreotropical migration was indicated to be much more likely than long‐distance dispersal. Analyses of a large sample of dated phylogenies did, however, show that this result was not consistent. The age estimate of one specific node had a major impact on likelihood values and on which model performed best. The results show that boreotropical migration provides a slightly better explanation of the geographical distribution patterns of extant Urophylleae than long‐distance dispersal. Main conclusions This study shows that results from biogeographical analyses based on single phylogenetic trees, such as a ML or consensus tree, can be misleading, and that it may be very important to take the uncertainty in age estimates into account. Methods that account for the uncertainty in topology, branch lengths and estimated divergence times are not commonly used in biogeographical inference today but should definitely be preferred in order to avoid unwarranted conclusions. 3aRubiaceae 3abiogeography 3achloroplast DNA 3aconfidence interval 3ageographical distribution 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3arefuge habitats 3aribosomal DNA 3atopology 3atropics 3auncertainty1 aEriksson, Torsten1 aBremer, Birgitta0 tJournal of biogeography.g2010 Dec., v. 37, no. 12 p.2260-2274dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02366.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03433naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012600171300001800297500002400315520214300339650001702482650001202499650001902511650001302530650001502543650001502558650001202573650001102585650000902596650000902605650002402614650002302638650001802661650001602679650001702695650001102712651001902723700002002742700001402762773011002776852000902886856009202895655001202987IND4445692420221118004149.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444569242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02384.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundy, Mathieu10aClimate change‐linked range expansion of Nathusius' pipistrelle bat, Pipistrellus nathusii (Keyserling & Blasius, 1839)  ap. 2232-2242.  aIncludes references  aAim To examine the effect of climate change on the occurrence and distribution of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) in the United Kingdom (UK). Location We modelled habitat and climatic associations of P. nathusii in the UK and applied this model to the species' historical range in continental Europe. Methods A binomial logistic regression model was constructed relating the occurrence of P. nathusii to climate and habitat characteristics using historical species occurrence records (1940-2006) and CORINE land cover data. This model was applied to historical and projected climate data to examine changes in suitable range (1940-2080) of this species. We tested the predictive ability of the model with known records in the UK after 2006 and applied the model to the species' known range in Europe. Results The distribution of P. nathusii was related positively to the area of water bodies, woodland and small areas of urbanization, and negatively related to the area of peat/heathland. Species records were associated with higher minimum temperatures, low seasonal variation in temperature and intermediate rainfall. We found that suitable areas have existed in the UK since the 1940s and that these have expanded. The model had high predictive power when applied to new records after 2006, with a correct classification rate of 70%, estimated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Based on climate projections, our model suggests a potential twofold increase in the area suitable for P. nathusii in the UK by 2050. The single most influential climate variable contributing to range increase was the projected increase in minimum temperature. When applied to Europe, the model predictions had best predictive capability of known records in western areas of the species' range, where P. nathusii is present during the winter. Main conclusions We show that a mobile, migratory species has adapted its range in response to recent climate change on a continental scale. We believe this may be the first study to demonstrate a case of range change linked to contemporary climate change in a mammal species in Europe. 3aPipistrellus 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3aland cover 3amammals 3amodels 3apeat 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom1 aMontgomery, Ian1 aRuss, Jon0 tJournal of biogeography.g2010 Dec., v. 37, no. 12 p.2232-2242dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02384.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03367naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001200154245017300166300001600339500002400355520216100379650002102540650001702561650001102578650001402589650001002603650001602613650001102629650002002640650002202660650001002682650001002692650002602702650001202728651001002740651001402750773010202764852000902866856009402875655001202969IND4445691920221118004153.0101126s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444569192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.1997.tb00075.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, H.10aEcological and biogeographical studies on the tropical rain forest of south Yunnan, SW China with a special reference to its relation with rain forests of tropical Asia  ap. 647-662.  aIncludes references  aEcological and biogeographic analyses of the tropical rain forest in south Yunnan were made using data from seventeen sample plots and floristic inventories of about 1000 species of seed plants. The rain forest is shown to be a type of true tropical rain forest because it has almost the same profile, physiognomic characteristics, species richness per unit area, numbers of individuals in each tree species and diameter classes of trees as classic lowland tropical rain forests. As the area is at the northern margin of monsoonal tropics, the rain forest differs from equatorial lowland rain forests in having some deciduous trees in the canopy layer, fewer megaphanaerophytes and epiphytes but more species of lianas as well as more species of microphylls. In its floristic composition, about 80% of total families. 94% of total genera and more than 90% of total species are tropical, of which about 38% of genera and 74% of species are tropical Asian. Furthermore, the rain forest has not only almost the same families and genera, but also the same families rank in the top ten both in species richness and in dominance of stems, as lowland forests in southeast Asia. It is indisputable that the flora of the rain forest is part of the tropical Asian flora. However, most of the tropical families and genera have their northern limits in south Yunnan and most have their centre of species diversity in Malesia. More strictly tropical families and genera have relatively lower species richness and importance compared with lowland rain forests in tropical southeast Asia. Thus, the flora also shows characteristics of being at the margin of the tropics. Based mainly on physiognomy and floristic composition the tropical rain forest of Yunnan is classified into two types, i.e. seasonal rain forest and wet seasonal rain forest, the latter is further divided into two subtypes, i.e. mixed rain forest and dipterocarp rain forest. From analysis of geographic elements it is also shown that the tropical rain forest of Yunnan occurs at a geographical nexus with its flora coming mainly from four sources, i.e. Malesia, south Himalayas, Indochina and China. 3aDipterocarpaceae 3abiogeography 3acanopy 3aepiphytes 3aflora 3ainventories 3alianas 3alowland forests 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3atropics 3aChina 3aIndochina0 tJournal of biogeography.g1997, v. 24, no. 5 p.647-662dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.1997.tb00075.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03382naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245012800172300001600300500002400316520148600340650001801826650001901844650001201863650001301875650001801888650001701906650002501923650001501948650000901963650002301972650001801995650001902013650001702032650002802049650002002077650002602097650000902123650003902132650001202171650002202183650002602205650001002231650004102241650004102282650001702323650002302340650003502363650001902398700001702417700001702434700001802451700001802469700001902487700001802506773013402524852000902658856007702667655001202744IND4445842620221118003908.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444584262DNAL7 a195754652pmid7 a10.1002/tox.205202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jiyoun10aAcute toxicity of two CdSe/ZnSe quantum dots with different surface coating in Daphnia magna under various light conditions  ap. 593-600.  aIncludes references  aWith an increasing use of quantum dots (QDs) in many applications, their potential hazard is of growing concern. However, little is known about their ecotoxicity, especially in vivo. In the present study, we employed freshwater macroinvertebrate, Daphnia magna, to evaluate toxicity characteristics of cadmium selenide/zinc selenide (CdSe/ZnSe) in relation to surface coatings, e.g., mercaptopropionic acid QD (MPAQD), and gum arabic/tri‐n‐octylphosphine oxide QD (GA/TOPOQD), and light conditions, i.e., dark, fluorescent light, environmental level of ultraviolet (UV) light, and sunlight. The results of the present study showed that D. magna was more susceptible to GA/TOPOQD exposure compared to MPAQD. The surface coating of QD appeared to determine the stability of QDs and hence the toxicity, potentially by size change of or the release of toxic components from QDs. However, GA/TOPOQD was still less toxic than the equivalent level of CdCl₂. The toxicity of all the tested compounds increased by changing the light condition from dark to white fluorescence to UV‐B light, and to natural sunlight. The effect of light condition on QDs toxicity could also be explained by photostability of the QDs, which would affect size of the particle, release of toxic component ions, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Considering increasing use of QDs in various applications, their environmental fates and corresponding toxic potentials deserve further investigation. 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3acadmium 3acoatings 3aecotoxicology 3afluorescence 3afluorescent lighting 3afreshwater 3aions 3amacroinvertebrates 3aparticle size 3aphotostability 3aquantum dots 3areactive oxygen species 3asolar radiation 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc 2a3-Mercaptopropionic Acidxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aLight 2aNanostructuresxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxtoxicity 2aQuantum Dots 2aSeleniumxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests, Acutexmethods 2aZincxtoxicity1 aJi, Kyunghee1 aKim, Jungkon1 aPark, Chansik1 aLim, Kook Hee1 aYoon, Tae Hyun1 aChoi, Kyungho0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2010 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.593-600dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.205203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03171naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245008300186300001800269500002400287500001500311520156900326650001301895650001501908650001501923650002001938650001101958650001901969650001901988650001402007650002202021650001802043650001202061650001002073650001402083650001102097650000902108650001202117650001202129650001402141650004502155650001102200650004802211650000902259650003002268650002302298650002402321653002402345700001702369773011802386852000902504856009202513655001202605IND4445778620221118003920.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444577862DNAL7 a211210892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02126.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREMEŠ, V.10aDomestic chickens defy Rensch's rule: sexual size dimorphism in chicken breeds  ap. 2754-2759.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e. the difference in sizes of males and females, is a key evolutionary feature that is related to ecology, behaviour and life histories of organisms. Although the basic patterns of SSD are well documented for several major taxa, the processes generating SSD are poorly understood. Domesticated animals offer excellent opportunities for testing predictions of functional explanations of SSD theory because domestic stocks were often selected by humans for particular desirable traits. Here, we analyse SSD in 139 breeds of domestic chickens Gallus gallus domesticus and compare them to their wild relatives (pheasants, partridges and grouse; Phasianidae, 53 species). SSD was male‐biased in all chicken breeds, because males were 21.5 ± 0.55% (mean ± SE) heavier than females. The extent of SSD did not differ among breed categories (cock fighting, ornamental and breeds selected for egg and meat production). SSD of chicken breeds was not different from wild pheasants and allies (23.5 ± 3.43%), although the wild ancestor of chickens, the red jungle fowl G. gallus, had more extreme SSD (male 68.8% heavier) than any domesticated breed. Male mass and female mass exhibited positive allometry among pheasants and allies, consistently with the Rensch's rule reported from various taxa. However, body mass scaled isometrically across chicken breeds. The latter results suggest that sex‐specific selection on males vs. females is necessary to generate positive allometry, i.e. the Rensch's rule, in wild populations. 3achickens 3apartridges 3adimorphism 3ameat production 3ahumans 3awild relatives 3achicken breeds 3aallometry 3afighting behavior 3aGallus gallus 3aecology 3amales 3apheasants 3agrouse 3aeggs 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aChickensxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGalliformesxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animal 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Characteristics 0afighting (behavior)1 aSZÉKELY, T.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.2754-2759dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02126.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02650naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245014800188300001800336500002400354520097800378650001601356650002601372650001201398650002901410650001001439650001401449650002301463650001301486650001201499650001201511650005201523650005501575650004801630650002201678650003101700650003201731650004301763650005301806650005501859700001801914700001701932773011801949852000902067856009202076655001202168IND4445778220221118003912.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444577822DNAL7 a211210852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02115.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHELLGREN, O.10aIn vitro tests of natural allelic variation of innate immune genes (avian β‐defensins) reveal functional differences in microbial inhibition  ap. 2726-2730.  aIncludes references  aAllelic variation in immune genes might result from, and contribute to, host-pathogen evolution. Functional allelic variation in the innate immune system has received little attention. Here, we investigate whether naturally occurring allelic variation within the avian innate immune system (β‐defensins) is associated with variation in antimicrobial activity. We tested differences in in vitro antimicrobial properties of the synthesized products of two alleles of avian β‐defensin 7, both of which occur at high frequency in natural populations of the great tit (Parus major). Only one allele strongly inhibited the growth of the gram‐positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, but both alleles strongly inhibited growth of the gram‐negative bacterium Escherechia coli. Our data demonstrate functional allelic variation in natural defensin genes, and we discuss how differences in efficacy against microbial species might contribute to maintaining this variation. 3aParus major 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalleles 3aantimicrobial properties 3abirds 3aevolution 3agrowth retardation 3aimmunity 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAvian Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGenetic Variation 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPasseriformesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2abeta-Defensinsxchemistryxgeneticsxpharmacology.1 aSHELDON, B.C.1 aBUCKLING, A.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.2726-2730dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02115.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02432naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245015300189300001800342500002400360520100100384650003401385650001401419650001201433650001401445650001101459650001601470650001201486650002901498650001401527650006301541650001401604650002301618650001601641650002401657650003601681700002001717700001601737700001401753773011801767852000901885856009201894655001201986IND4445777320221118004049.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444577732DNAL7 a210400672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02119.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDE CAUWER, I.10aPollen limitation of female reproductive success at fine spatial scale in a gynodioecious and wind‐pollinated species, Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima  ap. 2636-2647.  aIncludes references  aIn sexually polymorphic plants, the spatial distribution of sexes is usually not random. Local variation in phenotype frequencies is expected to affect individual fitness of the different phenotypes. For gynodioecious species, with co‐occurrence of hermaphrodites and females, if sexual phenotypes are structured in space and pollen flow is spatially restricted, local pollen availability should vary among patches. Female fitness may thus be low when hermaphrodites are locally rare. To test this hypothesis, we analysed how the reproductive output of females varied among patches within two natural study sites of the gynodioecious wind‐pollinated Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima. Plants growing in female‐biased areas and experiencing pollen limitation were found to have low fruit and seed sets but did not reallocate resources towards better offspring. Our results show that fine‐scale processes influence individual fitness and the evolution of sex ratio in sexually polymorphic plants. 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. maritima 3aevolution 3afemales 3aphenotype 3apollen 3apollen flow 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3asex ratio 2aBeta vulgarisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPollenxphysiology 2aPollination 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aReproduction, Asexualxgenetics1 aARNAUD, J.‐F.1 aSCHMITT, E.1 aDUFAY, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.2636-2647dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02119.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03225naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009100146300001600237500001500253520172000268650002701988650001802015650002302033650001202056650002502068650001802093650002302111650002802134650001302162650003702175650003002212650002202242650005602264650001902320650005102339650002202390650003202412653002102444653001602465653000802481653001702489700001602506700001802522700001702540773007002557852000902627930003302636945001302669946001302682655001202695IND2047140020221118003939.0950804e19950420flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204714002DNAL7 a75382532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuzayan, J.M.10aIncrease of satellite tobacco ringspot virus RNA initiated by inoculating circular RNA  ap. 832-837.  a2019-12-05  aA small satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTRSV RNA) generates circular and linear molecules of unit length and repetitive sequence, linear multimers during replication. The phosphodiester junction joining the unit satellite RNA sequences in multimeric and circular RNA resisted base-catalyzed cleavage in circles but not in linear dimers. We postulate that junctions of multimeric satellite RNA form during synthesis of the polyribonucleotide chain, whereas those of circular RNA result from a ligation reaction that introduces a group blocking the junction 2'-hydroxyl. To test the relative effectiveness of linear and circular satellite RNAs in initiating replication, we inoculated onto bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv Black Valentine) the four possible pairs of satellite RNA molecules, one member of each pair having the wild-type sTRSV RNA sequence and the other that of the replicating mutant 51AG/212CU, with each sequence provided as the unit circular or linear form. The relative amounts of wild-type and mutant satellite RNA sequence recovered from progeny virions reflected their relative abundances in the inoculum without regard to whether the sequence was supplied as a linear or a circular molecule. These results are consistent with models for the replication of the satellite RNA in which a circular form of the satellite RNA is a template for rolling circle transcription or is otherwise a replication intermediate or is readily converted to an intermediate. We also show that a circular form of a nonaccumulating satellite RNA mutant induced an increase in a satellite RNA that is endogenous to some tobacco ringspot virus virion preparations, as demonstrated previously for the linear form. 3aTobacco ringspot virus 3asatellite RNA 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 2aBase Sequence 2aFabaceaexvirology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNepovirusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRNAxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Satellite 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aVirionxchemistry 2aVirus Replicationxgenetics 0arna conformation 0areplication 0aRNA 0aconformation1 aVan Tol, H.1 aZalloua, P.A.1 aBruening, G.0 tVirology.g1995 Apr. 20, v. 208, no. 2 p.832-837x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03423naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245014200144300001800286520182000304650001202124650001202136650002102148650001102169650001502180650001902195650002002214650001702234650000902251650003202260650002202292650001602314650001202330650003302342650000902375650001002384650004002394650001202434650002902446700001902475700001902494700003602513700001502549700001602564700001602580700001602596700001602612700001802628700001902646700001502665773008502680852000902765930003302774945001302807946001302820655001202833IND2205591320221118004014.0000706e200004  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220559132DNAL7 a107841922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, G.M.10aGrowth promotion effects and plasma changes from feeding high dietary concentrations of zinc and copper to weanling pigs (regional study)  ap. 1010-1016.  aAn experiment was conducted to determine the effect of high dietary intakes of Zn and Cu and their combination on growth performance of weanling pigs with diverse health status and management strategies. Twelve experiment stations cooperated and used a total of 1,356 pigs that averaged 6.55 kg BW and 22.2 d age at weaning. The four dietary treatments, all of which met or exceeded NRC requirements, were 1) control, 2) 3,000 ppm Zn (from Zn oxide), 3) 250 Cu ppm (from Cu sulfate), or 4) 3,000 ppm Zn and 250 ppm Cu. The diets were fed as a complex Phase I diet (1.4% lysine) for 7 d followed by a Phase II diet (1.2% lysine) for 21 d. Chlortetracycline (220 ppm) was added to all diets. Fecal color (1 = yellow to 5 = black) and consistency (1 = very firm to 5 = very watery) were scored daily for 3 wk. At the end of the 28-d study, 412 pigs were bled at five stations, and plasma Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations were determined at one station with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Average daily gain (375, 422, 409, 415 g/d), feed intake (637, 690, 671, 681 g/d), and gain/feed (586, 611, 611, 612 g/kg) were improved (P < .01) by the addition of Zn and(or) Cu. Significant Cu x Zn interactions imply that the responses to Zn and Cu were independent and not additive. There were significant (P < .01) Zn and Cu effects and a Zn x Cu interaction on fecal color (3.17, 3.24, 4.32, 3.57) and consistency (2.39, 2.14, 2.14, 2.13). Dietary additions of Cu and Zn resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of Cu and Zn, respectively. These data indicate that pharmacological additions of 3,000 ppm Zn (oxide) or 250 ppm Cu (sulfate) stimulate growth beyond that derived from intakes of Zn and Cu that meet nutrient requirements. However, the combination of Zn and Cu did not result in an additive growth response. 3apiglets 3aweaning 3adietary minerals 3adosage 3azinc oxide 3acopper sulfate 3aliveweight gain 3ablood plasma 3airon 3adietary mineral supplements 3afeces composition 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCopper Sulfatexpharmacology 2aDiet 2aFeces 2aSwinexbloodxgrowth & development. 2aWeaning 2aZinc Oxidexpharmacology1 aCromwell, G.L.1 aCrenshaw, T.D.1 aDove, Robertc(College teacher)1 aEwan, R.C.1 aKnabe, D.A.1 aLewis, A.J.1 aLibal, G.W.1 aMahan, D.C.1 aShurson, G.C.1 aSouthern, L.L.1 aVeum, T.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2000 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.1010-1016x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01888naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008000124300001400204500008700218520078000305650001901085650002101104650002201125650002301147650002101170650001901191650002201210650001701232650002001249653002301269653002201292653001901314700001901333773008201352852000901434930003301443945001301476946001301489655001201502IND2205392620221118003821.0000622s1999    ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220539262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, D.10aLivestock nutrient management concerns: regulatory and legislative overview  ap. 51-62.  aPaper presented at the 1998 ADSA-ASAS Joint Meeting, July 27-31, Fort Collins, CO.  aA greater focus on manure nutrient disposition from concentrated animal-feeding operations has developed from environmentalists, concerned citizens, and regulatory agencies.

The dynamics of observed thermoregulatory responses in cattle to thermal heat load challenges are explored, with an emphasis on physiological and behavioral parameters of body temperature, respiration rate, and feed intake. Observations of body temperature, especially tympanic temperature, have shown hot environments to cause phase shifts, increased amplitude, and increased means for diurnal rhythms. Fractal analysis of body temperature records obtained at 2- to 10-min intervals has been found to be robust for objectively differentiating among responses of cattle in cool to hot environments, and it indicates a stress threshold of approximately 25 degrees C (coincident with declining feed intake). Other analyses determined a 21 degrees C threshold for increased respiration rate. The reported observations and analyses provide further understanding of how and why the animals respond to environmental challenges, an understanding that is necessary for refining performance models and developing energetic and thermoregulatory models. The dynamic responses are discussed in the context of establishing criteria for proactive environmental management for cattle during hot weather, using heat waves as an example. 3arelative humidity 3athermoregulation 3astress response 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3aheat stress 3asteers 3awind speed 3afeed intake 3aad libitum feeding 0atemperature-humidity index 0aheat waves 0acattle 0aliterature reviews 0aweather patterns 0arespiration rate 0atemperature-humidity 0aindexes0 tJournal of animal science.g1999, v. 77, no. suppl.2 p.10-20x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01984naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010300174300001600277500002400293520099100317650002301308650001901331650001501350650002501365650001201390651001401402700002201416773014301438852000901581856009201590655001201682IND4445620520221118003855.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444562052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01535.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aECHEVERRY, AMPARO10aParsimony analysis of endemicity as a panbiogeographical tool: an analysis of Caribbean plant taxa  ap. 961-976.  aIncludes references  aTo demonstrate that parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) can be a method implementing the panbiogeographic approach, we analyzed two data matrices of 40/38 biogeographic provinces × 148 plant species from the Caribbean subregion of the Neotropical region, one where taxa are represented by individual tracks and the other where taxa are represented by single sample localities.

Environmental factors, including ambient temperature, radiant energy, relative humidity, and metabolic heat associated with maintenance and productive processes, contribute to heat stress. The focus of this article is to identify environmental and metabolic factors that contribute to excessive heat load, describe how disruption of homeothermy alters physiologic systems of the cow, and discuss nutritional modifications that help to maintain homeostasis or prevent nutrient deficiencies that result from heat stress. Changes in diet are needed during hot weather to maintain nutrient intake, increase dietary nutrient density, or to reestablish homeostasis. Formulation for adequate nutrient intake is challenging because of the competition between nutrient density and other needs for the cow, including energy density and adequate dietary fiber. Lower DMI during hot weather reduces nutrients available for absorption, and absorbed nutrients are used less efficiently. An excess of degradable dietary protein is undesirable because of energy costs to metabolize and excrete excess N as urea. Optimizing ruminally undegraded protein improves milk yield in hot climates. Mineral losses via sweating (primarily K) and changes in blood acid-base chemistry resulting from hyperventilation reduce blood bicarbonate and blood buffering capacity and increase urinary excretion of electrolytes. Theoretical heat production favors feed ingredients with a lower heat increment, such as concentrates and fats, whereas forages have a greater heat increment. Improved dietary energy density and the lower heat increment associated with the inclusion of dietary fat must be coupled with limitations to fat feeding to avoid ruminal and metabolic disorders. Numerous nutritional modifications are used for hot weather feeding; however, many need further investigation to achieve specific recommendations. 3adairy cows 3aheat stress 3aheat production 3adietary fat 3aconcentrates 3afeed intake 3alipids 3adietary protein 3asweating 3apotassium 3adietary minerals 3amilk yield 3avitamins 3aambient temperature 3afeeding behavior 3adietary fiber 0aliterature reviews0 tJournal of animal science.g1999, v. 77, no. suppl.2 p.21-33x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02742naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245012800177300001600305500002400321520165100345650001901996650003002015650001702045650002202062650001202084650004502096651001602141700002702157773014302184852000902327856009202336655001202428IND4445620020221118004048.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444562002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01549.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWESTFALL, KRISTEN M.10aGenetic diversity of Southern hemisphere blue mussels (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) and the identification of non‐indigenous taxa  ap. 898-909.  aIncludes references  aThe taxonomic and evolutionary affinities of Southern hemisphere smooth‐shelled blue mussels are unclear, with studies using different marker types having identified different relationships among various geographic regions. Using an existing and a new molecular assay, the present study builds on previous work to test the distribution of blue mussels native to and introduced to the Southern hemisphere. Populations of Mytilus were sampled from New Zealand, Australia, and Chile. The nuclear‐DNA marker Me 15/16 was used to identify the taxonomic status of 484 individuals. A new restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was used to identify the hemisphere of origin for a subset of Mytilus galloprovincialis. The Me15/16 marker identified 478 pure M. galloprovincialis from Southern hemisphere sites and six Mytilus edulis/M. galloprovincialis hybrids from the Auckland Islands (New Zealand) and Chile. A cytoplasmic RFLP identified Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis in almost every Southern hemisphere region. The presence of native M. galloprovincialis at high latitudes (up to 52°S) has implications for our understanding of environmentally induced selective constraints considered to determine species distributions. Widespread occurrence of invasive Northern hemisphere blue mussels in the Southern hemisphere is documented for the first time. Identification of inter‐specific hybrids (M. edulis × M. galloprovincialis) in Chile and in the Auckland Islands (subantarctic New Zealand) illustrates that environments ranging from international ports to remote protected locations are vulnerable to bioinvasion. 3aMytilus edulis 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3abiogeography 3agenetic variation 3amussels 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aNew Zealand1 aGARDNER, JONATHAN P.A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 4 p.898-909dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01549.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02880naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245012900176300001600305500002400321520191400345650001102259650001502270650001202285650001202297651001202309700002502321773014302346852000902489856009202498655001202590IND4445619720221118004124.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444561972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01539.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHigham, Timothy E.,10aDivergence in locomotor performance, ecology, and morphology between two sympatric sister species of desert‐dwelling gecko  ap. 860-869.  aIncludes references  aThe functional and evolutionary implications of morphological diversification have been addressed for several groups of vertebrates. Although the mechanisms of gecko adhesion have received considerable attention, little is known regarding locomotor performance of geckos in nature, and how this might relate to morphological diversity. In this study we examine locomotor performance of two sympatric sister species of geckos of the genus Rhoptropus (Rhoptropus afer and Rhoptropus bradfieldi) found in the coastal desert regions of Namibia. One species (R. afer) commonly runs on sandy substrates and moves between isolated rock sheets, whereas the other species (R. bradfieldi) commonly lives and runs on isolated boulders. The morphology of R. afer is extremely divergent from its sister species and all other species in the genus. We initially recorded the inclination of the substrate in which the lizards were found in order to characterize the habitat of each species. We then quantified maximum speed and acceleration on a level 1‐m trackway, and also during escapes in the field. We found that R. bradfieldi occupies steeper surfaces than those occupied by R. afer. On the trackway and in nature, R. afer runs faster than R. bradfieldi, although the differences in locomotor performance between the species are greater for the field measurements. Rhoptropus afer commonly runs for more than 2 or 3 m, whereas R. bradfieldi commonly runs less than 50 cm during an escape sprint. Our main conclusions are that: (1) R. afer attains higher maximum speeds when escaping under controlled and field conditions, although the magnitude differs between conditions; and (2) hindlimb morphology correlates with maximum running speed in R. afer, but not in R. bradfieldi. Similar to the well‐studied Anolis lizards, we propose that these two gecko species represent distinct and highly divergent ecomorphs. 3aAnolis 3aGekkonidae 3aecology 3alizards 3aNamibia1 aRussell, Anthony P.,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 4 p.860-869dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01539.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02283naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245011500192300001800307500002400325520069400349650002501043650002101068650002101089650002501110650001801135650007301153650001101226650002801237650001401265650002701279650002201306650004301328650004001371651001301411651001901424651001801443651001301461653002001474653001001494653001001504653002901514700002001543700002101563773009901584852000901683856008501692655001201777IND4445370120221118002436.0101119s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444537012DNAL7 a206867982pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0781-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChieochansin, Thaweesak10aDetermination and analysis of complete coding sequence regions of new discovered human bocavirus types 2 and 3  ap. 2023-2028.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, two human bocaviruses (HBoV), HBoV2 and HBoV3, that were detected previously in enteric samples were characterized genetically.

The goal of this study is to monitor the survival of injected bacteria and reveal the response of microbial communities in field trial of microbial plugging through injection of selected microbial culture broth and nutrients. Culture-dependent enrichment and culture-independent 16S rDNA clone library methods were used. The results show that it was easy to activate targeted biopolymer-producing bacteria in a laboratory environment, and it was difficult for injected exogenous bacteria to survive. In addition, microbial communities in the oil reservoir also changed before and after the field trial. However, microbial communities, activated by fermentative medium for biopolymer-producing bacteria, appeared to show greater differences in the laboratory than in the natural reservoir. It was concluded that microbial populations monitoring was important to MEOR; results of response of microbial communities could provide a guide for the future field trials. 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial communities 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3aoil fields 3apetroleum 3aribosomal DNA 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiodiversity 2aCluster Analysis 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPetroleumxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 3aChina 0aChina 0aMicrobial plugging 0aMicrobial enhancement of oil recovery (MEOR) 0aMicrobial communities 0aBiopolymer-producing bacteria 0a16S rDNA clone library1 aShe, Yue Hui1 aMa, Sha Sha1 aHu, Ji Ming1 aBanat, Ibrahim M.1 aHou, Du Jie0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1413-1422dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2841-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02810naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245011000176300001600286500002400302520138600326650001501712650001001727650002201737650001501759650001801774650002201792650001401814650002501828650002001853650001201873650001001885650001701895650001501912651002801927651001201955651002201967700001901989700002002008700002102028700002502049700002202074773014302096852000902239856009202248655001202340IND4445619320221118002350.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444561932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01530.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCÉLIO ALVES, PAULO10aGenetic diversity of wild boar populations and domestic pig breeds (Sus scrofa) in South‐western Europe  ap. 797-822.  aIncludes references  aThe Eurasian wild boar, Sus scrofa, is an important game species and is widely distributed in Eurasia. The recent demographic expansions allied to man mediated translocations and reintroductions, reshaped the genetic variability of wild boar populations, and gave rise to management problems. Genetic variability and the population structure of the European populations are not well‐known, in particular in the Iberian Peninsula. In the present study, we assessed the phylogenetic relationship among 17 Iberian wild boar populations and several Eurasian wild and domestic pigs by sequencing 660 bp of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA control region. This analysis was extended to the two autochthonous Portuguese pig breeds, Bísaro and Alentejano, and their relationship with Eurasian pigs was also established. High levels of gene diversity were found in Iberian wild boar and Portuguese domestic pigs, as well as a significant genetic difference among and within populations. Iberian wild boar and Portuguese pig breeds belong to the main European clade but diverge with animals from Central Europe, showing a high proportion of private (Iberian) haplotypes. These results suggest the existence of glacial refugia for Sus scrofa in the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum. No signs of Asian mtDNA introgression from Asian populations were found in the present survey. 3aSus scrofa 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aintrogression 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3arefuge habitats 3asurveys 3aswine 3aswine breeds 3awild boars 3aCentral European region 3aEurasia 3aIberian Peninsula1 aPINHEIRO, IRIS1 aGODINHO, RAQUEL1 aVICENTE, JOAQUIN1 aGORTÁZAR, CHRISTIAN1 aSCANDURA, MASSIMO0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 4 p.797-822dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01530.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02494naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003400152245012200186300001600308500002400324520140300348650001801751650001001769650001001779650001201789650001301801650001101814650001001825650001401835650001501849650001701864700001901881773014301900852000902043856009202052655001202144IND4445619020221118002625.0101126s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444561902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01543.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIBÁÑEZ‐ÁLAMO, JUAN DIEGO10aDoes urbanization affect selective pressures and life‐history strategies in the common blackbird (Turdus merula L.)  ap. 759-766.  aIncludes references  aUrbanization, one of the most extreme land‐use alterations, is currently spreading, and the number of species confronting these changes is increasing. However, contradictory results of previous studies impede a clear interpretation of which selective pressure (nest predation or food limitation) is more important in urban habitats compared with natural situations, and whether birds can confront them by adjusting their life‐history strategies. We investigated life‐history syndromes of three common blackbird (Turdus merula) populations differing in their human influence (urban, rural, and woodland). We analysed daily nest predation and nestling starvation rates to assess the relative importance of these selection pressures in each habitat. Simultaneously, several life‐history traits were investigated to determine if T. merula seem adapted to their main source of selection. Food limitation was more important in the city, whereas nest predation was the most important selective force in the forest. The rural habitat was characterized by an intermediate influence of these two factors. Life‐history syndromes, as the covariation of a suite of traits, confirmed these results because T. merula seem well adapted to the main cause of selection in each habitat. Our results are consistent with urbanization imposing new challenges on birds, and that they adaptively respond to them. 3aTurdus merula 3abirds 3afoods 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3anests 3apredation 3astarvation 3aurbanization1 aSoler, Manuel,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 4 p.759-766dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01543.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02066naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245006700174300001600241500002400257520099100281650002501272650001201297650001401309650001501323650001201338650001301350650001001363650001401373650001401387650002101401700002401422700001801446773013901464852000901603856009201612655001201704IND4445618620221118002711.0101126s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444561862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00549.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, Frank,10aSexual size dimorphism and sex ratios in dragonflies (Odonata)  ap. 507-513.  aIncludes references  aSexual size dimorphism and biased sex ratios are common in animals. Rensch's rule states that sexual size dimorphism (SSD) would increase with body size in taxa where males are larger than females and decrease with body size in taxa where females are larger. We tested this trend in dragonflies (Odonata) by analysing body size of 21 species and found support for Rensch's rule. The increase in SSD with increasing size among species can be explained by sexual selection favouring large males. We also estimated the slope of the relationship between sex ratio and size ratio in populations of the 21 species. A negative slope would suggest that the larger sex suffers from high mortality in the larval stage, consistent with riskier foraging. The slope of this relationship was negative, but after correcting for phylogentic non‐independence with independent contrasts the relationship was no longer statistically significant, perhaps because of phylogenic inertia or low sample size. 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aanimals 3abody size 3adimorphism 3afemales 3aforaging 3amales 3amortality 3asex ratio 3asexual selection1 aCrowley, Philip H.,1 aBRODIN, TOMAS0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Dec., v. 86, no. 4 p.507-513dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00549.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02456naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010400126300001600230500001500246520122300261650002301484650002601507650002501533650001101558650001401569650003001583650001501613650001701628650002501645650002301670650001301693650002001706650001401726650001401740650001101754651002101765653001901786653001101805653002201816773009401838852000901932930003301941945001301974946001101987655001201998IND2205742420221118002604.0000713e199911  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220574242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooke, L.R.14aThe influence of fungicide sprays on infection of apple cv.

Bramley's Seedling, inoculated, at single sites in the leader shoots, with Nectria galligena. The effect of spring-summer and autumn fungicide spray programmes, applied during 1991-1993, on the development of new cankers was assessed up to May 1994. Spring-summer fungicide programmes, applied as for the control of apple scab, reduced numbers of new cankers by between 65% and 76% compared with the untreated control. Sterol demethylation inhibiting fungicides (hexaconazole, myclobutanil, penconazole) had a similar effect on canker to dithianon. Autumn application of copper oxychloride at 5% and 50% leaf-fall further reduced numbers of new cankers. The combination of a spring-summer benzimidazole (carbendazim or thiophanate-methyl) with a scab funcicide (dithianon) and autumn copper oxychloride did not improve canker control compared with applying copper oxychloride after spring-summer myclobutanil + mancozeb. The percentage of fruit which developed rots in long-term storage was decreased by spring-summer benzimidazole application, but not by other fungicide programmes even those which achieved similar levels of canker control. 3aapplication timing 3along term experiments 3aNeonectria ditissima 3aapples 3aseedlings 3afungal diseases of plants 3afungicides 3afood storage 3apostharvest diseases 3aseasonal variation 3aduration 3aMalus domestica 3aincidence 3ainfection 3ashoots 3aNorthern Ireland 0afungus control 0afruits 0aNectria galligena0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Nov., v. 105, no. 8 p.783-790x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02378naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010900162300001600271520100400287650001801291650002301309650001101332650001301343650002601356650001601382650001001398650002201408650001101430650001301441650001401454650001801468650003001486651001101516653001001527653004501537653002201582700002001604700002301624773013401647852000901781856008601790930003301876946001101909655001201920IND4391027520221118002631.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439102752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9128-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzra, David 10aMolecular characterization of Phoma tracheiphila, causal agent of Mal secco disease of citrus, in Israel  ap. 183-191.  aMal secco disease of citrus caused by Phoma tracheiphila is a devastating disease in the Mediterranean basin. Susceptible citrus species include lemon, citron, lime and others. Trees attacked by the fungus show characteristic symptoms; the smallest twigs die first, followed by the larger branches. Eventually, the whole tree is killed. The symptoms are clear in the orchards but by the time they are visible the disease is already well established. The need for a sensitive, reliable and rapid diagnostic method for the early identification of the fungus in trees and fruit exists. We have developed a PCR-based method for the identification of P. tracheiphila from plant tissues including fruit. Any such method must take into account the genetic variability in the pathogen population. Molecular methods were used to compare different isolates of P. tracheiphila. This study found no significant differences between different isolates from different citrus species from different parts of Israel. 3aCitrus medica 3aPhoma tracheiphila 3abasins 3abranches 3adiagnostic techniques 3afruit trees 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3alemons 3aorchards 3apathogens 3aplant tissues 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aIsrael 0aApPCR 0aInternal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region 0aMal secco disease1 aKroitor, Tammy 1 aSadowsky, Avraham 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 June, v. 118, no. 2 p.183-191dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9128-63Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01956naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010400165300001300269520081700282650002401099650001001123650001901133650002201152650001201174650001801186650002201204653002501226653001401251653001301265700002401278700001701302773012501319852000901444856008501453930003301538946001101571655001201582IND4398179420221118002631.0071125e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439817942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9184-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReignault, Ph. 14aThe importance of fungal pectinolytic enzymes in plant invasion, host adaptability and symptom type  ap. 1-11.  aThis review describes the extent to which recent works performed in the last decade have clarified the role of different pectinase activities in pathogenicity of fungi responsible for a wide array of diseases. Beyond physiological or biochemical investigations, strategies that have been used include gene cloning and expression studies as well as gene disruption or replacement. Pectinase involvement in fungal diseases has been considered according to the type of symptoms produced by the studied fungi. Although pectinolytic enzymes are clearly important for soft rot diseases, their role cannot be anticipated for other diseases as a whole. Each symptom type must therefore be investigated separately. Moreover, before antifungal strategies can be considered, several strains and/or mutants must be analysed. 3aecological invasion 3afungi 3agene targeting 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3apolygalacturonase 0aFungal pathogenicity 0aCell wall 0aSymptoms1 aValette-Collet, O. 1 aBoccara, M. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2008 Jan., v. 120, no. 1 p.1-11dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9184-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015100163300001400314520108900328650002301417650002501440650002401465650004301489650002301532650003001555650001201585650001401597650001101611650001401622650001301636650002401649650001401673650001101687650001301698653000801711653002101719700002101740700002301761700002301784700002701807773012601834852000901960856008501969930003302054946001102087655001202098IND4398179920221118002546.0071125e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439817992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9196-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaved, Nazir 14aThe potential of combining Pasteuria penetrans and neem (Azadirachta indica) formulations as a management system for root-knot nematodes on tomato  ap. 53-60.  aInitial applications of 10⁴ spores g-¹ of Pasteuria penetrans, and dried neem cake and leaves at 3 and 2% w:w, respectively, were applied to soil in pots.

The tomatoes were sampled after 64 days; subsequently a second crop was grown for 59 days and a third crop for 67 days without further applications of P. penetrans and neem. There was significantly less root-galling in the P. penetrans combined with neem cake treatment at the end of the third crop and this treatment also had the greatest effect on the growth of the tomato plants. At the end of the third crop, 30% of the females were infected with P. penetrans in those treatments where spores had been applied at the start of the experiment. The effects of neem leaves and neem cake on the nematode population did not persist through the crop sequences but the potential for combining the amendments with a biological control agent such as P. penetrans is worthy of further evaluation. 3aAzadirachta indica 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aPasteuria penetrans 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3aneem cake 3aplanting 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseedlings 3aspores 3atomatoes 0aIPM 0aNatural products1 aEl-Hassan, Said 1 aGowen, S.q(Simon)1 aPemproke, Barbara 1 aInam-ul-Haq, Muhammed 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2008 Jan., v. 120, no. 1 p.53-60dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9196-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015000165300001600315520186800331650002702199650002202226650001102248650001502259650002902274650002602303650002602329650001502355650001602370650002002386650002102406650001902427650001302446650001802459650001402477650001902491650001302510650001402523650001302537653002202550653001602572653001702588700001702605700001802622700002402640700002502664773012802689852000902817856008502826930003302911946001102944655001202955IND4394868420221118002710.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439486842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9166-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorn, Brigitte 10aControl of late blight in organic potato production: evaluation of copper-free preparations under field, growth chamber and laboratory conditions  ap. 217-240.  aIn order to replace copper fungicides in organic potato production, 53 copper-free preparations (CFPs) based on natural compounds, including plant extracts and microorganisms, and five copper preparations were evaluated for their potential to control Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen that causes late blight of potatoes. In in vitro assays, 30% of the CFPs inhibited indirect germination of sporangia, 26% mycelial growth and in growth chamber experiments, 21% efficiently reduced foliar blight of tomato plants. In micro-plot field trials with applications twice a week, the copper preparations were the most effective and reduced foliar blight by 99%. Of the CFPs tested, Oekofluid P, Mycosin and other sulphuric clays, and C-2000 reduced late blight the most, from 63% to 37%. In small-plot trials in 2001, 2002 and 2004, 27 CFPs with different formulations and four copper preparations were examined. In 2004, copper preparations at full and reduced rates and sulphuric clays were applied either weekly or according to the decision support system Bio-PhytoPRE. With Bio-PhytoPRE, copper preparations reduced foliar blight of potatoes by 23-77% and increased tuber yield by 2-28%, depending on the copper rate applied and year. With CFPs, maximal efficacy was 17% and no effect on tuber yield was observed. In vitro and in vivo trials showed that the rainfastness and the persistence of CFPs was low compared with copper preparations. This indicates that the failure of CFPs under field conditions is probably due to a lack of stability under prevailing environmental conditions and not to a lack of efficacy. Until stable formulations for CFPs are developed, an optimised and restricted use of copper fungicides using a decision support system could help to control late blight in organic potato production and to reduce copper input into the environment. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum tuberosum 3ablight 3acrop yield 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3afungicides 3agermination 3agrowth chambers 3ain vitro studies 3amicroorganisms 3amycelium 3aorganic foods 3apathogens 3aplant extracts 3apotatoes 3asporangia 3atomatoes 0aCopper fungicides 0aPersistence 0aRainfastness1 aMusa, Tomke 1 aKrebs, Heinz 1 aFried, Padruot Men 1 aForrer, Hans Rudolf 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Oct., v. 119, no. 2 p.217-240dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9166-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03688naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245011700172300001600289520192900305650002002234650002702254650001902281650001802300650000902318650001502327650001302342650004402355650002002399650002202419650002602441650001402467650002302481650002202504650002002526650001302546650001602559650000902575650002102584650001602605650002002621651001002641651001602651653000902667700003102676700003002707700002202737700002702759700002802786700001802814773012802832852000902960856008502969930003303054946001103087655001203098IND4397406520221118002736.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439740652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9167-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessiha, Nevain A. S. 10aPotato brown rot incidence and severity under different management and amendment regimes in different soil types  ap. 367-381.  aRalstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2, the causative agent of potato brown rot (bacterial wilt), is an economically important disease in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. In view of previous reports on suppression of the disease by organic amendments, and the expansion of organic agriculture, it was timely to compare the effects of organic and conventional management and various amendments on brown rot development in different soils (type: sand or clay; origin: Egypt or the Netherlands). Brown rot infection was only slightly reduced in organically compared to conventionally managed sandy soils from Egypt, but organic management significantly increased disease incidence and pathogen survival in Dutch sandy and clay soils, which correlated with high DOC contents in the organic Dutch soils. There was no correlation between disease incidence or severity and bacterial diversity in the potato rhizosphere in differently managed soils (as determined by 16S DGGE). NPK fertilization reduced bacterial wilt in conventional Egyptian soils but not in Dutch soils. Cow manure amendment significantly reduced disease incidence in organic Dutch sandy soils, but did not affect the bacterial population. However, cow manure did reduce densities of R. solanacearum in Egyptian sandy soils, most probably by microbial competition as a clear shift in populations was detected with DGGE in these and Dutch sandy soils after manure amendment. Amendment with compost did not have a suppressive effect in any soil type. The absence of a disease suppressive effect of mineral and organic fertilization in Dutch clay soils may be related to the already high availability of inorganic and organic nutrients in these soils. This study shows that the mechanism of disease suppression of soil-borne plant pathogens may vary strongly according to the soil type, especially if quite different types of soil are used. 3aNPK fertilizers 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3abacterial wilt 3acattle manure 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acomposts 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3amicrobial competition 3anutrients 3aorganic production 3apathogen survival 3aplant pathogens 3apotatoes 3arhizosphere 3asand 3asandy clay soils 3asandy soils 3atemperate zones 3aEgypt 3aNetherlands 0aDGGE1 avan Bruggen, Ariena H.

Characterization of a set of genotypes that may contain different genes for resistance may help breeders to develop better and more durable resistance compared to current cultivars. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic relationships of 37 chickpea germplasm accessions differing in reaction to ascochyta blight using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers linked to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for resistance. The results demonstrated that ILC72 and ILC3279, landraces from the former Soviet Union, had SSR alleles that were common among the kabuli breeding lines and cultivars. A lower SSR allele diversity was found on LG4 than on other regions. No correlation was found between the dendrogram derived using SSRs at the QTL regions and the SSRs derived from other parts of the genome. The clustering based on 127 alleles of 17 SSRs associated with the QTL for ascochyta blight resistance enabled us to differentiate three major groups within the current germplasm accessions. The first group was the desi germplasm originating from India and cultivars derived from it. The second group was a mix of desi genotypes originating from India and Greece, and kabuli breeding lines from ICARDA and the University of Saskatchewan. The third and largest group consisted of landraces originating mostly from the former Soviet Union and breeding lines/cultivars of the kabuli type. Several moderately resistance genotypes that are distantly related were identified. Disease evaluation on three test populations suggested that it is possible to enhance the level of resistance by crossing moderately resistant parents with distinct genetic backgrounds at the QTL for resistance to ascochyta blight. 3aAscochyta 3aCicer arietinum 3aalleles 3ablight 3abreeding lines 3achickpeas 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agenetic background 3agermplasm 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3aGreece 3aIndia 3aSaskatchewan 3aUSSR 0aAscochyta blight resistance 0aQuantitative Trait Loci (QTL) 0aSimple Sequence Repeat (SSR)1 aWarkentin, T. 1 aTullu, A. 1 aVandenberg, A. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Sept., v. 119, no. 1 p.39-51dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9118-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012300167300001600290520139100306650000801697650002901705650001901734650002601753650002101779650001001800650001901810650003001829650001401859650001101873653002101884653002601905653001301931653001701944700002201961700003401983700001902017700002702036700001902063700001702082773012802099852000902227856008502236930003302321946001102354655001202365IND4394867920221118002601.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439486792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9156-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWander, J.

In four experiments the ability of the Hendrickx centrifuge to extract the sporangia from soil was compared with a method used by the Dutch Plant Protection Service, which is a modification of the recommended EPPO method. Naturally and artificially contaminated soil samples were used to study the recovery percentage of and variation in numbers of winter sporangia. The effects of soil type and inoculum density were studied. The Hendrickx centrifuge method, developed originally for extraction of free living nematodes from soil, performed better than the method used by the Dutch Plant Protection Service. This was due to a better extraction recovery (60% higher), a lower measurement error (50% lower) and a lower detection level (down to 0.02 sporangia g-¹ soil). The Hendrickx centrifuge method is much less labour-intensive than the method used by the Dutch Plant Protection Service. It can be used to extract many different organisms from soil, and DNA can be subsequently extracted from the supernatant for further PCR analysis.

Genetic variation within and between Russian Far East, North West and Caucasus populations of A. tenuissima from wheat was examined. In addition, genetic differences between isolates from various hosts were estimated. In total, 101 isolates of A. tenuissima were studied using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) with four primer combinations. Wright's fixation index (F st), gene flow (N m) and gene diversity (H s) were calculated. AFLP banding patterns indicated significant genetic distance and at the same time a low level of gene flow between the Far East and the two other groups of isolates originating from the European part of country. The degree of similarity between the North West and Caucasus populations was very high, as was the migration rate. Isolates analysed by UPGMA-based cluster analysis were grouped according to location of origin but irrespective of plant host. Based on the F st value, the group of isolates originating from wheat and barley were not found to differ significantly from each other. 3aAlternaria tenuissima 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abarley 3acluster analysis 3agene flow 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahost plants 3apathogens 3aseeds 3awheat 3aEast Asia 3aRussia 0aHost specialization1 aKlemsdal, Sonja S. 1 aLevitin, Mark M. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Oct., v. 119, no. 2 p.175-182dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9159-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013400165300001600299520161900315650002501934650001101959650001701970650001801987650001102005650001902016650001402035650002302049650001102072650001002083650001302093650001002106653002302116653002202139700001702161773013402178852000902312856008502321930003302406946001102439655001202450IND4393065220221118002730.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439306522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9131-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuveni, Moshe 10aImproved control of moldy-core decay (Alternaria alternata) in Red Delicious apple fruit by mixtures of DMI fungicides and captan  ap. 349-357.  aThe sterol biosynthesis inhibitors bromuconazole and difenoconazole and tank mixes of each fungicide with captan were applied to apples and evaluated as controls for moldy-core and fruit decay caused by Alternaria alternata. Effectiveness of a mixture of bromuconazole and captan in controlling colonization by the fungus was also evaluated. Decay formation by A. alternata on mature detached fruits was partially inhibited by bromuconazole at 0.5 μg ml-¹ and was completely inhibited at 50 μg ml-¹; it was significantly affected by either bromoconazole at 5 μg ml-¹ or captan at 1,250 μg ml-¹, and was completely inhibited by their mixture. In general, three foliar applications of bromuconazole or difenoconazole in the field, during the bloom period, reduced the numbers of infected fruits by 40-60% compared with untreated control trees. However, tank mixes of either fungicide with captan improved control of moldy-core in fruits at harvest. Tank mixtures of bromuconazole and captan also significantly reduced the percentage of fruits colonized by A. alternata when sampled at various days after full bloom. Artificial inoculations in the orchard at full bloom did not change the inhibitory effects of the tank mixtures. Large-scale demonstration trials in commercial orchards supported these findings. The inhibitory effects of tank mixes on decay development in detached fruits, and on moldy-core in the field indicate that a control programme based on mixtures of either bromuconazole or difenoconazole with captan during the bloom period can effectively reduce moldy-core on Red Delicious apples. 3aAlternaria alternata 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3abromuconazole 3acaptan 3adifenoconazole 3aflowering 3afoliar application 3afruits 3afungi 3aorchards 3atrees 0aMoldy-core disease 0aSterol inhibitors1 aPrusky, Dov 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Aug., v. 118, no. 4 p.349-357dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9131-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03003naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011700159300001600276520160000292650001401892650001201906650002101918650001001939650001301949650001001962650003701972650002202009650001102031650001002042650001202052650000902064650001402073650001402087650002202101650001202123650001402135653002402149653001502173700001702188700001702205700002002222773012902242852000902371856008502380930003302465946001102498655001202509IND4394594720221118002802.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439459472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9116-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbo, S. 14aThe sympatric Ascochyta pathosystems of Near Eastern legumes, a key for better understanding of pathogen biology  ap. 111-118.  aThe primary and secondary centres of origin of domesticated plants are often also the places of origin of their pathogens. Therefore, the Near Eastern cradle of agriculture, where crop plants, their wild progenitors, and other con-generic taxa grow sympatrically, may hold some clues on the biology of the pathogens of the respective crops. Unlike the situation in the well-studied Near Eastern cereals and their important diseases, hardly any data are available on basic questions regarding grain legumes. What is the role of genetic diversity at resistance loci of the wild hosts and is it greater compared with the cultigens? Are populations of Ascochyta pathogens infecting wild legumes genetically distinct from populations infecting their domesticated counterparts, and if so, is this differentiation related to differences in host specialization or to adaptation to different ecological conditions? Do isolates originating from wild taxa exhibit a similar level of aggressiveness and have different aggressiveness alleles compared with those originating from domesticated grain legumes? In this review we propose an experimental framework aimed at gaining answers to some of the above questions. The proposed approach includes comparative epidemiology of wild vs. domesticated plant communities, co-evolutionary study of pathogens and their hosts, phenotypic and genetic characterization of fungal isolates from wild and domesticated origins, and genetic analyses of pathogenicity and parasitic fitness among progeny derived from crosses between isolates from wild and domesticated hosts. 3aAscochyta 3aalleles 3acenter of origin 3acrops 3acrossing 3afungi 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3agrains 3ahosts 3alegumes 3aloci 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplant communities 3aprogeny 3avirulence 0aAscochyta pathogens 0aWild hosts1 aFrenkel, O. 1 aSherman, A. 1 aShtienberg, D. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Sept., v. 119, no. 1 p.111-118dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9116-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144245009900168300001600267520185800283650001902141650001402160650001902174650001902193650001702212650002202229650002002251650001302271650003002284651001302314700001502327700002002342700002202362700002202384773008302406852000902489930003302498945002502531946001302556655001202569IND4417567820221118002827.0090313e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441756782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBahaa-Eldin, E.A.R.10aHeavy Metal Contamination of Soil Beneath a Waste Disposal Site at Dengkil, Selangor, Malaysia  ap. 449-466.  aHeavy metals leaching from solid waste facilities pose concerns because of the metal ions being distributed to surroundings through surface, subsurface, lateral and/or vertical movement of water. In view of this concern, heavy metals, namely Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, and Co, in soil horizons beneath the Ampar Tenang waste disposal site at Dengkil, Selangor, were extensively studied through chemical analyses of 21 representative soil samples collected in triplicate. The soil samples were collected from nine augered boreholes. Three of the boreholes are located within the disposal site and three each up-slope and down-slope of the disposal site. Soils sampled from the soil-waste interface (ATI) within the dumping site show relatively high concentrations of most of the heavy metals analyzed as compared with samples collected from upslope area (ATU) of the dumping site. Soil samples from a downslope area (ATD) show a slightly elevated concentration of heavy metals. The results of chemical analyses also show that Cr, Zn and Pb have higher levels of concentration among all studied heavy metals. It was found that, in most cases, the heavy metal concentrations were generally high within the near surface soil layer and decreased in concentration with increasing depth. Site observations indicate that, in addition to the vertical infiltration of leachate from the solid waste, shallow groundwater level strongly influences contaminant dispersion in soils below the waste site. Properties of the soil indicate that the Ampar Tenang soil (ATS) is more permeable than the minimum limit of formation permeability required underlying a waste disposal site. The acidic-pH soil environment and groundwater fluctuations also influence the mobility of heavy metals spatially and vertically in the vicinity of the waste disposal site at Ampar Tenang. 3awaste disposal 3alandfills 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aheavy metals 3achemical analysis 3asoil properties 3aleaching 3agroundwater contamination 3aMalaysia1 aYusoff, I.1 aRahim, S.

We overlayed species distribution data for 14 plant lineages with the distribution of the reserve system (8.5% of the State's area) and identified the species that remained unprotected. We found that, depending upon the method employed, between 174 (5.7%) and 570 (18.7%) of species were not included within the reserve system. Two main unprotected regions were identified, one of which was also a centre of high diversity. Geographical range sizes of unprotected species were six times smaller than those species that were protected, while species richness of small-ranged endemic species coincided with general patterns of species richness. At the level of Western Australia's bioregions we found that conservation effectiveness was most dependent on characteristics of the reserve system rather than characteristics (size and positioning) of species ranges. At this scale, the most effective way to conserve more species in Western Australia would be to conserve more land, while conservation would be most successful in a uniformly dispersed reserve system. Our results highlight the fact that reserve systems may take on two design approaches based on scale--at continental scales, reserves should be clustered around the hotspots of endemic species, while within regions, an evenly distributed reserve system will most adequately sample species. 3acenter of diversity 3abiogeography 3aspecies diversity 3aindigenous species 3aAngiospermae 3aconservation areas 3aWestern Australia 0aMagnoliophyta1 aDunn, Robert R.1 aMajer, Jonathan D.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.817-831dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9321-8 7aarticle03308naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245013000175300001600305500002400321520198600345650001402331650002702345650001302372650001702385650002102402650001602423650000902439650001202448650001302460650001102473650001702484650001102501650001102512650001302523650001602536650001502552650001602567650001102583650001302594651001302607700002002620700002402640773009802664852000902762856005502771655001202826IND4399023120221118002305.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439902312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2007.00182.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHULTE, MARIE JOY10aBiology and control of the fruit borer, Conopomorpha sinensis Bradley on litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) in northern Thailand  ap. 525-529.  aIncludes references  aFruit and leaf shoot of litchi (Litchi chinensis) infestation by naturally occurring populations of the fruit borer, Conopomorpha sinensis larvae and C. sinensis parasitization rates were determined in litchi orchards in northern Thailand at high (ca. 1 400 m ASL) and low (ca. 800 m ASL) elevations with different, non-over-lapping fruiting seasons. In addition, spray applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai, the natural compound spinosad and the chemical pesticide imidacloprid were conducted in the field to test the effects of these agents on C. sinensis fruit infestation rate. Fruit infestation rate and fruit growth, studied in a low elevation orchard, were sigmoidal and showed a highly significant positive correlation (P· 0.01). Leaf shoot infestation rate in the low elevation orchard decreased in the course of the fruiting season (March until May), but increased in the high elevation orchard, where no fruits were present within the same period of time. Together, these results indicate that females of C. sinensis clearly prefer fruits over shoots for oviposition. If no fruits are available, which was the case in the high elevation orchard during that time, they are constrained to lay their eggs on shoots. The parasitization rate of C. sinensis larvae in untreated fruits was 54.3%. The parasitoid species were Chelonus chailini (90.8%) and Phanerotoma sp. (9.2%). In the leaf shoots, C. sinensis was found to be parasitized by Phanerotoma sp. and Apanteles briareus. The applications of the different active agents had no significant effect on C. sinensis fruit infestation compared to the untreated control. Besides the cryptic life of the larvae, this is most probably explained by the fact that C. sinensis has several generations during the fruiting season. Because of the high parasitization rates recorded, an alternative and more effective control measure than the application of pesticides might be the augmentative release of parasitoids. 3aApanteles 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aChelonus 3aConopomorpha 3aLitchi chinensis 3aPhanerotoma 3aeggs 3afemales 3afruiting 3afruits 3aimidacloprid 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aorchards 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3ashoots 3aspinosad 3aThailand1 aMartin, Konrad.1 aSauerborn, Joachim.0 tInsect science.g2007 Dec., v. 14, no. 6 p.525-529dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2007.00182.x 7aarticle02585naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245011200210300001800322500002400340506007600364520125100440506003701691650002501728650002301753650001101776650001301787650001001800650001101810650002301821650003701844650001401881651001201895700002301907700001901930773013701949852000902086856008002095655001202175IND4424322020221207120646.0090807e20090815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442432202DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00374-092doi7 aPMC27254602pmcid7 a195423362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakkinen, M.q(Marjaana)10aChickens and Cattle as Sources of Sporadic Domestically Acquired Campylobacter jejuni Infections in Finland  ap. 5244-5249.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA substantial sampling among domestic human campylobacter cases, chicken process lots, and cattle at slaughter was performed during the seasonal peak of human infections. Campylobacter jejuni isolates (n = 419) were subtyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with SmaI, and isolates representing overlapping types (n = 212) were further subtyped using KpnI for restriction. The SmaI/KpnI profiles of 55.4% (97/175) of the human isolates were indistinguishable from those of the chicken or cattle isolates. The overlapping SmaI/KpnI subtypes accounted for 69.8% (30/43) and 15.9% (32/201) of the chicken and cattle isolates, respectively. The occurrence of identical SmaI/KpnI subtypes with human C. jejuni isolates was significantly associated with animal host species (P < 0.001). A temporal association of isolates from chickens and patients was possible in 31.4% (55/175) of the human infections. Besides chickens as sources of C. jejuni in the sporadic infections, the role of cattle appears notable. New approaches to restrict the occurrence of campylobacters in other farm animals may be needed in addition to hygienic measures in chicken production. However, only about half of the human infections were attributable to these sources.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3acampylobacteriosis 3acattle 3achickens 3ahosts 3ahumans 3apoultry production 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aslaughter 3aFinland1 aNakari, Ulla-Maija1 aSiitonen, Anja0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Aug. 15, v. 75, no. 16 p.5244-5249dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00374-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04007naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002200157245011300179300001600292500002400308500001500332520169300347650000902040650001702049650001302066650001202079650002102091650002202112650001102134650001702145650003002162650001302192650001702205650001202222650001602234650001902250650001402269650001502283650002202298650001802320650001902338650002902357650001402386650003902400650002402439650005002463650002502513650005702538650003102595650002302626650004202649650003302691650001302724650003002737650001702767650004902784650004202833650002202875653001302897700001502910700002002925700001902945700001802964700001902982700002303001700002003024773010603044852000903150856007803159655001203237IND4406820420221118002051.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440682042DNAL7 a184205952pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcn0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Md.

In public databases, this protein was annotated as a putative Os02g0465900 protein of rice. The OsARP gene was introduced into tobacco under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The transformants were selected for their ability to grow on medium containing kanamycin. Incorporation of the transgene in the genome of tobacco was confirmed by PCR, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Transgenic plants had better growth and vigor than non-transgenic plants under salt stress in vitro. Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type. The OsARP protein was localized in the tonoplast of rice plants. Transgenic plants accumulated more Na⁺ in their leaf tissue than did wild-type plants. It is conceivable that the toxic effect of Na⁺ in the cytosol might be reduced by sequestration into vacuoles. The rate of water loss was higher in the wild type than in transgenic plants under salt stress. Increased vacuolar solute accumulation and water retention could confer salt tolerance in transgenic plants. Tonoplast vesicles isolated from OsARP transgenic plants showed Na⁺/H⁺ exchange rates 3-fold higher than those of wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsARP on the tonoplasts plays an important role in compartmentation of Na⁺ into vacuoles. We suggest that OsARP is a new type of protein participating in Na⁺ uptake in vacuoles. 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3avacuoles 3acytosol 3aWestern blotting 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity 3arice protein 3atobacco 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3akanamycin 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3agrowing media 3aphotosystem II 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3atonoplast 2aAntiportersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCationsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSalinity 2aSodium Chloridextoxicity 2aTime Factors 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVacuolesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aproteins1 aQi, Yanhua1 aYamada, Satoshi1 aShibuya, Izumi1 aDeng, Xi-Ping1 aKwak, Sang-Soo1 aKaminaka, Hironori1 aTanaka, Kiyoshi0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2008 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.880-890dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcn0623Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02769naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245017200163300001600335500002400351520167800375650001802053650001502071650002202086650001402108650001102122650001502133650003302148650001302181700001802194700002002212700001702232773011302249852000902362856004802371655001202419IND4442897220221118002309.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444289722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-010-0358-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemir, Selami10aCombined Use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) for Source Identification and Source Apportionment in Air Pollution Modeling Studies  ap. 429-439.  aIncludes references  aChemical mass balance (CMB) and principal component analysis (PCA) are used together for source identification and source apportionment in this air pollution modeling study. Source profile sets, each of which contains five source profiles based on ten pollutant species, were generated using a computer program. Another algorithm was implemented to produce ten random data sets, which was composed of 100 simulated measurement results for all of ten pollutant species. Ten source profile sets were selected. Five of them contained sources of dissimilar characteristics, whereas the other five were chosen from those of similar emission profiles. Ten simulated data sets for each source profile set were used in the analyses. PCA was applied to all simulated data sets; a number of principal factors were extracted and interpreted. The identified sources for each data set were used in fitting with CMB analyses, and source contributions were estimated. The performance of PCA-CMB combination was evaluated in the aspect of percent variance explained, percent apportionment, R ², and χ ². PCA was able to explain 89.6% to 100% of the variance within the data sets used. Two to five sources were extracted depending on the characteristics of source profile sets used. CMB was found to be successful in the aspect of percent apportionment since 95.4% to 100% of mass concentrations were apportioned. The values of R ² and χ ² were found out to range from 0.981 to 1.000 and from 0.000 to 29.947, respectively. Evaluating overall results from the analyses, PCA-CMB combination produced satisfactory results in the aspect of source identification and source apportionment. 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aemissions 3amodels 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3avariance1 aSaral, Arslan1 aErtürk, Ferruh1 aKuzu, Levent0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 Oct., v. 212, no. 1-4 p.429-439dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0358-4 7aarticle02265naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008900171300001600260500002400276520117000300650001401470650001201484650002201496650001401518650001201532650002301544650000901567650001601576650002001592651002001612700002001632700001901652700001901671700001901690773010601709852000901815856005501824655001201879IND4458483420221118002058.0110527e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445848342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01514.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Rachel.10aIs an online healthy lifestyles program acceptable for parents of preschool children  ap. 149-154.  aIncludes references  aAims: To assess the acceptability and potential efficacy of an online healthy lifestyles program for parents of overweight, or at risk of overweight, preschool-aged children. Methods: A pilot trial was conducted within a regional area of New South Wales, Australia. Two cohorts totalling 47 dyads were recruited. Primary outcomes were parental self-reported perceived knowledge and parental proxy-reported behaviour of their child. Data analysis was completed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (v 16). Results: At follow up (10 weeks) parents reported high acceptability of the program. Changes in the hypothesised direction were reported for all parental perceived knowledge and parental and child behavioural outcomes. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the acceptability and potential efficacy of an online healthy lifestyles program for parents of preschool children. The Time2bHealthy Program offers a viable option for parental involvement in obesity prevention programs targeting young children. Given the online nature of the program it has the capacity to be utilised within metropolitan, regional and rural areas of Australia. 3alifestyle 3aobesity 3aparental behavior 3aparenting 3aparents 3apreschool children 3arisk 3arural areas 3asocial sciences 3aNew South Wales1 aWELLS, Michelle1 aOKELY, Anthony1 aLockyer, Lori.1 aWalton, Karen.0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2011 June, v. 68, no. 2 p.149-154dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01514.x 7aarticle03924naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100003400162245007400196300001800270500002400288520196400312650002302276650002902299650001802328650002202346650001502368650001602383650002002399650003802419650001902457650002102476650001702497650002302514650000802537650002302545650001402568650002402582650001902606650001302625650001202638650002002650650003802670650001802708650003002726650005102756650005102807650001102858650003102869650002302900650000902923650001602932651001002948700002502958700001902983700002303002700002203025700002003047773010303067852000903170856008303179655001203262IND4380048820060429000000.0060429s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438004882DNAL7 a166446372pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.29510582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Real, José-Manuel10aBurden of Infection and Insulin Resistance in Healthy Middle-Aged Men  ap. 1058-1064.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--We hypothesized that burden of infection could be associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, resulting in insulin resistance. We aimed to study the effect of exposure to four infections on insulin sensitivity in apparently healthy middle-aged men (n = 124). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--By inclusion criteria, all subjects were hepatitis C virus antibody seronegative. Each study subject's serum was tested for specific IgG class antibodies against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, enteroviruses, and Chlamydia pneumoniae through the use of quantitative in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated using minimal model analysis. RESULTS:--The HSV-2 titer was negatively associated with insulin sensitivity even after controlling for BMI, age, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The associations were stronger when considering the infection burden. In particular, in those subjects who were seropositive for C. pneumoniae, the relationship between the quantitative seropositivity index (a measure of the exposure to various pathogens) and insulin sensitivity was strengthened (r = -0.50, P < 0.0001). We also observed decreasing mean insulin sensitivity index with increasing seropositivity score in subjects positive for enteroviruses. In the latter, the relationship between insulin sensitivity and seropositivity was especially significant (r = -0.71, P < 0.0001). In a multivariate regression analysis, both BMI and quantitative seropositivity index (7%) independently predicted insulin sensitivity variance in subjects with C. pneumoniae seropositivity. When controlling for CRP, this association was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS:--Pathogen burden showed the strongest association with insulin resistance, especially with enteroviruses and C. pneumoniae seropositivity. We hypothesize that exposure to multiple pathogens could cause a chronic low-grade inflammation, resulting in insulin resistance. 3aC-reactive protein 3aChlamydophila pneumoniae 3aEnterovirus C 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherpes simplex 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amen 3amiddle-aged adults 3apathogens 3aregression analysis 3aseroprevalence 3avariance 3aviruses 2aCost of Illness 2aEnterovirus Infectionsxeconomics 2aHealth Status 2aHerpes Simplexxeconomics 2aHerpesvirus 1, Humanxisolation & purification 2aHerpesvirus 2, Humanxisolation & purification 2aHumans 2aInsulinxbloodxsecretion. 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 0aSpain1 aLópez-Bermejo, Abel1 aVendrell, Joan1 aFerri, Maria-José1 aRecasens, Mónica1 aRicart, Wifredo0 tDiabetes care.g2006 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.1058-1064dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.29510583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03031naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002100179245011300200300001600313500002400329500001500353520151900368650001301887650002701900650002801927650001501955650001501970650001301985650002801998650002302026650002602049650001702075650002002092650001902112650002102131650002902152653005902181700002002240773010502260852000902365856009202374930003302466945002502499946001302524655001202537IND4435441820221118002431.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443544182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.2009.00207.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ205 0aQ1151 aIturriaga, M.

A study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of chlorine to kill Salmonella Montevideo cells during colonization on the surface of tomatoes. Tomatoes (Lycopersicum esculentum) were spot-inoculated with 100 μL (ca. 8 log cfu) of S. Montevideo. To promote attachment, inoculated fruits were incubated for 90 min at 22C, then washed to remove unattached cells and stored at 30C and 97% relative humidity for up to 10 days. Periodically, tomatoes were treated with chlorine (1000 or 200 mg/L) or water (control). On day 0, treatments with 1000 or 200 mg/L of chlorine, and water reduced the pathogen population by approximately 5.0, 4.5 and 0.4 log cfu/tomato, respectively. The inactivation efficacy of the sanitizers decreased as the storage time elapsed. By the 7th day, the populations recovered from tomatoes treated with water and disinfectants were not significantly different (P < 0.5). This study clearly shows how the effectiveness of chlorine is modified when treatments are applied to tomatoes several days after the contamination with a human pathogen took place. The diminished effect of disinfection treatments suggests that microorganisms colonizing on surfaces become more resistant to germicides, and that biofilms may provide protective sites, or both. The results also reinforce the concept that once contaminated, bacterial pathogens can persist on tomatoes throughout a normal distribution time. 3atomatoes 3abacterial colonization 3abacterial contamination 3asanitizers 3asanitizing 3achlorine 3amicrobiological quality 3afood contamination 3aSalmonella Montevideo 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial growth 3aantibacterial properties 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Montevideo1 aEscartin, E.

Termination at UGA competes with selenocysteine (Sec) incorporation at Sec-dedicated UGA codons, and RF2 thereby counteracts expression of selenoproteins. prfB is an essential gene in E. coli and can therefore not be removed in order to increase yield of recombinant selenoproteins. We therefore constructed an E. coli strain with the endogenous chromosomal promoter of prfB replaced with the titratable PBAD promoter. Knockdown of prfB expression gave a bacteriostatic effect, while two- to sevenfold overexpression of RF2 resulted in a slightly lowered growth rate in late exponential phase. In a turbidostatic fermentor system the simultaneous impact of prfB knockdown on growth and recombinant selenoprotein expression was subsequently studied, using production of mammalian thioredoxin reductase as model system. This showed that lowering the levels of RF2 correlated directly with increasing Sec incorporation specificity, while also affecting total selenoprotein yield concomitant with a lower growth rate. This study thus demonstrates that expression of prfB can be titrated through targeted exchange of the native promoter with a PBAD-promoter and that knockdown of RF2 can result in almost full efficiency of Sec incorporation at the cost of lower total selenoprotein yield.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afermenters 3aselenoproteins 3acodons 3aselenocysteine 3amammals 3atitration 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCodon 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Termination Factorsxgenetics 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSelenocysteinexmetabolism 2aSelenoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aThioredoxin-Disulfide Reductasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0agenes1 aArnér, Elias S.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Jan., v. 73, no. 2 p.432-441dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02019-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02961naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245014200186300001800328500001500346520145000361650002001811650001001831650001901841650002001860650002301880650001401903650003001917650001701947650002301964650003501987650000902022650001302031650003402044650002102078650002102099650003202120653001202152700001602164773010502180852000902285856007702294930003302371945002502404946001302429961001302442655001202455IND4370900120221118002251.0050602e20050323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437090012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04809972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHuwe, J.K.10aLaboratory and on-farm studies on the bioaccumulation and elimination of dioxins from a contaminated mineral supplement fed to dairy cows  ap. 2362-2370.  a2019-12-04  aA dioxin-contaminated mineral supplement was used to study the bioaccumulation and elimination of dioxins in two dairy cows. The supplement was mixed into the total maintenance ration and fed to the cows for 40 days after which unfortified diets were fed for 40 additional days. Dioxins and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured twice a week in the milk and in selected tissues of the cows, one at death (day 10 of withdrawal) and one at slaughter (day 40 of withdrawal). The dioxins and PCBs were readily transferred into the milk, and at steady state, total toxic equivalents were concentrated 6-fold into the milk fat from the diet. Bioaccumulation was inversely related to chlorination number. The elimination of dioxins and PCBs in milk was biphasic. With the exception of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodioxin and both octachlorinated congeners, dioxin and furan half-lives in milk were approximately 3-5 days for the alpha-phase and 35-50 days for the beta-phase. PCB-169 had a longer half-life: 11 (alpha) and 200 days (beta). When milk and feed samples from Minnesota farms that had used similar contaminated mineral supplements were analyzed, no elevated dioxin levels were found in milk. It appeared that although the dioxins from the mineral supplements have the potential to bioaccumulate, dilution into the total diet was sufficient to prevent a significant rise in the dioxin concentrations in the milk at these farms. 3amagnesium oxide 3aliver 3acattle feeding 3abioaccumulation 3afood contamination 3aexcretion 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3adairy cattle 3afeed contamination 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3amilk 3amilk fat 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3afeed supplements 3ahuman food chain 3adietary mineral supplements 0adioxins1 aSmith, D.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Mar. 23, v. 53, no. 6 p.2362-2370x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04809973Available from publisher's Web site  a20070724b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02969naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245013900175300001600314500002400330520164900354650001202003650002502015650003102040650001502071650004302086650001502129650002102144650002102165650000902186650003502195700002102230700002202251700002002273700001902293700002402312700001802336773010202354852000902456856009402465655001202559IND4379285020221118002232.0060402s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437928502DNAL7 a10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-17232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraki, Shin-ichi10aPolymorphisms of the Protein Kinase C-{szligbeta} Gene (PRKCB1) Accelerate Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes Without Overt Proteinuria  ap. 864-868.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--We investigated the contribution of PKC-{szligbeta} gene (PRKCB1) polymorphisms to diabetic kidney disease in a prospective observational follow-up study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A total of 364 Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes without overt proteinuria were enrolled during 1996-1998 and followed until 2004. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (-1504C/T, -546C/G, -348A/G, -278C/T, and -238C/G) in the promoter region of PRKCB1 were genotyped. The end points were transition from stage to stage of diabetic nephropathy as a time-to-event outcome and the annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a slope-based outcome. RESULTS:--During the study (median 6 years), 34 of 364 subjects (9.3%) progressed. Kaplan-Meier estimation revealed that subjects with both T allele at -1054 C/T and G allele at -546 C/G polymorphisms frequently showed transition to advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy (P = 0.015). The annual change rate in eGFR in the subjects with both alleles was also significantly higher than in others (-2.96 ± 0.62 vs. -1.63 ± 0.15 ml/min per 1.73 m²/year, P = 0.02). The estimated frequency of this risk T-G haplotype was significantly higher in the progressors who showed transition to advanced nephropathy stages (12%) than in the nonprogressors (5%) (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.0-5.2]), and it was also higher in those with accelerated decline of the [Delta] eGFR ([>/=]3 ml/min per 1.73 m²/year) than in those without (2.1 [1.1-3.9]). CONCLUSIONS:--Our study indicates that PRKCB1 is a predictor for worsening of kidney disease in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes. 3aalleles 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahaplotypes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apromoter regions 3aprotein kinase C 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aHaneda, Masakazu1 aSugimoto, Toshiro1 aIsono, Motohide1 aIsshiki, Keiji1 aKashiwagi, Atsunori1 aKoya, Daisuke0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.864-868dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-17233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04347naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001900173245012300192300001600315500002400331520191800355650001202273650001502285650001902300650001302319650001702332650004002349650001602389650001902405650001802424650001802442650003702460650001102497650001502508650003002523650002402553650000902577650001402586650003502600650003202635650002702667650001502694650002502709650005702734650001002791650006802801650001102869650003802880650001302918650003002931650002402961650002302985650001103008650000903019650001403028650002403042650001703066650004203083700001803125700001903143700002103162700001903183700002103202700002103223700001403244700002103258700001803279700002103297700001803318773010203336852000903438856009403447655001203541IND4379284920221118002248.0060402s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437928492DNAL7 a165678282pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-19232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumnik, Zdenek10aRisk of Celiac Disease in Children With Type 1 Diabetes Is Modified by Positivity for HLA-DQB1*02-DQA1*05 andTNF -308A  ap. 858-863.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--The overlap between genetic susceptibility to celiac disease (CD) and to type 1 diabetes is incomplete; therefore, some genetic polymorphisms may significantly modify the risk of CD in subjects with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate whether the susceptibility to CD in diabetic children is modified by positivity for HLA-DQB1*02-DQA1*05 and DQB1*0302-DQA1*03 and by alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the genes encoding CTLA4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-{szligbeta}, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-[alpha], interferon (IFN)-[gamma], interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Genotypic data were compared between 130 case subjects (children with type 1 diabetes and CD diagnosed using endomysium antibodies) and 245 control subjects (children with type 1 diabetes only, optimally two per case, matched for center, age at type 1 diabetes onset, and type 1 diabetes duration). The subjects were recruited from 10 major European pediatric diabetes centers performing regular screening for CD. The polymorphisms were determined using PCR with sequence-specific primers, and the risk was assessed by building a step-up conditional logistic regression model using variables that were significantly associated with CD in the univariate analysis. RESULTS:--The best-fitted model showed that risk of CD is increased by presence of HLA-DQB1*02-DQA1*05 (odds ratio 4.5 [95% CI 1.8-11], for homozygosity, and 2.0 [1.1-3.7], for a single dose) and also independently by TNF -308A (1.9 [1.1-3.2], for phenotypic positivity), whereas IL1-[alpha] -889T showed a weak negative association (0.6 [0.4-0.9]). CONCLUSIONS:--The results indicate that the risk of CD in children with type 1 diabetes is significantly modified both by the presence of HLA-DQB1*02-DQA1*05 and by a variant of another gene within the major histocompatibility complex, the TNF -308A. 3aalleles 3aantibodies 3aceliac disease 3achildren 3ahomozygosity 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainterferons 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atransforming growth factors 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAdolescent 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCeliac Diseasexcomplicationsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aChild 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xcomplicationsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aHLA-DQ Antigensxgenetics 2aHLA-DQ alpha-Chains 2aHLA-DQ beta-Chains 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgenetics1 aCinek, Ondrej1 aBratanic, Nina1 aKordonouri, Olga1 aKulich, Michal1 aRoszai, Barnabas1 aArató, András.1 aLebl, Jan1 aSoltész, Gyula.1 aDanne, Thomas1 aBattelino, Tadej1 aSchober, Edit0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.858-863dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-19233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03513naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002000173245011000193300001600303500002400319520159300343650001601936650002701952650001301979650001401992650001202006650002102018650001202039650001902051650003602070650001302106650001702119650003102136650001802167650000902185650001802194650002002212650001602232650003002248650003902278650006202317650001802379650001102397650002502408650002402433650001102457650000902468650001702477700002102494700002302515700001902538700002302557700001802580700002002598700001702618700002302635773010202658852000902760856009402769655001202863IND4379284420221118002429.0060402s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437928442DNAL7 a165678232pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-17692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrief, Paula M.10aDepression and Glycemic Control in Elderly Ethnically Diverse Patients With Diabetes: The IDEATel Project  ap. 830-835.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of comorbid depression on glycemic control and on response to a telemedicine case management intervention for elderly, ethnically diverse diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Medicare beneficiaries in underserved areas were participants (n = 1,665) in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) project and randomized to a telemedicine case management intervention or usual care. The data analyzed include baseline demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, insulin use, years of education, years of diabetes, and pack-years smoked) and measures of glycemic control (HbA[subscript 1c] [A1C]), comorbidity, diabetes symptom severity, functional disability and depression, and 1-year (n = 1,578) A1C. The association between depression and glycemic control was analyzed cross-sectionally and prospectively. RESULTS:--At baseline, there was a significant correlation between depression and A1C and a trend for depression to predict A1C when other factors were controlled. However, in prospective analyses, depression did not predict change in A1C, either in the control or intervention group. CONCLUSIONS:--In this large sample of elderly diabetic patients, a weak relationship between depression and A1C was found, but depression did not prospectively predict change in glycemic control. Thus, there is no evidence that depression should be used to exclude patients from interventions. Also, we should evaluate the impact of depression on outcomes other than glycemic control. 3acomorbidity 3ademographic statistics 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3aelderly 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3amarital status 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apatients 3atelemedicine 2aActivities of Daily Living 2aBlack People. 2aAged 2aBlood Glucose 2aCase Management 2aComorbidity 2aDepressionxcomplications 2aDiabetes Complicationsxpsychology 2aDiabetes Mellitusxbloodxethnologyxpsychologyxtherapy. 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobin. 2aHispanic or Latino. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aTelemedicine1 aMorin, Philip C.1 aIzquierdo, Roberto1 aTeresi, Jeanne1 aEimicke, Joseph P.1 aGoland, Robin1 aStarren, Justin1 aShea, Steven1 aWeinstock, Ruth S.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.830-835dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-17693Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03649naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001400285520194600299650001802245650002002263650002002283650002102303650002702324650002702351650001802378650002702396650002702423650002602450650002702476650002502503650002202528650002902550650001602579650002302595650002102618650001502639650000902654650001902663650003002682650001402712700001702726700001302743700001702756700002202773700001302795700001802808700001202826700001602838773016902854856005103023852000903074655001203083IND60589043720221118002403.0180131e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058904372DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shengan10aBacteriostatic Effect of Quercetin as an Antibiotic Alternative In Vivo and Its Antibacterial Mechanism In Vitro  ap. 68-78.  aQuercetin, a ubiquitous flavonoid, is known to have antibacterial effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of quercetin on cecal microbiota of Arbor Acre (AA) broiler chickens in vivo and the bacteriostatic effect and antibacterial mechanism of quercetin in vitro. In vivo, 480 AA broilers (1 day old) were randomly allotted to four treatments (negative control and 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 g of quercetin per kg of diet) for 42 days. Cecal microbial population and distribution were measured at the end of the experiment. The cecal microflora in these broilers included Proteobacteria, Fimicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Deferribacteres. Compared with the negative control, quercetin significantly decreased the copies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05), Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (P < 0.01), Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.01), and Escherichia coli (P < 0.01) but significantly increased the copies of Lactobacillus (P < 0.01), Bifidobacterium (P < 0.01), and total bacteria (P < 0.01). In vitro, we investigated the bacteriostatic effect of quercetin on four kinds of bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. enterica Typhimurium, and S. aureus) and the antibacterial mechanism of quercetin in E. coli and S. aureus. The bacteriostatic effect of quercetin was stronger on gram-positive bacteria than on gram-negative bacteria. Quercetin damaged the cell walls and membranes of E. coli (at 50 × MIC) and S. aureus (at 10 × MIC). Compared with the control, the activity of the extracellular alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase and concentrations of soluble protein in E. coli and S. aureus were significantly increased (all P < 0.01), and the activity of ATP in S. aureus was significantly increased (P < 0.01); however, no significant change in ATP activity in E. coli was observed (P > 0.05). These results suggest that quercetin has potential as an alternative antibiotic feed additive in animal production. 3aBacteroidetes 3aBifidobacterium 3aDeferribacteres 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aLactobacillus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal production 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abeta-galactosidase 3abroiler chickens 3acell walls 3adiet 3afeed additives 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aquercetin1 aYao, Jiaying1 aZhou, Bo1 aYang, Jiaxin1 aChaudry, Maria T.1 aWang, Mi1 aXiao, Fenglin1 aLi, Yao1 aYin, Wenzhe0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.68-78dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-214  aDNAL 7aarticle01077naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245005600161300001600217520025200233650001100485650002100496650001600517650001200533650001000545650001500555700001700570773014900587856004200736852000900778655001200787IND60589042320221118002129.0180131e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058904232DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.263632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, D.

We used the 3D Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model (ELCOM) to estimate the dynamics of tidal currents, salt flux and residence time in the Macuse Estuary, central Mozambique. The model was calibrated using data acquired from field-data measurements obtained in 2014 with an acoustic Doppler current profiler and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts and a tide-gauge. The water flow dynamics that were tracked indicated that tidal currents of 100 cm s⁻¹ were dissipated by friction caused by bathymetric morphology during both the spring and neap tides. The water dissipation was translated into a phase-difference delay of ∼15 min between the catchment zone and the outlet during flood and ebb tides. The study showed that tidal currents and river discharges controlled the salt flux (2.07 × 10⁵ g kg⁻¹ m³ s⁻¹) and the variation in residence time from hours to 40 days. The water ages were mostly driven by U-velocity tidal currents, bathymetric gradients and seasonal river discharges of ∼500 m³ s⁻¹. River discharges seasonally affected salinity changes between 15 and 30, and changes in the concentration of suspended sediments of ∼300 mg l⁻¹. In addition, it was shown that ELCOM was able to track the water-particle dynamics well, indicating the model’s suitability. These results contribute to our understanding of the effect of water-exchange dynamics on residence time and salt flux in shallow coastal inlet systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aEdital 47/2014cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  aSCHOLARSHIPcEduardo Mondlane University 3aacoustics 3acoastal inlets 3adata collection 3aestuaries 3afriction 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3amodels 3arivers 3asalinity 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3awater flow 3awatersheds 3aMozambique 0abathymetry 0abottom morphology 0acoastal inlet 0aELCOM 0aresidence time 0awater quality1 aCastro, JWA1 aMachava, SFA0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.203-219dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12126x1814-23387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2019.16242763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245015600175300001400331520223600345592002802581650001702609650003302626650002602659650001702685650002202702650001302724650001502737650001202752650002202764650003302786650001402819650001202833650004402845653002702889653004902916653002902965700005902994700001803053773010203071856008703173852000903260655001203269IND60552603020221120132525.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMărginean, Ioan,14aThe role of ultra high performance liquid chromatography with time of flight detection for the identification of synthetic cannabinoids in seized drugs  ap. 83-91.  aSeparation and mass spectrometric techniques are integral parts of forensic drug analysis for both screening and confirmation. The Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG), which is responsible for setting standards for drug analysis, requires for drug identification a Category A test such as mass spectrometry with an additional test from either Category B or C. If a Category A method is not used at least two uncorrelated tests from Category B must be included, for which separation techniques such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography would qualify. The utility and validity of using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for the analysis of synthetic cannabinoids is presented. The separation of 32 solutes, including 23 controlled substances and nine non-controlled positional isomers of JWH-018, are compared using UHPLC with TOF detection and capillary GC with electron ionization (EI). For these solutes, the reversed phase UHPLC separation on three different 2.1mm×150mm×2.7μm superficially porous (SPP) columns (C18, Phenyl-Hexyl and Dimethylpentafluorophenylpropyl (PFP)) compared favorably with the capillary gas chromatography (GC) separation using an Elite-5MS column 0.25mm×30m×0.25μm. Principal component analysis revealed that all three UHPLC separations for the separation of the controlled substances are orthogonal to the capillary GC separation. It was also revealed by principal component analysis that the separation of JWH-018 and the nine non-controlled positional isomers for the various techniques were significantly more correlated than the separation of the controlled substances. Although most of the controlled synthetic cannabinoids gave unique TOF in-source collision-induced dissociation MS spectra and EI spectra, it was not possible to discriminate among the geometric isomers (CP47, 497, Epi CP47, 497; Cp47, 497 C8 homologue, Epi CP47, 497 C8 homologue). JWH-018 could be distinguished from the non-controlled isomers based on its EI spectra. In contrast, several of the non-controlled JWH-018 isomers give identical TOF in-source collision-induced dissociation MS spectra to JWH-018.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannabinoids 3acapillary gas chromatography 3acontrolled substances 3adissociation 3aforensic sciences 3ageometry 3aionization 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3aprincipal component analysis 3ascreening 3asolutes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aSynthetic cannabinoids 0aUltra high performance liquid chromatography 0aTime of flight detection1 aRowe, Walter F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1013-768X1 aLurie, Ira S.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.83-91dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245011400194300001500308520219400323592002802517650000802545650001502553650002302568650001202591650002402603650000902627650001702636650002902653650002002682650001502702650001302717650001402730650002902744700001402773700001402787700001802801773015202819856006902971856010503040990002303145852000903168655001203177IND60643852220221118024922.0190514e20160225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064385222DNAL7 a10.3791/534172doi7 aPMC48281832pmcid7 a269670012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandas, Demet10aExperimental approaches to study mitochondrial localization and function of a nuclear cell cycle kinase, cdk1  ap. e53417.  aAlthough mitochondria possess their own transcriptional machinery, merely 1% of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized inside the organelle. The nuclear-encoded proteins are transported into mitochondria guided by their mitochondria targeting sequences (MTS); however, a majority of mitochondrial localized proteins lack an identifiable MTS. Nevertheless, the fact that MTS can instruct proteins to go into the mitochondria provides a valuable tool for studying mitochondrial functions of normally nuclear and/or cytoplasmic proteins. We have recently identified the cell cycle kinase CyclinB1/Cdk1 complex in the mitochondria. To specifically study the mitochondrial functions of this complex, mitochondrial overexpression and knock-down of this complex without interfering with its nuclear or cytoplasmic functions were essential. By tagging CyclinB1/Cdk1 with MTS, we were able to achieve mitochondrial overexpression of this complex to study its mitochondrial targets as well as functions. Via tagging dominant-negative Cdk1 with MTS, inhibition of Cdk1 activity was accomplished particularly in the mitochondria. Potential mitochondrial targets of CyclinB1/Cdk1 complex were identified using a gel-based proteomics approach. Unlike traditional 2D gel analysis, we employed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technology followed by phosphoprotein staining to fluorescently label differentially phosphorylated proteins in mitochondrial Cdk1 expressing cells. Identification of phosphoprotein spots that were altered in wild type versus dominant negative Cdk1 bearing mitochondria revealed the identity of mitochondrial targets of Cdk1. Finally, to determine the effect of CyclinB1/Cdk1 mitochondrial localization in cell cycle progression, a cell proliferation assay using a synthetic thymidine analogue EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) was used to monitor the cells as they go through the cell cycle and replicate their DNA. Altogether, we demonstrated a variety of approaches available to study mitochondrial localization and activity of a cell cycle kinase. These are advanced, yet easy to follow methods that will be beneficial to many cell biology researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3aenzymes 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3amitochondria 3anuclear-encoded proteins 3aphosphoproteins 3aproteomics 3astaining 3athymidine 3atranscription (genetics)1 aQin, Lili1 aFan, Ming1 aLi, Jian-Jian0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Feb. 25, , no. 108 p.e53417-e53417dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534173Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53417/experimental-approaches-to-study-mitochondrial-localization-function  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245014900210300001600359500001900375520169800394592002802092650001702120650000902137650002302146650001202169650001102181650001802192650002302210650001202233650002602245650001502271650001202286651001402298653001602312653002302328653001402351653001902365653001302384653001802397653001902415653001402434700001802448700002002466700001802486700002202504700002102526700001702547700002202564700002102586700001802607700002702625700002302652773010402675856008102779852000902860655001202869IND60715745920221119161257.0201102e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574592DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053190008512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Caspian L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6990-795210aUsing occupancy-based camera-trap surveys to assess the Critically Endangered primate Macaca nigra across its range in North Sulawesi, Indonesia  ap. 784-793.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrimates are one of the most threatened groups of mammals. Understanding their patterns of population occurrence and abundance, especially in response to threats, is critical for informing conservation action. The crested black macaque Macaca nigra is the only Critically Endangered species of Sulawesi's seven endemic macaques. Little is known about its distribution or its response to deforestation and hunting. We conducted a camera-trap survey across the entire species range using an occupancy-based analytical approach to (1) establish the first range-wide baseline of occurrence, (2) investigate how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence occurrence, (3) identify priority conservation subpopulations, and (4) test the efficacy of the sampling and analytical protocol for temporal monitoring of M. nigra using occupancy as the state variable. From 9,753 camera-trap days, M. nigra was detected on 473 days at 77 of the 111 camera locations. Species occupancy was 0.66 and highest inside protected areas and closed canopy forest. We identified eight distinct subpopulations, based on distribution and forest fragment size. To inform future monitoring, we used a power analysis to determine if our effort would allow us to detect inter-annual occupancy declines of 10%, and found that 90 camera locations surveyed for 3 months (8,100 camera days) across three consecutive seasons is the effort required to detect such change with 80% certainty. Our study underscores the importance of well-managed protected areas and intact forests for the long-term survival of the crested black macaque, and tests the effectiveness of camera traps to monitor primates at the landscape scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca nigra 3aOryx 3aanalytical methods 3acameras 3acanopy 3adeforestation 3aendangered species 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3asurveys 3aIndonesia 0aCamera trap 0apresence–absence 0aoccupancy 0apower analysis 0aprimates 0adetectability 0acost–benefit 0amodelling1 aHilser, Harry1 aLinkie, Matthew1 aRahasia, Rivo1 aRovero, Francesco1 aPusparini, Wulan1 aHunowu, Iwan1 aPatandung, Alfons1 aAndayani, Noviar1 aTasirin, John1 aNistyantara, Lukita A.1 aBowkett, Andrew E.0 tOryx.g2020 Nov., v. 54, no. 6 p.784-793dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053190008513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012700174300001100301520146800312592002801780650002501808650001201833650001401845650003501859650002501894650001201919650001501931650001001946650000901956650001401965650001401979650000901993650002202002651001502024700002002039700001802059700002102077700002402098773012602122856008102248852000902329655001202338IND60633787720221119002511.0190420e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-019-0932-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Mohammad Mosleh10aPotential of biological arsenite oxidation in sand filtration units at arsenic–iron removal plants (AIRPs) in Bangladesh  ap. 48.  aThis study is aimed to investigate biological oxidation of arsenic [As(III)] in sand component of arsenic–iron removal plant (AIRP). Water and sand samples were collected from the municipal and household AIRP units (MAIRP and HAIRPs) at Manikganj district, Bangladesh. These samples were analyzed using arsenic speciation cartridge with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for arsenic and iron detection and phylogenetic analysis based on aoxB gene sequencing. It was observed that arsenic concentration in the raw water, before and after sand filtration, ranged from 13.0–81.0 to 4.0–21.0 μg/L, respectively, which majorly contained reduced arsenic [As(III)] in the inlet and oxidized arsenic [As(V)] in the outlet. The results of our batch experiments showed that indeed sand unit of MAIRP oxidized As(III) with 36 g/h estimated biological oxidation potential which was considered enough to oxidize all the As(III) loading (6.3 g/h) in the influent. Additionally, bacterial arsenite oxidase gene (aoxB) was detected in the sand sample and has 80% sequence similarity with Polymorphum gilvum, an alphaproteobacteria on the phylogenetic tree. This study, therefore, revealed that AIRP sand units have enough potential of biological activity to ensure overall arsenic removal through As(III) oxidation. However, future research is necessary to unfold the basic mechanistic approach explored in this plant for further modification if need arises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioactive properties 3aenzymes 3afiltration 3agenes 3airon 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3asand 3asequence homology 3aBangladesh1 aKurisu, Futoshi1 aKasuga, Ikuro1 aFurumai, Hiroaki1 aIslam, S.

Despite the type of regionalization framework considered (e.g., region of influence or hierarchical clustering), selecting flood-related attributes to reflect flood generating mechanisms is required to discriminate flood regimes among catchments. To understand how different attributes perform across Canada for identifying homogeneous regions, this study examines five distinctive attributes (i.e., geographical proximity, flood seasonality, physiographic variables, monthly precipitation pattern, and monthly temperature pattern) for their ability to identify homogeneous regions at 186 gauging sites with their annual maximum flow data. We propose a novel region revision procedure to complement the well-known region of influence and L-Moments techniques that automates the identification of homogeneous regions across continental domains. Results are presented spatially for Canada to assess patterning of homogeneous regions. Memberships of two selected regions are investigated to provide insight into membership characteristics. Sites in eastern Canada are highly likely to identify homogeneous flood regions, while the western prairie and mountainous regions are not. Overall, it is revealed that the success of identifying homogeneous regions depends on local hydrological complexities, whether the considered attribute(s) reflect primary flooding mechanism(s), and on whether catchment sites are clustered in a small geographic region. Formation of effective pooling groups affords the extension of record lengths across the Canadian domain (where gauges typically have <50 years of record), facilitating more comprehensive analysis of higher return period flood needs for climate change assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3amountains 3atemperature 3awater 3awatersheds 3aCanada1 aStadnyk, Tricia  A.0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007300157300001800230520082700248592002801075650001601103650001301119650002101132650002001153650001601173650002301189650003501212650001101247650002001258700001901278700002201297700001701319773015001336856007401486852000901560655001201569IND60765509520221123003117.0220615e20090624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076550952DNAL7 a10.17221/956-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukurová, K.10aEffect of Inorganic Salts on Acrylamide Formation in Cereal Matrices  ap.

Calcium chloride was the most effective with near to 90% acrylamide elimination ability. Sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium as well as potassium dihydrogen phosphate were also very effective and brought about 75% acrylamide content decrease, followed by calcium lactate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride causing 40–45% of acrylamide elimination and finally sodium and potassium hydrogen carbonates that achieved 30% reduction of acrylamide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aammonium 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium lactate 3alactic acid 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3asodium 3asodium chloride1 aCiesarová, Z.1 aBednáriková, A.1 aMarkova, L.,0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 27, no.

The following eight traits were measured and evaluated: plant height (PH), leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW), leaf number per plant (LN), stem girth (SG), leaf area (LA), dry leaf yield (DLW), and fresh leaf yield (FLW). The genotype by trait biplot for tobacco dataset explained 73% of the total variation of the standardized data. The polygon view of genotype by trait presented for the eight different traits of tobacco genotypes showed six vertex cultivars (G4, G5, G11, G12, G18, and G21). Genotype G21 had the highest values for most of the measured traits. Based on a vector view biplot, strong positive associations among LL, DLW, FLW, and LA were detected while near zero correlations between LL and SG, as well as between LL and PH were observed. Generally, based on ideal genotype and ideal tester biplots, it was demonstrated that the selection for high leaf yield should be performed via leaf length, leaf width, and leaf area traits identified as effective selection criteria for high yielding cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adata collection 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aleaf area 3aleaf length 3aleaf width 3aleaves 3aplant height 3aselection criteria 3atobacco 0agenotype-by-trait interaction 0aprincipal components analysis 0atrait associations1 aSabaghnia, N.1 aRanjbar, R.1 aMaleki, H.H.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 50, no. 1 p.1-7dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2019-00013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245008700208300001600295500001900311520097300330592002801303650002101331650001801352650000901370650001201379650001901391650001201410650001301422651001101435653001201446653002401458653001701482653002101499653002001520700001801540700002001558700002001578700002401598700001801622700002001640700002201660700005901682773010401741856008101845852000901926655001201935IND60715746120221119162448.0201102e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574612DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053190009662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonterroso, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7911-365110aUpdated ranges of the Vulnerable cheetah and Endangered African wild dog in Angola  ap. 851-853.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe civil unrest that ravaged Angola for nearly 30 years took a heavy toll on the country's wildlife, and led to a lengthy absence of reliable information for many threatened species, including the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and African wild dog Lycaon pictus. Using camera trapping we assessed the status of these two species in two areas of southern Angola, and complemented our findings by reviewing recent survey reports and observations to provide an update on the species' status. We found unequivocal evidence that African wild dogs are resident and reproducing in Bicuar National Park, where cheetahs appear to be absent. Conversely, cheetahs may be resident in western Cuando Cubango province, where African wild dogs may only be transient. Based on these and other recent records in Angola, we recommend a revision of these species' distribution ranges and note the need for monitoring of these remnant populations and for appropriate attention to any threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinonyx jubatus 3aLycaon pictus 3aOryx 3acameras 3anational parks 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aAngola 0acheetah 0aconservation status 0adistribution 0aAfrican wild dog 0asouthern Africa1 aRocha, Filipe1 avan Wyk, Stefan1 aAntónio, Telmo1 aChicomo, Milcíades1 aKosmas, Selma1 aLages, Fernanda1 aFabiano, Ezequiel1 aGodinho, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4260-47990 tOryx.g2020 Nov., v. 54, no. 6 p.851-853dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053190009663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011200168300001800280520141900298592002801717596006001745650001901805650002001824650003101844650001001875650001001885650000901895650001601904650001901920650002001939650002001959650002101979650001902000650001602019650001602035650001302051650001402064650001102078650003202089700005402121700001502175700001702190700001402207700001502221773014502236856008202381852000902463655001202472IND60654673720221120212543.0190726e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-019-01713-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashamol, V.

The study was conducted in 12 (10 months to 1 year old) goats of Malabari breed for 45-day duration. The control (n = 6; C) group goats were kept under comfortable condition in the shaded pens while heat stress (n = 6; HS) group goats were kept out in the open hot environment during summer season for the study duration between 10.00 h to 16.00 h. The representative mesenteric lymph node (MLN) samples were collected from the slaughtered goats at the end of study for assessing the different cytokine gene expression and histopathological changes. Compared with C group, the expression patterns of interleukin 18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-β (IFN-β), and IFN-γ downregulated (P < 0.05) in the HS group. The histopathological changes of MLNs showed paucity of lymphocyte distribution in follicular areas as wells as decreased density of lymphocytes in the germinal centers of the HS group (P < 0.05). The findings from this study reflected the compromised immune functions during heat stress in Malabari goats. Further, the study established that IL-18, TNF-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ genes could serve as reliable immunological markers for quantifying heat stress–mediated immune response alterations in Malabari goats.  aPublisher supplied data  aNot apllicablecIndian Council of Agricultural Research 3abioclimatology 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agoats 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-18 3alymph nodes 3alymphocytes 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3asummer 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aSejian, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8224-45211 aBagath, M.1 aKrishnan, G.1 aBeena, V.1 aBhatta, R.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2019 Aug., v. 63, no. 8 p.1005-1013dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-019-01713-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245007500213300001800288506007600306520120000382592002801582506003701610650002501647650001001672650001601682650001801698650001501716650001501731650002101746650002101767650002201788650002301810650002301833650002701856700002401883700002201907700002101929700002501950700002001975700001901995773017302014856007902187852000902266655001202275IND60173623820221207125456.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12187321102doi7 aPMC36253502pmcid7 a235302322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChazal, Pierre-Etienne10aEJC core component MLN51 interacts with eIF3 and activates translation  ap. 5903-5908.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC), deposited by the splicing machinery, is an important constituent of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles because it participates to numerous steps of the mRNA lifecycle from splicing to surveillance via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. By an unknown mechanism, the EJC also stimulates translation efficiency of newly synthesized mRNAs. Here, we show that among the four EJC core components, the RNA-binding protein metastatic lymph node 51 (MLN51) is a translation enhancer. Overexpression of MLN51 preferentially increased the translation of intron-containing reporters via the EJC, whereas silencing MLN51 decreased translation. In addition, modulation of the MLN51 level in cell-free translational extracts confirmed its direct role in protein synthesis. Immunoprecipitations indicated that MLN51 associates with translation-initiating factors and ribosomal subunits, and in vitro binding assays revealed that MLN51, alone or as part of the EJC, interacts directly with the pivotal eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3. Taken together, our data define MLN51 as a translation activator linking the EJC and the translation machinery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aexons 3alymph nodes 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amonitoring 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein subunits 3aprotein synthesis 3aribonucleoproteins 3aribosomal proteins 3atranslation (genetics)1 aDaguenet, Elisabeth1 aWendling, Corinne1 aUlryck, Nathalie1 aTomasetto, Catherine1 aSargueil, Bruno1 aLe Hir, Hervé0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.5903-5908dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12187321103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018900158300001800347520144700365592002801812650001501840650002301855650001501878650001301893650002101906650002801927650001301955650001901968650001501987650001402002650001502016650001102031650001302042650001402055650002002069700001902089700002102108773012902129856007402258852000902332655001202341IND60617354520221122221808.0181025e20180614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735452DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00528a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaffash, Amir10aHighly sensitive biosensing of phenol based on the adsorption of the phenol enzymatic oxidation product on the surface of an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide-modified electrode  ap. 2731-2739.  aPhenol determination is an important step of its monitoring to prevent water contamination. Herein, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is modified with electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme (HRP/ERGO/GCE). Then, the modified electrode (HRP/ERGO/GCE) has been used for the biosensing of phenol. Using HRP, phenol is oxidized into electroactive o-quinone, which can be electrochemically reduced to catechol. The electrochemical responses obtained in the reduction of o-quinone to catechol are directly related to the phenol concentration. Also, the selectivity of phenol enzymatic oxidation is significantly increased when HRP is used to fabricate the biosensor. In order to enhance the electrochemical responses, ERGO is employed to fabricate the biosensor. The results indicate that the o-quinone/catechol redox couple is adsorbed on the HRP/ERGO/GCE surface and leads to the enhancement of the responses and the sensitivity of the biosensor to determine the phenol concentration. The voltammetric responses of the biosensor, during preparation under specified conditions, are also examined. Using differential pulse voltammetry, a wide linear range of 3.0–100.0 μM and a low detection limit of 2.19 μM are obtained for phenol determination at the HRP/ERGO/GCE surface. Finally, the proposed biosensor has been satisfactorily used to determine the phenol concentration in a tap water sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanalytical methods 3abiosensors 3acatechol 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3aquinones 3atap water 3awater pollution1 aZare, Hamid R.1 aRostami, Khosrow0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 June 14, v. 10, no. 23 p.2731-2739dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00528a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245008900207300001800296506007600314520121100390592002801601506003701629650002201666650002001688650001101708650001901719650001801738650000801756650001301764650001501777650001501792653002001807653003301827653002101860653001301881653001601894653002901910700002101939700001901960773017301979856007902152852000902231655001202240IND60173623920221207125425.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12187721102doi7 aPMC36253242pmcid7 a234796312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosinski, Michal10aPrivate traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior  ap. 5802-5805.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe show that easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3adata collection 3agender 3ahuman behavior 3alinear models 3amen 3apolitics 3aprediction 3avolunteers 0asocial networks 0acomputational social science 0amachine learning 0abig data 0adata mining 0apsychological assessment1 aStillwell, David1 aGraepel, Thore0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.5802-5805dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12187721103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245012200206300001800328506007600346520179600422592002802218506003702246650002702283650003002310650001602340650002902356650001602385650001402401650002902415650001302444650001102457650001802468650002802486650001602514650004102530650001202571650001702583650001202600650001302612650001302625650001602638650003002654700001902684700003002703700002202733700001602755773017302771856007902944852000903023655001203032IND60173624020221207125500.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362402DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12187781102doi7 aPMC36252622pmcid7 a235301892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRauthan, Manish14aThe mitochondrial unfolded protein response activator ATFS-1 protects cells from inhibition of the mevalonate pathway  ap. 5981-5986.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStatins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. This pathway also produces coenzyme Q (a component of the respiratory chain), dolichols (important for protein glycosylation), and isoprenoids (lipid moieties responsible for the membrane association of small GTPases). We previously showed that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is useful to study the noncholesterol effects of statins because its mevalonate pathway lacks the sterol synthesis branch but retains all other branches. Here, from a screen of 150,000 mutagenized genomes, we isolated four C. elegans mutants resistant to statins by virtue of gain-of-function mutations within the first six amino acids of the protein ATFS-1, the key regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response that includes activation of the chaperones HSP-6 and HSP-60. The atfs-1 gain-of-function mutants are also resistant to ibandronate, an inhibitor of an enzyme downstream of HMG-CoA reductase, and to gliotoxin, an inhibitor acting on a subbranch of the pathway important for protein prenylation, and showed improved mitochondrial function and protein prenylation in the presence of statins. Additionally, preinduction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in wild-type worms using ethidium bromide or paraquat triggered statin resistance, and similar observations were made in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in a mammalian cell line. We conclude that statin resistance through maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is conserved across species, and that the cell-lethal effects of statins are caused primarily through impaired protein prenylation that results in mitochondria dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aamino acids 3aanticholesteremic agents 3acholesterol 3adolichols 3aelectron transport chain 3aethidium 3agenome 3aglycosylation 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3amammals 3amitochondria 3amutants 3amutation 3aparaquat 3aubiquinones 3aunfolded protein response1 aRanji, Parmida1 aAguilera Pradenas, Nataly1 aPitot, Christophe1 aPilon, Marc0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.5981-5986dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12187781103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245016800166500001900334520189500353592002802248650002102276650001302297650002102310650001702331650001302348650002902361650002702390650001902417650002002436650001402456650001602470650001402486650001802500651001402518700002102532700002102553700002202574773012002596856007302716852000902789655001202798IND60711910420221116142336.0200928e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191042DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderzalm, Joanne  L.10aEvaluating Treatment Requirements for Recycled Water to Manage Well Clogging during Aquifer Storage and Recovery: A Case Study in the Werribee Formation, Australia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aManaged aquifer recharge (MAR) is the intentional recharge of water to suitable aquifers for subsequent beneficial use or to achieve environmental benefits. Well injection techniques for MAR, such as Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR), rely on implementing appropriate design and defining the operational parameters to minimise well clogging and maintain sustainable rates of recharge over the long term. The purpose of this study was to develop water quality targets and pre-treatment requirements for recycled water to allow sustained recharge and recovery in a medium-coarse siliceous aquifer. The recharge water is a blend of 40% Class A recycled water and 60% reverse osmosis (RO)-treated Class A recycled water. Four source waters for MAR were evaluated: (1) this blend with no further treatment, and this blend with additional treatment using: (2) a 20 µm sediment cartridge filter, (3) a 5 µm sediment cartridge filter, or (4) a 5 µm granular activated carbon (GAC) cartridge filter. All four treatment options were also further disinfected with chlorine. The four blended and treated recycled waters were used in laboratory columns packed with aquifer material under saturated conditions at constant temperature (20.7 °C) with light excluded for up to 42 days. Substantial differences in the changes in hydraulic conductivity of the columns were observed for the different treatments within 14 days of the experiment, despite low turbidity (<2 NTU) of the blend waters. After 14 days, the GAC-treated water had a 7% decline in hydraulic conductivity, which was very different from the other three blend waters, which had declines of 39–52%. Based on these results and consistent with previous studies, a target biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) level of <0.2 mg/L was recommended to ensure a biologically stable source of water to reduce clogging during recharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaquifers 3abiodegradability 3acase studies 3achlorine 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahydraulic conductivity 3arecycled water 3areverse osmosis 3asediments 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3aAustralia1 aPage, Declan  W.1 aBarry, Karen  E.1 aGonzalez, Dennis 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007300170300001500243520155100258592002801809650002301837650002701860650000901887650001901896650002701915650001001942650001801952653000801970653002401978653002302002653001802025653002302043653001302066700002602079700002502105773010302130856008702233852000902320655001202329IND60552603820221120132459.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraz, Andre,10aRaman imaging for determining the sequence of blue pen ink crossings  ap. 92-100.  aThis manuscript presents a preliminary investigation on the applicability of Raman imaging for non-destructive and rapid analysis of blue crossing ink lines. The MCR method was used to facilitate visualization of the distribution of inks of the same colour and the most predominant Raman signature at the crossing was used to interpret the order of application of inks. Different pen ink types, different times separating the application of the two ink lines and different paper substrates were used. From the 90 Raman images examined, the correct order of application was determined in more than 60% by direct observation. The remainder cases were not as clear due to the uneven distribution of inks and the empty spaces similar to a net-like pattern observed at the crossing. This pattern was possibly caused by physical impediments (the first ink applied acting as a physical barrier) or chemical impediments (the two inks did not stick). Such impediments were more strongly observed in the crossings involving the U. Eye pen ink, causing the complete skipping of this ink line. Moreover, most crossings showed some mixing between the two inks and it was more accentuated when the times separating the application of the inks were shorter, since the ink was fresher. The use of white or certificate papers did not seem to influence in the inks distribution nor determining the order of the inks. Although this study provided useful insights regarding crossing ink lines, future statistic studies may be helpful for more objective examinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical specificity 3adyes 3aimage analysis 3anondestructive methods 3apaper 3arapid methods 0aInk 0aQuestioned document 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aRaman imaging 0aIntersecting lines 0aCrossing1 aLópez-López, María1 aGarcía-Ruiz, Carmen0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.92-100dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007200170300001600242520148600258592002801744650001101772650001301783650001101796650001201807650001201819650002201831650001101853650001201864650001001876653003301886653001501919653001001934653001901944653002901963700005401992700001702046700002002063773010402083856008702187852000902274655001202283IND60552603920221120132511.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowper, E.J.14aThe effect of fabric and stabbing variables on severance appearance  ap. 214-224.  aDuring a stabbing, apparel fabrics are usually damaged and may be penetrated. Despite numerous studies considering forces required to penetrate skin and human stabbing performance, none have systematically evaluated which variables affect severance appearance from a textile science perspective using a human stabbing participant assessment. Although the human performance aspects of stabbing attacks have been previously studied, there has been a bias towards male assailants. The effects of fabric elasticity and tension applied have been identified as major factors influencing the severance profile in the fabric resulting from a stab attack. However, previous studies have considered limited fabric types with little emphasis on the physical and mechanical textile properties. The purpose of the current research was to use a human participant study (male n=5; female n=5) to determine the effect of fabric extension (0%, 10%) on the severance profile. Fabric type (single jersey; 100% cotton; 93% cotton/7% elastane), age (not laundered; laundered 60 times) and knife type (carving, bread) were also considered. Severance length was affected by participant sex, fabric type, laundering and knife type. The severances formed in this study were not significantly affected by the amount a fabric was extended when stabbed. Variability was observed in the severance appearance among participants where prior training influenced the angle of impact and knife withdrawal technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3aclothing 3acotton 3afabrics 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3alaundry 3amales 0aMale and female participants 0aMorphology 0aKnife 0aKnitted fabric 0aExtension and elasticity1 aCarr, D.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9476-21661 aHorsfall, I.1 aFergusson, S.M.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.214-224dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245020100205300001200406520206600418592002802484650002002512650001002532650000902542650001102551650001902562650000902581650002002590650001502610650001502625650001402640650001402654650002002668650001702688650002602705650004402731650002402775650001102799700001802810700002002828700001602848700002102864700002002885700001902905773011702924856008303041852000903124655001203133IND60715746520221119162841.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574652DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02614-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebreuque, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3708-676010aDefinitive-intent uniform megavoltage fractioned radiotherapy protocol for presumed canine intracranial gliomas: retrospective analysis of survival and prognostic factors in 38 cases (2013–2019)  ap. 412.  aBACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) is currently considered the treatment of choice for presumed canine intracranial gliomas. However, variable therapeutic responses are described, due to heterogeneous populations and different radiation methods or protocols. Only one study dedicated to intracranial suspected glioma highlighted prognostic criteria. Determination or confirmation of specific clinical and imaging prognostic factors may guide the therapeutic management of these tumours. The objectives were to provide data on long-term clinical outcome (including quality of life, QoL) and to determine specific prognostic factors associated with survival time. We report a single-institution retrospective study, including all dogs with suspected symptomatic primary solitary intracranial glioma, treated with a complete uniform fractionated megavoltage radiation protocol of 15x3Gy over 5 weeks, between January 2013 and February 2019. Thirty-eight client-owned dogs were included. Medical records were retrospectively evaluated for median overall survival time (MST), clinical and imaging responses. Prognostic factors on survival were researched in terms of signalment, clinical presentation, tumour imaging characteristics and response following RT. Finally, the RT’s impact on the dogs’ clinical signs and Qol were evaluated by the owners. RESULTS: The disease-specific MST was 698 days (95% CI: 598–1135). Survival at 1 and 2 years were respectively 74.2 ± 7.4% and 49.0 ± 9.8%. Initial clinical signs were related to survival, as well as tumour characteristics such as cystic-pattern, mass effect and Tumour/Brain volume ratio. No significant adverse effect or radiotoxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: RT appears as a safe and effective treatment for canine intracranial gliomas, allowing long-term tumour control, improvement of life’s quality and management of associated clinical signs. The initial clinical signs and MRI characteristics (Tumour/Brain volume ratio, cyst-like lesion and mass effect) may help predict the prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abrain 3adogs 3aglioma 3aimage analysis 3amass 3amedical records 3aobjectives 3apopulation 3aprognosis 3aprotocols 3aquality of life 3aradiotherapy 3aretrospective studies 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aveterinary medicine 3avolume1 aDe Fornel, P.1 aDavid, Ignacio,1 aDelisle, F.1 aDucerveau, M.

No clinical breakpoint (CBP) currently exists to interpret the results of such tests in horses. OBJECTIVES: To compute PK/PD cut‐offs (PK/PDCO) that is one of the three minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) considered establishing a CBP for antimicrobial susceptibility test interpretation. STUDY DESIGN: A meta‐analysis conducted by combining five sets of previously published pharmacokinetic data, obtained in clinical and nonclinical settings. METHODS: Horses (n = 131) received MBX intravenously at doses of either 2 or 10 mg/kg BW. They were richly sampled (five or six samples per horse). A population model was built to generate a virtual population of 5000 MBX disposition curves by Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) over 24 hours. The selected PK/PD index was the ratio of Area Under the free plasma concentration‐time Curve divided by the MIC (fAUC/MIC). The PK/PDCO, which is the highest MIC for which 90% of horses can achieve an a priori selected critical value for the numerical value of the PK/PD index, was established for Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria for a dose of 2 mg/kg. RESULTS: The PK/PDCO of MBX in horses was 0.125 mg/L for Gram‐positive pathogens and 0.0625 mg/L for Gram‐negative pathogens. MBX MICs determined by broth microdilution for 54 Escherichia coli and 189 Streptococcus equi isolates are reported. MAIN LIMITATION: No clinical data are taken into account in the determination of a PK/PDcₒ. CONCLUSION: The computed PK/PDcₒ predicts that MBX may be efficacious in horses to treat infections associated with Enterobacteriaceae but unlikely to those involving Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus equi.  aPublisher supplied data  cVetoquinol 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus equi 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3amarbofloxacin 3ameta-analysis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics1 aSchneider, Marc1 aEl Garch, Farid1 aBroussou, Diane C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0016-58201 aFerran, Aude A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6629-10881 aLallemand, Elodie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5910-46111 aTriboulloy, Cyrielle1 aDamborg, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9932-59961 aToutain, Pierre‐Louis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8846-88920 tEquine veterinary journal.g2021 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.1047-1055dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1170x0425-16447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.133853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01709naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003000148245009500178300001400273520066300287592002800950650002500978650001101003650001301014650002201027650001501049650001001064650001501074650001201089650001101101651001101112651001401123700002601137773009101163856008401254852000901338655001201347IND4487789920221118085047.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448778992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2012.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmajgl, Alexander,d1971-10aWhen households stop logging â Evidence for household adaptation from East Kalimantan  ap. 58-65.  aRising fuel prices are thought to drive households in developing countries to increase pressure on natural resources, primarily through firewood collection and logging.

Survey data suggests that household logging, rattan harvest and fishing are likely to decrease in response to increasing fuel prices. These empirical findings stand in contrast to other studies. Our findings show that if households perceive a specific livelihood to become unviable, the complete set of livelihoods is likely to be replaced by wage labour.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3afuelwood 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3alabor 3alivelihood 3alogging 3aprices 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia1 aBohensky, E.q(Erin),0 tForest policy and economics.g2012 July, v. 20 p.58-65dElsevier B.V.x1389-93417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245004900157500001900206520217700225592002802402650001202430650001902442650003402461650001602495650002302511650001502534650001602549650001302565650001002578700002102588700001802609700002602627773012002653856007302773852000902846655001202855IND60711910720221116142245.0200928e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191072DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirsák, Jan 12aA Molecular-Level Picture of Electrospinning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrospinning is a modern and versatile method of producing nanofibers from polymer solutions or melts by the action of strong electric fields. The complex, multiscale nature of the process hinders its theoretical understanding, especially at the molecular level. The present article aims to contribute to the fundamental picture of the process by the molecular modeling of its nanoscale analogue and complements the picture by laboratory experiments at macroscale. Special attention is given to how the process is influenced by ions. Molecular dynamics (MD) is employed to model the time evolution of a nanodroplet of aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solution on a solid surface in a strong electric field. Two molecular weights of PEG are used, each in 12 aqueous solutions differing by the weight fraction of the polymer and the concentration of added NaCl. Various structural and dynamic quantities are monitored in production trajectories to characterize important features of the process and the effect of ions on it. Complementary experiments are carried out with macroscopic droplets of compositions similar to those used in MD. The behavior of droplets in a strong electric field is monitored using an oscilloscopic method and high-speed camera recording. Oscilloscopic records of voltage and current are used to determine the characteristic onset times of the instability of the meniscus as the times of the first discharge. The results of simulations indicate that, at the molecular level, the process is primarily driven by polarization forces and the role of ionic charge is only minor. Ions enhance the evaporation of solvent and the transport of polymer into the jet. Experimentally measured instability onset times weakly decrease with increasing ionic concentration in solutions with low polymer content. High-speed photography coupled with oscilloscopic measurement shows that the measured instability onset corresponds to the formation of a sharp tip of the Taylor cone. Molecular-scale and macroscopic views of the process are confronted, and challenges for their reconciliation are presented as a route to a true understanding of electrospinning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aevaporation 3amolecular dynamics 3ananofibers 3aphotography 3asolvents 3awater1 aPokorný, Pavel,1 aHolec, Pavel 1 aDědičová, Šárka 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245006400176300001800240500001500258520075700273592002801030650003101058650001501089650001101104650002101115650002301136650001401159653001801173773011901191856005501310852000901365655001201374IND4510055320221118085006.0150730e20010515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451005532DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02226.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossman, Steven R.10ap300/CBP/p53 interaction and regulation of the p53 response  ap. 2773-2778.  a2019-12-04  aSubstantial evidence points to a critical role for the p300/CREB binding protein (CBP) coactivators in p53 responses to DNA damage. p300/CBP and the associated protein P/CAF bind to and acetylate p53 during the DNA damage response, and are needed for full p53 transactivation as wellÂ as downstream p53 effects of growth arrest and/or apoptosis. Beyond this simplistic model, p300/CBP appear to be complex integrators of signals that regulate p53, and biochemically, the multipartite p53/p300/CBP interaction is equally complex. Through physical interaction with p53, p300/CBP can both positively and negatively regulate p53 transactivation, as well as p53 protein turnover depending on cellular context and environmental stimuli, such as DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscriptional activation 3aDNA damage 3amodels 3abinding proteins 3aprotein metabolism 3aapoptosis 0agrowth arrest0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 May 15, v. 268, no. 10 p.2773-2778dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02226.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161500001900280520146600299592002801765650003001793650001701823650002101840650001501861650002301876650001901899650000701918650001501925650001101940650001601951650002101967650002501988650001002013650001502023700002402038700002502062773012002087856007302207852000902280655001202289IND60711910820221116142305.0200928e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191082DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedupin, Cecilia 10aExploring the Interactions of Physical, Chemical and Biological Variables of an Urban River Using Network Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNetwork analysis was used as a method to investigate the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrates in an urban river watershed and physicochemical variables. The measured physicochemical variables were the dissolved oxygen, temperature, nutrients, conductivity, pH, total organic matter, biochemical oxygen demand and river discharge. The metrics applied in the study were the degree of connections between nodes, the number of edges identified for each study location and the functional feeding groups. The river sampling took place over 14 months and sampling took place at five sites, two of which were upstream of a major wastewater treatment works and three sites were downstream of the works. A biological and environmental (BIOENV) analysis was included as part of the overall analysis to compare the variables that influenced the river ecosystem. This study shows that the relationships between benthic macroinvertebrates were stronger at the upstream locations of the watershed, while the downstream locations were controlled by the physicochemical relationships. From this analysis, the river quality and biodiversity were mainly controlled by the discharge, conductivity and availability of relevant organic matter suitable for organisms. Through the network, the degree of connections between the variables revealed the status of the urban river and provided insight into the possible management of vegetation cover across the urban watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodiversity 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3amacroinvertebrates 3aorganic matter 3apH 3ariver flow 3arivers 3atemperature 3avegetation cover 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awatersheds1 aBannister, Charles 1 aSchwartz, Jean-Marc 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245009700212506007600309520111100385592002801496506003701524650001601561650002101577650001501598650002401613650001501637650001401652650001801666650002701684650002401711653001601735653002001751653002401771653001401795653001401809653001001823653000901833653001601842700001801858700001901876700001701895773012001912856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60690191220221207102633.0200426e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069019122DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2016.11439992doi7 aPMC48905502pmcid7 a268291652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Hanako10aImportance of epidermal clocks for regulation of hypocotyl elongation through PIF4 and IAA29  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCircadian clocks adjust an organism's environmentally relevant physiological responses.. In plants, a decentralized circadian clock system has recently been proposed. Epidermal clock function is crucial for cell elongation; thus, epidermis-specific overexpression of CCA1 caused smaller cotyledons and longer hypocotyls under 27°C, concomitant with elevated night time levels of PIF4 mRNA. However, which tissue's clock regulates PIF4 expression is still an open question. Here we tested spatial expression patterns of PIF4 and its downstream target IAA29 with or without epidermal clock perturbation. Using an epidermal-specific expression system, we revealed that epidermal clock perturbation increases PIF4 expression in both epidermis and mesophyll. However, IAA29 expression is mainly regulated in the epidermis, implying the potential importance of epidermis for regulation of cell elongation through PIF4 and IAA29. We conclude that the circadian clock in epidermis regulates cell elongation mainly in epidermis, and there is also another inter-tissue signaling pathway from epidermis to mesophyll.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell growth 3acircadian clocks 3acotyledons 3agene overexpression 3ahypocotyls 3amesophyll 3amessenger RNA 3aphysiological response 3asignal transduction 0aArabidopsis 0acircadian clock 0adecentralized clock 0aepidermis 0ahypocotyl 0aIAA29 0aPIF4 0atemperature1 aTorii, Kotaro1 aAraki, Takashi1 aEndo, Motomu0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.e1143999-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2016.11439993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245015600203300001600359520158000375592002801955596005601983596005502039596004702094650002902141650001202170650002702182650001202209650001202221650002302233650000902256650001502265650000902280650001402289650001502303650001402318650001802332650001802350650001102368650001602379651001802395651001202413700002102425700002102446700002302467700002502490700002402515700002402539773014102563856008202704852000902786655001202795IND60637006320221118055850.0190413e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-019-00607-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiaowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-752010aInfluence of Anthropogenic Activities on Metals in Arctic Permafrost: A Characterization of Benchmark Soils on the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas in Russia  ap. 540-553.  aPermafrost-affected region in Russian Arctic is an important study area for investigating fate of trace metals in soils by geological processes and human-induced trace metals through atmospheric deposition. Two plots of soils in Yamal region were selected: Northern Trans-Urals area (PU1, PU2, PU3) adjacent to urban areas and Gydan Peninsula representing reference groups as natural landscapes (Yavai, Gyda, Enysei). The levels of most metals in Urals area were more than those in Gydan Peninsula. In soil profile, Histic horizon revealed the accumulation of most metals. Cd and Pb were classified as metals, which were transported by atmosphere from urban areas and accumulated in surficial organic layers. Gleying processes and cryogenic mass exchanges transported metals from bottom to top layers in mineral horizons. Moreover, gleying horizon functioned as a geochemical barrier for metal transporting below permafrost table. The levels of As, Mn, and Fe were obliviously higher than threshold limit values of Russian Siberia. However, these values cannot represent the natural hydromorphic soils in Arctic tundra. The Geoaccumulation Index (Igₑₒ) were determined for assessing surface soil samples regarding to metals’ pollution. The results suggested local geology pollution for Gydan Peninsula and atmospheric transport pollution for Urals area. More investigations with respect to trace metals behavior in permafrost-affected soil profile needed to be studied for understanding levels of trace metals with changes of active layer depth due to climate changing.  aPublisher supplied data  a18-44-890003cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  a16-34-60010cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  aEXC177cthe Cluster of Excellence 'CliSAP' 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3ageology 3ahydromorphic soils 3airon 3alandscapes 3alead 3amanganese 3apermafrost 3apollution 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3atundra 3aurban areas 3aArctic region 3aSiberia1 aAbakumov, Evgeny1 aAntcibor, Iuliia1 aTomashunas, Vitaly1 aKnoblauch, Christian1 aZubzycki, Sebastian1 aPfeiffer, Eva-Maria0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 May, v. 76, no. 4 p.540-553dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3984x0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-019-00607-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012100158500001900279520149800298592002801796650001101824650000901835650001301844650001501857650002501872650000901897650001901906650001101925650001301936650002101949650001101970650002701981650001002008650001502018700001802033700002402051700001902075700002602094700001902120773012002139856007302259852000902332655001202341IND60711910920221116142310.0200928e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191092DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashiro, Yuto 10aSeasonal Variations of Dissolved Iron Concentration in Active Layer and Rivers in Permafrost Areas, Russian Far East  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDissolved iron (dFe) in boreal rivers may play an important role in primary production in high-latitude oceans. However, iron behavior in soils and dFe discharge mechanism from soil to the rivers are poorly understood. To better understand iron dynamics on the watershed scale, we observed the seasonal changes in dFe and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) concentrations in the river as well as dFe concentration in soil pore waters in permafrost watershed from May to October. During snowmelt season, high dFe production (1.38–4.70 mg L-1) was observed in surface soil pore waters. Correspondingly, riverine dFe and DOC concentrations increased to 1.10 mg L-1 and 32.3 mg L-1, and both were the highest in the year. After spring floods, riverine dFe and DOC concentrations decreased to 0.15 mg L-1 and 7.62 mg L-1, and dFe concentration in surface soil pore waters also decreased to 0.20–1.28 mg L-1. In late July, riverine dFe and DOC concentrations increased to 0.33 mg L-1 and 23.6 mg L-1 in response to heavy rainfall. In August and September, considerable increases in dFe concentrations (2.00–6.90 mg L-1) were observed in subsurface soil pore waters, probably because infiltrated rainwater developed reducing conditions. This dFe production was confirmed widely in permafrost wetlands in valley areas. Overall, permafrost wetlands in valley areas are hotspots of dFe production and greatly contribute to dFe and DOC discharge to rivers, especially during snowmelt and rainy seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3airon 3alatitude 3apermafrost 3aprimary productivity 3arain 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asnowmelt 3asoil pore system 3aspring 3asubsurface soil layers 3awater 3awatersheds1 aYoh, Muneoki 1 aShiraiwa, Takayuki 1 aOnishi, Takeo 1 aShesterkin, Vladimir 1 aKim, Vladimir 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010000165300001600265520106700281592002801348650002101376650001201397650001801409650001801427650001001445650001901455650002801474650001401502650001301516650002001529700002001549700002001569700001801589773013401607856007801741852000901819655001201828IND60765510320221120225123.0220714e20110810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076551032DNAL7 a10.17221/96/2011-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedláčková, P.10aCell surface characteristic of Asaia bogorensis &ndash; spoilage microorganism of bottled water  ap. 457-461.  aThe ability of bacteria to attach to a surface and develop a biofilm has been of considerable interest for many groups in the food industry. Biofilms may serve as a chronic source of microbial contamination and the research into biofilms and cells interactions might help to improve general understanding of the biofilm resistance mechanisms. Multitude of factors, including surface conditioning, surface charge and roughness and hydrophobicity, are thought to be involved in the initial attachment. Hydrophobic interactions have been widely suggested as responsible for much of the adherence of cells to surfaces. Cell-surface hydrophobicity is an important factor in the adherence and subsequent proliferation of microorganisms on solid surfaces and at interfaces. In the present study, we have estimated the cell-surface characteristics of Asaia bogorensis &ndash; isolated contamination of flavoured bottled water and compared its ability to colonise surfaces which are typical in the beverage production &ndash; stainless steel, glass and plastic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsaia bogorensis 3abiofilm 3abottled water 3afood industry 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobial contamination 3aroughness 3aspoilage 3astainless steel1 aČeřovský, M.1 aHorsáková, I.1 aVoldřich, M.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.457-461dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/96/2011-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010400170300001600274520124200290592002801532650001401560650001201574650002201586650002301608650001401631650001001645650001101655653002301666653002001689653001701709653002601726700002001752773010401772856008701876852000901963655001201972IND60552604420221120224422.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmino, Kanae10aCross-language differences of articulation rate and its transfer into Japanese as a second language  ap. 116-122.  aRecently, the articulation rate has been attracting attention in forensic speech investigation as an acoustic feature that varies across speakers, dialects, and languages. The present study investigates how cross-language differences in the articulation rate are transferred into Japanese as a second language. Participants were speakers of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. They were recorded while they read a passage in their native language and in Japanese. Local and global articulation rates were calculated based on the number of syllables as well as the number of morae for Japanese speech. When we compared the articulation rate of the native languages, Japanese was the fastest, then Korean, Chinese, and Thai in that order. Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between the articulation rate of the native language and that of the second language. A gender difference was found in the articulation rate of some languages, with males speaking faster than females. The effect of age was limited to Thai speakers only. Accent discrimination and identification experiments were conducted and the results revealed that native and non-native accents could be correctly discriminated just by the articulation rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3agender differences 3alanguages 3amales 3aspeech 0aForensic phonetics 0aForeign accents 0aSpeech tempo 0aAccent identification1 aOsanai, Takashi0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.116-122dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009800164300001400262506002800276520111100304592002801415506003701443650001201480650001601492650003001508650001701538650002301555651001301578653002201591653001701613653002001630700001701650700001901667700002401686700001701710700001601727700001801743773011701761856008301878852000901961655001201970IND60784751320221207095725.0190418e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078475132DNAL7 a10.26480/esp.02.2018.22.242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArslan, Ch.10aStudy of spatial and temporal variability of arsenic in groundwater due to drain by using gis  ap. 22-24.  aResource is Open Access  aIndustrial activity is one of the major reason of groundwater contamination. Arsenic is one, which is responsible for the contamination of the groundwater. Its testing in groundwater is considered as an important activity due to its serious effects on human health. Arsenic problem in Pakistan has been identified recently as a result of field testing. In Faisalabad, arsenic has been found in groundwater within permissible limit. But due to increasing industrial activities the concentration of arsenic is increasing day by day. Drain passing through the city is one of the sources of arsenic in groundwater. The research work was conducted at Syedabbad, Faisalabad. Samples were taken from the selected drain portion and from the groundwater by the help of water pumps. The sampling points were drawn on GIS map by the help of GPS receiver to study the spatial variability of arsenic contamination The results shows that there 10109.9 mg per second intake of arsenic due to drain. Results show that there is no temporal variability of arsenic within the research period but they have spatial variability  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarsenic 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahuman health 3atemporal variation 3aPakistan 0apermissible limit 0aGPS receiver 0asampling points1 aSattar, Asma1 aCuong, Do Minh1 aKhan, Faizan ul Haq1 aNasir, Abdul1 aBakhat, Zia1 aIlyas, Fariha0 tEarth sciences Pakistan.g2018 Aug., v. 2, no. 2 p.22-24dZibeline InternationalwJournal:27885x2521-29077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.26480/esp.02.2018.22.243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010800201300001600309500002000325520196200345592002802307596002802335596002502363650002502388650002802413650001702441650001202458650001202470650001102482650001102493650001202504650001402516650002302530650001202553650001302565650001902578650001902597650001102616651001202627700006202639700006502701773012502766856007302891852000902964655001202973IND60746929520221120205334.0210807e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074692952DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.133782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarslake, Harry B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1288-176810aEquine metabolic syndrome in UK native ponies and cobs is highly prevalent with modifiable risk factors  ap. 923-934.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The epidemiology of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is poorly described. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of EMS in native UK ponies and cobs in England and Wales and identify associated risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: Breeders registered with UK native pony breed societies and registered riding schools and livery yards within a set radius were invited to participate. All native UK ponies and cobs aged 3‐14 years and not diagnosed or being treated for conditions likely to affect insulin regulation at participating premises were eligible. Animals underwent a clinical examination and an oral glucose test while their owner or keeper completed a questionnaire by face‐to‐face interview. Data were analysed by multilevel uni‐ and multivariable modelling using insulin concentration and EMS diagnosis as outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 354 animals were examined at 64 properties (19 studs, 19 livery yards, 26 riding schools). The overall prevalence of EMS adjusted for clustering within yard was 23.3% (95%CI 17.9%–29.8%). Risk factors associated with a diagnosis of EMS included age, being female, more sedentary main activity, obesity, and shorter periods on pasture during the summer. Compared to the Welsh section A, the other Welsh, Connemara and cob breeds all had decreased odds of EMS. Clinical manifestations of hoof growth ring and supraorbital fat scores of 3/3 were more frequent in EMS ponies and animals with a history of laminitis within the last 5 years (9.7%) were 14.4 (95% CI 5.9–35.3) times more likely to be positive for EMS than those without. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Results may not be transferable to other breeds or age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Equine metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in UK native ponies and cobs with modifiable risk factors including obesity and sedentary activities. Modifying risk factors could help reduce the risk of laminitis in susceptible animals.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Liverpool  cBoehringer Ingelheim 3aclinical examination 3across-sectional studies 3aepidemiology 3afemales 3aglucose 3ahooves 3ahorses 3ainsulin 3alaminitis 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3apastures 3aquestionnaires 3arisk reduction 3asummer 3aEngland1 aPinchbeck, Gina L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5671-86231 aMcGowan, Catherine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-95840 tEquine veterinary journal.g2021 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.923-934dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1170x0425-16447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.133783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010500208300001200313500001900325520094300344592002801287596004501315650001401360650001701374650002201391650002301413650002001436650002101456650001801477650001401495650001601509650001301525650001501538650001301553651001401566700002301580700001701603773011001620856008301730852000901813655001201822IND60715746920221119160801.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071574692DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-01442-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlagoke, Olusola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4093-208610aKoalas vaccinated against Koala retrovirus respond by producing increased levels of interferon-gamma  ap. 168.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKoala retrovirus (KoRV) is believed to be in an active state of endogenization into the koala genome. KoRV is present as both an endogenous and exogenous infection in all koalas in northern Australia. KoRV has been linked to koala pathologies including neoplasia and increased susceptibility to Chlamydia. A KoRV vaccine recently trialled in 10 northern koalas improved antibody response and reduced viral load. This communication reports the expression of key immune genes underlining the innate and adaptive immune response to vaccination in these northern koalas. The results showed that prior to vaccination, IL-8 was expressed at the highest levels, with at least 200-fold greater expression compared to other cytokines, while CD8 mRNA expression was significantly higher than CD4 mRNA expression level. Interferon-γ was up-regulated at both 4- and 8-weeks post-vaccination while IL-8 was down-regulated at 8-weeks post-vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data  aLP150100046cAustralian Research Council 3aChlamydia 3aRetroviridae 3aadaptive immunity 3aantibody formation 3agene expression 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-8 3aneoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviral load 3avirology 3aAustralia1 aQuigley, Bonnie L.1 aTimms, Peter0 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.168-168dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01442-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100004000139245010100179500001900280520125500299592002801554650000801582650002201590650001601612650002501628650001901653700001901672700004101691700003601732700002001768700002001788773012001808856007301928852000902001655001202010IND60711911120221116142328.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191112DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Ocampo, Paola  Elizabeth10aCFD Simulations of Multiphase Flows: Interaction of Miscible Liquids with Different Temperatures  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe incorporation of new equations to extend the applicability of open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software according to the user’s needs must be complemented with code verification and validation with a representative case. This paper presents the development and validation of an OpenFOAM®-based solver suitable for simulating multiphase fluid flow considering three fluid phases with different densities and temperatures, i.e., two miscible liquids and air. A benchmark “dam-break” experiment was performed to validate the solver. Ten thermistors measured temperature variations in different locations of the experimental model and the temperature time series were compared against those of numerical probes in analogous locations. The accuracy of the temperature field assessment considered three different turbulence models: (a) zero-equation, (b) k-omega (Reynolds averaged simulation; RAS), and (c) large eddy simulation (LES). The simulations exhibit a maximum time-average relative and absolute errors of 9.3% and 3.1 K, respectively; thus, the validation tests proved to achieve an adequate performance of the numerical model. The solver developed can be applied in the modeling of thermal discharges into water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acomputer software 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aturbulent flow1 aRing, Michael 1 aHernández-Fontes, Jassiel  Vladimir1 aAlcérreca-Huerta, Juan  Carlos1 aMendoza, Edgar 1 aSilva, Rodolfo 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010100164300002000265520130600285592002801591650001701619650001101636650001401647650001301661650001201674650002301686650002201709650002101731650001201752650001401764650002301778650001501801650002201816650001301838650001101851650002001862700005801882700005701940700005701997700001902054700005702073700002002130773013902150856008102289852000902370655001202379IND60614634420190128000000.0190128e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b065602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieker, Georg10aCation-Dependent Electrochemistry of Polysulfides in Lithium and Magnesium Electrolyte Solutions  ap. 21770-21783.  aIn Li/S and Mg/S batteries, the charge and discharge of the sulfur cathode proceeds through a cascade of bivalent Sₓ²– and radical Sy•– polysulfide intermediates. The presence of Li⁺ or Mg²⁺ cations in the electrolyte determines the type of intermediates and the overpotentials of their formation in a different manner. Based on systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV/vis investigations, this work reveals how the mutual interplay of the different cations, the electrolyte solvent, and the polysulfide anions is reflected in the electrochemical behavior of “Li₂S₈”/LiTFSI and “MgS₈”/MgTFSI₂ solutions with dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or tetrahydrofuran as solvent. It was observed that the disproportionation reactions of the polysulfides are generally more pronounced and especially the S₃•– radical is less stabilized in Mg²⁺ than in Li⁺ containing solutions. In contrast to their Li counterparts, the formation of S₄²– polysulfides during the reduction of sulfur is not observed in glyme-based Mg polysulfide solutions. Quantum chemical predictions of stability and disproportionation of the Mg/polysulfide/solvent clusters complemented the CV and UV/vis investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aanions 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acations 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adimethylformamide 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3amagnesium 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents 3asulfur 3atetrahydrofuran1 aDiddens, Diddo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-13321 aKolek, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7852-40641 aBorodin, Oleg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9428-52911 aWinter, Martin1 aBieker, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4378-48051 aJalkanen, Kirsi0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 04, v. 122, no. 38 p.21770-21783dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b065603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001800099024003600117024003400153040001800187100001400205245005100219300001400270520073500284592002801019650002301047650001401070650001601084650000901100650001501109650000901124650000901133650001401142650001301156650001201169650002101181650001601202650001101218650002101229650001401250650002101264650001401285650002101299650001701320700001701337700001401354773011301368852000901481856008301490655001201573991594318250742620221116232945.0190530e19750101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590246892DNAL7 a11176952pmid7 a10.1258/0023677757809948442doi4 a0023-6772(19750101)9:1L.43;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorag, M.10aEffect of litter size on milk yield in the rat  ap. 43-47.  aThe amount of milk removed from rats during 1 hour's suckling after a separation period of 8 hours was estimated by weighing their pups. In the 1st experiment litters of 9 pups were suckled by all rats. At test sucklings held daily on days 6-15 of lactation, pups were reallocated to give 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 pups per dam. The largest amount of milk was removed at suckling by groups of 12 pups. In a 2nd experiment, rats were constantly sucked by litters of either 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 pups from birth to slaughter at 15 days post partum. Rats with 12 and 15 pups yielded the most milk, nearly twice as much as those suckling only 6 or 9 pups. Litters of 3 pups consumed less than 1/3 of the amount consumed by litters of 6 or 9 pups.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaboratory animals 3alactation 3alitter size 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apups 3arats 3aslaughter 3asuckling 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aLabor, Obstetric 2aLactation 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aPregnancy 2aRatsxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aPopliker, F.1 aYagil, R.0 tLaboratory animals.g1975 Jan. 01, v. 9, no. 1 p.43-47dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677757809948443Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03084naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012500163300001800288520146100306592002801767650002401795650001401819650002101833650002301854650002301877650002701900650002001927650001301947650003301960650001301993650002602006650001502032650002302047653002102070653003102091653002602122653002402148653002102172653001602193700005602209700001902265700005602284700001302340773014302353856008502496852000902581655001202590IND60598910720221119031425.0180702e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059891072DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Han10aSynthesis and Structure–Property Relationship of Biobased Biodegradable Poly(butylene carbonate-co-furandicarboxylate)  ap. 7488-7498.  aA series of biobased poly(butylene carbonate-co-furandicarboxylate) (PBCF), are synthesized through a two-step polycondensation reaction. Chemical structures, thermal properties, crystallization behaviors, mechanical properties, barrier properties, and enzymatic degradation of PBCFs are investigated. The linear variation of the glass transition temperatures with the content ratio confirms the good miscibility between butylene carbonate (BC) and butylene furandicarboxylate (BF) units. BF segments could crystallize in most contents under different temperatures. Consequently, mechanical properties of these copolymers depend not only on the composition but also on the annealing conditions. Long-time annealing at room temperature or short-time annealing under high temperature could tremendously increase the tensile modulus. For room-temperature annealing, the formation of less perfect crystals of the poly(butylene furandicarboxylate) (PBF) could interpret the enhancement of modulus. On the other hand, the high-temperature annealing induces more perfect PBF crystals and improves the modulus significantly too. The tensile toughness of the PBCFs is good with the lowest elongation at break of 260%, and the degradation could be observed in samples with less than 60 mol % BF units. With good gas barrier properties, fast biodegradability, and high mechanical performance, these copolyesters possess potential applications in the plastic industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3abiodegradability 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3acondensation reactions 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aglass transition temperature 3aindustry 3amechanical properties 3apolyesters 3athermal properties 0aBiobased polymer 0a2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid 0aPoly(ester carbonate) 0aMechanical property 0aBiodegradability 0aGas barrier1 aZhang, Ruoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3502-87381 aWang, Jinggang1 aYing, Wu Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-74281 aZhu, Jin0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 6, no. 6 p.7488-7498dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009500172300001400267500001500281520125600296592002801552650001601580650002001596650001001616650001901626650002201645650001401667650001601681650002301697650002701720650001001747650001101757650000801768650001401776650001101790650001101801650001101812650001301823650001501836650001001851650001401861653002601875653001001901653001201911653001301923653002501936653001601961653001801977653002401995700002802019700002202047773011602069856008302185852000902268655001202277IND60113608920221121035459.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011360892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClurkin, Janie D.10aHalf-life time of ozone as a function of air movement and conditions in a sealed container  ap. 41-47.  a2019-12-04  aThe effectiveness of ozone sterilization of empty storage and transportation containers used for food products and bulk grains depend on the ability to maintain high concentrations over a sufficiently long period of time. The half-life time (HLT) is generally the measure used to characterize the degradation of a fumigant in air. It is typically affected by the air vapor properties, temperature and relative humidity, gas diffusivity and air tightness. The focus of this study was to determine HLT of ozone in air as a function of airflow (0, 0.028, 0.051, 0.10 m3/s), temperature (4, 24, 40 °C) and relative humidity (0, 30, 80%) in a sealed plexiglass cylinder equipped with a combination temperature/humidity sensor and fan. HLT was as high as 1524 min (25.4 h) in still air at 24 °C and zero humidity, which was substantially longer than previously published data (i.e., 30–40 min). As airflow, temperature and humidity increased, HLT decreased to as low as 39 min. The results suggest that sterilization with ozone will be more effective in still air at low temperature and humidity (e.g., headspace ozonation of rail cars in the early spring) than at high temperature and humidity (e.g., grain storage silo in the middle of summer).  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3astored products 3afoods 3atransportation 3arelative humidity 3aozonation 3adiffusivity 3aheadspace analysis 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aozone 3aspring 3aair 3afumigants 3agrains 3asummer 3avapors 3aair flow 3acontainers 3asilos 3ahalf life 0apolymethylmetacrylate 0aOzone 0aAirflow 0aHumidity 0aHalf-life time (HLT) 0aTemperature 0aSterilization 0aOzone concentration1 aMaier, Dirkq(Dirk E.),1 aIleleji, Klein E.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.41-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008200171300002000253520115400273592002801427650002001455650001401475650002301489650003001512650001101542650001301553650001401566650002301580650001301603700005301616700001501669700005701684773013801741856008001879852000901959655001201968IND60614634620221118153906.0181002e20180831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b066212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen Santillan10aEvaluating the Stability of Single-Atom Catalysts with High Chemical Activity  ap. 21919-21926.  aSingle-atom catalysts represent the most efficient use of precious metals while at the same time offering the potential for high catalytic activity. Yet it has proven challenging to identify supports enabling high catalytic activity while at the same time inhibiting aggregation of metal adatoms. Density functional theory calculations are employed to identify how the local molecular environment on graphene can be used to stabilize a single platinum adatom and provide favorable activity for a benchmark reaction, CO oxidation. Graphene is modified via defects and dopants—specifically single vacancy and pyridinic N-doping—so that we can see how the electronic structure and chemical activity of Pt atoms are affected. The ability to disperse single atoms on graphene supports is examined by comparing binding energy of Pt atoms at neighboring stable sites versus isolated sites and evaluating the tendency toward clustering. Nudged elastic band calculations indicate that pyridinic N-doped graphene is a promising candidate to support a single Pt atom acting as a catalyst that is resistant to poisoning and enhances CO oxidation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry 3aplatinum1 aWang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9972-20191 aWu, Ruqian1 aRagan, Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8694-56830 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 31, v. 122, no. 38 p.21919-21926dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b066213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245010500209520159300314592002801907650001901935650001701954650001901971650001901990650001502009650001702024650002202041651001502063653001702078653002002095653002302115653003002138700002002168700001802188700002802206773012002234856008802354852000902442655001202451IND60753053120221123043850.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1059482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3425-350310aHow much potable water is saved by wastewater recycling? Quasi-experimental evidence from California  aRecently, California has made large investments in wastewater recycling to replace applications that use potable water. It may be expected that the use of recycled water reduces potable water use, but such an equivalency is not assured. The addition of recycled water infrastructure in a large Californian water district creates a natural experiment where this work tests how recycled water usage affects primary potable water. This is done using econometric methods for causal inference in an observational setting that mirror a randomized control trial (RCT). From 2001 to 2014, a number of public parks were given recycled water infrastructure, while others in those regions remained exclusively on potable supply. A two-way fixed effects regression is used to produce a difference-in-differences estimate of the average treatment effect of recycled water on total and potable water usage. The results indicate that potable water usage is reduced significantly when a park is connected to the recycled water supply. The estimated rate of displacement in the study period is 81.7%, meaning each unit of recycled water use avoided 0.817 units of potable water usage, which implies the connection of parks to recycled water supply increases total water use. The analysis provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical estimate of the water savings claimed by urban water recycling programs, and the first empirical estimate of displacement using quasi-experimental methods. The methodology can be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of recycling programs around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3aeconometrics 3ainfrastructure 3arecycled water 3awastewater 3awater supply 3awater utilization 3aCalifornia 0aDisplacement 0aWater recycling 0aQuasi-experimental 0aDifference-in-differences1 aPalazzo, Joseph1 aGeyer, Roland1 aSteigerwald, Douglas G.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Jan., v. 176 p.105948-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1059483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012500161300001800286520176400304592002802068650002102096650001602117650002202133650001302155650001302168650003702181700002002218700001902238700001802257700001902275700001802294700002002312700001902332700002302351773013202374856007802506852000902584655001202593IND60541272020170628000000.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127202DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b031672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsarfati, Yael10aDispersing Perylene Diimide/SWCNT Hybrids: Structural Insights at the Molecular Level and Fabricating Advanced Materials  ap. 7429-7440.  aThe unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) are advantageous for emerging applications. Yet, the CNT insolubility hampers their potential. Approaches based on covalent and noncovalent methodologies have been tested to realize stable dispersions of CNTs. Noncovalent approaches are of particular interest as they preserve the CNT’s structures and properties. We report on hybrids, in which perylene diimide (PDI) amphiphiles are noncovalently immobilized onto single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The resulting hybrids were dispersed and exfoliated both in water and organic solvents in the presence of two different PDI derivatives, PP2b and PP3a. The dispersions were investigated using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), providing unique structural insights into the exfoliation. A helical arrangement of PP2b assemblies on SWCNTs dominates in aqueous dispersions, while a single layer of PP2b and PP3a was found on SWCNTs in organic dispersions. The dispersions were probed by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies, revealing appreciable charge redistribution in the ground state, and an efficient electron transfer from SWCNTs to PDIs in the excited state. We also fabricated hybrid materials from the PP2b/SWCNT dispersions. A supramolecular membrane was prepared from aqueous dispersions and used for size-selective separation of gold nanoparticles. Hybrid buckypaper films were prepared from the organic dispersions. In the latter, high conductivity results from enhanced electronic communication and favorable morphology within the hybrid material. Our findings shed light onto SWCNT/dispersant molecular interactions, and introduce a versatile approach toward universal solution processing of SWCNT-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adispersions 3aelectron transfer 3ananogold 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aStrauss, Volker1 aKuhri, Susanne1 aKrieg, Elisha1 aWeissman, Haim1 aShimoni, Eyal1 aBaram, Jonathan1 aGuldi, Dirk M.1 aRybtchinski, Boris0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7429-7440dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b031673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04349naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245020100205300001600406520209700422592002802519650001702547650002202564650002902586650002402615650002402639650002502663650001302688650001502701650002502716650001302741650002002754650001502774650001302789650004302802650002402845650000902869650001602878653001302894653001302907653000902920653000802929653000802937653001702945653000902962653001002971653001002981653000802991653001202999653000803011653000803019653000803027653000803035653000803043653000803051653000703059653000803066653000903074653002203083653001403105653002003119653002903139653001103168653003503179700001403214700001203228700001203240700001703252700001603269700001903285700001803304773011503322856008503437852000903522655001203531IND60543909720221118071257.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054390972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4617-172110aImpacts of human leukocyte antigen DQ genetic polymorphisms and their interactions with hepatitis B virus mutations on the risks of viral persistence, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 201-209.  aHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17–1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04–1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65–0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68–0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09–0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02–7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHLA antigens 3aHepatitis B virus 3aanthropogenic activities 3achronic hepatitis B 3aconfidence interval 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahepatoma 3aliver cirrhosis 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3astart codon 0aanti-HBc 0aanti-HBs 0aASCs 0aCHB 0aCIs 0aEnhII/BCP/PC 0aGWAS 0aHBeAg 0aHBsAg 0aHBV 0aHBV-HCC 0aHCC 0aHCV 0aHDV 0aHIV 0aHLA 0aHWE 0aLC 0aORs 0aSNPs 0aHepatitis B virus 0aMutations 0aLiver cirrhosis 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aHLA-DQ 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aZhang, Qi1 aLi, Bin1 aDu, Yan1 aYin, Jianhua1 aLiu, Wenbin1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aCao, Guangwen0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.201-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166500002200274520165300296592002801949650001001977650002501987650001902012650002002031650004102051650001202092650002602104650002902130653003002159653002302189653002602212653002702238653002202265653000902287653001302296700002202309700002202331700001702353700002202370700002602392773006802418856008102486852000902567655001202576IND60558336020221123032026.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafique, Umer10aGas chromatographic determination of perfluorocarboxylic acids in aqueous samples – A tutorial review  aPre-press version  aDetermination of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) by gas chromatography (GC) has been undertaken since 1980. However, only small number of studies can be found in the literature due to the major drawbacks associated with the GC determination of PFCAs such as high detection limits, a small range of analytes, long analysis time, and laborious derivatization prior to chromatographic separation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2) can overcome these limitations of GC, and therefore has become the method of choice for the determination of PFCAs since 2001. Nevertheless, GC as a low-cost and commonly available analytical technique should not be ignored because of its inherent advantage over LC to identify PFCA isomers in environmental and biological matrices owing to its high-resolution power. In addition, GC provides an opportunity to crosscheck LC–MS2 results that are often suspicious due to background contamination. This tutorial provides an overview of GC methods that have been used for the determination of PFCAs after derivatization. Moreover, performance characteristics of GC–MS are compared with that of LC–MS2. PFCAs in aqueous samples were determined by both analytical techniques, and two sets of measurements were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. For both methods, reasons for false-positive and false-negative results (overestimation and underestimation of the PFCA concentration, respectively) are discussed, and accordingly some advice is offered on how to avoid erroneous results. Finally, major applications of GC and its future perspectives for the determination of PFCAs are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aanalytical chemistry 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aisomers 3aliquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPerfluorocarboxylic acids 0aGas chromatography 0aLiquid chromatography 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aBland-Altman plot 0aPFOA 0aEffluent1 aSchulze, Stefanie1 aSlawik, Christian1 aKunz, Stefan1 aPaschke, Albrecht1 aSchüürmann, Gerrit,0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001600283500001900299520122500318592002801543650001801571650002701589650002901616650001301645650002001658650003101678650001001709650002001719650004301739650001101782653001201793653001701805653001901822700001601841773014101857856008601998852000902084655001202093IND60721209220221116173557.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120922DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00037.X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannaki, T.R.10aDifferential mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides-defensins in Indian native chickens and White Leghorn  ap. 212-216.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAvian b-defensins are antimicrobial peptides that play a crucial role in the innate immune response in chickens. Apart from their antimicrobial activity by non-oxidative mechanisms, recent evidences revealed their immune-modulatory function also, thus acting as a link between innate and adaptive immune responses. The present investigation provides a comparative quantification of constitutive expression of mRNA of AvBD (1–14) genes in Indian native chicken breeds (Aseel and Kadaknath) and White Leghorn. Real-time PCR analysis revealed the measurable mRNA expressions for all 1–14 AvBD genes in the spleen of both native chickens and White Leghorn. Significant differences were found for AvBD5, 12 and 14 gene expressions among the three breeds. However, no significant difference was found for AvBD1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 gene expressions among the chicken breeds investigated. AvBD5 expression was significantly (P<0.05) higher in Kadaknath, whereas AvBD12 and 14 mRNA expression levels were significantly (P<0.05) higher in Aseel in comparison to other two breeds. This differential expression may confer more innate immunity to native chicken breeds to encounter pathogens more efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite Leghorn 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3achickens 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 0aChicken 0aβ defensins 0aNative chicken1 aReddy, M.R.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.212-216dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00037.X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011400156300001600270520154200286592002801828650002101856650001601877650001601893650001801909650001201927650001701939650002401956650001201980650002301992650002302015650002002038650002402058650001302082650002102095650002002116700001602136700001602152700002202168773013502190856007402325852000902399655001202408IND60765064620221119030608.0220509e20080717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506462DNAL7 a10.17221/358-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkřivan, M.10aEffect of dietary selenium on lipid oxidation, selenium and vitamin E content in the meat of broiler chickens  ap. 306-311.  aAn experiment was conducted to compare the effect of dietary sodium selenite and selenomethionine on selenium and α-tocopherol concentration in breast meat, oxidative stability of meat in broilers, and on growth performance, but only as an unimportant criterion in this case. Sexed broiler cockerels Ross 308 were allocated to 3 dietary treatments, each comprising 100 chickens. The basal diet was supplemented with 0 (control) or 0.3 mg/kg Se from sodium selenite (SS) or selenomethionine (SM). Dietary supplementation with SM increased (<I>P</I> < 0.05) body weight, but only by about 3%. Breast muscle Se concentration was increased (<I>P</I> < 0.05) by both Se sources, but more by SM (1.32 mg/kg dry matter; 0.47 mg/kg DM in control). The concentration of Se in excreta was 3 times higher with SS supplement than with SM supplement. Dietary Se supplementation increased (<I>P</I> < 0.05) the α-tocopherol content of breast meat from 25.9 mg/kg DM in the control to 33.2 mg/kg DM when SM supplementation was used. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation decreased compared to the control. The inclusion of SM in the diet reduced (<I>P</I> < 0.05) malondialdehyde (MDA) values in breast samples after 0, 3, and 5 days of cooler storage, whereas SS decreased (<I>P</I> < 0.05) the MDA of breast meat after 0 and 3 days of storage. The results of this experiment indicate that selenomethionine in the diet of broilers is capable of simultaneously increasing the content of selenium and vitamin E in broiler meat plus its stability in storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abody weight 3abreast meat 3abreast muscle 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3adietary supplements 3aexcreta 3agrowth performance 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stability 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asodium selenite1 aDlouhá, G.1 aMašata, O.1 aŠevčíková, S.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 53, no. 7 p.306-311dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/358-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245009200206500002200298520151800320592002801838650002501866650002301891650001601914650001001930650001601940650001101956650001501967650001001982650001701992650001302009650001802022653004002040653000902080653001802089653003202107653001602139653001802155653001802173700002502191700001802216773006802234856008102302852000902383655001202392IND60558336220221123031954.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, Adam G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3813-868410aVertical-flow paper SERS system for therapeutic drug monitoring of flucytosine in serum  aPre-press version  aA number of life-saving drugs require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for safe and effective use. Currently, however, TDM is performed using sophisticated analytical techniques relegated to central labs, increasing the cost per test and time to answer. Here, using a novel vertical flow membrane system with inkjet-printed surface enhanced Raman sensors, along with a portable spectrometer, we demonstrate a low cost and easy to use device to quantify levels of flucytosine, an antifungal that requires TDM for effective patient care, from undiluted human serum. To our knowledge, this work represents the first report of a passive vertical flow sample cleanup method with surface enhanced Raman detection. We first investigated and optimized the parameters of the vertical flow system for the detection of flucytosine in spiked serum samples. Then, using an optimized vertical-flow system utilizing nitrocellulose membranes and a paper SERS sensor, we achieved detection of down to 10 μg mL−1 flucytosine in undiluted serum, with quantitative detection across the entire therapeutic range. This system reduces the assay time to about 15 min, far quicker than the current gold standards. We anticipate that this novel system will enable near-patient therapeutic drug monitoring, leading to the safe and effective administration of a number of life-saving drugs. Furthermore, it will spawn the development of SERS detection systems capable of separating target analytes from real-world biological matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3aflucytosine 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apaper 3apatient care 3aspawning 3aspectrometers 0aSurface enhanced Raman spectroscopy 0aSERS 0aPaper sensors 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring 0aFlucytosine 0aPoint-of-care 0aVertical flow1 aRestaino, Stephen M.1 aWhite, Ian M.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012300170300001600293500001900309520091000328592002801238650001601266650002101282650001601303650001901319650001401338650001701352650001801369650001901387653002001406653001401426700001701440700001501457700002301472700001801495700002301513773014101536856008601677852000901763655001201772IND60721209420221116173601.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120942DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00047.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM.

Seminal plasma of the two lines was analysed for protein, cholesterol and nitric oxide levels. The line under selection had significantly (P < 0.05) lower values in fertilizing ability, protein, cholesterol and nitric oxide levels in comparison to control line.

Herein, we report a simple strategy to controllably synthesize pure RuP and RuP₂ and evaluate their HER performances in all pH range. Different from other transition metal phosphides, the HER performance of the RuPₓ in all pH range obviously improves as the phosphorus content decreases. By systematic research, it has been found that the RuP-475 with more Ru had much better conductivity and more catalytically active sites than the P rich RuP₂-550. In addition, the RuP-475 exhibits excellent HER performance with small overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm–² (46, 47, 22 mV in pH 0, 7, and 14, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen production 3apH 3aphosphides 3aphosphorus 3aruthenium 0aruthenium phosphides 0aone-step controlled synthesis 0aall pH range 0aPt-like activity 0aHydrogen evolution reaction1 aMa, Jingwen1 aZhu, Yuanzhi1 aLi, Zhen1 aXu, Danyun1 aDuan, Xuezhi1 aPeng, Wenchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1515-82871 aLi, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3003-98571 aZhang, Guoliang1 aZhang, Fengbao1 aFan, Xiaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9615-38660 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Apr. 17, v. 6, no. 5 p.6388-6394dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008200170300001600252500001900268520069300287592002800980650001801008650002401026650001601050650001201066650001301078650002201091650001601113650001501129650001601144650002301160653001001183653001001193653001601203653001601219700002301235700001601258700001901274700001701293773014101310856008601451852000901537655001201546IND60721209520221116173643.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120952DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00045.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM.

Before FT-ICR-MS analysis, isolation, desalination and concentration of DOM are necessary, and solid-phase extraction (SPE) is the most widely applied pretreatment procedure. However, some molecular information is lost using conventional SPE methods. Here, we propose a novel strategy of SPE enrichment using stepwise elution (SPE-SE). Compounds in DOM were divided into three fractions by this SPE-SE procedure according to their polarity and ionization efficiency. The diversity of DOM molecules identified by ESI-FT-ICR-MS using SPE-SE exceeded those using conventional SPE methods by more than 50%. This method is feasible and has the potential to be used as a pretreatment strategy for complex DOM matrixes prior to ESI-FT-ICR-MS analysis, especially for those rich in nitrogenous molecules, carbohydrates, lipids and/or aromatic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbohydrates 3adesalination 3adissolved organic matter 3aionization 3alipids 3amass spectrometry 3apollution 3asolid phase extraction 0aDOM 0aSPE 0aESI-FT-ICR-MS 0aStepwise elution1 aZhang, Shuzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7058-70951 aLuo, Lei1 aCao, Dong0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015100173520205200324592002802376650002302404650001202427650001002439650002402449650002202473650001802495650002002513650002302533650001002556650001602566650002902582650002002611650001302631650002102644650001702665650002902682653001102711653001302722653002302735653002802758700002502786700007102811700001802882700001602900700002002916773010802936856009003044852000903134655001203143IND60753053620221120112319.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1065482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasoumi, Reza10aDoes fat-tail docking and Zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) supplementation affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of finishing lambs?  aThe present study aimed to examine the implementation of either fat-tail docking and/or Zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) supplementation on feedlot performance, carcass characteristics and selected blood metabolites of fat-tailed Afshari lambs. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, 32 male lambs (41.0 ± 5.8 kg, 180 days of age) were allocated to two experimental groups consisting of 16 intact and 16 fat-tail docked lambs. Within each group, lambs were randomly assigned to two dietary treatment groups for 28 days as follows: G1; intact lambs with no ZH supplementation, G2; intact lambs with 10 mg ZH/day, G3; fat-tail docked with no ZH supplementation and G4; fat-tail docked with 10 mg ZH/day. ZH supplementation or fat tail docking did not change total body weight gain (P > 0.10). Dry matter intake was significantly increased by fat-tail docking (P < 0.01), but it was not affected by ZH supplementation. Fat-tail docking did not influence feed efficiency, while ZH improved feed efficiency only in intact lams with no significant effect on docked lambs (P = 0.05). ZH tended to decrease backfat thickness (P = 0.06) and tended to increase longissimus dorsi muscle depth only in intact lambs (P = 0.08). ZH supplementation, fat tail docking, or ZH × fat-tail docking interactions did not affect whole carcass weights and lengths (P > 0.10). Fat-tail docking resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in fat thickness covering longissimus dorsi muscle in docked lambs with no ZH supplementation; however, ZH supplementation prevented this increase in longissimus dorsi muscle fat thickness (P = 0.03). In summary, fat-tail docking did not notably affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics; however, it increased dry matter intake and subcutaneous fat thickness as well as visceral organs weights and visceral fat deposits. ZH supplementation did not influence feedlot performance but significantly improved carcass characteristics, as indicated by lower fat and higher muscle and protein content of carcass both in docked and intact lambs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3abackfat 3ablood 3abody weight changes 3adry matter intake 3afat thickness 3afeed conversion 3alongissimus muscle 3amales 3ametabolites 3anutritional intervention 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3asubcutaneous fat 3avisceral fat 3azilpaterol hydrochloride 0aZilmax 0aFat-tail 0aLamb's performance 0aCarcass characteristics1 aAfsharirad, Ali-Reza1 aMirzaei-Alamouti, Hamidreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2200-64491 aVahedi, Vahid1 aGreen, Mark1 aAliyari, Davoud0 tSmall ruminant research.g2021 Dec., v. 205 p.106548-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1065483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008000170300001600250500001900266520052200285592002800807650001300835650002000848650002000868650005200888650001000940653000800950653001600958653001200974700001800986700001901004700002101023773014101044856008601185852000901271655001201280IND60721209820221116173550.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120982DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00039.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannaki, T.R.10aToll like receptor mRNA expression in the ejaculated spermatozoa of chicken  ap. 234-235.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) are a broad family of innate immune receptors that play an essential role in detecting and responding to invading pathogens.

The four S,S-acetals 2c-f with sufficiently long alkyl chains are thermotropic liquid crystalline; 2 e and 2 f are even dithermomesomorphic. Each of these four inosose derivatives 2c-f exhibits monotropically a most likely cubic mesophase (MI); in addition 2e and 2f show enantiotropically a hexagonal mesophase (Hₓ) with a non-covalent, supramolecular H-bridge architecture. Whereas the nature of the optically isotropic mesophase MI needs further clarification the stable high temperature mesophase Hₓ of 2 e and 2 f has been established by a miscibility test using a sugar S,S-dialkyl acetal also tripodal in structure and with a Hₓ phase proved by X-ray diffraction, but in contrast to 2 with an acyclic hydrophilic part.

Laboratory bioassays were conducted on wheat in all combinations of three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C) and two r.h. levels (55 and 75%). The rates used were 0.1, 0.5 and 1 ppm, and the insects tested were adults of Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus oryzae and Tribolium confusum. Mortality was assessed after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure, and progeny production of the first two species was recorded 65 d later. Based on both mortality and progeny production counts, R. dominica was highly susceptible to all doses of spinetoram. Moreover, the test temperature and r.h. had little effect on R. dominica adult mortality. Sitophilus oryzae was also susceptible to spinetoram at dose rates ≥0.5 ppm. For this species, mortality increased significantly with an increase of temperature, but not in all dose–r.h. combinations. Adult mortality of T. confusum was low, which indicated that this species was not susceptible to spinetoram, regardless of the conditions examined. The results of the present study suggest that over the range tested, temperature and r.h. affected spinetoram efficacy only in the case of S. oryzae, and not significantly in R. dominica and T. confusum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aTribolium confusum 3aadults 3abioassays 3ainsects 3amortality 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3astored products 3atemperature 3awheat 0aSpinetoram 0aRhyzopertha dominica 0aSitophilus oryzae 0aTribolium confusum 0aTemperature 0aRelative humidity1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.73-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010300158300002200261520126700283592002801550650001101578650001101589650001701600650002201617650003401639650002101673650001501694650002201709650001201731650001801743650001701761650001301778700001801791700001701809700001701826700001901843773012701862856007401989852000902063655001202072IND60641259720221121014315.0190505e20161129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125972DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20989k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivakumar, M.13aAn efficacy of ‘nano’ in brannerite-type CoV₂O₆ conversion electrode for lithium batteries  ap. 112813-112818.  aAmong the classical anodes, conversion anodes play a unique role due to their capability to provide higher initial discharge capacity than the theoretical capacity. Poor capacity retention and voltage hysteresis exhibited by classical conversion anodes are the major obstacles for their commercialization in lithium battery market. Nanotechnology may be a suitable contrivance to tackle this problem. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to synthesize brannerite-type nano sized cobalt vanadate by rheological phase reaction method and use it as a conversion anode in lithium batteries. Although this material provides a high initial irreversible capacity of around 600 mA h g⁻¹ in its preliminary cycle, stabilization of capacity with approximately 100% coulombic efficiency and considerable low voltage hysteresis in the proceeding cycles may place this material in the limelight for its development as a commercially available anode material. The electrochemical conversion of CoO nanoparticles into Co quantum dots occurred in an amorphous lithiated vanadium oxide matrix, which functioned as a source of reactive sites, as well as a separator to preserve the nanoparticles against further agglomeration, thereby, offering a better rate capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acommercialization 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3ahysteresis 3alithium batteries 3amarkets 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 3avanadium1 aPrahasini, P.1 aSubadevi, R.1 aLiu, Wei-Ren1 aWang, Fu Ming,0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 29, v. 6, no. 114 p.112813-112818dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra20989k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009700172300001600269520174000285592002802025650001502053650003002068650002702098650002502125650002502150650002302175650001102198650001402209650001202223650001402235650002202249650001202271650002202283650002002305650001602325653002202341653003402363653002802397653003402425700002602459700002902485773011802514856008302632852000902715655001202724IND60113609520221120162058.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011360952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumbos, Christos I.10aComparison of two pirimiphos-methyl formulations against major stored-product insect species  ap. 106-115.  aThe insecticidal effect of two pirimiphos-methyl formulations [emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and capsule suspension (CS)] was evaluated in laboratory bioassays against adults of Sitophilus granarius, S. oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium confusum, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, Prostephanus truncatus and Liposcelis entomophila. Pirimiphos-methyl was applied at five dose rates, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 ppm, and, depending on the natural mortality level, insect mortality was assessed after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. After the final mortality count, all individuals were removed and progeny production was evaluated after an additional period of 65 d. In another series of laboratory bioassays, the insecticidal efficacy of these two pirimiphos-methyl formulations was evaluated against S. granarius, T. confusum and R. dominica at three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C) and two relative humidity (r.h.) levels (55 and 75%). Pirimiphos-methyl was applied at two dose rates, 2 and 4 ppm, and mortality of beetles was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. In all cases, Sitophilus species were highly susceptible to both pirimiphos-methyl formulations, since complete (100%) mortality was noted with doses ≥1 ppm after 7 d of exposure. In contrast, R. dominica and P. truncatus were the least susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl, as mortality did not exceed 82 and 57%, respectively, for any of the dose rates or formulations tested. Progeny production was in most cases suppressed by pirimiphos-methyl, with the exception of R. dominica. Moreover, in most of the combinations tested, there was no significant and consistent effect of temperature and r.h. on S. granarius, T. confusum and R. dominica mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiposcelis 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3aProstephanus truncatus 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus granarius 3aTribolium confusum 3aadults 3abioassays 3ainsects 3amortality 3apirimiphos-methyl 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3astored products 3atemperature 0aPirimiphos-methyl 0aStored-product insect control 0aCapsule suspension (CS) 0aEmulsifiable concentrate (EC)1 aDutton, Anna Cristina1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.106-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016200167500002200329520139700351592002801748650002001776650001501796650001201811650002501823650002201848650001001870650001701880650002201897650001801919650001401937650002301951650001501974650001401989650002402003653003302027653001202060653001702072653002502089653002602114700001602140700001702156700001402173700001502187773006802202856008102270852000902351655001202360IND60558336720221116231039.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Bingying10aCoupling hybridization chain reaction with DNAzyme recycling for enzyme-free and dual amplified sensitive fluorescent detection of methyltransferase activity  aPre-press version  aAberrant DNA methylation originated from changes in DNA methyltransferase activity can lead to many genetic diseases and tumor types, and the monitoring of methyltransferase activity is thus of great importance in disease diagnosis and drug screening. In this work, by combing hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and metal ion-dependent DNAzyme recycling, we have developed a convenient enzyme-free signal amplification strategy for highly sensitive detection of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam MTase) activity and its inhibitors. The Dam MTase-induced methylation and subsequent cleavage of the methylated hairpin DNA probes by DpnI endonuclease lead to the release of ssDNA triggers for HCR formation of many Mg2+-dependent DNAzymes, in which the fluorescently quenched substrate sequences are catalytically and cyclically cleaved by Mg2+ to generate remarkably amplified fluorescent signals for highly sensitive detection of Dam MTase at 7.23 × 10−4 U/mL. In addition, the inhibition of different drugs to Dam MTase activity can also be evaluated with the developed method. With the advantages of simplicity and significant signal amplification over other common methods, the demonstrated biosensing approach thus offers great potential for highly sensitive detection of various methyltransferases and provides a convenient platform for drug screening for therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA probes 3aadenine 3aanalytical chemistry 3adisease diagnosis 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3agenetic disorders 3ahybridization 3amagnesium 3amethyltransferases 3amonitoring 3ascreening 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aHybridization chain reaction 0aDNAzyme 0aFluorescence 0aSignal amplification 0aDNA methyltransferase1 aWei, Yulian1 aXu, Junqiang1 aYuan, Ruo1 aXiang, Yun0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009200168300001600260520162400276592002801900650001801928650001401946650001501960650002301975650002601998650003502024650002602059650001102085650002502096650001802121650001102139650001402150650001402164650001702178650002002195650001402215650001502229650002002244650002302264650001802287650003702305650001302342700001702355700001602372700002602388700001902414773012402433856008402557852000902641655001202650IND60099602320221122233837.0141105e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaria, Ola M.10aMatrigel improves functional properties of human submandibular salivary gland cell line  ap. 622-631.  aSjogren's syndrome and radiotherapy for head and neck cancers result in irreversible damage to functional salivary tissue, for which no adequate treatment is available. The microenvironment for salivary gland cell cytodifferentiation is critical for the future development of salivary gland regeneration, repair and tissue engineering treatments. Results from this study indicate that human submandibular cell line (HSG) cultured on Matrigel (2mg/ml) could be induced to differentiate into polarized secretory acinar-like cells. The HSG cells grown on Matrigel were evaluated by physiological functional assays, molecular and immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and morphological assessments. The results showed (1) a decrease in cell proliferation; (2) an increase in cell apoptosis; (3) cellular polarization evident by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), expressions of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, occludin, JAM-A, and ZO-1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); (4) an increase in the production and/or secretion of acinar cell proteins, i.e., alpha-amylase, aquaporin-5, cytokeratins, and mucin-1, that were not associated with increases in mRNA transcription; (5) a decrease in vimentin expression; and (6) expression of potential stem cell biomarkers CD44 and CD166. The data indicated that Matrigel provided a suitable microenvironment for morphological and functional differentiation of HSG cells into 3D acinar like cells. This study provides an in vitro model and baseline data on future developments of new strategies for salivary gland regeneration and replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell proliferation 3aelectrical resistance 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afunctional properties 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aoccludins 3aradiotherapy 3asalivary glands 3asecretion 3astem cells 3atight junctions 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avimentin1 aMaria, Osama1 aLiu, Younan1 aKomarova, Svetlana V.1 aTran, Simon D.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.622-631dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016300160300002000323520143000343592002801773650003401801650004401835650002201879650003701901650002501938650001701963650002201980650001602002650002502018650001302043650000902056650001302065650001302078650003302091650001202124650002302136650003702159700001402196700001302210700001702223700001202240773012502252856007402377852000902451655001202460IND60641259820221121003704.0190505e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125982DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20996c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Hongshan10aCoordination-driven multilayer of phosvitin-polyphenol functional nanofibrous membranes: antioxidant and biomineralization applications for tissue engineering  ap. 98935-98944.  aThe layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique has been widely used to decorate the nanofibers formed from polymer pairs with complementary functional groups. In the current study, an antioxidative coordination-driven multilayer electrospun nanofibrous film was fabricated from tannic acid (TA) and phosvitin (PV) obtained from egg yolk. PV was reported to bond with 95% of yolk iron which could provide chelating sites for TA. The surface morphology of the nanofibrous mats was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Also the TEM image of the cross-section illustrated a uniform shell formed around the cellulose nanofibers. The deposition of TA and PV was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). TA/PV nanofibrous mats showed good 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity regardless of the outmost component. While for superoxide-scavenging and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, the outmost component affected the scavenging capacity of nanofibrous mats. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were combined to characterize the morphology and structure of the deposited mineral phase on the scaffolds after culturing in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 5 days. From the result, the TA/PV nanofibrous mats were satisfactory for use in bioapplications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomineralization 3abody fluids 3acellulose nanofibers 3aegg yolk 3airon 3amoieties 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atannins 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhou, Bin1 aLi, Jing1 aPei, Yaqiong1 aLi, Bin0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 6, no. 101 p.98935-98944dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra20996c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012400163300001800287520070500305592002801010650002301038650001401061650001201075700002101087700002101108700002001129700002301149700002501172700001901197700001501216700002001231773013201251856007801383852000901461655001201470IND60541272720170628000000.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127272DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b037682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerón, Maira R.10aTethered Bisadducts of C60 and C70 with Addends on a Common Hexagonal Face and a 12-Membered Hole in the Fullerene Cage  ap. 7502-7508.  aThe regioselective synthesis of easily isolable pure bismethano derivatives of C₆₀ and C₇₀ with high steric congestion is described using 1,3-dibenzoylpropane bis-p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazone as the addend precursor. When the addition occurs at two [6,6] ring junctions within the same hexagon, bisadducts with mirror symmetry are obtained for both C₆₀ and C₇₀. When the addition occurs at two [5,6] ring junctions in C₆₀, a symmetrical adduct is formed, which readily undergoes photo-oxygenation and ring opening to yield a fullerene with a hole in the cage.

Our study was designed to compare six principal IgY extraction methods (water dilution, polyethylene glycol [PEG] precipitation, caprylic acid extraction, chloroform extraction, phenol extraction, and carrageenan extraction), and to assess their relative extraction efficiencies and the purity of the resulting antibodies. The results showed that the organic solvents (chloroform or phenol) minimised the lipid ratio in the egg yolk. The water dilution, PEG precipitation and caprylic acid extraction methods resulted in high yields, and antibodies purified with PEG and carrageenan exhibited high purity. Our results indicate that phenol extraction would be more suitable for preparing high concentrations of IgY for non-therapeutic usage, while the water dilution and carrageenan extraction methods would be more appropriate for use in the preparation of IgY for oral administration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3acarrageenan 3achloroform 3aegg yolk 3alaboratories 3aoctanoic acid 3aoral administration 3aphenol 3apolyethylene glycol1 aYang, Wenjing1 aThirumalai, Diraviyam1 aZhang, Xiaoying1 aSchade, Rüdiger,0 tATLA.

Strawberry plants were treated with juglone (5-hydroxy-1.4 naphthoquinone, 1mM) and walnut leaf extracts (undiluted, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 diluted). Vegetative and reproductive plant growth was inhibited strongly by the treatment of both juglone and undiluted walnut leaf extracts. Fruit yield per plant, the number of fruit per plant, average fruit weight, crowns per plant, number of leaves, leaf area, fresh root weight, total soluble solid (TSS), vitamin C and acidity were reduced by juglone treatment compared to the control. All nutrient elements analyzed in the leaves generally were lower than the control for all treatments except 1/8 diluted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria 3aJuglans regia 3aacidity 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3aelemental composition 3aenvironment 3aferns and fern allies 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3ajuglone 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3asoil 3astrawberries 3atotal soluble solids 3awalnuts1 aEsitken, A.1 aTurkkal, C.1 aOrhan, E.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 51, no. 6 p.283-287dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3587-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245020200198300002000400520153600420592002801956650001801984650001302002650002002015650003202035650001102067650001302078650002202091650001302113650001802126650001302144650001302157650001902170650002202189650002502211650001802236653001202254653002402266653002502290653002102315653002602336700001502362700005502377700001602432700001502448773014202463856008002605852000902685655001202694IND60760420820221120201357.0211221e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076042082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c041132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1834-095410aIntegrating Microbial Protein Production and Harvest Systems into Pilot-Scale Recirculating Aquaculture Systems for Sustainable Resource Recovery: Linking Nitrogen Recovery to Microbial Communities  ap. 16735-16746.  aIn aquaculture, it is important to raise the nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) to improve sustainability. To achieve this, recovery of microbial protein (RMP), instead of nitrification/denitrification in conventional wastewater treatment, is a promising approach whose microbiological mechanisms must be characterized. Here, periodic RMP was conducted in an in situ biofloc-based aquaculture system (IBAS) and a separating assimilation reactor-based recirculating aquaculture system (SRAS). Kinetic analysis indicated that a microbial biomass level of 3 g L–¹ was optimal for inorganic N removal, and excess biomass was harvested to improve the NRE. Unlike the IBAS, the SRAS eliminated the fluctuation in water quality caused by the RMP. Periodic RMP significantly increased the NRE to 44–57% by promoting the filamentous bacterium Herpetosiphon and suppressing anaerobic denitrifiers. Aerobic chemoheterotrophy was the main microbial metabolic process for energy. After RMP, nitrate reductase-encoded functional genes (napA and narG) significantly decreased, while nitrite reductase-encoded functional genes, especially nirK, significantly increased. Co-occurrence networks analysis indicated that the cooperation and competition among organic matter degraders, filamentous bacteria, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers determined the microbial protein yield. These results provide fundamental insights into the influence of the RMP on microbial communities and functions, which is important for realizing sustainable aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpetosiphon 3abacteria 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenergy 3akinetics 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aprotein synthesis 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 0aKinetic 0aBacterial community 0aFilamentous bacteria 0aFunctional genes 0aCo-occurrence network1 aDai, Zhili1 aKang, Song,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5511-04991 aWang, Yuren1 aHe, Xugang0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 55, no. 24 p.16735-16746dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c041133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009100169300001600260500001900276520131100295592002801606650001901634650001301653650001801666650000901684650001401693650001901707650001401726650001501740650000901755650001101764650000901775650001701784653001401801653002401815653001601839700002001855700002001875773014101895856008602036852000902122655001202131IND60721210320221117191312.0201224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121032DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00049.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Amit10aRice based distillers dried grains and solubles in duck egg production and its quality  ap. 255-258.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA feeding trial was conducted with laying Khaki Campbell ducks with rice based distillers dried grain solubles (DDGS) for 20 weeks to study the laying performance and quality of eggs. Dried DDGS contains 64.41% crude protein and 4739.73 cal/g of gross energy. Soybean cake in the laying ration was replaced with DDGS at the levels of 0, 10, 25, 50 and 75% on iso-nitrogenous basis. Laying Khaki Campbell ducks of 200 nos. were distributed in to five experimental groups with 10 ducks in four replicates each. After 20 weeks of laying study it was observed that total number of egg production was significantly increased (p<0.05) with the increased level of DDGS in the ration. The quality of eggs in different experimental group indicated that egg length (mm), egg width (mm) shape index (%) and egg weight (g) were not influence with the increasing levels of DDGS in the diet. The egg shell weight (g) and yolk weight followed the same trend. Although shell thickness increased with higher level of DDGS but it was not statistically significant. Higher values of Haugh unit, yolk index and albumin index were observed with higher levels of DDGS in the diet. Present investigation in laying ducks indicated that 75% replacement of soybean cake with DDGS have higher egg production and superior egg quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKhaki Campbell 3aalbumins 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aduck eggs 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aenergy 3arice 3asoybean cake 0aRice DDGS 0aDuck egg production 0aEgg quality1 aSamanta, Gautam1 aSamanta, Gourab0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 3 p.255-258dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00049.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245010300166520124900269592002801518650002001546650001101566650001401577650001001591650001401601650001501615650001401630650001601644650001701660651001001677653002301687653001901710653001301729653001501742653002001757653001501777700002301792700002301815700002201838700001901860700001801879700002101897700002001918700001801938700001301956700001801969700001701987773010902004856008802113852000902201655001202210IND60753054020221120133005.0220222e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1036702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xin10aMiddle Triassic lake deepening in the Ordos Basin of North China linked with global sea-level rise  aThe Yanchang Formation was deposited during the Middle Triassic in a vast lacustrine basin in the modern Ordos Basin and is a main target for hydrocarbon exploration in Central China. It is divided, based on sedimentary cycles and lithology, into the Chang 10 (the oldest) to Chang 1 (the youngest) members. During the deposition of the Chang 7 Member, the Ordos lake system reached its maximum depth and large volumes of organic-rich sediments were deposited. The evolution of the Ordos Basin sedimentary system during this phase is, however, not completely understood, and uncertainty still exists as for the chronostratigraphy of Chang 7 Member. We acquired palynological markers and palynofacies and a high-resolution δ¹³Cₒᵣg record through the entire Chang 7 Member, and a ID-TIMS ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U date of 240.95 ± 0.033 Ma from a volcanic ash bed in the middle of this Member. These imply that the maximum deepening phase of the lacustrine system was during the earliest Ladinian. Evidence of marine influence in the Ordos Basin at that time and comparison to the sea-level oscillations observed in Western Tethys suggest that a global eustatic rise and highstand may have played a role in determining lake-level variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3aevolution 3alakes 3alithology 3apalynology 3asea level 3auncertainty 3avolcanic ash 3aChina 0aYanchang formation 0aChang 7 Member 0aLadinian 0aCA-ID-TIMS 0aCarbon isotopes 0aLacustrine1 aBaranyi, Viktória1 aCaggiati, Marcello1 aFranceschi, Marco1 aWall, Corey J.1 aLiu, Guanglin1 aSchmitz, Mark D.1 aGianolla, Piero1 aOgg, James G.1 aLu, Gang1 aShi, Zhiqiang1 aPreto, Nereo0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2021 Dec., v. 207 p.103670-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1036703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012900168300001600297520218400313592002802497506003702525650001902562650001602581650002902597650001702626650001402643650001202657650001502669650002002684650001502704650001802719650001702737650001902754650001502773650001502788650001802803700001702821773012602838856008302964852000903047655001203056IND60776611620221207045901.0220904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661162DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192916044005132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatsch, Andreas10aNrf2 Activation as a Key Event Triggered by Skin Sensitisers: The Development of the Stable KeratinoSens Reporter Gene Assay  ap. 443-451.  aThe 21st century paradigm for toxicology and the adverse outcome pathway concept envisage a future toxicology largely based on mechanistic in vitro assays and relying mainly on cellular models. In the skin sensitisation field, this concept was not intuitive at the beginning. Given the high structural diversity of skin sensitising molecules, classical receptor binding as the molecular initiating event in a cell-based assay could be excluded from the start, leaving the question of how cells could sense potential skin sensitising chemicals and be able to differentiate them from non-sensitisers. When we entered this field in 2006, we realised that, in another emerging field of toxicology, detailed work on the antioxidant/electrophile sensing pathway Keap1/Nrf2/ARE was being performed. We postulated that, based on their intrinsic electrophilicity, a large structural variety of skin sensitisers would activate this pathway. This was demonstrated in a preliminary pilot study with an existing, breast cancer-derived reporter cell line. Broader confirmation of this initial hypothesis then came from a multitude of genome-wide studies, in which sensitiser-induced changes to the transcriptome were investigated. The results showed that this regulatory pathway is indeed the most common regulatory pathway activated by sensitisers at the gene expression level, and the underlying event in keratinocytes has become formalised as a Key Event in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Adverse Outcome Pathway for sensitisation. These studies led to the development of the KeratinoSens® assay, which became the first cell-based in vitro test for skin sensitisation to be endorsed by a European Union Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) statement and an OECD Test Guideline. More recently, a number of studies have further developed this approach into 3-D skin models. Here, we review the underlying mechanism and the development of the KeratinoSens assay. We also present data on the stability of the assay over time, which is a key requirement for a cell-based biological assay to be endorsed in a regulatory context.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aLewis acids 3aadverse outcome pathways 3aantioxidants 3abioassays 3abreasts 3acell lines 3agene expression 3aguidelines 3akeratinocytes 3alaboratories 3areporter genes 3askin tests 3atoxicology 3atranscriptome1 aEmter, Roger0 tATLA.

MOFs were tested for adsorption capacity and uptake time at different concentrations. NU-1000 was shown to have the highest adsorption capacity, and fastest uptake rates for both selenate and selenite, of all zirconium-based MOFs studied here. Herein, the mechanism of selenate and selenite adsorption on NU-1000 is explored to determine the important features that make NU-1000 a superior adsorbent for this application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3acoordination polymers 3aselenates 3aselenites1 aKatz, Michael J.1 aWang, Timothy C.1 aPlatero-Prats, Ana E.1 aChapman, Karena W.1 aHupp, Joseph T.1 aFarha, Omar K.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7488-7494dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b039043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010000175300001600275520104900291592002801340650001401368650002001382650001301402650001301415650001501428650002601443650002301469650001601492650001301508653001401521653001401535653001301549653001201562653001301574653001301587700002301600700001901623773011501642856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60543910820221118071856.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054391082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasquez, Daniel E.10aStrain diversity plays no major role in the varying efficacy of rotavirus vaccines: An overview  ap. 561-571.  aWhile a monovalent Rotarix® [RV1] and a pentavalent RotaTeq® [RV5] have been extensively tested and found generally safe and equally efficacious in clinical trials, the question still lingers about the evolving diversity of circulating rotavirus strains over time and their relationship with protective immunity induced by rotavirus vaccines. We reviewed data from clinical trials and observational studies that assessed the efficacy or field effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines against different rotavirus strains worldwide. RV1 provided broad clinical efficacy and field effectiveness against severe diarrhea due to all major circulating strains, including the homotypic G1P[8] and the fully heterotypic G2P[4] strains. Similarly, RV5 provided broad efficacy and effectiveness against RV5 and non-RV5 strains throughout different locations. Rotavirus vaccination provides broad heterotypic protection; however continuing surveillance is needed to track the change of circulating strains and monitor the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aclinical trials 3adiarrhea 3aimmunity 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3astrain differences 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aRotavirus 0aGenotypes 0aVaccines 0aStrains 0aDiarrhea 0aEfficacy1 aParashar, Umesh D.1 aJiang, Baoming0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.561-571dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245016400175300001500339500001500354520112900369592002801498650001201526650001201538650001801550650002001568650001401588650000901602650001101611650001001622650001401632650001301646650001001659650002701669653000801696653001701704653000801721653002701729653002301756653001001779653000801789653000701797653000801804653000801812653001301820653002301833700003101856700003001887773011701917856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60113609920221120145605.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011360992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Lara, Silverio10aComparison of the processing and quality of tortillas produced from larger grain borer Prostephanus truncatus (Horn.) resistant and susceptible maize genotypes  ap. 99-105.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this research was to compare the processing and quality of tortillas produced from two kinds of larger grain borer (LGB) Prostephanus truncatus (Horn.) damaged kernels: resistant (IRM) and susceptible (ISM) genotypes. The damaged LGB kernels had significant lower test weight, 1000 kernel weigh and density. The ISM kernels were more negatively affected by insects compared with the IRM counterpart. A significant reduction of 5% in starch was observed in IRM kernels but not in ISM counterparts. Flour acidity and protein increased 8-fold and 5%, respectively parallel to an augmentation of weight grain losses whereas the crude fat content significantly reduced by 29%. Insect damage enhanced the penetration of the hot lime solution into the starchy endosperm. Insect infested kernels which lost 10% and 20% of their weight required 34% and 42% less lime-cooking time compared to sound kernels. The 10% and 20% insect-damaged kernels lost 15 and 23% of their solids during storage and tortilla processing, respectively. Finally, LGB damaged kernels reduced substantially the tortilla quality in terms of color.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsects 3aacidity 3alipid content 3astored products 3atortillas 3acorn 3astarch 3aflour 3aendosperm 3agenotype 3acolor 3aProstephanus truncatus 0aDML 0aLime-cooking 0aIRM 0aInsect-resistant maize 0aPostharvest losses 0aseeds 0aLGB 0aRH 0aISM 0aGWL 0aTortilla 0aLarger grain borer1 aChuck-Hernández, Cristina1 aSerna-Saldivar, Sergio O.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.99-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245020000165300001400365520138700379592002801766650001901794650001901813650002201832650001101854650002401865650001701889650001301906653001801919653002001937653001801957653002501975653001902000700001302019700001702032700001802049700001802067700001602085700001702101700001702118700001602135700002102151773013602172856008302308852000902391655001202400IND60733286020221122025251.0210428e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seul-Gi10aDevelopment and validation of dual-cardiotoxicity evaluation method based on analysis of field potential and contractile force of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes / multielectrode assay platform  ap. 67-73.  aA recent in vitro cardiovascular safety pharmacology test uses cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to overcome the limitations of the classical test systems, such as species differences and local channel analysis. The Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) is a new proarrhythmia screening paradigm proposed by a CiPA steering expert group, which essentially requires iPSCs derived cardiomyocyte-based electrophysiological evaluation technology. Moreover, the measurement of the contractile force is also emerging as an important parameter to recapitulate non-proarrhythmic cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we constructed an multielectrode assay (MEA) evaluation method that can measure the electrophysiological changes with 6 reference drugs in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the electrophysiological were changed in accordance with the mechanism of action of the drugs. Furthermore, based on the multi-probe impedance, we confirmed the decrease in contractile force due to treatment with drugs, and developed a platform to evaluate cardiotoxicity according to drugs along with field potential changes. Our excitation–contraction coupling cardiotoxicity assessment is considered to be more supportive in cardiac safety studies on pharmacologic sensitivity by complementing each assessment parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiotoxicity 3aelectrophysiology 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3apharmacology 3aresearch 0aCardiomyocyte 0aField potential 0aContractility 0aMultielectrode assay 0aCardiotoxicity1 aKim, Jin1 aOh, Min-Seok1 aRyu, Bokyeong1 aKang, Kyu-Ree1 aBaek, Jieun1 aLee, Jin-Moo1 aChoi, Sun-Ok1 aKim, C-Yoon1 aChung, Hyung Min0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 28, v. 555 p.67-73dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009900160500002200259520129900281592002801580650002501608650001601633650001901649650001901668650002001687650003801707650002001745650004101765650001201806650001501818650002601833650001801859650001501877653001601892653001101908653002401919653002001943653002201963700001801985700001702003700002002020700001902040700001802059700001502077700001802092700001402110700001702124773006802141856008102209852000902290655001202299IND60558337220221116231318.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lin10aDevelopment of an indirect ELISA for the determination of ethyl carbamate in Chinese rice wine  aPre-press version  aThe widespread occurrence of ethyl carbamate (EC, 89.09 Da), a group 2A carcinogen, in fermented foods and alcoholic beverages has raised worldwide public health concern. Immunoassay for EC is unavailable due to the simple and small structure of EC. In this work, an initial attempt to produce antibody specific for EC, by using 4-((ethoxycarbonyl)amino)butanoic acid as hapten, was made but failed. However, since EC can easily react with 9-xanthydrol to form xanthyl ethyl carbamate (XEC), two haptens based on XEC structure were designed and synthesized. Polyclonal antibody against XEC, instead of EC was obtained and then used to develop a competitive indirect ELISA for EC via a pre-analysis derivatization. After optimization, the ciELISA was applied in analyzing Chinese rice wine with detection limit of 166 μg/L, and negligible cross-reactivity with EC analogs. Recoveries of EC in fortified samples were from 84.4% to 100.9%, with coefficients of variation below 10%. Results for analysis of real samples by the ci-ELISA correlated well with that by reference method GC-MS, suggesting the good accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed method. This is the first report of an immunoassay capable of detecting EC, which is suitable for monitoring EC in a large amount of samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarcinogens 3across reaction 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethyl carbamate 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahaptens 3amonitoring 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apublic health 3arice wines 0aImmunoassay 0aHapten 0aPolyclonal antibody 0aEthyl carbamate 0aChinese rice wine1 aLei, Hong-Tao1 aYang, Jin-Yi1 aLiu, Gong-Liang1 aSun, Yuan-Ming1 aBai, Wei-Dong1 aWang, Hong1 aShen, Yu-Dong1 aChen, Sui1 aXu, Zhen-Lin0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015400173300001600327520161900343592002801962650002701990650002502017650001502042650003802057650002402095650001102119650001302130650003102143650001702174650001802191650001302209650001202222650001602234650001702250650001702267650002202284650002402306650003002330650001802360650003202378700002002410700001902430700002102449700002302470700002002493700002302513773012402536856008402660852000902744655001202753IND60099602820221122230857.0141105e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholas, Sally A.10aDysfunctional mitochondria contain endogenous high-affinity human Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands and induce TLR4-mediated inflammatory reactions  ap. 674-681.  aMitochondria, known to share many common features with prokaryotic cells, accumulate several endogenous ligands of the pattern-recognition Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), such as the heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 and 60. TLR4 specifically recognises and responds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and participates in both autoimmune reactions and tissue regeneration due to its ability to recognise endogenous ligands. In the present study we show that mitochondria extracts obtained from hydrogen peroxide-dysfunctionalised cells induce a pro-inflammatory response in human THP-1 myeloid leukaemia cells. This inflammatory response was similar to that caused by LPS and much stronger than that induced by the extracts of normal mitochondria. Such reactions include activation of stress-adaptation hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and expression/release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Pre-treatment of THP-1 myeloid macrophages with TLR4-neutralising antibody before exposure to mitochondria extracts or LPS attenuated the inflammatory responses. Signalling pathways recruited by TLR4 in response to LPS and mitochondria-derived ligands were found to be the same. An in vitro ELISA-based TLR4-ligand binding assay, in which the ligand-binding domain of human TLR4 was immobilised, showed that mitochondria extracts contain endogenous TLR4 ligands. These results were verified in surface plasmon resonance experiments in which the affinity of the ligands derived from dysfunctional mitochondria was comparable with that of LPS and was much higher than that observed for normal mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aheat shock proteins 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aleukemia 3aligands 3amacrophages 3amitochondria 3apretreatment 3aprokaryotic cells 3asignal transduction 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atissue repair 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aCoughlan, Karen1 aYasinska, Inna1 aLall, Gurprit S.1 aGibbs, Bernhard F.1 aCalzolai, Luigi1 aSumbayev, Vadim V.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.674-681dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001800200245011000218300001600328520102000344592002801364650001601392650002401408650003101432650001701463650001201480650002301492650000901515650002301524650001301547650001201560650002401572650001601596650001101612650004301623650003801666650001501704650000901719650004801728650002401776650002401800700001601824700001301840773011601853852000901969856008301978655001202061IND8106184820221116232244.0190606e19810401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810618482DNAL7 a72781122pmid7 a10.1258/0023677817809590802doi4 a0023-6772(19810401)15:2L.125;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackbarth, H.10aStrain differences in kidney function of inbred rats: 1.

Significant environmental correlations could be calculated only between bodyweight and all other variables, so that for comparison between strains it seems better to correct renal functions for bodyweight than for kidney weight, which would increase the variation of glomerular filtration rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3agenetic correlation 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aheritability 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3arats 3astrain differences 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratory 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aGlomerular Filtration Ratexveterinary 2aKidneyxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aOrgan Size 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strainsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBaunack, E.1 aWinn, M.0 tLaboratory animals.g1981 Apr. 01, v. 15, no. 2 p.125-128dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677817809590803Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02760naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014200164300002000306520167500326592002802001650002502029650002102054650001202075650002302087650002302110650001002133650002202143700005302165773013902218856008002357852000902437655001202446IND60614635820221118155151.0181002e20180910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b067922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yunzhen10aCoupling Transport of Water and Ions through a Carbon Nanotube in a Pressure Difference: The Relation between Dynamics and Ion Structures  ap. 22178-22187.  aUnderstanding the coupling relation between water and ions in their transport through nanochannels is relevant to many physicochemical process and biological activities and should be the preliminary knowledge that nanofluidic devices depend on. This work is devoted to revealing the coupling transport relation between water and ions through a (10,10) carbon nanotube under the drive of pressure difference. By using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we compare different salts from monovalent to trivalent cations as well as the monovalent salt concentration. An interesting phenomenon is that the distinct cation valence will result in different channel blockage that ultimately leads to the dynamics bifurcation of water and ions. The strong coupling relation between water and ions can be uncovered by their dynamical similarity, such as the linear flux and power law translocation time behaviors with the change of pressure difference. Furthermore, with the increase of salt concentration, the dynamics of water and ions exhibit unique behaviors, such as the monotonous decrease of water flux, the maximum behavior of ion flux, as well as the translocation time increase for both of them. We also find that the ions can travel through the channel in distinct structures that depend on the ionic conditions, such as single, couple, triple, quadruple, and even more complex clusters. These ion structures provide a key to decipher the dynamical behaviors of water and ions. Our results provide essential information on the coupling relation between water and ions, and the revealed connection between dynamics and ion structures is promising for future study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acarbon nanotubes 3acations 3amolecular dynamics 3asalt concentration 3asalts 3asimulation models1 aSu, Jiaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9894-578X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 10, v. 122, no. 38 p.22178-22187dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b067923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010600173300002200279520197800301592002802279650001102307650001302318650001402331650001202345650002202357650000902379650001102388650001002399650003602409650001302445650001102458650002402469650001402493650001002507651001002517653004202527653001902569653001602588653001202604653002202616653002402638700002702662700001902689700001702708700001902725700002702744773011002771856008702881852000902968655001202977IND60552600520221122160754.0161021e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Rijen10aCraniometric analysis for estimation of stature in Nepalese population—A study on an autopsy sample  ap. 187.e1-187.e6.  aEstablishing the identity of the deceased becomes essential when highly decomposed bodies, mutilated body parts or skeletal remains are recovered from mass fatality sites. In these situations, estimation of stature along with other parameters such as age, sex and race/ethnicity becomes important to establish the biological profile of the deceased. Following the Maoist insurgency in Nepal, there have been numerous discoveries of unidentified human remains in mass graves or otherwise. No systemic studies and anthropological data on the Nepalese population however, is available posing problems in anthropologic evaluation of the remains. The sample of the present study consisted of 200 autopsied cases (148 males and 52 female adult cadavers). During the autopsy, the scalp was reflected after giving a coronal incision extending from one mastoid to the other exposing the cranium in each case. Maximum cranial length (MCL), maximum cranial breadth (MCB), bi-zygomatic breadth (BZB), minimum frontal breadth (MFB) and length of parietal chord (PC) were then measured. Stature was measured as the length of the body from head to heel in centimeters with the heel, buttocks, back of the shoulders and the head in contact with the autopsy table. Linear and stepwise multiple regression models were derived for estimation of stature from cranial measurements. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate regression models show statistically significant correlation between stature and the cranial measurements. The present study opines that the stature estimation from cranial dimensions using multivariate linear regression models is more accurate than those of the univariate and bivariate regression models. This study presents a rare data from Nepalese population that show typical Asian features and thus, is significant from anthropologic and genetic point of view. The study observations further contribute a baseline data bank for forensic pathologists and specialists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abuttocks 3adatabases 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ahead 3ahumans 3amales 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anecropsy 3aopines 3aregression analysis 3ashoulders 3askull 3aNepal 0aForensic anthropology population data 0aIdentification 0aCraniometry 0aStature 0aRegression models 0aNepalese population1 aShrestha, Pramod Kumar1 aWasti, Harihar1 aKadel, Tulsi1 aKanchan, Tanuj1 aDewett, Kewal Krishan,0 tForensic science international.g2015 Mar., v. 248 p.187.e1-187.e6dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010500163500001900268520140400287592002801691650002001719650001501739650001101754650002601765650001101791650001601802650001701818650001301835650001601848650001201864650001501876650001701891651001001908700002801918700002801946700002301974773012001997856007302117852000902190655001202199IND60711907620221118014528.0200928e20200912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071190762DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimaki, Haruyuki 10aOptimization of Irrigation and Leaching Depths Considering the Cost of Water Using WASH_1D/2D Models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOptimization of water use with consideration of salinity control is a crucial task for crop production. A new scheme, “optimized irrigation”, was recently presented to determine irrigation depth using WASH_1D/2D which are numerical simulation models of water flow and solute transport in soils and crop growth. In the scheme, irrigation depth is determined such that net income is maximized considering the price of water and weather forecasts. To evaluate whether the optimized irrigation is also able to restrict salinity stress and avoid salinization without any intentional leaching, we carried out a numerical experiment for winter wheat grown in northern Sudan under the following scenarios: (1) Available water in the root zone is refilled using freshwater (0.17 g/L of NaCl) at every five days; (2) available water in the root zone is refilled using saline water (1.7 g/L) at every five days; (3) optimized irrigation using fresh water at 7-days interval; (4) optimized irrigation on a weekly basis using saline water; and (5) same as scenario 2, except for leaching is carried out at the middle of the growing season and leaching depth is optimized such that net income is maximized. The results showed that the optimized irrigation scheme automatically instructs additional water required for leaching at each irrigation event and maximizes the net income even under saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afreshwater 3aincome 3airrigation management 3aprices 3arhizosphere 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asolutes 3awater flow 3awinter wheat 3aSudan1 aAbd El Baki, Hassan  M.1 aMohamad Mahdavi, Seyed 1 aEbrahimian, Hamed 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 12, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011000175300002200285520210200307592002802409650002102437650002202458650001302480650001702493650002202510650001602532650001202548653004202560653002602602653002802628653002802656653002802684653001902712700002602731700002302757700004302780700002102823773011002844856008702954852000903041655001203050IND60552600620221122193653.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGocha, Timothy P.10aTesting the applicability of six macroscopic skeletal aging techniques on a modern Southeast Asian sample  ap. 318.e1-318.e7.  aMost macroscopic skeletal aging techniques used by forensic anthropologists have been developed and tested only on reference material from western populations. This study examined the performance of six aging techniques on a known age sample of 88 Southeast Asian individuals. Methods examined included the Suchey-Brooks method of aging the symphyseal face of the os pubis (Brooks and Suchey, Hum. Evol. 5 (1990) 227), Buckberry and Chamberlain's (Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 119 (2002) 231), and Osborne et al.'s (J. Forensic Sci. 49 (2004) 1) revisions of the Lovejoy et al. (Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 68 (1985) 15) method of aging the auricular surface of the ilium, Iscan et al.'s (J. Forensic Sci. 29 (1984) 1094, J. Forensic Sci. 30 (1985) 853) method of aging the sternal end of the fourth rib, and Meindl and Lovejoy's (Am. J. Phys Anthropol. 68 (1985) 57) methods for aging both lateral-anterior and vault sutures on the cranium. The results of this study indicate that application of aging techniques commonly used in forensic anthropology to individuals identified as Asian, and more specifically Southeast Asian, should not be undertaken injudiciously. Of the six individual methods tested here, the Suchey–Brooks pubic symphysis aging method performs best, though average age estimates were still off by nearly 10 years or greater. Methods for aging the auricular surface perform next best, though the Osborne et al. method works better for individuals below 50 years and the Buckberry and Chamberlain method works better for those above 50 years. Methods for age estimation from the sternal ends of the fourth rib and vault and lateral-anterior cranial sutures perform poorly and are not recommended for use on remains of Southeast Asian ancestry. Combining age estimates from multiple indicators, specifically the pubic symphysis and one auricular surface method, was superior to individual methods. Data and a worked example are provided for calculating the conditional probability that an individual belongs to a particular age decade, though overall age estimates may still be broad.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoutheast Asians 3aage determination 3aancestry 3aanthropology 3aforensic sciences 3aprobability 3asutures 0aForensic anthropology population data 0aForensic anthropology 0aSkeletal age estimation 0aHuman aging variability 0aConditional probability 0aSoutheast Asia1 aIngvoldstad, Megan E.1 aKolatorowicz, Adam1 aCosgriff-Hernandez, Meghan-Tomasita J.1 aSciulli, Paul W.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.318.e1-318.e7dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014700163500001900310520197100329592002802300650001802328650001802346650001202364650001202376650002202388650002002410650001902430650000902449650001202458650001702470650001202487650001402499650002602513650001602539651001302555700001802568700002102586700002002607773012002627856007302747852000902820655001202829IND60711907720221118014522.0200928e20200912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071190772DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHrabovský, Andrej 14aThe Impacts of Vineyard Afforestation on Soil Properties, Water Repellency and Near-Saturated Infiltration in the Little Carpathians Mountains  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVineyards are a 7000-year-old land-use tradition and both management and abandonment have result in altered soil properties. These have a great effect on water resources and soil services, and this inspired our investigation into the effects of land-use and land-use change on soils in the Modra wine-growing region in South-western Slovakia. Ten topsoil samples were taken at each of the seven research sites (n = 70) on granite parent material in cultivated and afforested vineyards and original forest soils. Laboratory analyses included determination of soil texture, organic carbon content, soil pH, and water repellency. This was supplemented by infiltration measurements under near-saturated conditions at the vineyard and afforested study sites. Studied soils have a low clay content and a high proportion of sand. The vineyard soils have significantly higher pH than the forest and afforested soils because the naturally acidic soils have been limed. The forest and afforested soils have similar properties, with higher organic carbon content. This makes them strongly to extremely water repellent and contrasts sharply with the wettability of cultivated vineyard soils. One afforested site, however, was less acidic and therefore was considered transitional between forest and vineyard soils. Our infiltration measurements established the influence of soil water repellency on the infiltration process, and our results highlighted that the infiltration rate in the vineyard soils was significantly higher than in afforested soils. The infiltration rate also gradually increased over time in afforested soils due to decreasing water repellency. Physically impossible negative sorptivity values in afforested soils were noted because of changes in water repellency during the infiltration process. Finally, we conclude that soil afforestation results in increased soil water repellency and a subsequent reduction in the infiltration rate at the matrix scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aclay fraction 3aforests 3agranite 3ainfiltration rate 3aland use change 3aorganic carbon 3asand 3asoil pH 3asoil texture 3atopsoil 3avineyards 3awater repellent soils 3awettability 3aSlovakia1 aDlapa, Pavel 1 aCerdà, Artemio,1 aKollár, Jozef,0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 12, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03781naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245017000216300001600386520205700402592002802459650002302487650001602510650002802526650001402554650002802568650001502596650001402611650001402625650002402639650001702663650002502680650001102705653001502716653004202731653003602773653004702809700007402856700006902930700002602999700003203025700005603057773010403113856008503217852000903302655001203311IND60746121520221122043603.0211114e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074612152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen, Simon Hosbond1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4478-347610aSigns of dysphagia and associated outcomes regarding mortality, length of hospital stay and readmissions in acute geriatric patients: Observational prospective study  ap. 412-419.  aDysphagia is a prevalent disorder in acute geriatric patients. This observational prospective study aimed at investigating adverse clinical outcomes linked to signs of dysphagia, including mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, among patients aged ≥ 65 years at a Danish acute medical unit (AMU).Signs of dysphagia were assessed using bedside screening tools including the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), a 30 mL Water Swallowing Test (WST) and the Gugging Swallowing Screen tool (GUSS), as described in the preceding cross-sectional study. Data for the follow-up was twice retrieved from electronic medical charts 30 days and 90 days after the patients’ primary admission to the hospital. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests of independence and proportional hazards modelling.444 patients were recruited, 334 of whom completed the dysphagia screening with 144 (43.1 %) showing signs of dysphagia. Patients with signs of dysphagia, compared to those without, experienced higher mortality after 30 days (12.5 % vs. 1.6 %, p < 0.001) and 90 days (21.5 % vs. 5.8 %, p < 0.001), longer LOS (median [Q1; Q3]: 4 [2; 8] vs. 3 [1; 6] days, p = 0.004), more total hospital days (THD) during both the 30-day and 90-day follow-up (for 90d: median [Q1; Q3]: 6 [2.25; 12] vs. 4 [2; 9] days, p = 0.007), but no significant difference in frequency of readmissions. Multivariate proportional hazards modelling revealed signs of dysphagia, low performance status and high comorbidity to be independent risk factors for mortality. High comorbidity and low hemoglobin, but not signs of dysphagia, were revealed as independent risk factors for readmission.Dysphagia is a notable risk factor linked to increased mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS) for acute geriatric patients in general, not just those suffering from stroke, head and neck cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of systematic dysphagia screening within this population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3acomorbidity 3across-sectional studies 3adysphagia 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3ahemoglobin 3ahospitals 3amortality 3aprospective studies 3arisk factors 3astatistical analysis 3astroke 0aGeriatrics 0aGugging swallowing screen tool (GUSS) 0aEating assessment tool (EAT-10) 0aNutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS-2002)1 aRosenvinge, Pernille Mølgaard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3956-39571 aModlinski, Robert Mariusz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4755-02801 aOlesen, Maria Dissing1 aRasmussen, Henrik Højgaard1 aHolst, Mette1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7458-94580 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Oct., v. 45 p.412-419dElsevier LtdwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245009100184300001800275500001900293520126000312536010201572592002801674596001901702650002101721650001201742650001301754650002901767650002801796650002501824650001401849650001101863650001001874650001501884650002801899650001501927650001301942650001701955650001501972650001001987650002001997650001802017650002102035650001402056650001202070650001202082650000902094650001402103650001502117650001602132650002702148650000902175653002402184653002802208653001202236653002402248653001302272700001502285700001402300773013902314856008502453852000902538655001202547IND60722638920221123041806.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072263892DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18284562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHesam Shahrajabian, Mohamad,10aChemical components and pharmacological benefits of Basil (Ocimum basilicum): a review  ap. 1961-1970.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBasil (Ocimum basilicum) is one of the most important crops with essential oils as well as polyphenols, phenolics, flavonoids and phenolic acids.

To further investigate this phenomenon, we studied the (i) time course of the residual ratios of α-PHPP-HCl when a small amount (10μg) of α-PHPP-HCl was stored in glass vials in air at room temperature; (ii) identification of the decomposition products of α-PHPP-HCl; (iii) effect of air on the decomposition process; (iv) effect of the added amounts of α-PHPP-HCl on its decomposition; and (v) comparison of the stability between various cathinone derivatives and their decomposition products. The decomposition of α-PHPP-HCl occurred in air and increased with time. Two possible decomposition products, α-(2″-oxopyrrolidino)heptanophenone and α-PHPP-N-oxide, were identified. These products were formed by oxygen in air because the yield significantly decreased by storing them in a vacuum desiccator. With the decrease in the amount of α-PHPP-HCl, the residual ratios decreased and amount of the decomposition products increased. This indicates that the decomposition of α-PHPP-HCl occurred on the upper surface of the samples. The hydrochloride salts of other cathinone derivatives were also unstable in air, and the residual ratios observed were different depending on the compounds. The pyrrolidine-type cathinone derivatives afforded two types of decomposition products, which were presumed to be 2″-oxo and N-oxide derivatives, similar to α-PHPP-HCl. In contrast, secondary amine-type cathinone derivatives showed different decomposition patterns, possibly including the dealkylated derivative. These findings may be very useful for the future toxicological analysis of cathinone derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aglass 3aoxygen 3arefrigerators 3asalts 0aCathinone 0aα-Pyrrolidinoheptanophenone 0aOxidative decomposition 0aDealkylation1 aYamamuro, Tadashi1 aKuwayama, Kenji1 aKanamori, Tatsuyuki1 aIwata, Yuko T.1 aInoue, Hiroyuki0 tForensic science international.g2015 Mar., v. 248 p.48-54dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100007300188245011300261300001100374506007600385520177400461592002802235506003702263650001602300650002302316650001402339650001702353650002502370650002102395650001802416650003102434650001202465650000902477650001602486650000902502650001902511650001902530650001802549650000902567650001402576650001802590651001802608700002402626700002702650700002402677700002302701700002002724700002202744700003302766773012902799856008202928852000903010655001203019IND60633785820221207113803.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378582DNAL7 a308941702pmid7 aPMC64278632pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2478-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalpezzi-Marinho, Elena L.

In 2009, it was listed as one of the native medicinal herbal plants used in the Brazilian public health system. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, a recent clinical study has shown antinociceptive effects of S. chilensis, introducing a new potential medical use for this plant. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antinociceptive activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of Solidago chilensis (HESc) in rodent models of pain. METHODS: The dried plant extract was obtained from its aerial parts, maintained in ethanol (100 g/l) and filtered. Rats or mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of HESc (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) 30 min before being submitted to writhing, 0.2%-formaline or hot-plate tests or prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) administration in the hind paw. Mechanical hypernociception and motor impairment were evaluated by electronic von Frey and rota-rod, respectively. RESULTS: HESc dose-dependently inhibited abdominal contortions in the writhing test and attenuated phases I and II formalin-induced nociceptive behavior. Treatment with HESc also increased thermal threshold and decreased PGE₂-induced hypernociception without promoting motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, when systemically administered, HESc decreases nociception without inducing a sedative effect. Importantly, this effect was observed in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory models of pain and nociception, suggesting a specific non-inflammatory mechanism of HESc on pain. Our findings indicate that S. chilensis might be an important adjuvant in pain management.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicroglossa 3aSolidago chilensis 3aadjuvants 3aaerial parts 3aalternative medicine 3aanalgesic effect 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aethanol 3amice 3anociception 3apain 3aplant extracts 3aprostaglandins 3apublic health 3arats 3asedatives 3awrithing test 3aSouth America1 aMolska, Graziela R.1 aFreire, Lyvia I.

Low threshold at 2.2 mJ cm–² was obtained. Also, emission spectral tunability from 500 to 570 nm was demonstrated by synthesis the mixed halide perovskite MDs. The spatial effect of photoluminescence (PL) properties under one-photon and two-photon excitation were also studied by means of two-photon laser scanning microscope (TPLSM) and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. It was found that the band to band emission of near-surface regions and photocarriers’ diffusion from near-surface regions to interior regions is significant for one-photon excitation. By contrast, reabsorption of emission under two-photon excitation plays a major role in the emission properties of the MDs. These results will give a more comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear effect of CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ single crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectroscopy 0aamplified spontaneous emission 0aCH3NH3PbBr3 0aperovskite 0arecombination 0asolution processed1 aMao, Xin1 aYang, Songqiu1 aLi, Yajuan1 aWang, Yanqiu1 aWang, Meishan1 aDeng, Weiqiao1 aHan, Ke-Li,0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 30 p.19587-19592dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b042463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009000155300001800245520095700263592002801220650001201248650000901260650002701269650000901296650000901305650002101314650001701335650002301352650000701375651001001382700002901392700002301421700002501444700002501469700001701494773015001511856007401661852000901735655001201744IND60765507420221123003316.0220419e20090624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076550742DNAL7 a10.17221/941-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRevilla, I.10aChanges in Ewe’s Milk Composition in Organic<I> versus</I> Conventional Dairy Farms  ap.

Bulk tank ewe’s milk from flocks of two production systems (organic and conventional) all of them from the same geographical area (Zamora, Spain) were used to investigate changes in physico-chemical properties including the composition in fatty acids. The metal contents (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Se, Mo, Ba, As, Hg, Pb) and the presence of antibiotics and pesticides in the meat were also studied. The type of production system was seen to elicit a significant effect on pH, total acidity and on the fatty acid composition. Organic milk showed significantly higher values of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including CLA, while saturated fatty acids decreased. No residues of pesticides or antibiotics were found in any of the samples and regarding metal contents only Fe, Cu and Zn were detected and no differences were observed in their contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aewes 3afatty acid composition 3ameat 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk quality 3aorganic production 3apH 3aSpain1 aA Lurueña-Martínez, M.1 aA Blanco-Lopez, M.1 aViñuela-Serrano, J.1 aM Vivar-Quintana, A.1 aPalacios, C.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 27, no.

This study aimed at investigating in cats from southern Italy FeMV prevalence and risk factors for exposure to FeMV, including the relationship with CKD; sequencing amplicons and analyzing phylogeny of PCR positive samples. Blood serum, K₃EDTA blood and urine samples from 223 cats were investigated. Ten carcasses were also evaluated. FeMV RNA was detected in 2.4% (5/211) blood and 16.1% (36/223) urine samples. One carcass tested positive by qPCRFₑMV from kidney, urinary bladder, and submandibular lymph nodes. Antibodies against FeMV were detected in 14.5% (28/193) cats. We followed up 27 cats (13 FeMV positive cats) and documented in some cases urine shedding after up to 360 days. Older and foundling cats and cats living in rescue catteries, were more frequently infected with FeMV. A significant correlation between FeMV and higher serum creatinine values or low urine specific gravity was found. FeMV positivity was significantly associated with retroviral infection, and the presence of some clinical signs apart from CKD clinicopathological markers. Our study highlights the possibility of a link between FeMV exposure and CKD and a general impairment of feline health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline morbillivirus 3aRNA 3abladder 3ablood serum 3acats 3acreatinine 3aepidemiology 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3alymph 3aphylogeny 3aspecific gravity 3aurine 3aItaly1 aMasucci, Marisa 1 aDe Luca, Eliana 1 aAlibrandi, Angela 1 aDe Majo, Massimo 1 aBerjaoui, Shadia 1 aMartino, Camillo 1 aMangano, Cyndi 1 aLorusso, Alessio 1 aPennisi, Maria Grazia0 tViruses.g2021 July 25, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006100188245011000249300001100359506007600370520240300446592002802849506003702877650002502914650002902939650002502968650002702993650002403020650002303044650002103067650002003088650001603108650001603124650002003140700001603160700001503176773012903191856008203320852000903402655001203411IND60633785920221207110041.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378592DNAL7 a308941512pmid7 aPMC64278972pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2466-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Alastair C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4520-456012aA critical integrative review of complementary medicine education research: key issues and empirical gaps  ap. 73.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Complementary Medicine (CM) continues to thrive across many countries. Closely related to the continuing popularity of CM has been an increased number of enrolments at CM education institutions across the public and private tertiary sectors. Despite the popularity of CM across the globe and growth in CM education/education providers, to date, there has been no critical review of peer-reviewed research examining CM education undertaken. In direct response to this important gap, this paper reports the first critical review of contemporary literature examining CM education research. METHODS: A review was undertaken of research to identify empirical research papers reporting on CM education published between 2005 and 17. The search was conducted in May 2017 and included the search of PubMed and EBSCO (CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED) for search terms embracing CM and education. Identified studies were evaluated using the STROBE, SRQP and MMAT appraisal tools. RESULTS: From 9496 identified papers, 18 met the review inclusion criteria (English language, original empirical research data, reporting on the prevalence or nature of the education of CM practitioners), and highlighted four broad issues: CM education provision; the development of educational competencies to develop clinical skills and standards; the application of new educational theory, methods and technology in CM; and future challenges facing CM education. This critical integrative review highlights two key issues of interest and significance for CM educational institutions, CM regulators and researchers, and points to number of significant gaps in this area of research. There is very sporadic coverage of research in CM education. The clear absence of the robust and mature research regarding educational technology and e-learning taking place in medical and or allied health education research is notably absent within CM educational research. CONCLUSION: Despite the high levels of CM use in the community, and the thriving nature of CM educational institutions globally, the current evidence evaluating the procedures, effectiveness and outcomes of CM education remains limited on a number of fronts. There is an urgent need to establish a strategic research agenda around this important aspect of health care education with the overarching goal to ensure a well-educated and effective health care workforce.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3aeducational institutions 3aeducational research 3aeducational technology 3aelectronic learning 3aempirical research 3ahealth education 3ahealth services 3alabor force 3aresearchers 3atertiary sector1 aSteel, Amie1 aAdams, Jon0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.73-73dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2466-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011400163300001800277500001500295520153000310592002801840650001601868650001101884650001301895650002001908650002601928650001601954650001001970650001501980650001301995650001302008650001502021650001102036650002202047650002202069650002502091650001502116653002302131700002102154773012902175856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60617352420221121220307.0181025e20180614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735242DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00446c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurter, Jasmine S.12aA low-cost ambient desorption/ionization source for mass-spectrometry based on a dielectric barrier discharge  ap. 2701-2711.  a2019-12-06  aAn ambient ionization source for mass-spectrometry is described. It is based on a plasma generated in helium by a dielectric barrier discharge using two external electrodes arranged axially on a fused silica tube. The plasma is created with a sinusoidal voltage source having an amplitude of 7 kilovolts and a frequency of 27 kilohertz. The plasma cell as well as the excitation circuitry were designed with simplicity in mind and both can easily be duplicated. The plasma source was characterized in terms of electronic properties and temperatures by using optical emission spectroscopy. Bands of the nitrogen second positive system at 357 nm were used for determination of the vibrational and rotational temperatures by fitting simulated to the experimental spectra with the software package Specair. With an excitation voltage of 7 kilovolts and a flow rate of 50 mL min⁻¹, a vibrational temperature of approximately 5000 K and a rotational temperature of 300 K were determined. By using the Boltzmann plot method, the excitation temperature was determined to be around 2800 K. The performance of the ionization source was demonstrated by the qualitative analysis of various standards as well as of application examples of pharmaceutical, illegal drug and food samples. Quantitative analysis of solutions is also possible. Linear calibration curves were obtained for caffeine and nicotine in the range from 1 to 1500 μM and limits of detection of 0.8 μM and 0.4 μM were determined for the two compounds respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3asilica 3acaffeine 3adetection limit 3aquantitative analysis 3acalibration 3adrugs 3aionization 3anicotine 3anitrogen 3aelectrodes 3ahelium 3acomputer software 3amass spectrometry 3aqualitative analysis 3adesorption 0aelectric potential1 aHauser, Peter C.0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 June 14, v. 10, no. 23 p.2701-2711dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00446c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03974naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011700174300001200291520253700303592002802840650002202868650002202890650002002912650002002932650001002952650002202962650001102984650001802995650002603013650001503039650001203054650001603066651001203082653002203094653002403116653001903140653002403159653002003183653003203203700002103235700002303256700001703279773010003296856008703396852000903483655001203492IND60552600920221122193620.0161021e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaqué, Michèle10aEstablishment of developmental charts for the larvae of the blow fly Calliphora vicina using quantile regression  ap. 1-9.  aDevelopmental data of necrophagous blow fly species can be used to estimate a minimum postmortem interval (PMImin) in death investigations by estimating the age of larvae sampled from the cadaver. The most important parameter used in this age estimation is the increase in larval length during growth. Larval length can be compared to species-specific reference data to get an age estimate for the larval specimen. The exploration of this type of data and the use of an appropriate statistical method are the major challenges in evaluating forensic entomological data sets. In Europe, Calliphora vicina is one of the most dominant species with forensic entomological relevance. Despite its frequency and importance, there are currently no published developmental studies for German populations of this blow fly that can be referenced for larval age estimations. This is regrettable because the geographical origin of different populations may lead to phenotypic plasticity in the same species and population-specific growth patterns that differ from published data sets.To address this shortcoming, the objective of the present research was to generate growth data for C. vicina which can be used for age estimation in German casework.We present, for the first time, local developmental data for the larval stages of German C. vicina, reared at three constant temperatures (15, 20 and 25°C) and compare the results with published studies on C. vicina development from elsewhere. To analyse the development we chose a quantile mixed effects model because of its robustness and insensitivity towards outliers. Quantile regression was developed as an extension of the linear model to estimate rates of change in all parts of the distribution of a response variable and to discover more useful predictive relationships between variables. By applying a linear quantile mixed effect model, we estimated the 0.1 and 0.9 quantile functions of the larval age for each temperature. Graphically, these quantile functions act like reference bands and therefore, plots for larval stages 1–3 can be used to estimate the age of a larva. Nevertheless, the post-feeding stage still remains difficult to describe with linear models and need to be further investigated. A comparison of the results from this present study with the currently applied methods for age estimation of C. vicina still demonstrates the importance of collecting growth rates for local blow fly populations and of standardising experimental designs and statistical analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vicina 3aage determination 3acarrion insects 3adata collection 3adeath 3aforensic sciences 3alarvae 3alinear models 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprovenance 3arearing 3atemperature 3aGermany 0aCalliphora vicina 0aForensic entomology 0aAge estimation 0aPostmortem interval 0aReference bands 0aLinear quantile mixed model1 aFilmann, Natalie1 aVerhoff, Marcel A.1 aAmendt, Jens0 tForensic science international.g2015 Mar., v. 248 p.1-9dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010600159300002000265520134100285592002801626650002201654650001601676650002001692650001401712650002001726650002601746650001901772650001801791650001401809650001701823650001401840650001301854700001601867773012401883856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60637003220221119163640.0190413e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700322DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00818g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Kyung10aProperties of immature and mature dendritic cells: phenotype, morphology, phagocytosis, and migration  ap. 11230-11238.  aDendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play an important role in connecting the innate and adaptive immunity of the immune system. To mediate innate and adaptive immunity, DCs pass through two stages: immature and mature. The change of phenotype is closely associated with the morphological and functional characteristics of DCs. Understanding these properties of DCs is important in the context of recent efforts on the developments of biomaterials-based cancer vaccine. In this paper, the morphological and phenotypical status of DCs in both stages were compared, and their relationship to the phagocytic and migratory ability of the cells was studied using bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Immature DCs were of a circular shape and expressed low levels of costimulatory molecules, while mature DCs had longer dendrites and expressed high levels of costimulatory molecules. The phagocytic and migratory ability studied using the polymer bead uptake test and live imaging indicated that immature DCs have a pronounced phagocytic ability compared to mature DCs, while the mature DCs moves faster than immature DCs. These findings could be helpful for understanding the relationship between immature and mature DCs and analyzing initiation of the adaptive immune response by DCs in DC-mediated immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive immunity 3abone marrow 3acancer vaccines 3adendrites 3adendritic cells 3afunctional properties 3aimage analysis 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasms 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3apolymers1 aKim, Jaeyun0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 9, no. 20 p.11230-11238dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00818g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014000164300001600304506002800320520152400348592002801872506003701900650001901937650001701956650001001973650001101983650001501994650001102009650001102020650001302031650001602044650001302060650001602073650001002089651001102099653001602110653002302126700002002149700002702169700002202196700002502218700002102243700002302264773013502287856007802422852000902500655001202509IND60784746920221207105144.0160617e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474692DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha441102542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHORTI, Evangelia10aIrrigation and Leaf Removal Effects on Polyphenolic Content of Grapes and Wines Produced from cv. ‘Agiorgitiko’ (Vitis vinifera L.)  ap. 133-139.  aResource is Open Access  aVitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Agiorgitiko’ is one of the most important red grape varieties of Greece, cultivated almost exclusively in the region of Nemea in north-eastern Peloponnese. This work aimed to study the influence of some commonly applied viticultural practices on the polyphenolic composition of ‘Agiorgitiko’. Leaf removal at veraison, irrigation, and a combination of both, were applied and the phenolic content of the grapes and of the produced wines was compared. The results showed that leaf removal decreased berry size, enhanced total anthocyanin, total phenol and malvidin 3-O-monoglucoside accumulation in skins and increased the amount of extractable anthocyanins in the juice. The combination of irrigation and leaf removal caused a significant increase in total phenols in the skin and in the amount of extractable anthocyanins in juice. As far as the produced wines were concerned, color intensity, tannin content and total polyphenols were increased due to leaf removal. Both irrigation and leaf removal resulted in wines with the highest concentration of malvidin 3-O-monoglucoside, although neither practice resulted in any significant difference in anthocyanin concentration of the wines. Vines where only irrigation was applied produced berries with reduced extractable anthocyanins, increased seed total phenols and lower wine total tannins. The study showed that increasing cluster sun exposure of ‘Agiorgitiko’ vines may be, overall, beneficial to the quality of the produced wine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3agrapes 3airrigation 3ajuices 3aleaves 3amalvidin 3apolyphenols 3aripening 3aviticulture 3awines 3aGreece 0adefoliation 0aphenolic compounds1 aKYRALEOU, Maria1 aKALLITHRAKA, Stamatina1 aPAVLIDIS, Manolis1 aKOUNDOURAS, Stefanos1 aKANAKIS, Ioannis1 aKOTSERIDIS, Yorgos0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2016 June, v. 44, no. 1 p.133-139dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha441102543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014700164300002000311520147700331592002801808650001501836650002801851650001701879650001101896650001201907650002301919650001401942650002101956653002601977653003102003653002102034653002002055653003102075700001802106700001802124700001802142700001802160700001702178700001302195700001602208700001302224700001902237773012902256856007802385852000902463655001202472IND60534666520221123020605.0160803e20160803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053466652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b044112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wang-Chao10aSuperior Light-Harvesting Heteroleptic Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Electron-Donating Antennas for High Performance Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells  ap. 19410-19417.  aThree heteroleptic polypyridyl ruthenium complexes, RC-41, RC-42, and RC-43, with efficient electron-donating antennas in the ancillary ligands were designed, synthesized, and characterized as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cell. All the RC dye sensitizers showed remarkable light-harvesting capacity and broadened absorption range. Significantly, RC-43 obtained the lower energy metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band peaked at 557 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient of 27 400 M–¹ cm–¹. In conjunction with TiO₂ photoanode of submicrospheres and iodide-based electrolytes, the DSSCs sensitizing with the RC sensitizers, achieved impressively high short-circuit current density (19.04 mA cm–² for RC-41, 19.83 mA cm–² for RC-42, and 20.21 mA cm–² for RC-43) and power conversion efficiency (10.07% for RC-41, 10.52% for RC-42, and 10.78% for RC-43). The superior performances of RC dye sensitizers were attributed to the enhanced light-harvesting capacity and incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) caused by the introduction of electron-donating antennas in the ancillary ligands. The interfacial charge recombination/regeneration kinetics and electron lifetime were further evaluated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). These data decisively revealed the dependences on the photovoltaic performance of ruthenium sensitizers incorporating electron-donating antennas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aligands 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aruthenium 3atitanium dioxide 0aruthenium sensitizers 0aelectron-donating antennas 0alight-harvesting 0ahigh-efficiency 0adye-sensitized solar cells1 aKong, Fan-Tai1 aLi, Zhao-Qian1 aPan, Jia-Hong1 aLiu, Xue-Peng1 aGuo, Fu-Ling1 aZhou, Li1 aHuang, Yang1 aYu, Ting1 aDai, Song-Yuan0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 30 p.19410-19417dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b044113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245013600203300001800339506007600357520174100433592002802174506003702202650002502239650002502264650002002289650001402309650001302323650001302336650002102349650001402370650001002384650001302394650001602407650001902423650001302442650003402455650002002489653004102509653004002550653002302590653001802613653002602631700001902657700002002676700001802696700001202714700002302726700002602749700001902775700001802794773017302812856007902985852000903064655001203073IND60173622020221207125410.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12167801102doi7 aPMC36253452pmcid7 a234311872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTintor, Nico10aLayered pattern receptor signaling via ethylene and endogenous elicitor peptides during Arabidopsis immunity to bacterial infection  ap. 6211-6216.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecognition of molecular patterns characteristic of microbes or altered-self leads to immune activation in multicellular eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana , the leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinases FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) and EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) recognize bacterial flagellin and elongation factor EF-Tu (and their elicitor-active epitopes flg22 and elf18), respectively. Likewise, PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) and PEPR2 recognize the elicitor-active Pep epitopes conserved in Arabidopsis ELICITOR PEPTIDE PRECURSOR s (PROPEP s). Here we reveal that loss of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2), a master signaling regulator of the phytohormone ethylene (ET), lowers sensitivity to both elf18 and flg22 in different defense-related outputs. Remarkably, in contrast to a large decrease in FLS2 expression, EFR expression and receptor accumulation remain unaffected in ein2 plants. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling has uncovered an inventory of EIN2-dependent and EFR-regulated genes. This dataset highlights important aspects of how ET modulates EFR-triggered immunity: the potentiation of salicylate-based immunity and the repression of a jasmonate-related branch. EFR requires ET signaling components for PROPEP2 activation but not for PROPEP3 activation, pointing to both ET-dependent and -independent engagement of the PEPR pathway during EFR-triggered immunity. Moreover, PEPR activation compensates the ein2 defects for a subset of EFR-regulated genes. Accordingly, ein2 pepr1 pepr2 plants exhibit additive defects in EFR-triggered antibacterial immunity, compared with ein2 or pepr1 pepr2 plants. Our findings suggest that the PEPR pathway not only mediates ET signaling but also compensates for its absence in enhancing plant immunity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abacterial infections 3adata collection 3aelicitors 3aepitopes 3aethylene 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflagellin 3agenes 3aimmunity 3ainventories 3amicroorganisms 3apeptides 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3atranscriptomics 0amicrobe-associated molecular pattern 0adanger-associated molecular pattern 0adisease resistance 0aplant hormone 0adefense-related genes1 aRoss, Annegret1 aKanehara, Kazue1 aYamada, Kohji1 aFan, Li1 aKemmerling, Birgit1 aNürnberger, Thorsten1 aTsuda, Kenichi1 aSaijo, Yusuke0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.6211-6216dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12167801103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006100158300001800219520098200237592002801219650001001247650001401257650001001271650001401281650001601295650000901311650001901320650002101339650001301360650001601373651001901389700002001408700001901428700001901447700002001466700002201486700001701508773015001525856007401675852000901749655001201758IND60765507720221123003058.0220419e20090624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076550772DNAL7 a10.17221/944-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDračková, M.10aDetermination of Lactoferrin in Goat Milk by HPLC Method  ap.

It were established bulk tank samples of raw milk (<I>n</I> = 24) and pasteurised milk (<I>n</I>n = 27) that were collected during lactation. Lactoferrin contents were analysed by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with diode-array detector PDA 2996. Detection was carried out at the wavelength 205 nm. The average concentration of lactoferrin in goat milk was 120 ± 18 &mu;g/ml. The lactoferrin content was increasing within the lactation period in the ranges of 98 ± 170 &mu;g/ml in April to 149 ± 19 &mu;g/ml in November. The heat treatment (pasteurisation at 72°C for 20 s) resulted in no significant effect on the lactoferrin content. No statistically significant differences (<I>P</I> = 0.05) were found between the values of raw and pasteurised goat milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3agoat milk 3agoats 3alactation 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3apasteurization 3apasteurized milk 3araw milk 3awavelengths 3aCzech Republic1 aBorkovcová, I.1 aJanštová, B.1 aNaiserová, M.1 aPřidalová, H.1 aNavrátilová, P.1 aVorlová, L.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 27, no.

Q.10aEvaluation of Potato virus X mild mutants for cross protection against severe infection in China  ap. 36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cross protection is a promising alternative to control plant viral diseases. One critical factor limiting the application of cross protection is the availability of attenuated mutants or mild strains. Potato virus X (PVX) infects many crops and induces huge economic losses to agricultural production. However, researches on the variability and mechanism of PVX virulence are scarce. METHODS: The mutants were obtained by introducing mutations into the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of PVX via site-directed mutagenesis. Attenuated mutants were screen according to their symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The protection efficacy against severe infection were evaluated with interval of 5, 10 and 15 days. RESULTS: Among the 40 mutants obtained, four mutants carrying substitutions of either Glu⁴⁶, Asn⁸⁶³, Asn⁹⁶⁸ or Glu¹⁰⁰¹ to Ala in PVX RdRp showed drastically attenuated symptom, accompanying with reduced accumulation levels of coat protein, plus- and minus-sense RNAs. When the interval between protective and challenging inoculations was 15 days, mutant E1001A (with substitution of Glu¹⁰⁰¹ to Ala in RdRp) provided complete protection against severe infection in both Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato, while E46A (Glu⁴⁶ mutated to Ala) provided incomplete protection. To reduce the risk of reverse mutation, we constructed mutant dM which carries double mutations of both Glu⁴⁶ and Glu¹⁰⁰¹ to Ala in RdRp. The mutant dM could provide effective protection against severe PVX infection. CONCLUSION: Mutations of Glu⁴⁶, Asn⁸⁶³, Asn⁹⁶⁸ or Glu¹⁰⁰¹ to Ala in PVX RdRp significantly reduced the viral symptoms. Mutants E1001A and E46A could provide effective protection against wild type PVX in both Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato. These results provide theoretical and practical bases for the control of PVX via cross protection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31571895cNational Natural Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato virus X 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acoat proteins 3acrops 3across immunity 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3amutants 3arisk reduction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atomatoes 3aviral diseases of plants 3avirulence 3aChina1 aWang, Y.1 aLiu, J.1 aLan, Y.

This study aimed to determine the optimum harvest time for the goldenberry based on the calyx maturation stage and viability of stored seeds. The design was completely randomized a in factorial design (5 x 3), with three replications. The treatments consisted of a combination of five calyx maturation stages, assessed based on color (green, green-yellow, greenish-yellow, yellow, brownishyellow), and three types of packaging: Kraft paper bags, plastic bags, and glass. The seeds were removed from the fruit and stored at the same temperature and shade conditions for 120 days. Based on the results of the 21-day germination test, it is recommended that goldenberry seeds should be obtained from fruit with a green-yellow to brownish-yellow calyx. All the packaging types analyzed by this study are recommended for the storage of goldenberry seeds obtained from fruit with a green-yellow to brownish-yellow calyx for a 120-day storage period.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalyx 3acolor 3afruits 3agermination 3aglass 3aharvest date 3akraft paper 3astorage time 3atemperature 3aviability 0agermination speed. seed propagation. packaging.1 aSilva, Érica Duarte1 aOliosi, Gleison1 aAltoé, Jalille Amim1 aOliveira, Jeniffer Ribeiro de1 aSesquim, Larissa Andreata0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2020 Sept., v. 14, no. 0dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v14i0.62863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011500204300001600319520169100335592002802026650002502054650002402079650001802103650001302121650001102134650001102145650001002156650001502166650001602181650001302197650001202210650001302222651001002235653001402245653001702259653003102276653003402307653001102341700001802352700002102370700001702391700001402408700001902422773013902441856008202580852000902662655001202671IND60755465820221117222749.0211102e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546582DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853210003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinyanjui, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5887-980210aDistribution, abundance and natural enemies of the invasive tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) in Kenya  ap. 658-673.  aTuta absoluta (Meyrick) has become a serious menace to sustainable production of tomato in Kenya. A survey was conducted between April 2015 and June 2016 to determine its distribution, abundance, infestation, and damage levels on tomato, and associated natural enemies. Trap counts of T. absoluta moths were recorded in all surveyed 29 counties, which indicated its nationwide distribution irrespective of altitude. Tuta absoluta was present in both open fields and greenhouses. The highest moth/trap/day was 115.38 ± 15.90. Highest leaf infestation was 92.22% and the highest number of mines and larvae per leaf were 3.71 ± 0.28 and 2.16 ± 0.45, respectively. Trap captures in terms of moth/trap/day were linearly and positively related to leaf infestations in open fields (R² = 0.81) and greenhouses (R² = 0.61). Highest fruits’ infestation and damage were 60.00 and 59.61%, respectively, while the highest number of mines per fruit was 7.50 ± 0.50. Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) and Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) were identified as predators of T. absoluta larvae. Nine species of larval parasitoids were recovered from infested foliage, with a combined parasitism of 7.26 ± 0.65%. Hockeria species was the most dominant (31.25%) and accounted for 12.88 ± 1.47% parasitism. Two species of larval parasitoids, Hockeria and Necremnus were obtained from sentinel plants with an average parasitism of 1.13 ± 0.25. The overall abundance and parasitism rates of recovered natural enemies were low to effectively control the field populations of T. absoluta. These findings form the basis of researching and developing effective and sustainable management strategies for the pest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrolophus pygmaeus 3aNesidiocoris tenuis 3aTuta absoluta 3aaltitude 3afruits 3aleaves 3amoths 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aresearch 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3aKenya 0aAbundance 0adistribution 0aindigenous natural enemies 0ainfestation and damage levels 0atomato1 aKhamis, F.

In this study, we monitored the interannual archaeal community composition of abundant and rare biospheres in northwestern Mediterranean Sea surface waters by pyrosequencing 16S rDNA and rRNA. A detailed analysis of the rare biosphere structure showed that the rare archaeal community was composed of three distinct fractions. One contained the rare Archaea that became abundant at different times within the same ecosystem; these cells were typically not dormant, and we hypothesize that they represent a local seed bank that is specific and essential for ecosystem functioning through cycling seasonal environmental conditions. The second fraction contained cells that were uncommon in public databases and not active, consisting of aliens to the studied ecosystem and representing a nonlocal seed bank of potential colonizers. The third fraction contained Archaea that were always rare but actively growing; their affiliation and seasonal dynamics were similar to the abundant microbes and could not be considered a seed bank. We also showed that the major archaeal groups, Thaumarchaeota marine group I and Euryarchaeota group II.B in winter and Euryarchaeota group II.A in summer, contained different ecotypes with varying activities. Our findings suggest that archaeal diversity could be associated with distinct metabolisms or life strategies, and that the rare archaeal biosphere is composed of a complex assortment of organisms with distinct histories that affect their potential for growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuryarchaeota 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiosphere 3acoastal water 3acommunity structure 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3amicroorganisms 3aplankton 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asummer 3asurface water 3awinter 3aMediterranean Sea 0aong-term dynamic 0adormancy 0ataxonomic diversity 0amicrobial observatory 0aSomlit1 aTaib, Najwa1 aDebroas, Didier1 aDomaizon, Isabelle1 aJouan Dufournel, Isabelle1 aBronner, Gisèle1 aSalter, Ian1 aAgogué, Hélène1 aMary, Isabelle1 aGaland, Pierre E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.6004-6009dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12168631103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01624naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005800164300001600222520028600238536017300524592002800697596005400725596006200779650001900841650004400860650002200904650001800926653001400944653002500958653001100983700001700994700001601011773014101027856008501168852000901253655001201262IND60654671820221120075435.0190726e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467182DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2018.15418932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Gang10aTwo new iridal-type triterpenoids from Iris forrestii  ap. 881-886.  aTwo new iridal-type triterpenoids, named forrestins A and B (1 and 2), were isolated from Iris forrestii Dykes by comprehensive chromatographic methods.

For the ADH method we further applied five reference datasets for the development time of Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) from 5 different countries and our results confirmed the following: (1) Reference data for blowfly development that has not been sampled using a local blowfly colony should not, in most circumstances, be used in estimating a PMI in real cases; and (2) The new method ExLAC might be a potential alternative to the ADH method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vicina 3acrime 3adata collection 3adeath 3aforensic entomology 3amathematical models 0aEstimating time since death 0aForensic entomology 0aComputational model ExLAC 0aADH-method 0aCalliphora vicina1 aMadea, B.q(Burkhard),0 tForensic science international.g2015 Mar., v. 248 p.78-81dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06099naa a2202077 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100000700143245007000150300001800220520084800238592002801086650002001114650002001134650001501154700002101169700001601190700001501206700001701221700001501238700002001253700001701273700001601290700001901306700002101325700001701346700001801363700002001381700001601401700001401417700001601431700001401447700002101461700001901482700001501501700001901516700001501535700001601550700001601566700001801582700001801600700001501618700001601633700001401649700001601663700002101679700002001700700001701720700001801737700002501755700001601780700001701796700001501813700001501828700002001843700001601863700001701879700001901896700001701915700001501932700001701947700001401964700001601978700001901994700001602013700001602029700001802045700001702063700001802080700001702098700001602115700001902131700001902150700001702169700001802186700001602204700001602220700001902236700002102255700001902276700001902295700001702314700001702331700001602348700001402364700001302378700002002391700001502411700001302426700001402439700001802453700001602471700002402487700001402511700001602525700002202541700001602563700001602579700002202595700001602617700002102633700001902654700002102673700001502694700001902709700001402728700001902742700001702761700002202778700001502800700001702815700001702832700001802849700001302867700001502880700001602895700001502911700001602926700001402942700001602956700001502972700002202987700002103009700001403030700001803044700001503062700001803077700001503095700001703110700001503127700001703142700001303159700001803172700001303190700002603203700002503229700001403254700001603268700001903284700001703303700001703320700001703337700002003354700001703374700001803391700001503409700001803424700001803442700001703460700002003477700002003497700001603517700001803533700001403551700001403565700002203579700001803601700001803619700001503637700001703652700001603669700001503685700001703700700001303717700001603730700001303746700001603759700001503775773012703790856008303917852000904000655001204009IND6013631420221120165306.0170526e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601363142DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12071412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aFermi Detection of a Luminous γ-Ray Pulsar in a Globular Cluster  ap. 1107-1110.  aWe report on the Fermi Large Area Telescope’s detection of γ-ray (>100 mega–electron volts) pulsations from pulsar J1823–3021A in the globular cluster NGC 6624 with high significance (∼7 σ). Its γ-ray luminosity, Lγ = (8.4 ± 1.6) x 1034 ergs per second, is the highest observed for any millisecond pulsar (MSP) to date, and it accounts for most of the cluster emission. The nondetection of the cluster in the off-pulse phase implies that it contains <32 γ-ray MSPs, not ∼100 as previously estimated. The γ-ray luminosity indicates that the unusually large rate of change of its period is caused by its intrinsic spin-down. This implies that J1823–3021A has the largest magnetic field and is the youngest MSP ever detected and that such anomalous objects might be forming at rates comparable to those of the more normal MSPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3agamma radiation 3amagnetic fields 3atelescopes1 aFreire, P.

In this work, for the first time, lotus-seedpod-bioinspired 3D superhydrophobic diatomite porous ceramics with good mechanical strength and thermal stability were fabricated, using inexpensive porous diatomite as a substrate, and graphene/carbon nanobelts as modifiers. Thanks to the presence of graphene coating and in situ formed carbon nanobelts, the surface energy of the final porous ceramics was reduced and their surface roughness increased, conferring superhydrophobicity on them. As-prepared porous ceramics demonstrated 3–30 times higher adsorption capacity in oil/water separation than their conventional inorganic sorbent materials, and had compressive strength 70–270 times higher than that of a sponge/graphene-based sorbent material. The present work could additionally offer a new strategy for the treatment/recycle of waste plastics, the so-called “white pollution”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aceramics 3acoatings 3acompression strength 3adiatomaceous earth 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aplastics 3aremediation 3asorbents 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface roughness 3athermal stability 3awastes 0ahierarchical pore ceramic 0agraphene 0acarbon nanobelt 0asuperhydrophobicity 0aoil/water separation1 aHan, Lei1 aZheng, Yangfan1 aGuan, Yunpeng1 aZhang, Haijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9546-85241 aGe, Shengtao1 aWang, Huifang1 aJia, Quanli1 aZhang, Yuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4698-56451 aZhang, Shaowei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 23, v. 10, no. 32 p.27416-27423dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b058783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245015700214500002200371520157500393592002801968650001701996650003002013650001602043650001402059650001502073650001902088650001802107651001102125653003002136653003102166653002202197653002002219653002802239700002202267773005602289856008902345852000902434655001202443IND60570170820221122232834.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057017082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalina, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5788-256410aTemporal and spatial variation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contamination in environmental compartments of highly polluted area in Central Russia  aPre-press version  aThis study highlights the fact that serious contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) still exists in Serpukhov City (Russia). The research help to determine the temporal (16- and 24-year periods) and spatial PCBs distribution in the environmental compartments of the studied region. Samples of soil, sediments, water and plants were analysed in order to establish their contamination levels. The most recent data on the Serpukhov City's soil contamination showed that the PCBs concentrations varies from 0.0009 to 1169 mg/kg depending on the sampling point and the distance from the pollution source. The temporal trends of the contamination distribution with the soil depth showed contamination migration in the upper soil layers of the highly polluted site. The high level of water pollution (11.5 μg/L) in the proximity to the contamination source and the sediments contamination (0.098–119 mg/kg) were determined, as well as the water migration pathways of the PCBs that were prevalent in the studied region. The PCB congener group (by the level of chlorination) analysis showed that heptachlorinated biphenyls were only found in the soils in close proximity to the contamination place, while biphenyls with Cl ≤ 6 were found in the soil samples downstream of the condenser plant and with Cl ≤ 5 in the soil samples upstream of the plant. The plant uptake of PCBs, even on the extremely contaminated site, was shown. In turn, this research present new knowledge necessary for the development of a contaminated territory remediation strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorination 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aremediation 3asediments 3asoil depth 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3aRussia 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aEnvironmental distribution 0aMigration pathway 0aCondenser plant 0aEnvironmental pollution1 aMazlova, Elena A.0 tChemosphere.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245005000164300002000214520085900234592002801093650002201121650001801143650001601161650001701177700002001194700002001214700002501234700001601259700001801275700001801293700002401311700002201335773011301357856007501470852000901545655001201554IND60529147620221118154926.0160717e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052914762DNAL7 a10.1021/ac302748b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Livera, Alysha M.10aNormalizing and Integrating Metabolomics Data  ap. 10768-10776.  aMetabolomics research often requires the use of multiple analytical platforms, batches of samples, and laboratories, any of which can introduce a component of unwanted variation. In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3adata analysis 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics1 aDias, Daniel A.1 aDesouza, David,1 aRupasinghe, Thusitha1 aPyke, James1 aTull, Dedreia1 aRoessner, Ute1 aMcConville, Malcolm1 aSpeed, Terence

L.10aRelating Molecular Morphology to Charge Mobility in Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers  ap. 4240-4250.  aThe molecular-level origins of the effects of annealing temperature and molecular weight on hole mobility in P3HT are elucidated using coarse-grained molecular dynamics, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo charge-transport simulations on a variety of realistic thin-film morphologies. The zero-field hole mobility is shown to increase as the annealing temperature or average molecular weights of samples are increased, in accordance with experimental results. Crystal structure analysis shows that the annealing temperature dependence of the mobility can be attributed to the size and structural order of the crystallites in both the chain-backbone and π-stacking directions. However, the molecular weight dependence of the mobility cannot be rationalized in the same way. Longer chains are shown to belong to more crystallites in the morphology, suggesting that the crystals become better connected as the molecular weight of the sample increases. We show that engineering samples to have an increased fraction of these long “tie chains” within the morphology improves mobility. As such, we propose that crystal connectivity in the noncrystalline portions of the morphology is similarly important in determining carrier mobility as crystallite size and order for semicrystalline conjugated polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3aengineering 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aHuang, D.

Offsets aim to balance residual losses of biodiversity caused by development in one location with commensurate gains at another. Although ecological challenges to achieve NNL are debated, the associated gains and losses for local stakeholders have received less attention. International best practice calls for offsets to make people no worse off than before implementation of the project, but there is a lack of clarity concerning how to achieve this with regard to people's use and nonuse values for biodiversity, especially given the inevitable trade‐offs when compensating biodiversity losses with gains elsewhere. This is particularly challenging for countries where poor people depend on natural resources. Badly planned offsets can exacerbate poverty, and development and offset impacts can vary across spatial‐temporal scales and by location, gender, and livelihood. We conceptualize the no‐worse‐off principle in the context of NNL of biodiversity, by exploring for whom and how the principle can be achieved. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of biodiversity‐related social impacts of a development and its associated offset can lead to social inequity and negatively impact people's well‐being. The level of aggregation (regional, village, interest group, household, and individual) at which these social impacts are measured and balanced can again exacerbate inequity in a system. We propose that a determination that people are no worse off, and preferably better off, after a development and biodiversity offset project than they were before the project should be based on the perceptions of project‐affected people (assessed at an appropriate level of aggregation); that their well‐being associated with biodiversity losses and gains should be at least as good as it was before the project; and that this level of well‐being should be maintained throughout the project life cycle. Employing this principle could help ensure people are no worse off as a result of interventions to achieve biodiversity NNL.  aPublisher supplied data  a23‐019cUnited Kingdom Government's Darwin Initiative 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3agender 3alivelihood 3apoverty 3asocial impact 3astakeholders 3avillages1 aBull, Joseph W.1 aBaker, Julia1 aMilner‐Gulland, E.J.0 tConservation biology.g2019 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.76-87dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.131843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010000163300001800263520148300281592002801764650002401792650001901816650001801835650001101853650001401864650002301878650001501901700001401916700001401930773012601944856008202070852000902152655001202161IND60567564620221116192501.0170425e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056756462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b115222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xikai10aCurrent Rectification for Transport of Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids through Conical Nanopores  ap. 4629-4637.  aWe studied the transport of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) through charged conical nanopores using a Landau–Ginzburg-type continuum model (Bazant et al. Phys. Rev. Lett 2011, 106, 046102) that takes steric effect and strong ion–ion correlations into account. When the surface charge is uniform on the pore wall, weak current rectification is observed. When the charge density near the pore base is removed, the ionic current is greatly suppressed under negative bias voltage while nearly unchanged under positive bias voltage, thereby leading to enhanced current rectification. These predictions agree qualitatively with prior experimental observations, and we elucidated them by analyzing the different components of the ionic current and the structural changes of electrical double layers (EDLs) at the pore tip under different bias voltages and surface charge patterns. These analyses reveal that the different modifications of the EDL structure near the pore tip by the positive and negative bias voltages cause the current rectification and the observed dependence on the distribution of surface charge on the pore wall. The fact that the current rectification phenomena are captured qualitatively by the simple model originally developed for describing EDLs at equilibrium conditions suggests that this model may be promising for understanding the ionic transport under nonequilibrium conditions when the EDL structure is strongly perturbed by external fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectric power 3aionic liquids 3amodels 3ananopores 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction1 aLiu, Ying1 aQiao, Rui0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 120, no. 8 p.4629-4637dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b115223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011300174300001800287520175900305592002802064650001302092650002302105650001302128650001202141650001002153650002502163650002002188650002002208650001602228650003002244650001702274650000902291650000902300650002202309650001402331650001102345650001302356650000702369650001402376650001302390650001802403653001202421653001202433653002002445653002002465653002202485653001102507700001802518700002602536700001902562773012402581856008502705852000902790655001202799IND60558100120221120123038.0161108e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055810012DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2016.12125552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovacevik, Biljana10aGroundwater quality in alluvial and prolluvial areas under the influence of irrigated agriculture activities  ap. 1197-1204.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the groundwater pollution from alluvial aquifers lying under surface agriculture activities in two geologically different areas: alluvial and prolluvial. The groundwater in investigated areas is neutral to alkaline (pH 7.05–8.45), and the major dissolved ions are bicarbonate and calcium. Groundwater samples from the alluvial area are characterized by nitrate concentration above the national maximum concentration limit (MCL) at 20.5% of samples [mean value (Me) 6.31 mg/L], arsenic concentrations greater than national MCL at 35.6% of investigated samples (Me 12.12 µg/L) and elevated concentrations of iron (Me 202.37 µg/L) and manganese (Me 355.22 µg/L) at 22.7% and 81% of investigated samples, respectively. Groundwater samples from the prolluvial area did not show significantly elevated concentrations of heavy metals, but the concentration of nitrate was considerably higher (Me 65.06 mg/L). Factor analysis positively correlates As with Mn and Fe, suggesting its natural origin. Nitrate was found in positive correlation with SO ₄²⁻ and Ni but in negative with NH ₄⁺, suggesting its anthropogenic origin and the relationship of these ions in the process of denitrification. The t -test analysis showed a significant difference between nitrate pollution of groundwater from alluvial and prolluvial areas. According to the chemical composition of groundwater, the process of denitrification is considered to be the main reason for the reduced presence of nitrate in the groundwater lying under alluvial deposits represented by chalk and sandstones. Denitrification in groundwater lying under prolluvial deposits represented by magmatic and metamorphic rock formations was not observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aammonium compounds 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3achalk 3achemical composition 3adenitrification 3afactor analysis 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3aions 3airon 3airrigated farming 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrates 3apH 3asandstone 3asulfates 3awater quality 0aAquifer 0aarsenic 0adenitrification 0afactor analysis 0anitrate pollution 0at-test1 aBoev, Blažo,1 aPanova, Vesna Zajkova1 aMitrev, Saša,0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 Dec. 5, v. 51, no. 14 p.1197-1204dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2016.12125553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245011300205300002000318520165900338592002801997650001302025650002102038650001702059650003002076650001702106650001302123650002302136650001302159650002502172700006002197700002302257700001902280700002102299700001902320700002202339700002102361773013902382856008102521852000902602655001202611IND60752820020221122033935.0211007e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075282002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c042912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Toshiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1538-022410aSimulation Study of the Effects of Interfacial Bonds on Adhesion and Fracture Behavior of Epoxy Resin Layers  ap. 11044-11057.  aThe adhesion and fracture behavior of tetraglycidyl-4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (TGDDM)/4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (44DDS)–bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA)/44DDS layer interfaces were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, mainly focusing on the role of covalent and noncovalent interactions. To accurately investigate the bond dissociation processes, the force field parameters of several bond potentials of the epoxy resin polymers were optimized by density functional theory calculations. In the MD simulations under a tensile load, small voids gradually developed without covalent bond dissociation in the plateau region. In the final large strain region, the stress rapidly increased with bond breaking, leading to failure. When the chemical bonds across the interface between the two layers were removed, the stress–strain curve in the initial elastic region was almost the same as that with interfacial bonds. This showed that the nonbonded interactions governed adhesion strength in the initial elastic region. In contrast, the bonded interactions at interfaces played important roles in the hardening regions because the bonded interactions made the major contribution to the fracture energies. We also investigated the effect of the etherification reaction in cross-linking. It was found that the etherification reaction mainly contributed to the behavior in the late region with large strain. These simulation results revealed that the nonbonded interactions, especially, van der Waals interactions, are important factors for adhesion of the different polymer layers in the small strain region up to the yield point.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3achemical bonding 3acrosslinking 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3aepoxides 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3avan der Waals forces1 aShimoi, Yukihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8108-22441 aHasegawa, Kōichi,1 aTakagi, Kiyoka1 aYamazaki, Noriko1 aMatsuki, Takeo1 aHarada, Yoshihisa1 aOhkubo, Masataka0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 125, no. 39 p.11044-11057dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c042913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245008500197300001400282500002000296520192800316592002802244596006902272596010902341596001002450596002602460596002602486650001302512650001502525650000902540650001702549650002702566650001002593650002402603650001202627650001502639650001902654650001402673700003002687700003402717700002302751700002502774700002402799773011802823856007402941852000903015655001203024IND60627762420221120225246.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062776242DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.131882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenes, Luísa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7556-456210aEffects of howler monkey reintroduction on ecological interactions and processes  ap. 88-98.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRewilding has been an increasingly popular tool to restore plant–animal interactions and ecological processes impaired by defaunation. However, the reestablishment of such processes has seldom been assessed. We investigated the restoration of ecological interactions following the reintroduction of the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) to a defaunated Atlantic forest site. We expected the reintroduction to restore plant–animal interactions and interactions between howlers and dung beetles, which promote secondary seed dispersal. We estimated the number of interactions expected to be restored by the reintroduction to provide the baseline interaction richness that could be restored. We followed the reintroduced howler monkeys twice a week for 24 months (337 hours total) to assess their diet. We used howler monkey dung in secondary seed dispersal experiments with 2484 seed mimics to estimate the removal rates by dung beetles and collected the beetles to assess community attributes. We compared the potential future contribution of howler monkeys and other frugivores to seed dispersal based on the seed sizes they disperse in other areas where they occur. In 2 years, howler monkeys consumed 60 animal‐dispersed plant species out of the 330 estimated. Twenty‐one dung beetle species were attracted to experimentally provided dung; most of them were tunnelers, nocturnal, and large‐sized (>10 mm). On average 30% (range 0–100%) of the large seed mimics (14 mm) were moved by dung beetles. About 91% of the species consumed by howlers (size range 0.3–34.3 mm) overlapped in seed size with those removed by dung beetles. In our study area, howler monkeys may consume more large‐seeded fruit species than most other frugivores, highlighting their potential to affect forest regeneration. Our results show reintroductions may effectively restore ecological links and enhance ecological processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a0010/2014cFundação Grupo Boticário de Proteção à Natureza  aE‐26/010/001645/2014cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro  cCAPES  a308356/2014‐4cCNPq  a487092/2012‐4cCNPq 3aAlouatta 3aColeoptera 3adiet 3adung beetles 3aecological competition 3afeces 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3afrugivores 3aseed dispersal 3aseed size1 aFernandez, Fernando A.

Basic (Pilot) indicators of food security have been studied and there have been made a conclusion that these indicators showed a great deterioration in post-Soviet Georgia. In response to ineffective agricultural policy, food self-sufficiency ratio is low and import ratio in a consumer basket is high. Due to low income bracket and rise in food prices, majority of the population can't get necessary amount of calories determined by physical standards. There have been revealed strengths and weaknesses of endogenous and exogenous factors influencing food security of the country. There has been researched how increase in local food production influences the macroeconomic security, especially momentary security of the country. Proposals and recommendations are drafted on strengthening food security of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3aeconomic systems 3afood prices 3afood production 3afood security 3aimports 3aincome 3amacroeconomics 3aRepublic of Georgia 0aFood security 0aBasic indicators 0aAgriculture 0aNational security 0aManufacturing0 tAnnals of Agrarian Science.g2016 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.46-51dElsevier B.V.aAgricultural University of GeorgiawJournal:23242x1512-18877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aasci.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245013800175300001600313500001500329520139500344592002801739650001501767650001101782650001301793650001801806650001901824650002101843650001001864650000901874650001701883650002301900650001701923650001001940650001701950650001601967650001901983650002802002650001002030650001902040650001202059650002202071650002602093650001702119653002502136700003102161700002802192773010402220856008102324852000902405655001202414IND4468971020221121014848.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2011.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosqueda-Melgar, Jonathan10aMicrobiological shelf life and sensory evaluation of fruit juices treated by high-intensity pulsed electric fields and antimicrobials  ap. 205-214.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of combining high-intensity pulsed electric fields (HIPEF) with citric acid or cinnamon bark oil, as antimicrobial substances, on the microbiological shelf life of strawberry, orange, apple, pear and tomato juices was evaluated in addition to the sensory properties of these products. An extension of the microbiological shelf life of fruit juices treated by HIPEF with or without antimicrobial substances was observed in comparison with those juices without processing. Naturally occurring microorganisms in the juices were inactivated by HIPEF treatment. Among the HIPEF treated juices, those from strawberry and orange did not show microbial growth along the 91 days of storage at 5Â°C. However, resident microbial populations in apple, pear and tomato juices only were controlled during that time when HIPEF was combined with antimicrobials. Therefore, combinations of those treatments may be a feasible alternative to thermal pasteurization to ensure the microbiological quality and safety in juices, and to avoid the risk of foodborne illness caused by the consumption of these commodities.

The FRUITFUL (FUL) and SHATTERPROOF1/2 (SHPs) MADS-box genes are master regulators directing fruit patterning in several eudicots. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the FUL–SHP network in different fruit types remain unclear. Here, we characterized the functions of an ortholog (CjPLE) of SHPs from Camellia japonica. We showed that CjPLE was predominantly expressed in stamen and carpel tissues during the early stage of floral development and that transcripts were abundant in the pericarp tissues during fruit development. The ectopic expression of CjPLE in Arabidopsis caused enhanced development of the carpels, whereas no defects in floral identity were observed. To investigate the downstream targets of CjPLE, overexpression transformants were analysed through a callus transformation system in Camellia azalea. We examined the expression levels of potential downstream target genes and found that two previously identified APETALA1-like genes (CjAPL1/2) were significantly up-regulated. We showed that CjPLE directly bound to the CArG motifs in the promoter region of CjAPL1 (the FUL ortholog). Taken together, our results reveal a possible positive regulation of FUL by SHP in the control of fruit development in Camellia.  aPublisher supplied data  cChinese Academy of Forestrydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005197  a31870578cNational Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aArabidopsis 3aCamellia japonica 3acallus 3acarpels 3acell differentiation 3aflowering 3afruiting 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apericarp 3apromoter regions 0aCamellia 0achromatin immunoprecipitation 0afruit development 0aFRUITFUL 0aMADS-box gene 0aPLENA1 aFan, Zhengqi1 aYang, Wen1 aYan, Chao1 aHu, Zhikang1 aLi, Xinlei1 aLi, Jiyuan1 aYin, Hengfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0720-53110 tJournal of experimental botany.g2019 June 28, v. 70, no. 12 p.3153-3164dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44658x1460-24317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erz1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011300156300002000269520029800289592002800587650001100615650002300626650002200649650001400671650001100685650001200696650001300708650002100721700002000742700001500762700002000777700001900797700001700816773014400833856007400977852000901051655001201060IND60670507920221118011440.0191002e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067050792DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12444d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Sinho10aSynthesis of micro-assembled Si/titanium silicide nanotube anodes for high-performance lithium-ion batteries  ap. 10617-10621.  aChemical reduction of micro-assembled CNT@TiO₂@SiO₂ leads to the formation of titanium silicide-containing Si nanotubular structures.

However, mechanistic understanding of environmental controls of top predator size is poorly developed. We used streams to investigate how predator body size is altered by three fundamental climate change stressors: reductions in habitat size, increases in disturbance and warmer temperatures. Using new survey data from 74 streams, we showed that habitat size and disturbance were the most important stressors influencing predator body size. A synergistic interaction between that habitat size and disturbance due to flooding meant the sizes of predatory fishes peaked in large, benign habitats and their body size decreased as habitats became either smaller or harsher. These patterns were supported by experiments indicating that habitat‐size reductions and increased flood disturbance decreased both the abundance and biomass of large predators. This research indicates that interacting climate change stressors can influence predator body size, resulting in smaller predators than would be predicted from examining an environmental factor in isolation. Thus, climate‐induced changes to key interacting environmental factors are likely to have synergistic impacts on predator body size which, because of their influence on the strength of biological interactions, will have far‐reaching effects on food‐web responses to global environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abody size 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3apredators 3astreams 3asurveys 3atemperature1 aMcHugh, Peter A.1 aMcIntosh, Angus R.0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1550-1558dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12441  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245007600161300001800237520089500255592002801150650002301178650002101201650001101222650001501233650000901248650001201257650001101269650001101280650001301291700002801304700001701332700001801349773012601367856008201493852000901575655001201584IND60567564920180615000000.0170425e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056756492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b116002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiffet, V.10aAlkali Ion Incorporation into V2O5: a Noncovalent Interactions Analysis  ap. 4259-4265.  aUnderstanding the interaction of alkali metals with layered materials like vanadia is important for a range of technological applications such as energy storage and heterogeneous catalysis. Here we used the NCI (noncovalent interactions) index to analyze the nature of the chemical bonding between inserted alkali atoms (Li, Na, and K) and vanadia. We found that alkali atoms ionize in bulk vanadia making directional ionic bonds with neighboring oxygen atoms, whereas the dispersive interactions between vanadia layers remain unmodified by the presence of alkali ions. Interestingly, we show how the NCI analysis discriminates among the different vanadium–oxygen types of bond, capturing even finer interactions involving reduced vanadium sites or ring stabilization. In addition, we explored dynamic effects, concluding that the directionality of all interactions is preserved at 500 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3aionization 3aions 3alithium 3aoxygen 3asodium 3avanadium1 aContreras-Garcı́a, J.1 aCarrasco, J.1 aCalatayud, M.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 120, no. 8 p.4259-4265dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b116003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245005600154300001600210520046000226592002800686650001200714650002300726650001300749650001400762650001300776651001000789653001400799653001000813653001800823653001200841653001600853700001500869773009800884856007300982852000901055655001201064IND60466550120221121015613.0151124e20150922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046655012DNAL7 a10.3417/20120752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Qiliang10aNeotypification of Primula filchnerae (Primulaceae)  ap. 155-158.  aPrimula filchnerae R.

The Santa Monica Mountains (California, U.S.A.), situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, is an area of conservation concern due to climate change, urbanization, and the introduction of non‐native species. We examined the effect of non‐native crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) on an existing native predator, dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna sp.), and their mosquito larvae (Anopheles sp.) prey. We used laboratory experiments to compare the predation efficiency of both predators, separately and together, and field data on counts of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae sampled from 13 local streams. We predicted a lower predation efficiency of crayfish compared with native dragonfly nymphs and a reduced predation efficiency of dragonfly nymphs in the presence of crayfish. Dragonfly nymphs were an order of magnitude more efficient predators than crayfish, and dragonfly nymph predation efficiency was reduced in the presence of crayfish. Field count data showed that populations of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae were strongly correlated with crayfish presence in streams, such that sites with crayfish tended to have fewer dragonfly nymphs and more mosquito larvae. Under natural conditions, it is likely that crayfish reduce the abundance of dragonfly nymphs and their predation efficiency and thereby, directly and indirectly, lead to higher mosquito populations and a loss of ecosystem services related to disease vector control.  aPublisher supplied data  cUnited States Geological Survey  cLas Virgenes Municipal Water District 3aAeshna 3aAnopheles 3aProcambarus clarkii 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acrayfish 3adisease vectors 3aecosystem services 3ainsect larvae 3aintroduced species 3alaboratory experimentation 3amountains 3anymphs 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3astreams 3aurbanization 3aCalifornia1 aSuh, Daniel1 aLamb, Avery Davis1 aRoberts, Dave1 aSharpton, Debra1 aShaffer, H.

To develop a visible-light-crosslinkable hydrogel, we systematically studied five combinations of GelMA and EY photoinitiator with various concentrations. Their mechanical properties, microstructures, and cell viability and confluency after encapsulation were investigated rigorously to elucidate the effects of the EY and GelMA macromer concentrations on the characteristics of the hydrogel. Experimental results show that the compressive Young’s modulus and pore size are positively affected by the concentration of EY, whereas the mass swelling ratio and cell viability are negatively affected. Increasing the concentration of GelMA helps in improving the compressive Young’s modulus and cell attachment. We further employed the developed visible-light-based stereolithography bioprinting system to print the patterned cell-laden hydrogels to demonstrate the bioprinting applications of the developed hydrogel. We observed good cell proliferation and the formation of a 3D cellular network inside the printed pattern at day 5, which proves the great feasibility of using EY–GelMA as the bioinks for biofabrication and tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofabrication 3abioprinting 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aencapsulation 3aeosin 3agelatin 3ahydrogels 3amaterials science 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of elasticity 3aporosity 3atissue engineering 0avisible light crosslinking 0agelatin methacryloyl hydrogel 0aeosin Y 0astereolithography 0a3D bioprinting1 aKumar, Hitendra1 aTian, Zhenlin1 aJin, Xian1 aHolzman, Jonathan F.1 aMenard, Frederic1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4135-44171 aKim, Keekyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7442-71170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 19, v. 10, no. 32 p.26859-26869dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b066073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245015300180300001800333520198900351592002802340650002302368650002602391650001302417650001502430650001902445650002502464650001502489650001502504700002002519700002802539773009902567856004002666852000902706655001202715IND50088722520221120194812.0140414e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008872252DNAL7 a243069682pmid7 a10.1111/gcb.124452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrassein, Fabrice14aThe importance of biotic interactions and local adaptation for plant response to environmental changes: field evidence along an elevational gradient  ap. 1452-1460.  aPredicting the response of species to environmental changes is a great and on‐going challenge for ecologists, and this requires a more in‐depth understanding of the importance of biotic interactions and the population structuration in the landscape. Using a reciprocal transplantation experiment, we tested the response of five species to an elevational gradient. This was combined to a neighbour removal treatment to test the importance of local adaptation and biotic interactions. The trait studied was performance measured as survival and biomass. Species response varied along the elevational gradient, but with no consistent pattern. Performance of species was influenced by environmental conditions occurring locally at each site, as well as by positive or negative effects of the surrounding vegetation. Indeed, we observed a shift from competition for biomass to facilitation for survival as a response to the increase in environmental stress occurring in the different sites. Unlike previous studies pointing out an increase of stress along the elevation gradient, our results supported a stress gradient related to water availability, which was not strictly parallel to the elevational gradient. For three of our species, we observed a greater biomass production for the population coming from the site where the species was dominant (central population) compared to population sampled at the limit of the distribution (marginal population). Nevertheless, we did not observe any pattern of local adaptation that could indicate adaptation of populations to a particular habitat. Altogether, our results highlighted the great ability of plant species to cope with environmental changes, with no local adaptation and great variability in response to local conditions. Our study confirms the importance of taking into account biotic interactions and population structure occurring at local scale in the prediction of communities’ responses to global environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aplant response 3apopulation structure 3aprediction 3avegetation1 aLavorel, Sandra1 aTill‐Bottraud, Irène0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1452-1460dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12445  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002600167245012400193300001600317500001500333520098000348592002801328650002301356650002301379650001601402650001201418650001101430650001901441650003001460650001701490650001701507650002801524650003801552650001201590650001301602650001401615650002501629650001001654650003301664650002501697650004901722650001101771650001901782650003201801650001101833650000901844650004901853650001601902650003601918650001701954651001001971653001101981653001701992653000902009653000902018653002302027653000902050653001002059653000902069653000802078653001302086653000902099653001102108653000702119653000702126653001802133653000802151653000902159700002202168773007402190856008202264852000902346655001202355IND60099165520221122082543.0161021e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009916552DNAL7 a240557292pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Aziz, Tarek A.10aHuman C-reactive protein gene polymorphism and metabolic syndrome are associated with premature coronary artery disease  ap. 216-221.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) gene polymorphism and metabolic syndrome (MetS) with premature coronary artery disease (PCAD). 116 patients with PCAD (58 with MetS and 58 without MetS) and 119 controls were included in the study. CRP gene +1059 G>C polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. Serum hs-CRP was measured using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Carriers of C allele of the CRP +1059 G>C polymorphism had 3.37 fold increased risk to develop MetS in patients with PCAD. In addition CRP gene and hs-CRP levels were independent risk factors for PCAD and MetS. The present study provides new evidence that the presence of CRP +1059 G>C polymorphism and hs-CRP levels are independent determinants of PCAD and MetS in Egyptians. The results of our study suggest a synergistic effect of CRP C allele with classical risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and MetS.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolic syndrome 3aC-reactive protein 3ablood serum 3aalleles 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ahypertension 3arisk factors 3acoronary artery disease 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aobesity 3apatients 3asynergism 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAdult 2aC-Reactive Proteinxgenetics 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexetiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexcomplicationsxgenetics. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRisk Factors 0aEgypt 0ahs-CRP 0aPolymorphism 0arisk 0aHDLc 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aSNPs 0aELISA 0aPCAD 0aCRP 0aCRP gene 0aLDLc 0aTNF-α 0aTC 0aTG 0aPremature CAD 0aCAD 0aMetS1 aMohamed, Rasha H.0 tGene.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 532 p.216-221dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011200211300001600323520166300339592002802002596004702030650002502077650001202102650002702114650001702141650001202158650001302170650001402183650001502197650002002212650001402232650002202246650001802268650003702286651001402323700006002337700001902397700001902416700001802435700007102453700005702524773012802581856008302709852000902792655001202801IND60770525120221119204338.0220813e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077052512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05268-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStandish, Rachel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8118-190410aPhosphorus supply affects seedling growth of mycorrhizal but not cluster-root forming jarrah-forest species  ap. 577-594.  aAIMS: Fertiliser is often used to kick-start ecological restoration despite growing evidence of the potentially negative impacts on plant diversity. Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest species growing on nutrient (especially phosphorus) impoverished soils in southwestern Australia have a suite of adaptations for phosphorus (P) acquisition, including the formation of cluster roots, and associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Here we investigated how escalating P supply, along with a stoichiometric adjustment of nitrogen (N) supply, impacted the growth and nutrition of a wide range of jarrah forest seedlings. METHODS: In a pot experiment, we measured seedling biomass and nutritional responses of 12 jarrah forest species to a gradient of P supply in relation to N supply, and for the mycorrhizal species, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. RESULTS: Three cluster-root forming species did not respond to increasing P, probably because they were reliant on seed P. Generally, mycorrhizal species showed a positive biomass response to increasing P when N was available. Mycorrhizas benefited seedling growth at low P (9 mg P added per kg of jarrah forest soil) when N was also available, and were parasitic to seedling growth at high P (243 mg P/ kg soil) without additional N. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight importance of P and N supply in determining the nature of the symbiosis between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. Since P supply has the potential to reduce plant growth, for a range of species, our results suggest careful consideration of fertiliser amounts for ecological restoration of ecosystems adapted to nutrient poor soils.  aPublisher supplied data  aARC LP 668931cAustralian Research Council 3aEucalyptus marginata 3abiomass 3aecological restoration 3aforest soils 3aforests 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3astoichiometry 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aAustralia1 aDaws, Matthew I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9120-47241 aMorald, Tim K.1 aSpeijers, Jane1 aKoch, John M.1 aHobbs, R.

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) are now planted in direct rotation, and conservation tillage is commonly used for both crops. Comprehensive data is lacking on crop and pest management recommendations in those systems, so a long-term study was conducted in Tifton, GA on the effects of tillage systems on crop and pest management in a peanut–cotton rotation. Systems evaluated were conventional, reduced, and minimum tillage. Plots in conventional tillage systems were harrowed, deep-turned, and planted each year. In reduced tillage systems, plots were harrowed in the fall and planted to rye (Secale cereale L.), and crops were planted into killed rye. In minimum tillage systems, plots were neither tilled nor planted to rye and remained nontilled during the winter, and crops were planted directly into the previous crop stubble. Weed control was based on species present and tillage system. Peanut was either treated with flutolanil [3′-isopropoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl) benzanilide] for soil-borne disease control or not treated (control). Yields were sustained for 5 yr with no difference in peanut or cotton yields among tillage systems. Flutolanil controlled soil-borne diseases and increased peanut yields, working equally well in all three tillage systems. Weed densities and species composition changed, causing more intensive and costly weed control in reduced and minimum tillage systems than in conventional tillage systems. Spotted wilt (tomato spotted wilt tospovirus) incidence was 42% lower in reduced and minimum tillage systems than in conventional tillage systems and is now part of the recommended strategy to manage the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aweed control 3aflutolanil 3along term experiments 3ano-tillage 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aGossypium hirsutum 3astubble 3abotanical composition 3aSecale cereale 3aplant density 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3aweeds 3aArachis hypogaea 3acrop rotation 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3aGeorgia1 aBrenneman, Timothy B.1 aBaker, Shelby H.1 aJohnson, Alva W.1 aSumner, Donald R.1 aMullinix, Benjamin G.0 tAgronomy journal.g2001 May, v. 93, no. 3 p.570-576dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/230193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2001.933570x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02742naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245010800210300001600318520122000334592002801554650002601582650001201608650001901620650001301639650001201652650001801664650001601682650001201698650002501710650001301735650000901748650002501757650001001782651001101792653001601803653002001819653002101839653001801860653001401878653001101892700002101903700003001924700006201954700002002016773010902036856008202145852000902227655001202236IND60544467120221117235619.0190416e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054446712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2014.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchierhorn, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8988-071814aThe potential of Russia to increase its wheat production through cropland expansion and intensification  ap. 133-141.  aRussia is a major player in the global wheat market, but extensive unused land resources and large yield gaps suggest that wheat production can be substantially increased.

We demonstrate that modest increases in the crop productivity and the recultivation of the recently abandoned croplands could increase wheat production by 9–32 million tons under rainfed conditions. Increases in the wheat yields, particularly within the fertile black soil belt in southern European Russia, will contribute the major share of the prospective production increases. Frequently recurring droughts, likely exacerbated by future climate change, and adverse market conditions jeopardize the exploitation of the production potentials. Improved adaptation to the volatile climate conditions and substantial institutional and political reforms in the agricultural sector are necessary to leverage the agricultural production potential of Russia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acropland 3adrought 3afood security 3agrain yield 3amarkets 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apolitics 3asoil 3atime series analysis 3awheat 3aRussia 0aAgriculture 0aCrop production 0aLand abandonment 0aRecultivation 0aYield gap 0aRussia1 aMüller, Daniel,1 aPrishchepov, Alexander V.1 aFaramarzi, Monireh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9795-67671 aBalmann, Alfons0 tGlobal food security.g2014 Nov., v. 3, no. 3-4 p.133-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2014.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015200168300001400320520189300334592002802227650003102255650001202286650002302298650002102321650002302342650002002365650001202385650001202397650001602409650002102425650002602446650002102472650001102493650002302504650001502527650001402542650001102556650001302567650001802580650001102598650001802609650001302627650001102640650001702651651001002668653002702678653001802705653002502723653001802748653002302766700002502789700002102814773011102835856008402946852000903030655001203039IND60564641020221118050545.0190403e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056464102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgea, Gregorio10aFinancial assessment of adopting irrigation technology for plant-based regulated deficit irrigation scheduling in super high-density olive orchards  ap. 47-56.  aHedgerow orchards with high plant densities, or super high-density (SHD) orchards, are considered to be amongst the most profitable management systems for most fruit-tree species. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies are recommended for SHD olive orchards, especially when scheduled from automatic and continuous measurements of plant water stress. There is a lack of information, however, on the profitability of this approach. In this work we analysed the financial feasibility of using three different systems for monitoring water stress in an ‘Arbequina’ SHD olive orchard under a RDI strategy recommended for the experimental area (SW Spain). The systems were based on sap flow (SF), trunk diameter variation (TDV) and leaf turgor pressure (TP) related measurements. We first compared their equivalent annual cost (EAC), resulting the TP based technology as that with the greatest potential to be adopted by farmers. We then used Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) to compare the financial feasibility of an RDI treatment scheduled from TP related measurements and providing 45% of the crop water needs (45RDITP) with both a similar treatment but scheduled with the crop coefficient approach (45RDICC) and a fully irrigated (FI) treatment. Our results from two irrigation seasons demonstrated that the 45RDI strategy guarantees the profitability of SHD olive orchards in the long-term, with both 45RDICC and 45RDITP showing positive Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return above the interest on capital. All the financial indicators suggested higher financial performance of 45RDITP as compared to 45RDICC, but differences were not significant, likely because of the high variability among replicates. The financial impact of Common Agricultural Policy payments as well as varying olive oil and irrigation water prices on the irrigation treatments was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3acapital 3acash flow analysis 3acrop coefficient 3adeficit irrigation 3aeconomic impact 3afarmers 3afinance 3afruit trees 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3amanagement systems 3amonitoring 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aorchards 3aplant density 3aprices 3aprofitability 3asap flow 3aturgor 3awater stress 3aSpain 0aHedgerow olive orchard 0aOlea europaea 0aPrecision irrigation 0aWater economy 0aWater productivity1 aFernández, José E.1 aAlcon, Francisco0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 June, v. 187 p.47-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010900169500001900278520210300297592002802400650002002428650001802448650001602466650001102482650001402493650001902507650001202526650001302538650001002551650001802561650001402579650001602593653002102609653002202630653002302652700001302675700001602688700001702704700001802721700001402739700001402753700001702767700001502784700001802799700001302817700001602830700001402846700001702860700005202877773011902929856008803048852000903136655001203145IND60686475020221121044700.0200601e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068647502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Rubing10aInteractions between climate factors and air quality index for improved childhood asthma self-management  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDaily air quality index (AQI) forecast can provide early warning information, and it is not clear whether it is appropriate for childhood asthma hospitalizations (CAHs). Furthermore, little is known about the effects of AQI on CAHs, as well as the interactions between temperature, humidity and AQI.We collected 32,238 cases in Hefei from 2013 to 2016 and estimated the association between daily CAHs and AQI by combining the Poisson Generalized Linear Models (PGLMs) with the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Models (DLNMs). The interaction between AQI and temperature was tested by stratifying AQI and temperature, as well as humidity.AQI was associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for childhood asthma. The adverse effect first appeared on the 3rd day, with the RR of 1.011 (95%CI: 1.000–1.023) and continued until the 19th day of lag (RR = 1.010, 95%CI: 1.001–1.020). In the subgroup analysis, the male and pre-school children were more sensitive to AQI, and there are seasonal differences in the effects of AQI on CAHs. Besides, in a stratified analysis with an AQI of 150, we found synergies between temperature, humidity and AQI. The interaction relative risk (IRR) and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) for the interaction between temperature and AQI were 1.157 (95%CI: 1.029–1.306) and 0.122 (95%CI: 0.022–0.223) respectively. For the humidity, the IRR and RERI were 1.090 (95%CI: 1.056–1.206) and 0.083 (95%CI: 0.083–0.143) respectively. Exploring different subgroups in the interaction analyses, it was worth noting that female and pre-school children were more sensitive to the interaction between AQI and temperature, while school-age children were more sensitive to the interaction between AQI and humidity.The study found that not only AQI can significantly increase the risk of CAHs, but also that under the context of climate change, temperature and humidity have a synergistic effect on AQI, suggesting that considering only the warning information of air pollution is not enough to strengthen the prevention of childhood asthma hospitalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aasthma 3achildhood 3aclimate change 3afemales 3ahumidity 3amales 3arelative risk 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aChildhood asthma 0aAir quality index 0aInteraction effect1 aWang, Xu1 aYi, Weizhuo1 aWei, Qiannan1 aGao, Jiaojiao1 aXu, Zihan1 aDuan, Jun1 aHe, Yangyang1 aTang, Chao1 aLiu, Xiangguo1 aZhou, Yu1 aSon, Shasha1 aJi, Yanhu1 aZou, Yanfeng1 aSu, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4673-64490 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 25, v. 723 p.137804-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014200169300001600311520101100327592002801338650001901366650001501385650001601400650002701416650001001443650001801453650002001471650001201491650002001503650001401523700002101537700002301558700002401581700002001605700002501625773011301650856008301763990002301846852000901869655001201878IND60099165920221121134017.0141105e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009916592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenks, Bruce G.14aThe role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the regulation of cell growth and gene expression in melanotrope cells of Xenopus laevis  ap. 315-321.  aBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is, despite its name, also found outside the central nervous system (CNS), but the functional significance of this observation is largely unknown. This review concerns the expression of BDNF in the pituitary gland. While the presence of the neurotrophin in the mammalian pituitary gland is well documented its functional significance remains obscure. Studies on the pars intermedia of the pituitary of the amphibian Xenopus laevis have shown that BDNF is produced by the neuroendocrine melanotrope cells, its expression is physiologically regulated, and the melanotrope cells themselves express receptors for the neurotrophin. The neurotrophin has been shown to act as an autocrine factor on the melanotrope to promote cell growth and regulate gene expression. In doing so BDNF supports the physiological function of the cell to produce and release α-melanophore-stimulating hormone for the purpose of adjusting the animal’s skin color to that of its background.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3aamphibians 3acell growth 3acentral nervous system 3acolor 3aendocrinology 3agene expression 3amammals 3apituitary gland 3areceptors1 aKuribara, Miyuki1 aKidane, Adhanet H.1 aKramer, Bianca M.R.1 aRoubos, Eric W.1 aScheenen, Wim J.J.M.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g2012 July 1, v. 177, no. 3 p.315-321dElsevier Inc.x0016-64807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01400naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245006800212300001600280520042200296592002800718650002300746650001300769650001000782700005600792700006500848773011700913856008301030852000901113655001201122IND60776130620221123040618.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077613062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2022.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholas, Dequina A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4996-219010aBuilding a laboratory and networks during the COVID-19 pandemic  ap. 725-727.  aThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented obstacles for new investigators to traverse.

Data were derived from the capture, clinical sampling and serological testing of 1803 badgers over 9945 capture events spanning 24 years. Incidence and prevalence increased over time, exhibiting no simple relationship with host density. Potential explanations are presented for a marked increase in the frequency of positive serological test results. Transmission rates (R₀) estimated from empirical data were consistent with modelled estimates and robust to changes in test sensitivity and the spatial extent of the population at risk. The risk of a positive culture or serological test result increased with badger age, and varied seasonally. Evidence consistent with progressive disease was found in cubs. This study demonstrates the value of long-term data and the repeated application of imperfect diagnostic tests as indices of infection to reveal epidemiological trends in M. bovis infection in badgers.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTuberculosis (TB)1 aWALKER, N.1 aSmith, G.

Among these processes are the making and breaking of connections among landmasses. Connections among landmasses are constantly in flux as are the climates and landscapes along the connection corridors, so that these corridors, or land bridges, may either facilitate or restrict migration at a given time. Across land bridges, changing landscape‐level and organismal factors include the dispersal potential and vectors of propagules, competition, predation, and distributions altered by pathogens. Assembly of a flora is, therefore, the outcome of complex, interacting, temporally‐varying factors that render simplistic explanations unlikely. In the case of North America, the continent experienced ephemeral connections with adjacent regions via five land bridges over the last 100 Ma at different times and under different climates and specific landscape morphologies, including edaphic characteristics. Here, I emphasize the earliest of these connections, Beringia, which probably comprised an initially‐incomplete land bridge during the Cretaceous and Paleocene resulting from compression, fragmentation, and rotation of Asian‐North American sub‐blocks as North America began moving westward from the northern portion of the Mid‐Atlantic Ridge. During the same time, additional land was added to Beringia with accretion of terranes and the subduction of the northern edge of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American‐Asian Plates in the Eocene to form the Aleutian Islands. Other connections between North America and adjacent landmasses were the North Atlantic, the Antilles, Central America, and the Magellan land bridge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aEocene epoch 3aPaleocene epoch 3aclimate 3aflora 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3apredation 3aAleutian Islands 3aCentral America 3aNorth America0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2018 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.405-429dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.123023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016900169520168800338592002802026650002102054650002602075650001402101650002302115650001802138650002002156650001102176650002602187650001002213650002302223650002302246650000902269650002402278650001302302650002202315650002902337650001402366650000702380650001602387650001902403650001302422653003302435653002702468653001602495653001602511653001502527700001502542700001502557700001402572700001602586700001302602700001202615700001802627700001602645700001702661700001102678700001402689700002002703773011902723856008802842852000902930655001202939IND60686475220221121054414.0200607e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068647522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xingyu10aRevealing structure and assembly for rhizophyte-endophyte diazotrophic community in mangrove ecosystem after introduced Sonneratia apetala and Laguncularia racemosa  aBiological nitrogen fixation (BNF) mediated by diazotrophic communities is a major source of bioavailable nitrogen in mangrove wetlands, which plays important roles in maintaining the health and stability of mangrove ecosystems. Recent large-scale mangrove afforestation activities have drawn great attention due to introduced mangrove species and their potential impacts on bio-functionalities of local ecosystems. However, the effects of introduced mangrove species on diazotrophic communities remain unclear. Here, we analyzed rhizosphere and endosphere diazotrophic communities between native mangrove species (Avicennia marina) and introduced mangrove species (Sonneratia apetala and Laguncularia racemose) by sequencing nifH gene amplicons. Our results showed that S. apetala and L. racemose introduction significantly (P < 0.05) increased nutrition components (e.g., total carbon and total nitrogen) in rhizosphere, as well as the diazotrophs richness in rhizosphere and endosphere. The relative abundance of clusters III diazotrophs in the rhizosphere and Rhizobium in the endosphere were significantly increased with L. racemosa or S. apetala introduction. Fe and pH were the main environmental factors driving the divergence of endophyte-rhizophyte diazotrophs between native and introduced mangroves. The correlation-based network analyses indicated that the interaction among rhizophyte-endophyte diazotrophs is more harmonious in native mangrove, while there exist more competition in introduced mangroves. These findings expand our current understanding of BNF in mangrove afforestation, and providing new perspectives to sustainable management of mangrove ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3aRhizobium 3aSonneratia apetala 3aafforestation 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3airon 3amangrove ecosystems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anutrition 3apH 3arhizosphere 3atotal nitrogen 3awetlands 0aBiological nitrogen fixation 0aMangrove afforestation 0aDiazotrophs 0aRhizosphere 0aEndosphere1 aYang, Chao1 aYu, Xiaoli1 aYu, Huang1 aZhuang, Wei1 aGu, Hang1 aXu, Kui1 aZheng, Xiafei1 aWang, Cheng1 aXiao, Fanshu1 aWu, Bo1 aHe, Zhili1 aNgan, A.

An international consensus has emerged that the best way to address food safety is through a risk-based, farm-to-table approach that focuses on cost-effective prevention. In developing countries, this approach has been implemented in supply chains for high-value markets, particularly exports. Evidence shows that improvements are possible where market incentives exist, and where market institutions can ensure that risk reduction practices are followed. To address food safety for food insecure consumers in developing countries, public efforts should focus on the most important risks and cost-effective controls, provide support for capacity building and supply chain coordination, and improve incentives for food safety management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic incentives 3aexports 3afarm to fork 3afood safety 3afood security 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3arisk 3arisk reduction 0aFood safety 0aSupply chain 0aRisk analysis 0aMarket development0 tGlobal food security.g2015 Mar., v. 4 p.24-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2014.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013400165300001600299500002000315520105000335592002801385650002601413650002501439650001401464650001701478650002001495650002601515650001401541650001301555650002301568650001101591650001501602651001201617700005801629700002101687700001701708700002101725700002101746700002201767700002301789773012501812856007901937852000902016655001202025IND60614935420221118143902.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061493542DNAL7 a10.1111/1748-5967.123082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaaboub, Jabeur10aComparison of chlorpyrifos resistance in Culex pipiens pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) collected from Northern and Southern Tunisia  ap. 400-404.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, we investigated resistance to the organophosphates chlorpyrifos in Tunisian populations of Culex pipiens pipiens. Three field populations were collected from Northern and central Tunisia between 2003 and 2005 and used for the bioassays tests. Our results registered moderate and high levels of resistance to chlorpyrifos which ranged from 33.8 to 111. The chlorpyrifos resistant populations were highly resistant to propoxur indicated an insensitive acetylcholinesterase 1 (AChE 1). The highest frequency of AChE 1 resistant phenotypes (64%) was recorded in the most resistant population (sample # 1). Bioassays conducted in the presence of synergists showed that not esterases were involved as the resistance mechanism to chlorpyrifos. However, CYP450 was partly involved in the resistance of the most resistant sample (# 1). Starch electrophoresis showed that three esterases were present in studied samples: A2‐B2, A4‐B4 and B12. Results are discussed in relation to the selection pressure caused by insecticide treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex pipiens pipiens 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abioassays 3achlorpyrifos 3aelectrophoresis 3apesticide application 3aphenotype 3apropoxur 3aselection pressure 3astarch 3asynergists 3aTunisia1 aTabbabi, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9951-59681 aBen Cheikh, Raja1 aLaamari, Ali1 aFeriani, Mohamed1 aBoubaker, Chokri1 aBen Jha, Ibtissem1 aBen Cheikh, Hassen0 tEntomological research.g2018 Sept., v. 48, no. 5 p.400-404dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867074x1738-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.123083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012900182300001600311520113400327592002801461650003001489650002201519650001101541650001401552650002201566650001701588650001201605650002601617650001301643650004401656650001401700650001401714650004201728650005501770650005001825650004201875650007201917650001301989650005402002700002402056773014302080852000902223856008202232655001202314IND4385889420221119112204.0200207e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438588942DNAL7 a164501102pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-005-0265-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshk, Sherif14aThe utilization of sugar cane molasses with/without the presence of lignosulfonate for the production of bacterial cellulose  ap. 291-296.  aProduction of bacterial cellulose (BC) using sugar cane molasses (MO) with/without the presence of lignosulfonate (MOL) as a sole carbon source in a Hestrin–Schramm medium (HS) was investigated. Six strains of Acetobacter xylinum [American Type Culture Collection 10245 and Institute of Fermentation in Osaka (IFO) 13693, 13772, 13773, 14815, and 15237] were screened for their BC production. The yield of the BC among all the strains from both the MO and MOL media was much higher than that from the HS medium. Acetobacter xylinum IFO 13772 was the best BC producer for all media. Furthermore, physical properties of these BC from the HS, MO, and MOL media were studied using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer, and cross polarization/magic angle spinning ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance. There are no significant differences in the crystallinity and the recorded I α fraction among the BC produced from the different media. A remarkable difference was only recorded in terms of viscosity. These results indicate that MO is a better carbon source than glucose for most of the strains investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconacetobacter xylinus 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolasses 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asugarcane 3aviscosity 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxdrug effects 2aCellulosexbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aGluconacetobacter xylinusxmetabolism 2aLigninxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMolasses 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods1 aSameshima, Kazuhiko0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 2 p.291-296dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-005-0265-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02675naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011800173300001600291500001500307520130700322592002801629650002301657650001101680650001001691650001501701650000901716650002101725650001601746650001901762650001701781650001501798651001001813653001401823653002701837653001001864653003001874653001601904653001801920700001801938700002401956700001901980773011301999856008402112852000902196655001202205IND60564641720221118050510.0190403e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056464172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Kishan Singh10aQuantification of wheat crop evapotranspiration and mapping: A case study from Bhiwani District of Haryana, India  ap. 200-209.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study an attempt has been made to estimate the actual wheat crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (SEBAL) and standardized FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) method. Improved knowledge of evapotranspiration (ET) helps in understanding the water balance of any region. The results obtained through measured lysimeter, SEBAL and PM method were evaluated through statistical performance measure tests. ETc estimated from SEBAL was found to correlate significantly as R2 (0.91) with the measured ETc of lysimeter. ETc estimated by SEBAL was also compared with PM ETc with the help of crop coefficient and was found to correlate significantly as R2 (0.85). The other statistical parameters (RMSE=0.56, nRMSE=0.09, MAE=0.26, NRMSE=0.20, R-RMSE=0.27, NSE=1, d=0.87 (≈1)) were also showing a good agreement between SEBAL ETc and PM ETc. The findings of work have suggested that SEBAL model shows a good potential to estimate spatial ETc for the region. Additionally the validation of models results were performed with the analysis of correlation between models ETc and district level wheat production and area under crop of five years. The results of this analysis outline that water availability and good amount of rainfall gives higher wheat yield and resulted into more ETc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3awheat 3alysimeters 3arain 3acrop coefficient 3agrain yield 3aenergy balance 3acase studies 3aalgorithms 3aIndia 0aLysimeter 0aPenman-Monteith method 0aWheat 0aActual evapotranspiration 0aSEBAL model 0awater balance1 aAñju Bālā,1 aSingh, Sudhir Kumar1 aPal, Raj Kumar0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 June, v. 187 p.200-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267506010400283506007600387520101700463592002801480506003701508650002901545650003401574650001601608650001901624650001101643650002801654650001301682651001001695653001601705653001601721653001001737653001601747653001901763700001801782700001901800700002501819773011501844856008201959852000902041655001202050IND60776131120221207133147.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077613112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2022.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugoua, Eugenie10aAssessing reliability of electricity grid services from space: The case of Uttar Pradesh, India  ap. 441-448.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile most households around the world have access to electricity, the number of hours per day when the grid supplies them with adequate voltage can be low. Improving the reliability of electricity is crucial to make progress on energy poverty but measuring and monitoring it is difficult, especially in lower-income countries where official data is sparse. We develop a transparent method using only easily accessible data to track the reliability of electricity. We train a decision tree model to predict the number of hours with normal electricity in Uttar Pradesh, India, using monthly nighttime luminosity, village characteristics, and voltage data from monitors installed in households. The approach successfully predicts reliability across time and space, and we document that, in Uttar Pradesh, the average number of hours per day with normal electricity has increased by 0.6 h between 2014 and 2019. The predicted number of hours with normal/reliable electricity supply for 2019 remains as low as 8.1 h.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adecision support systems 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity 3aenergy poverty 3amodels 3asustainable development 3avillages 3aIndia 0aElectricity 0aReliability 0aIndia 0aNightlights 0aRemote sensing1 aKennedy, Ryan1 aShiran, Myriam1 aUrpelainen, Johannes0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2022 June, v. 68 p.441-448dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2022.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245009900186300001600285520103100301592002801332650001601360650001801376650001201394650001001406650001601416650001201432650001001444650001801454650001201472650001701484650002201501650001101523650001001534650003201544650002201576650001001598700001601608700001501624700001601639700002301655700001901678700002501697773011701722856004801839852000901887655001201896IND50069420620221118180155.0130926e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006942062DNAL7 a238249532pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-013-9630-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, S.

A major step in this technique is to efficiently produce large batches of enucleated oocytes, a process that requires considerable micromanipulation skills and expensive equipments. Here, a simple, fast, and efficient method of manual oocyte enucleation was introduced that can be adopted in every laboratory with the minimum equipments. Common laboratory glass pipettes were pulled on the flame of a burner and then used for manual bisection or enucleation of sheep and goat zona-free oocytes by passing them through the discontinuous cutting border of culture medium and mineral oil. The described techniques showed a certain efficiency to conveniently bisect or enucleate large batches of sheep, and goat oocytes being pre-treated with demecolcine. The method may be straightforward for simple manipulation of oocytes of other species and for development of automated cloning methods as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3aculture media 3acutting 3agoats 3amineral oil 3aoocytes 3asheep 3asomatic cells 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleus 2aCloning, Organism 2aFemale 2aGoats 2aNuclear Transfer Techniques 2aOocytesxcytology 2aSheep1 aMoulavi, F.1 aAsgari, V.1 aShirazi, A.1 aAbazari-Kia, A.

However, they still suffer from limited specific capacitance and poor rate capability due to their poor interfacial properties and simple geometry. Here, we propose a facile strategy for the synthesis of yolk–shell NiGa₂S₄ microspheres comprising crumpled nanosheets supported on nickel foam. The robust structure not only highly facilitates the electron and charge transportation but also efficiently alleviates the volume expansion during redox reactions, contributing to excellent electrochemical behaviors in terms of specific capacitance and rate capability. Significantly, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on the prepared NiGa₂S₄ as the positive electrode and N,S-codoped graphene/Fe₂O₃ (N,S-G/Fe₂O₃) as the negative electrode delivers a high energy density of 43.6 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 961 W kg⁻¹ and retains an energy density of 22.2 W h kg⁻¹ even at 15 974 W kg⁻¹. These impressive results may provide a new perspective to develop high energy and power density storage systems for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afoams 3ageometry 3amicroparticles 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aredox reactions 3asulfides1 aKim, Kwang-ho,1 aYun, Je Moon1 aKundu, Aniruddha1 aSankar, K.

Brocken (Germany)—A re-assessment of Central Europe's northernmost treeline  ap. 127-135.  a2019-12-06  aAlpine treelines at medium high mountains are less abundant and thus have been less frequently studied than at high-elevation mountain ranges of the world. We studied mature Norway spruce stands along an extended elevation transect at Mt. Brocken (Harz Mountains, Central Germany) to analyse the altitudinal changes in climate-related growth conditions, and to evaluate the prevailing climate conditions at the treeline of medium high Mt. Brocken. A particular aim was to analyse the change in fine root biomass partitioning along the transect towards the treeline. Microclimate conditions at the treeline of Mt. Brocken were very similar to other treeline sites worldwide. Tree height and stem biomass strongly decreased from middle elevations towards the treeline. On the contrary, fine root biomass and the ratio of fine root/stem biomass strongly increased towards the treeline indicating a marked shift in carbon allocation in favour of the fine root system with elevation. A meta-analysis of literature data revealed that the elevation-related increase in dry mass partitioning to the fine root system is a general phenomenon for Norway spruce stands in northern and central European mountains. We conclude that the particularly large fine root system of Norway spruce at cold sites represents a mechanism to cope with unfavourable soil conditions such as reduced or temporally variable nutrient supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroot systems 3astems 3ameta-analysis 3amicroclimate 3amountains 3asoil quality 3aPicea abies 3atrees 3acarbon 3atreeline 3abiomass 3aroots 3acold 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 0aclimate1 aSchöling, Dorothea0 tFlora.g2011 Feb., v. 206, no. 2 p.127-135dElsevier GmbHx0367-25307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2010.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245010000179300001900279520150800298592002801806650002001834650001501854650001501869650001201884650002201896650001001918650001001928650000901938650001401947650001601961650001401977700001701991700002002008700002802028773010002056856008802156990002302244852000902267655001202276IND60098656620221119161517.0141105e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009865662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz-Jaffe, Mandy G.10aAging sperm negatively impacts in vivo and in vitro reproduction: a longitudinal murine study  ap. 262-268.e2.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of paternal aging on reproductive success. DESIGN: Animal study. SETTING: Research facility. ANIMAL(S): Outbred CF1 mice. INTERVENTION(S): Ten young male mice with proven fertility were mated routinely over 15 months with superovulated young females to assess in vivo and in vitro reproductive outcome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): In vivo fertilization, in vivo fetal development, in vitro embryo morphology, and developmental outcome were assessed. RESULT(S): There were no differences observed for any reproductive end point until the paternal age of 12 months. At 12–15 months, in vivo fertilization was significantly decreased (35% vs. 78% at <12 months). Natural matings with males ≥12 months revealed significantly smaller fetuses (11.36 mm vs. 14.73 mm <12 months) and placental weight (0.10 g vs. 0.13 g at <12 months). In vitro blastocyst development showed a significant decline at ≥12 months, and in vitro blastocyst transfer resulted in a significant increase in pregnancy loss with males ≥12 months (61.5% vs. 0% at <12 months). In addition, the expression levels of Ace-1, Prm1, Prm2, and Smcp were observed to be decreased in sperm from males ≥12 months compared with young male control subjects. CONCLUSION(S): Results from this study indicate an abrupt reproductive deterioration at paternal midlife, with an adverse effect observed on natural conception, in vitro blastocyst development, implantation potential, and fetal viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablastocyst 3aconception 3afemales 3afetal development 3afetus 3amales 3amice 3apregnancy 3aspermatozoa 3aviability1 aParks, Jason1 aMcCallie, Blair1 aSchoolcraft, William B.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 July, v. 100, no. 1 p.262-268.e2dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245009500180300001600275520135900291592002801650650001901678650002501697650001601722650002101738650001501759650000901774650001201783650001501795650002301810650003701833650001201870650002901882650001701911650002901928650002501957650003701982650001902019650003202038650001402070650000902084650003902093650003802132650002302170700001902193700001802212700001802230700001802248700001502266773011702281856004802398852000902446655001202455IND50069420720221118180600.0130926e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006942072DNAL7 a239497422pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-013-9632-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aEnrichment of epidermal stem cells of rats by Vario magnetic activated cell sorting system  ap. 583-588.  aEpidermal stem cells (ESCs) play an important role in skin homeostasis, wound repair, and tumorigensis which have great potential in scientific research and clinical application. So, the efficient isolation of these infrequent stem cells is very important for researchers to solve the problem of low purity and insufficient quantity of stem cells in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate a method for the enrichment of ESCs by magnetic activated cell sorting system. The isolation strategy was CD71 depletion followed by α6-integrin positive selection. The percentage of α6ᵇʳⁱCD71ᵈⁱᵐ cells in isolated cells was 94.59%. Transmission electron microscopy results revealed that α6ᵇʳⁱ CD71ᵈⁱᵐ cells exhibited some typical characteristics like progenitor cells, such as big nucleus, obvious nucleolus, large nuclear–cytoplasm ratio, and few organelles in cytoplasm. When cultured in vitro, the α6ᵇʳⁱCD71ᵈⁱᵐ cells had greater proliferating potential and higher colony-forming ability, and high levels of epidermal stem cell markers were expressed in our positive cells. ESCs have been successfully isolated from neonatal epidermis using Vario MACS and cultured in vitro. This isolation method is simple, fast, and inexpensive, providing an important tool for tissue engineering and cell transplantation studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleolus 3acell transplantation 3ahomeostasis 3ain vitro culture 3aorganelles 3arats 3asorting 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxmetabolism 2aCell Lineage 2aCell Separationxmethods 2aCell Transplantation 2aEpidermisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aIntegrin alpha6xmetabolism 2aMagnetics 2aRats 2aReceptors, Transferrinxmetabolism 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTissue Engineering1 aZhang, Wei-wei1 aShi, Chunying1 aLian, Xiaohua1 aYi, Shanghong1 aYang, Tian0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2013 Sept., v. 49, no. 8 p.583-588dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-013-9632-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012100162300001800283520152500301592002801826650001201854650002101866650001401887650001301901650001301914650001001927650001401937650001401951650000901965650001301974700001701987700001902004700001702023700002002040773012002060856008202180852000902262655001202271IND4467467220221120093428.0181015e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446746722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-011-1652-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGristina, M.10aShelter selection of the spiny lobster Palinurus elephas under different levels of Octopus vulgaris predation threat  ap. 1331-1337.  aThe skill of recognizing and reacting to predators is often based on a learned component. Few studies have examined the role of learning in spiny lobster anti-predator behavior. We investigated whether European spiny lobster (Palinurus elephas) shelter selection is influenced by olfactory stimuli released by one of the most common lobster predators, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), and whether the behavioral response to octopus chemical stimuli is innate or influenced by experience. In experimental arenas, we conditioned wild-caught lobsters with three levels of predation threat: no threat, with no predator–prey interaction; medium threat, with odor and visual predator cues only; high threat, active predation risk. We subsequently tested the shelter choice of the conditioned lobster under different experimental conditions: (1) shelter plus seawater; (2) shelter plus seawater plus chemical octopus cue. Our results showed significant differences in mean shelter occupancy with conditioning level. We conclude that P. elephas individuals use chemosensory systems in predator-avoidance mechanisms. Moreover, lobsters subject to a training period of high-level predation threat were able to learn the octopus chemical stimuli and treat its odor as a cue related to predation risk. The findings relative to the spiny lobster learning abilities could be an important tool for future management of lobster populations, e.g., by re-introduction of reared juveniles, which have not yet experienced predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas 3aOctopus vulgaris 3ajuveniles 3alearning 3alobsters 3aodors 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3aseawater1 aSinopoli, M.1 aFiorentino, F.1 aGarofalo, G.1 aBadalamenti, F.0 tMarine biology.g2011 June, v. 158, no. 6 p.1331-1337dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-011-1652-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014200155300001800297500001900315520222100334592002802555650001202583650001902595650004602614650001302660650001502673650000702688650001402695650002602709650001302735650002402748650000902772700001402781700001702795700001502812773012902827856007402956852000903030655001203039IND60717608420221118171139.0201113e20201112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071760842DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01478h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodina, D.10aMethod development of levoglucosenone analysis by UHPLC-UV-MS in fast pyrolysis samples and aspects of its degradation in aqueous samples  ap. 5202-5209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLevoglucosenone ((1S,5R)-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-en-4-one or LGO; CAS number: 37112-31-5) is an extensively studied biomass based chemical and its potential applications in organic synthesis, as well as in the extraction of various natural substances, have been established; therefore developing dependable, yet fast and simple analytical methods for determining LGO in the products of thermochemical biomass processing is of great importance.

The ionization of LGO in the positive and negative electrospray ionisation mode and the effect of a mobile phase additive on LGO and its degradation product ionisation have been evaluated. Using the UHPLC-UV system, a method for the quantification of levoglucosenone was developed and the analytical parameters of the method were determined. Utilising the developed UHPLC-UV method, studies of LGO stability in standard solution and in fast pyrolysis products were carried out in various solvent systems at different temperatures and pH levels. The main LGO primary degradation product has been confirmed to be furfural. It has been concluded that the degradation rate of LGO is significantly affected by the solvent and storage temperature, so it is essential that LGO standard solutions and samples are analysed when freshly prepared. Using a UHPLC-MS system and derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), a method for the determination of LGO was developed and the method analytical parameters were tested. To sum up, quantitative determination of LGO in pyrolysis products can be performed by reversed phase UHPLC-UV without any particular sample preparation, but in the case of UHPLC-MS it is necessary to derivatize LGO with DNPH to ensure ionisation of LGO. The additional work, requiring MS detection, can be outweighed by the greater selectivity compared to that of the more straightforward UV detection method in cases of incomplete chromatographic separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aderivatization 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afurfural 3aionization 3apH 3apyrolysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asolvents 3astorage temperature 3awood1 aMeile, K.1 aZhurinsh, A.1 aViksna, A.0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Nov. 12, v. 12, no. 43 p.5202-5209dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01478h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012000172520153400292592002801826650002201854650001601876650002201892650001801914650002701932650001301959650002301972650001701995650001302012650002102025650001102046650001602057650002302073650002102096650001602117650001402133650001502147650002202162650001302184650001902197650001502216653002202231653002502253653002702278653001802305653002302323700005702346700001802403700001602421700001402437773011902451856008802570852000902658655001202667IND60686475720221121125932.0200907e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068647572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Zhicheng10aComprehensive treatment of marine aquaculture wastewater by a cost-effective flow-through electro-oxidation process  aThe effective treatment of marine aquaculture wastewater is of great significance to protect marine environment and marine organisms. This study validated the feasibility of the comprehensive removal of NH₄⁺-N, NO₂⁻-N, COD and P, as well as disinfection and antibiotics removal from marine aquaculture wastewater by electrochemical oxidation (EO), comparing the performance and energy consumption with that by electro-peroxone (EP) and electro-Fenton (EF) process. Due to the formation of more free chlorine, the removal of NH₄⁺-N and COD was in order of EO ≫ EP > EF. A new flow-through EO reactor was adopted, which was found enhanced the formation rate of free chlorine and degradation rate of pollutants, and thus performed better than that of flow-by reactor and batch reactor. By this flow-through EO process, the removal of NH₄⁺-N and NO₂⁻-N could reach >90% and their concentrations after treatment both meet the Water Drainage Standard for Sea Water Mariculture (SC/T 9103-2007). Meanwhile, the process had a good bactericidal performance with a lg(c/c₀) of −5.6. At the same time, antibiotics such as sulfadimidine (SMT) and norfloxacin (NOR) could be completely removed. The energy consumption was only 0.054 kWh/g NH₄⁺-N (0.27 kWh/m³), which was far more cost-effective than other oxidative processes. The new flow-through EO process has great practical application prospects for the comprehensive removal of multiple pollutants and sterilization from marine aquaculture wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic organisms 3abatch systems 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorine 3acost effectiveness 3adisinfection 3adrainage 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3amariculture 3amarine environment 3anitrite nitrogen 3anorfloxacin 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aseawater 3asulfamethazine 3awastewater 0aElectro-oxidation 0aFlow-through reactor 0aAquaculture wastewater 0aFree chlorine 0aEnergy consumption1 aZhou, Minghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1306-35051 aZhang, Qizhan1 aYin, Xiaoya1 aLi, Yawei0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 20, v. 722 p.137812-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008300208300001600291520132500307592002801632596005701660650000901717650001901726650002801745700001601773700001201789700001501801700001501816700001901831700002501850700001701875700001601892700001301908700001301921700001401934773015001948856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60770526020221119204348.0220325e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077052602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-021-09661-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, K.

Here, we examine how equity is considered in a suite of papers that explored possible sustainable futures for the oceans, and mapped out pathways to achieve these futures. Our analysis revealed that a large range of equity issues were recognised and considered, in outcome-based (i.e. distributive), process-based (i.e. procedural) and concept (i.e. contextual) dimensions. However, often, the equity problem was not explicitly stated. Rather it was implied through the action pathway identified to move towards a more sustainable future, highlighting that reducing inequity is interlinked with improving sustainability. Based on these findings, we reflect on the way equity is conceptualised and considered within this work as well as futures science for the oceans more broadly. A key lesson learnt is that science and knowledge production are immediate areas where we can work to improve equity. We can build capacity to understand and include equity issues. We can develop mechanisms to be more inclusive and diverse. We can also critically reflect on our own practices to fundamentally challenge how we work and think in the space of marine science research.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch Enhancement ProgramcUniversity of Tasmania 3afish 3amarine science 3asustainable development1 aFleming, A.1 aBax, N.1 aGarcia, C.1 aJansen, J.1 aMaxwell, K.

Most farms across the globe are family farms, and they vary in size from <1ha to >10,000ha. Trends in farm size (small farms getting smaller and large farms getting larger) are not directly related to farm ownership and do not necessarily impact global food security. Rather, both the causes and effects of farm size trends depend on the availability of farm resources and off-farm employment opportunities. Similarly, environmental sustainability, though impacted by agriculture, cannot be linked directly to family ownership or farm size. To address issues related to environment, social conditions and food security, focus should not be on the preservation of family farms but on transformations to strive for environmental, social and economic sustainability of farming in all its shapes and forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3aemployment opportunities 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afamily farms 3afarm ownership 3afarm size 3afood security 3alabor 3aland tenure 3alarge farms 3aoff-farm employment 3asmall farms 0aFarm ownership 0aResource use 0aAgricultural development 0aFarm size 0aFarming systems1 aSchut, Antonius G.T.1 aReidsma, Pytrik1 aDescheemaeker, Katrien1 aSlingerland, Maja1 avan de Ven, Gerrie W.J.1 aGiller, K.

It has been demonstrated that a small amount of (10 mol%) grafted alkyl chains induced well-defined micro-phase separation of the obtained AEMs as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Thus, the highest conductivity was observed for grafted PPO AEMs with an alkyl chain length of 16 carbon atoms (C-16). The side-chain-type QA groups gave the excellent alkaline stability of AEMs according to the change in hydroxide conductivity after alkaline stability testing. These quaternized, grafted copolymers were employed as membranes for alkaline H₂/O₂ fuel cells. The results suggested that the C-16 alkyl-chain-grafted membrane had a better initial performance due to its high hydroxide conductivity in spite of its lower IEC value or water uptake. In contrast, the corresponding comb-shaped copolymers having C-16 alkyl chains failed to serve as anion exchange membranes for practical fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3acopper 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3awater uptake1 aLiu, Lei1 aHan, Xiaojin1 aHuang, Zhanggen1 aDong, Junping1 aLi, Nanwen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 May 30, v. 5, no. 21 p.10301-10310dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta00481h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011800160300001600278520163800294592002801932650002401960650002501984650002202009650001102031650002102042650001102063650002502074650002002099650001902119650001602138650001202154650002602166650002802192650001502220650002302235650002502258650001302283650001802296700001602314700001802330700001502348700001402363773012302377856008102500852000902581655001202590IND60687616120221119062241.0200402e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068761612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-019-9074-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiao10aEffects of hypoxia on survival, behavior, and metabolism of Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston 1904  ap. 351-363.  aHypoxia, a frequent occurring threat in coastal regions, often results in mass mortalities of marine organisms and brings a serious ecological problem. The commercially important Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri is being under such a threat as the risks of eutrophication and hypoxia have risen in their culture areas. However, little information has been known concerning their tolerance to hypoxia and their strategy for survival. In the present study, a 20-day experiment was conducted to determine the effects of hypoxia on the survival, behavior, and metabolism of Zhikong scallop. With the LC₅₀ for dissolved oxygen (DO) being estimated as 1.8 mg/L, the survival of Zhikong scallop can be greatly challenged even under the moderate hypoxic condition of around 2.0 mg/L DO. The survival rate ranged from 69% to 59% when DO dropped from 3.0 to 2.0 mg/L, and it was further reduced to 47% at 1.5 mg/L DO. In hypoxic conditions, the scallops became significantly active, which may be explained as escape attempts to avoid hypoxic water. To save energy, Zhikong scallop would depress their respiration. However, when DO dropped from 3.0 to 2.0 mg/L, the oxygen consumption rate hardly changed. The upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase activity and the unrepressed phosphofructokinase activity, which often result in the unbalanced cellular homeostasis and energy budget, may account for the observed increase in the mortality rate of Zhikong scallops. In general, Zhikong scallop is sensitive to hypoxia events, though possible escape attempts, depressed respiration, and oxaloacetate-pathway may increase their survival chance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzumapecten farreri 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquatic organisms 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzyme activity 3aeutrophication 3ahomeostasis 3ahypoxia 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alethal concentration 50 3ametabolism 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphofructokinases 3ascallops 3asurvival rate1 aZhang, Fang1 aWang, Minxiao1 aLi, Mengna1 aSun, Song0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2020 Mar., v. 38, no. 2 p.351-363dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-9074-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006800155300002000223520162600243592002801869650002401897650001301921650001101934650002201945650002601967650002501993650001502018650001402033650001402047653002102061653001202082653002002094653001302114653003202127653003002159700001902189700001602208700002402224773012602248856007502374852000902449655001202458IND60527670220221123023200.0160715e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052767022DNAL7 a10.1021/am501742z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaoli10aNew Cu3TeO6 Ceramics: Phase Formation and Dielectric Properties  ap. 11326-11332.  aTargeting low temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) applications and base-metal electrode multilayer ceramic capacitors (BME-MLCCs), ceramics of a new composition, tricopper tellurate (Cu₃TeO₆), are reported here. The crystal structure of Cu₃TeO₆ was determined to be cubic, Ia3, with the unit cell parameter a = 9.538 Å. The sequence of phase formation is proposed with the oxidation of tetravalent tellurium (Te⁴⁺) into hexavalent tellurium (Te⁶⁺) as a key step for the formation of Cu₃TeO₆. Ceramics sintered at 865 °C with densities of 94% exhibit two dielectric anomalies in the temperature dependence of the dielectric response, around −150 °C and +50 °C, respectively, accompanied by obvious frequency dispersion of the relative permittivity (εᵣ) and dielectric losses (tan δ), with an Arrhenius like behavior. A temperature stable dielectric region (near room temperature) formed between the two anomalies with εᵣ ∼ 12 and tan δ ∼ 0.01, and a very low positive temperature coefficient of the relative permittivity (TCεᵣ), 2.07 × 10–⁴ °C–¹, was obtained in the same region. The low temperature dielectric anomaly is associated with the possible mixed Cu⁺/Cu²⁺ valence in Cu₃TeO₆ ceramics, while the high temperature anomaly is attributed to point defect ordering, including VO, CuCᵤ₂₊⁺′, which might be formed during sintering. Therefore, Cu₃TeO₆ ceramics are of interest in view of not only the possible applications in BME-MLCCs, LTCC, and related technologies, but also for their possible compatibility with low cost abundant Cu electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aceramics 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3adielectric properties 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrodes 3aoxidation 3atellurium 0acopper tellurate 0aCu3TeO6 0aphase formation 0aceramics 0adielectric characterization 0alow sintering temperature1 aWang, Zhonghua1 aSu, Xinming1 aVilarinho, Paula M.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 July 23, v. 6, no. 14 p.11326-11332dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam501742z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245011100208520197000319592002802289650001202317650002202329650002502351650001702376650002702393650002002420650001102440650004302451650001502494650001002509650001902519650002402538650001702562650001802579650001502597650001202612650001602624650001702640651001002657653001702667653003102684653002402715653002402739653001802763700002302781700002002804700001602824700001602840773011902856856008802975961001303063852000903076655001203085IND60686475920221121125907.0200607e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068647592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9263-421910aImpacts of urbanization on soil organic carbon stocks in the northeast coastal agricultural areas of China  aDynamic changes in soil organic carbon pools have significant impacts on regional and global carbon balance. Due to rapid development in urbanized areas, the land use changes dramatically, impacting soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in topsoil. This study aimed to document the impacts of urbanization on SOC stocks in a rapidly urbanized area from northeastern China. A total of 12 auxiliary variables were as SOC predictors including elevation, slope aspect, slope gradient, topographic wetness index, Landsat TM band3, Landsat TM band4, Landsat TM5, and normalized difference vegetation index. Urban-specific variables including population (POP), gross domestic product (GDP), distance to the socio-economic center, and distance to the roads are also considered. A set of 523 (in 1990) and 847 (in 2015) top soil samples with SOC measurement were collected. Two random forest (RF) models, one with all auxiliary variables except urban-specific variable (MA) and the other with all auxiliary variables (MB) were used to map the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in the two periods. Ten-fold cross-validation was conducted to evaluate the performance of RF models. We find that the full auxiliary variables model had a better performance for the both periods. POP and GDP were key auxiliary variables affecting spatial variability of SOC stocks in 2015. Over a 25-year period, SOC stocks decreased from 2.77 ± 1.09 kg m⁻² to 2.16 ± 0.93 kg m⁻², resulting in 3.78 Tg SOC loss in this region. Rapid urbanization led to drastic land- use change, which was the main reason for the decrease of SOC stocks. Additionally, urban-specific variables should be used as the main auxiliary variables when predicting SOC stocks in the areas that experience rapid urbanization. We believe that accurate prediction and mapping of SOC stocks will help manage land use and facilitate soil quality assessment so as to increase soil carbon sequestration in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3agross domestic product 3aland use change 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3aroads 3asocioeconomics 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3atopography 3atopsoil 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrbanization 0aSoil organic carbon stocks 0aSpatial variability 0aAuxiliary variables 0aRandom forest1 aAdhikari, Kabindra1 aZhuang, Qianlai1 aGu, Hanlong1 aJin, Xinxin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 15, v. 721 p.137814-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012400168300001600292520113400308592002801442650002201470650002501492650002101517650002501538650002001563650002201583650001301605650002301618650002501641650001401666650001401680650001201694650002201706700002001728700001801748700002101766700002301787773011001810856008201920852000902002655001202011IND60593627020221123043354.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059362702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-018-1188-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamura, Akihiro10aInfluence of temperature and feeding regimes on growth and notochord deformity in reared Anguilla japonica leptocephali  ap. 505-512.  aThe high mortality rate of reared Japanese eel Anguilla japonica larvae is largely due to lower growth rate and the higher rate of deformed larvae. To establish an effective rearing protocol for this species, we examined the effects of water temperature and feeding regimes on their growth and notochord kyphosis. Larvae at 165 days post hatching were reared for 28 days at mean temperatures of 24, 25 and 27 °C, and were fed 4 or 6 times per day. Larval growth rate was significantly higher in larvae reared at 24–25 °C and fed 6 times per day. However, growth rate was significantly reduced at 27 °C, suggesting a shortage of metabolic energy due to an elevated cost of the higher basal metabolic rate at higher temperatures and low nutritional performance of currently used artificial diet. Notochord kyphosis was promoted by elevated water temperature, and two-way ANOVA showed that water temperature and feeding frequency had combined effects on the deformity. These findings suggest the importance of concurrently manipulating both environmental and nutritional factors to produce healthy eel larvae in captivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla japonica 3aanalysis of variance 3aartificial diets 3abasal metabolic rate 3acaptive animals 3afeeding frequency 3ahatching 3alarval development 3aleptocephalus larvae 3amortality 3aprotocols 3arearing 3awater temperature1 aHorie, Noriyuki1 aMikawa, Naomi1 aYamada, Yoshiaki1 aTsukamoto, Katsumi0 tFisheries science.g2018 May, v. 84, no. 3 p.505-512dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-018-1188-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245013300203300001600336506007600352520154100428592002801969506003701997650002102034650002502055650003202080650002502112650002502137650000902162650001902171650001102190650001402201650005202215650002402267650001702291650001202308650003702320650005802357650003502415650004302450650006402493650004402557650004602601650001102647650004602658650000902704650004002713650002802753650004502781650001702826700001402843700001602857700001502873700001402888700001802902700002102920700001602941700001402957700001502971773011702986856008103103852000903184655001203193IND50069420920221207143539.0150209e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006942092DNAL7 a238132432pmid7 aPMC37793162pmcid7 a10.1007/s11626-013-9641-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng10aImmortalized mouse dental papilla mesenchymal cells preserve odontoblastic phenotype and respond to bone morphogenetic protein 2  ap. 626-637.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOdontogenesis is the result of the reciprocal interactions between epithelial–mesenchymal cells leading to terminally differentiated odontoblasts. This process from dental papilla mesenchymal cells to odontoblasts is regulated by a complex signaling pathway. When isolated from the developing tooth germs, odontoblasts quickly lose their potential to maintain the odontoblast-specific phenotype. Therefore, generation of an odontoblast-like cell line would be a good surrogate model for studying the dental mesenchymal cell differentiation into odontoblasts and the molecular events of dentin formation. In this study, immortalized dental papilla mesenchymal cell lines were generated from the first mouse mandibular molars at postnatal day 3 using pSV40. These transformed cells were characterized by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization nodule formation. One of these immortalized cell lines, iMDP-3, displayed a high proliferation rate, but retained the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics similar to primary cells as determined by expression of tooth-specific markers and demonstrated the ability to differentiate and form mineralized nodules. Furthermore, iMDP-3 cells had high transfection efficiency as well as were inducible and responded to BMP2 stimulation. We conclude that the establishment of the stable murine dental papilla mesenchymal cell line might be used for studying the mechanisms of dental cell differentiation and dentin formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acell differentiation 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3amineralization 3amodels 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atransfection 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viral, Tumorxgenetics 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 2xgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aCells, Culturedxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aDental Papillaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHumans 2aMesodermxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aMice 2aOdontoblastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aOdontogenesisxgenetics 2aToothxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTransfection1 aWu, Li-An1 aLi, Wentong1 aYang, Yuan1 aGuo, Feng1 aGao, Qingping1 aChuang, Hui-Hsiu1 aShoff, Lisa1 aWang, Wei1 aChen, Shuo0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2013 Sept., v. 49, no. 8 p.626-637dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-013-9641-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007000161300001400231520099800245592002801243650002201271650001001293650001601303650001801319650002201337650002001359650002101379650001301400650001101413650000901424650001701433650001601450650001501466651001501481653002101496653002301517653002801540653002501568653002301593700001501616700001501631700001601646700001701662700001501679700001501694700001601709773009801725856008201823852000901905655001201914IND60544468020221117235752.0190416e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054446802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarms, B.10aDigital soil assessment for regional agricultural land evaluation  ap. 25-36.  aThe development of irrigated cropping is an important component of the strategy to intensify land use in sparsely populated northern Australia.

The coupling of digitally derived soil and land attributes with a conventional land suitability framework facilitated the rapid evaluation of regional-scale agricultural potential in this remote area. Approximately 50% of the total area was found to be suitable for a range of irrigated crops, but the vast majority of this area has significant soil limitations and other constraints to production. Growing crops successfully in the dry tropics of northern Australia remains a challenge.

Since disgust is intimately connected to ingesting food, disgust sensitivity is probably also associated with dietary habits. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between obesity and disgust and between restraint and disgust. Participants (n=135, all female) were recruited and tested via the Internet. They indicated their desire to eat high-calorie foods and filled out several questionnaires assessing restrained eating and disgust sensitivity. We hypothesized that more restrained eaters would show increased disgust and that women with a higher BMI would show decreased disgust, which is what we found; that is, more restrained eaters showed increased core disgust and contamination disgust, whereas women with a higher BMI showed decreased core disgust and contamination disgust. Hence, feeling disgusted by food may be a strategy to uphold restraint, whereas relatively decreased disgust could encourage overeating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abody mass index 3aemotions 3afemales 3aingestion 3aobesity 3aovereating 3aquestionnaires 3asoups 3awomen1 aHavermans, Remco C.0 tAppetite.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.827-830dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245006500207300001600272520184100288592002802129596005702157650003002214650000902244650001702253650002102270650002502291650001202316650001702328650002802345700002302373700002402396700002102420700002802441700002102469700002002490700001702510700001802527700001702545700001802562700002202580700002202602700002002624700001702644700001802661773015002679856008302829852000902912655001202921IND60770526320221119204406.0220325e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077052632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-021-09669-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNash, Kirsty L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0976-319710aOceans and society: feedbacks between ocean and human health  ap. 161-187.  aThe concentration of human population along coastlines has far-reaching effects on ocean and societal health. The oceans provide benefits to humans such as food, coastal protection and improved mental well-being, but can also impact negatively via natural disasters. At the same time, humans influence ocean health, for example, via coastal development or through environmental stewardship. Given the strong feedbacks between ocean and human health there is a need to promote desirable interactions, while minimising undesirable interactions. To this end, we articulate two scenarios for 2030. First, Business-as-Usual, named ‘Command and (out of) Control’, focuses on the anticipated future based on our current trajectory. Second, a more sustainable scenario called ‘Living and Connecting’, emphasises the development of interactions between oceans and society consistent with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We describe a potential pathway to achieving the ‘Living and Connecting’ scenario, centred on improving marine citizenship, achieving a more equitable distribution of power among stakeholders, and more equitable access to resources and opportunities. The constituent actions of this pathway can be categorised into four groups: (i) improved approaches to science and health communication that account for society’s diverse values, beliefs and worldviews, (ii) a shift towards more trusted relationships among stakeholders to enable two-way knowledge exchange, (iii) economic incentives that encourage behavioural changes necessary for achieving desired sustainability outcomes, and (iv) stronger regulations that simultaneously focus on ocean and human health. We contend that these changes will provide improved outcomes for both oceans and society over the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch Enhancement ProgramcUniversity of Tasmania 3aenvironmental stewardship 3afish 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3ainformation exchange 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asustainable development1 avan Putten, Ingrid1 aAlexander, Karen A.1 aBettiol, Silvana1 aCvitanovic, Christopher1 aFarmery, Anna K.1 aFlies, Emily J.1 aIson, Sierra1 aKelly, Rachel1 aMackay, Mary1 aMurray, Linda1 aNorris, Kimberley1 aRobinson, Lucy M.1 aScott, Jennifer1 aWard, Delphi1 aVince, Joanna0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2022 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.161-187dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3871702x0960-31667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-021-09669-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245017700181520179300358592002802151650004402179650002902223650002002252650001102272650001102283650001702294650001702311650001602328650001502344650003102359650000902390650001102399650001302410650004402423650001602467650002102483650002002504650001302524653003102537653002402568653001702592653002602609653002102635700002702656700002902683700002702712700002302739700001902762700002102781700007002802773011902872856008802991852000903079655001203088IND60686476020221121092648.0200907e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068647602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, João Vitor10aHumic-like acids from hydrochars: Study of the metal complexation properties compared with humic acids from anthropogenic soils using PARAFAC and time-resolved fluorescence  aHumic acids (HA) play an important role in the distribution, toxicity, and bioavailability of metals in the environment. Humic-like acids (HLA) that simulate geochemical processes can be prepared by NaOH aqueous extraction from hydrochars produced by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). HLA can exhibit properties such as those found in HA from soils, which are known for their ability to interact with inorganic and organic compounds. The molecular characteristics of HLA and HA help to explain the relationship between their molecular features and their interaction with metallic species. The aim of this study is to assess the molecular features of HA extracted from Terra Mulata (TM) and HLA from hydrochars as well as their interaction with metals by using Cu(II) ions as a model. The results from ¹³C NMR, elemental analysis, FTIR, and UV–Vis showed that HA are composed mostly of aromatic structures and oxygenated functional groups, whereas HLA showed a mutual contribution of aromatic and aliphatic structures as main constituents. The interactions of HA and HLA with Cu(II) ions were evaluated through fluorescence quenching, in which the density of complexing sites per gram of carbon for interaction was higher for HLA than for HA. Furthermore, the HLA showed similar values for stability constants, and higher than those found for other types of HA in the literature. In addition, the average lifetime in both humic extracts appeared to be independent of the copper addition, indicating that the main mechanism of interaction was static quenching with a non-fluorescent ground-state complex formation. Therefore, the HLA showed the ability to interact with Cu(II) ions, which suggests that their application can provide a new approach for remediation of contaminated areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanthropogenic soil types 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3acopper 3afluorescence 3ageochemistry 3ahumic acids 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aions 3amodels 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aremediation 3asodium hydroxide 3astable isotopes 3atoxicity 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aAnthropogenic soils 0aComplexation 0aFluorescence lifetime 0aSoil remediation1 aFregolente, Lais Gomes1 aMoreira, Altair Benedito1 aFerreira, Odair Pastor1 aMounier, Stéphane1 aViguier, Bruno1 aHajjoul, Houssam1 aBisinoti, Márcia Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4631-24000 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 20, v. 722 p.137815-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1378153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001800280520101500298592002801313653002001341653001601361653002601377700001501403700001501418700001501433700001401448700001501462773011501477856008101592852000901673655001201682IND60516614120221119030005.0160326e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051661412DNAL7 a10.1017/S09502688120021302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANG, L.

The survey involved 1200 residual sera of Singapore residents aged 1–17 years collected from two hospitals between 2008 and 2010. The overall prevalence of antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella was 83·1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 80·9–85·1], 71·8% (95% CI 69·1–74·2) and 88·5% (95% CI 86·6–90·2), respectively. For all three diseases, the lowest prevalence was in children aged 1 year (47·8–62·3%). The seroprevalence of the vaccinated children declined over time. The national MMR immunization programme is effective in raising the herd immunity of the childhood population, although certain age groups are more susceptible to infection, in particular, those who are not eligible for vaccination at age <15 months.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMMR vaccination 0apaediatrics 0aprevalence of disease1 aLAI, F.

Phenolic compounds (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, quercetin, gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, o-coumaric acid, phloridzin and ferulic acid), organic acids, sugars, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity were analyzed in sampled fruits. The results showed that most of the biochemical content and antioxidant capacities of the cultivars and genotypes were significantly different from one another (p < 0.05). Among the phenolic compounds, rutin (118.23 mg 100 g⁻¹), gallic acid (36.85 mg 100 g⁻¹), and chlorogenic acid (92.07 mg 100 g⁻¹) were determined to have the highest values for most of the fruit samples. Malic acid and citric acid were dominant among the organic acids for all the cultivars and genotypes except 44-Nrk-05. Glucose was measured as a more abundant sugar than fructose and sucrose in all samples. Antioxidant capacity, on the other hand, varied between 6.17 and 21.13 μmol TE g⁻¹ among the cultivars and genotypes analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acaffeic acid 3acatechin 3achlorogenic acid 3acitric acid 3acultivars 3aellagic acid 3aferulic acid 3afructose 3afruits 3agallic acid 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aglucose 3amalic acid 3amulberries 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphloridzin 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asucrose 3asyringic acid 3avanillic acid 3aTurkey (country) 0acultivar 0agenotype 0amulberry 0aphytochemicals1 aCanan, Ihsan1 aGecer, Mustafa K.1 aKan, Tuncay1 aErcisli, Sezai0 tFolia horticulturae.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 29, no. 2 p.251-262dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/fhort-2017-00233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012300161300001600284500001500300520101300315592002801328650001601356650001201372650002001384650002301404650001201427650002201439650001501461650001801476650002601494650001501520650001501535653001101550700001601561700001401577700001601591700001501607773010401622856008101726852000901807655001201816IND4468966220221120093511.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446896622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohebbi, M.10aPrediction of moisture content in pre-osmosed and ultrasounded dried banana using genetic algorithm and neural network  ap. 362-366.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, application of a versatile approach for estimation moisture content of dried banana using neural network and genetic algorithm has been presented. The banana samples were dehydrated using two non-thermal processes namely osmotic and ultrasound pretreatments, at different solution concentrations and dehydration times and were then subjected to air drying at 60 and 80°C for 4, 5 and 6h. The processing conditions were considered as inputs of neural network to predict final moisture content of banana. Network structure and learning parameters were optimized using genetic algorithm. It was found that the designed networks containing 7 and 10 neurons in first and second hidden layers, respectively, give the best fitting to experimental data. This configuration could predict moisture content of dried banana with correlation coefficient of 0.94. In addition, sensitivity analysis showed that the two most sensitive input variables towards such prediction were drying time and temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aneurons 3aneural networks 3adrying temperature 3abananas 3aosmotic treatment 3aair drying 3awater content 3anonthermal processing 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 0ainputs1 aShahidi, F.1 aFathi, M.1 aEhtiati, A.1 aNoshad, M.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2011 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.362-366dElsevier B.V.x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2010.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245019100168300001200359520107800371592002801449650001801477650001901495650002801514650001001542650002001552650001601572650001301588650001401601650001401615650001701629650003201646653001301678653002501691653001901716653001101735700002401746700002101770773011801791856007901909852000901988655001201997IND60596849120221117203120.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059684912DNAL7 a10.1515/fobio-2017-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabarek, Beniamin14aThe characterization of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), its role in cancerogenesis and cardiovascular system diseases and possibilities of using this cytokine as a molecular marker  ap. 1-8.  aThe inflammatory process is directly associated with secretion of cytokines, e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). This molecule is one of the 22 proteins which belong to TNF family and is secreted mainly by: macrophages, monocytes, T lymphocyte and mast cells. The biological effects of TNF-α is possible through binding this cytokine to specific receptors - TNFR1 and TNFR2. The large number of reports provides that this cytokine plays extremely important role in cancers and cardiovascular disease - two groups of inflammatory diseases. Unfortunately, these diseases are the main cause of death in spite of advances in medicine and increasing public awareness of prevention. It is believed that better understanding both molecular potential of this cytokine and the impact in cancerogenesis and others inflammatory diseases may cause using TNF-α as a molecular marker in these diseases and will make it possible to observe the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy. It will be able to cause a drop in the incidence of these diseases and better monitoring of them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acarcinogenesis 3acardiovascular diseases 3adeath 3agenetic markers 3amacrophages 3amedicine 3amonocytes 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0acytokine 0ainflammatory process 0acancerogenesis 0amarker1 aBednarczyk, Martyna1 aMazurek, Urszula0 tActa Universitatis Lodziensis.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 13, no. 1 p.1-8dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21560x1730-23667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/fobio-2017-00013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245007900190300001800269520107600287592002801363653001501391653002401406653001901430653001501449700002301464700002301487700001501510700001901525773010401544856011701648852000901765655001201774IND60127064820221120093750.0151110e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706482DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1063:CCTAMC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibert, Patricia10aChill-coma tolerance, a major climatic adaptation among drosophila species  ap. 1063-1068.  aMost drosophilid species can be classified either as temperate or tropical. Adults of species were submitted to a cold treatment (0°°C) and then brought back to ambient temperature. They generally exhibited a chill coma and the time needed to recover was measured. We found in a set of 26 temperate species that recovery was rapid (average 1.8 min, range 0.15––4.9). In contrast, a long recovery time (average 56 min, range 24––120) was observed for 48 tropical species. A few species, like Drosophila melanogaster, are cosmopolitan and can proliferate under temperate and tropical climates. In 9 of 10 such species, slight genetic differences were found: a shorter recovery in temperate than in tropical populations. Comparing physiological data to phylogeny suggests that chill-coma tolerance has been a recurrent adaptation that is selected for in cold climates but tends to disappear under a permanently warm environment. This major climatic adaptation, evidenced in drosophilids, seems to occur in other insect groups also.Corresponding Editor: T.

Supermarkets and ethnic markets were associated with a lower BMI in Guyanese adults. Among black adults, farmers’ markets were associated with a lower BMI, whereas supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and food pantries were associated with a higher BMI. Among white adults, food coops and supermarkets were associated with a lower BMI and wholesale clubs were associated with a higher BMI. Neighborhoods with less a favorable food environment (longer travel distance to a supermarket) were associated with a lower BMI in Guyanese adults.Both primary (ie, supermarkets) and secondary food shopping venues could be independent determinants of BMI. The observed variations by race and ethnicity provided insights into a culturally tailored approach to address obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3afarmers 3afood pantries 3afood purchasing 3ahealthy diet 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3aurban population 3aUnited States 0afood shopping 0abody mass index 0afood environment 0asupermarket 0aethnic market1 aMichaels, Isaac.

We studied the dissipation of famoxadone and oxathiapiprolin in tomatoes grown using different kinetic curves in the area of Beijing in 2015 and 2016. Our results show that the most suitable model for two fungicides in 2015 and 2016 was first-order kinetic and second-order kinetic with the half-lives of 3.4 to 5.2 and 2.4 to 3.0 days, respectively. In addition, we applied the dynamic plant uptake model dynamiCROP and combined it with results from the field experiments to investigate the uptake and translocation of famoxadone and oxathiapiprolin in the soil–tomato environment. Modeled and measured results of two years fitted well with R² values ranging from 0.8072 to 0.9221. The fractions of famoxadone and oxathiapiprolin applied during tomato cultivation that are eventually ingested by humans via residues in crop harvest were finally evaluated and found to be in the range of one part per thousand, that is one gram intake per kilogram applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3afamoxadone 3afield experimentation 3ahalf life 3ametabolites 3amodels 3asoil 3atomatoes 3aChina 0adissipation 0apesticides 0aplant uptake model 0adynamiCROP 0ahalf-life1 aWang, Kai1 aPan, Lixiang1 aXu, Tianheng1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aFantke, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7148-69820 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 July 20, v. 66, no. 32 p.8489-8495dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b020563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010000171300002000271520179200291592002802083650001602111650001602127650003702143650000902180650001502189650001302204650002302217650004402240650002102284650001402305650003702319700005802356700005102414700001802465700001402483700001902497700001502516700001902531773012302550856008802673852000902761655001202770IND60752817320221119165548.0211007e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075281732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c022842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yungang10aMolecular Modeling and Reactivity of Thermally Altered Coals by Molecular Simulation Techniques  ap. 15663-15674.  aIn this study, the chemical structure characteristics and reactivity features of three thermally altered coals with different ranks were analyzed by combining molecular modeling and molecular simulation methods to reveal and predict their chemical behaviors and properties. First, 2D molecular models of the three thermally altered coals were constructed based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹³C NMR), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and ultimate analysis data. 2D molecular models of the three thermally altered coals show different structural characteristics. 3D molecular models of the three thermally altered coals and their potential energy distributions were obtained by geometry optimization and anneal dynamics simulations. For exploring the reactivity of the three thermally altered coals with different ranks, the frontier molecular orbitals and Mulliken bond orders of the three molecular models were calculated based on quantum chemistry calculations. The frontier orbital (HOMO and LUMO) analysis results indicated that compared with the other two thermally altered coals, the thermally altered coal with Rₒ of 8.32% had higher reactivity in electrophilic or nucleophilic reactions. The bond order results provided detailed information on the active sites of the three thermally altered coal molecules, thereby predicting the thermal behaviors of the three thermally altered coals. These works can provide a theoretical basis for the industrial utilization of thermally altered coal. Meanwhile, these three models will be used in the future to study the combustion, pyrolysis, and graphitization mechanisms of thermally altered coals by reactive molecular dynamics methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoal 3acombustion 3ageometry 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apotential energy 3apyrolysis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWang, Shaoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5158-77511 aLiu, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1531-24991 aSong, Xiaoxia1 aChen, Hao1 aZhang, Xiaomei1 aLin, YuHan1 aWang, Xiaoling0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 35, no. 19 p.15663-15674dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c022843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245005400162300001800216520097000234592002801204650002101232650001501253650002501268650001301293650002301306700001501329700001501344700001701359700001701376700001401393773013501407856008101542852000901623655001201632IND60567562220221116192244.0210913e20160129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056756222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b101872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChee, W.

Herein, we summarize recent developments toward an all solid-state graphene-based flexible supercapacitor. The routes to produce graphene-based electrode materials, along with the typical fabrication techniques for flexible devices, are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the structural morphology of the electrode materials is closely related to the electrochemical performance, and the influence of the electrode components on the mechanical flexibility of the fabricated devices is examined. Lastly, a summary of the overall electrochemical properties and current development of the reported devices is presented progressively to predict the future trends toward the realization of an ultimate-performance graphene-based flexible supercapacitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic equipment 3agraphene 3aphysical chemistry1 aLim, H.

Four groups of 1-day-old Cobb male broilers (n = 4 cages/group, 6 chicks/cage) were fed a corn-soybean-based diet (control) and control supplemented with T-2 toxin at 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively, for 2 weeks. The histological results showed that dietary supplementation of T-2 toxin at 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg induced glandular gastric injury including serious inflammation, increased inflammatory cells, mucosal edema, and necrosis and desquamation of the epithelial cells in the glandular stomach of chicks. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that there were 671, 1393, and 1394 genes displayed ≥2 (P < 0.05) differential expression in the dietary supplemental T-2 toxin at 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg, respectively, compared with the control group. Notably, 204 differently expressed genes had shared similar changes among these three doses of T-2 toxin. GO and KEGG pathway analysis results showed that many genes involved in oxidation-reduction process, inflammation, wound healing/bleeding, and apoptosis/carcinogenesis were affected by T-2 toxin exposure.

The retinae of the principal eyes can be moved independently by two pairs of eye muscles each, whereas the secondary eyes do not have such eye muscles. The behavioural relevance of retinal movements of freely moving spiders was investigated by a novel dual-channel telemetric registration of the eye muscle activities. Walking spiders shifted the ipsilateral retina with respect to the walking direction before, during and after a turning movement. The change in the direction of vision in the ipsilateral anterior median eye was highly correlated with the walking direction, regardless of the actual light conditions. The contralateral retina remained in its resting position. This indicates that Cupiennius salei shifts it visual field in the walking direction not only during but sometimes previous to an intended turn, and therefore “peers” actively into the direction it wants to turn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupiennius salei 3amuscles 3aretina 3avision 3awalking 2aAnimals 2aElectrophysiology 2aLight 2aSpidersxchemistryxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aVision, Ocularxradiation effects1 aTrischler, C.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 57, no. 4 p.494-500dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245012800162300001600290520097800306592002801284650003401312650002201346650001701368650002601385650002901411650002501440650002001465650001301485650002801498650001601526650003201542650001401574650001101588650004401599650001401643650002201657650001701679651001701696653001801713653001601731653002401747653001901771653002901790700002501819700002601844773012201870856007701992852000902069655001202078IND60558097220221117030216.0161108e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055809722DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2015-02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadr, Jihan M.10aPlicosepalin A, a new antioxidant catechin–gallic acid derivative of inositol from the mistletoe Plicosepalus curviflorus  ap. 375-380.  aPhytochemical investigation of the semi-parasitic plant, Plicosepalus curviflorus (Loranthaceae) growing in Saudi Arabia resulted in the isolation of a new catechin–gallic acid derivative of inositol, plicosepalin A (1) [(+) catechin-4′-O-(1″-O-galloyl-5″-O-methyl)-myo-inositol], along with seven known compounds: methyl gallate (2), catechin (3), quercetin (4), gallic acid (5), lupeol (6), β-sitosterol (7), and ursolic acid (8).

The dual-stabilizer-capped NIR CdTe NCs were promising ECL labels because of their NIR ECL emission of 800 nm, low anodic ECL potential of +0.85 V, and high biocompatibity, which can facilitate interference-free and highly sensitive ECL bioassays. Upon the immunorecognition of the immobilized AFP to its antibody labeled with dual-stabilizer-capped CdTe NCs, the proposed immunoassay displayed increasing ECL intensity, leading to a wide calibration range of 10.0 pg/mL to 80.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 5.0 pg/mL [signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3] without coupling any signal amplification procedures. The NIR ECL immunoassay for real samples displayed very similar results with those of Ru(bpy)₃²⁺ reagent kit based commercial ECL immunoassay, which not only proved for the efficiency of NIR ECL from dual-stabilizer-capped CdTe NCs but also paved the road for development of novel ECL emitters and corresponding reagent kits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abioassays 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aimmunoassays 3ananocrystals1 aLiu, Shufeng1 aZou, Guizheng1 aZhang, Xiaoli0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 84, no. 24 p.10645-10649dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac302236a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019300165300001600358520130600374592002801680650002301708650001501731650001501746650001501761650001601776650001501792650001401807650001801821650001501839650001701854650002001871650001701891650001701908650002001925653003601945653004101981653002802022653002202050653002002072700001702092700001502109700001102124700001802135700002002153773012202173856008302295852000902378655001202387IND60767049420221120090849.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076704942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xianyu10aPost-crosslinking of conjugated microporous polymers using vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane for enhancing surface areas and organic micropollutants removal performance from water  ap. 697-706.  aHigh-capacity and rapid adsorption of organic micropollutants (OMPs) from water by adsorbents remain a great significance in water treatment. Recently, porous organic polymers with high surface areas, tunable nanopores and easy-to-modify skeletons are promising new generation of adsorbents. Here, a series of silsesquioxane-crosslinked conjugated microporous polymers (PcCMPs) with high surface areas and well-defined nanopores are developed via a molecular expansion strategy for removing OMPs from water. Among these PcCMPs, PcCMP-2E exhibited the highest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area up to 2518 m² g⁻¹. The maximum adsorption capacities of bisphenol A (BPA) of PcCMPs are ranging from 485.44 to 628.93 mg g⁻¹. Specially, >93.5% of BPA could be removed even through a thin layer filtration device composed of PcCMPs, which can be regenerated well using a mild washing procedure. PcCMPs also exhibit extraordinary adsorption to a variety of OMPs, such as tetracycline (226.99 mg g⁻¹), 1-naphthylamine (290.07 mg g⁻¹), 2-naphthol (213.87 mg g⁻¹), 2,4-dichlorophenol (183.85 mg g⁻¹) and p-nitrophenol (360.24 mg g⁻¹). This work provides a new strategy to design porous adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rate for water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3a2-naphthol 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3afiltration 3ananopores 3ap-nitrophenol 3apollutants 3aporous media 3asilsesquioxanes 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3awater treatment 0aConjugated microporous polymers 0aPolyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane 0aOrganic micropollutants 0aPost crosslinking 0aWater treatment1 aLiu, Yuchuan1 aWang, Shun1 aYe, Yu1 aSong, Xiaowei1 aLiang, Zhiqiang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.697-706dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245015200169300001800321520115100339592002801490650001501518650001201533650001001545650001301555650002301568650001601591700001801607700001801625773012601643856008201769852000901851655001201860IND60567562520221116192709.0170425e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056756252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b103752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArunkumar, Paulraj10aVersatile Ca4F2Si2O7 Host from Defect-Induced Host Emission to White-Light-Emitting Ce3+-Doped Ca4F2Si2O7 Phosphor for Near-UV Solid-State Lighting  ap. 4495-4503.  aWhite-light-emitting Ca₄–ₓF₂Si₂O₇:xCe³⁺ phosphor and violet-light-emitting oxyfluoride Ca₄F₂Si₂O₇ host were synthesized by solid-state reaction. Ca₄–ₓF₂Si₂O₇:xCe³⁺ has strong absorption in the near-UV region (370 nm) and shows a broad emission in the range of 390–600 nm centered at 475 nm. Under 315 nm excitation, a narrow blue emission was observed. The Ca₄F₂Si₂O₇ host synthesized under the same reduction conditions exhibited violet emission due to the formation of anion-deficient nonstoichiometric Ca₄F₂₋δSi₂O₇₊δ/₂ species. The broad emission of Ca₄F₂Si₂O₇:xCe³⁺ phosphor is attributed to Ce³⁺ occupying two crystallographic calcium sites available in the host. A white LED device was fabricated using Ca₄F₂Si₂O₇:Ce³⁺ without any additive phosphor, displaying excellent CIE chromaticity (0.29, 0.35) close to white emission with a color rendering index of 97. These exceptional optical properties of Ca₄F₂Si₂O₇:Ce³⁺ suggest the promising application of the single activator phosphor that could produce white light under near-UV-based LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3acolor 3alighting 3aoptical properties 3awhite light1 aKim, Yoon Hwa1 aIm, Wŏn-bin,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 120, no. 8 p.4495-4503dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b103753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100004400169245007100213300001800284520146900302592002801771653002001799653002401819653002701843653002701870653003001897773010501927856011702032852000902149655001202158IND60127065320221120093904.0151110e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706532DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1104:PAUDEP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandre Felizola Diniz-Filho, Joséé10aPhylogenetic autocorrelation under distinct evolutionary processes  ap. 1104-1109.  aI show how phylogenetic correlograms track distinct microevolutionary processes and can be used as empirical descriptors of the relationship between interspecific covariance (VB) and time since divergence (t). Data were simulated under models of gradual and speciational change, using increasing levels of stabilizing selection in a stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, on a phylogeny of 42 species. For each simulated dataset, correlograms were constructed using Moran's I coefficients estimated at five time slices, established at constant intervals. The correlograms generated under different evolutionary models differ significantly according to F-values derived from analysis of variance comparing Moran's I at each time slice and based on Wilks' λλ from multivariate analysis of variance comparing their overall profiles in a two-way design. Under Brownian motion or with small restraining forces in the O-U process, correlograms were better fit by a linear model. However, increasing restraining forces in the O-U process cause a lack of linear fit, and correlograms are better described by exponential models. These patterns are better fit for gradual than for speciational modes of change. Correlograms can be used as a diagnostic method and to describe the VB//t relationship before using methods to analyze correlated evolution that assume (or perform statistically better when) this relationship is linear.Corresponding Editor: T.

Self-assembled branched DNA (bDNA) structures or DNA origami that change conformation in response to environmental cues hold great promises in sensing and actuation at the nanoscale. Recently, the B-Z transition in DNA is being explored to design various nanomechanical devices. In this communication we have demonstrated that Cerium chloride binds to the phosphate backbone of self-assembled bDNA structure and induce B-to-Z transition at physiological concentration. The mechanism of controlled conversion from right-handed to left-handed has been assayed by various dye binding studies using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Three different bDNA structures have been identified to display B-Z transition. This approach provides a rapid and reversible means to change bDNA conformation, which can be used for dynamic and progressive control at the nanoscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acerium 3achlorides 3adye binding 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ananomaterials 3aorganic compounds 3aphosphates 0aZ-DNA 0aSelf-assembly 0aB-Z transition 0aCerium chloride 0aConformation change 0aDNA Nanotechnology1 aNayak, Ashok K.1 aSubudhi, Umakanta0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 22, v. 482 p.916-921dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.11.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012200163300001600285520145700301592002801758650001201786650001701798650000901815650001301824650001401837650001301851650001501864650003301879650001201912650003701924650002101961653002601982653001902008653001302027653002002040700001802060700001702078700002002095700001902115773012202134856008302256852000902339655001202348IND60767049520221120073302.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076704952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Eun-Ji10aStructural transition of reverse cylindrical micelles to reverse vesicles by mixtures of lecithin and inorganic salts  ap. 768-777.  aThe transformation from reverse micelles to reverse vesicles is influenced by electrostatic interactions between lecithin headgroups and inorganic salts. The electrostatic interactions are expected to influence molecular geometry of lecithin, resulting in a reduction in critical packing parameter (p). Hence, it should be possible to drive structural transitions of reverse self-assembled structures by addition of inorganic salts to lecithin solutions. Structural transitions of reverse micelles and reverse vesicles were formulated including lecithin and inorganic salts as a function of concentration in cyclohexane. A systematic study was performed using inorganic salts with the different valences of the cations such as Li⁺, Ca²⁺, and La³⁺. To probe the nanodomain structures from the lecithin/salt mixtures, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used. Adding salts to lecithin solutions induced the systematic transformation of reverse self-assembled structures from reverse spherical micelles to reverse cylindrical micelles and finally to reverse vesicles. The transformation was also correlated with interactions between lecithin headgroups and salts, that is, Li⁺ < Ca²⁺ < La³⁺. In addition, a water-soluble dye such as rhodamine B (RB) can be readily encapsulated into reverse micelles and vesicles, indicating that they are potentially useful for controlled solute delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acyclohexanes 3adyes 3ageometry 3alecithins 3amicelles 3arhodamines 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolutes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility 0aReverse self-assembly 0aInorganic salt 0aLecithin 0aReverse vesicle1 aPark, Da-Gyun1 aLim, Yeon-Su1 aSik Jin, Kyeong1 aLee, Hee-Young0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.768-777dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245012300201300001800324506007600342520120800418592002801626506003701654650001301691650002701704650002701731650001601758650001201774650002201786700001901808700001301827700002201840700002501862700002201887700002401909700001601933700002101949700002201970700001901992700002302011773007502034856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60092683620221207143530.0161019e20130523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009268362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.0462doi7 aPMC43820092pmcid7 a236478432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Pu10aCyclic [G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] Is the Metazoan Second Messenger Produced by DNA-Activated Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase  ap. 1094-1107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies identified cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) as a metazoan second messenger triggering an interferon response. cGAMP is generated from GTP and ATP by cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS). We combined structural, chemical, biochemical, and cellular assays to demonstrate that this second messenger contains G(2′,5′)pA and A(3′,5′)pG phosphodiester linkages, designated c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p]. We show that, upon dsDNA binding, cGAS is activated through conformational transitions, resulting in formation of a catalytically competent and accessible nucleotide-binding pocket for generation of c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p]. We demonstrate that cyclization occurs in a stepwise manner through initial generation of 5′-pppG(2′,5′)pA prior to cyclization to c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p], with the latter positioned precisely in the catalytic pocket. Mutants of cGAS dsDNA-binding or catalytic pocket residues exhibit reduced or abrogated activity. Our studies have identified c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] as a founding member of a family of metazoan 2′,5′-containing cyclic heterodinucleotide second messengers distinct from bacterial 3′,5′ cyclic dinucleotides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimalia 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ainterferons 3amutants 3asecond messengers1 aAscano, Manuel1 aWu, Yang1 aBarchet, Winfried1 aGaffney, Barbara L.1 aZillinger, Thomas1 aSerganov, Artem A.1 aLiu, Yizhou1 aJones, Roger A.1 aHartmann, Gunther1 aTuschl, Thomas1 aPatel, Dinshaw J.0 tCell.g2013 May 23, v. 153 p.1094-1107dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245006600191300001800257520214800275592002802423653002602451653002202477653001402499653002402513653002702537653001402564653002502578700001702603773010502620856011702725852000902842655001202851IND60127065420221120093851.0151110e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706542DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1110:GTIAPE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Elaine S.10aGenetic trends in a population evolving antibiotic resistance  ap. 1110-1122.  aThe evolution of antibiotic resistance provides a well-documented, rapid, and recent example of a selection driven process that has occurred in many bacterial species. An exhaustive collection of Moraxella catarrhalis that spans a transition to chromosomally encoded penicillin resistance was used to analyze genetic changes accompanying the transition. The population was characterized by high haplotypic diversity with 148 distinct haplotypes among 372 isolates tested at three genomic regions. The power of a temporally stratified sample from a single population was highlighted by the finding of high genetic diversity throughout the transition to resistance, population numbers that remained high over time, and no evidence of departures from neutrality in the allele frequency spectra throughout the transition. The direct temporal analysis documented the persistence, antibiotic status, and haplotypic identity of strains undergoing apparent clonal expansions. Several haplotypes that were ββ-lactamase nonproducers in early samples converted to producers in later years. Maintenance of genetic diversity and haplotype conversions from sensitive to resistant supported the hypothesis that penicillin resistance determinants spread to a diverse array of strains via horizontal exchange. Genetic differentiation between sample years, estimated by FST, was increasing at a rate that could cause complete haplotype turnover in less than 150 years. Widespread linkage disequilibrium among sites within one locus (copB) suggested recent mutation followed by clonal expansion. Nonrandom associations between haplotypes and resistance phenotypes provided further evidence of clonal expansion for some haplotypes. Nevertheless, the population structure was far from clonal as evidenced by a relatively low frequency of disequilibria both within sites at a second locus (M46) as well as between loci. The haplotype-antibiotic resistance association that was accompanied by gradual haplotype turnover is consistent with a hypothesis of genetic drift at marker loci with directional selection at the resistance locus.Corresponding Editor: D.

Body mass index of the children was obtained from measured heights and weights. Parents reported their anthropometric and employment data.Reliability was assessed using Cronbach α. Factorial validity was examined by Procrustes semi-confirmatory factor and confirmatory factor analyses.Seven major factors with loadings similar to those in the original questionnaire were found: perceived responsibility, perceived parent weight, perceived child weight, concern about child weight (CN), pressure to eat (PE), monitoring, and restriction. Reliability was adequate for each factor and overall CFQ (α = .86). Goodness of fit indexes for confirmatory factor analysis solutions was acceptable. Item loadings ranged from 0.30 to 0.92. The factor of CN was associated with restriction [multivariate coefficient (R2) = 0.14; P < .001] and PE (R2 = 0.36; P< .001). Child's body mass index showed a negative association with PE (R2 = 0.11; P < .001) and a positive association with CN (R2 = 0.25; P < .001) and factors related to feeding control (monitoring and restriction, R2 = 0.04 and R2 = 0.09, respectively; P < .001).Results support the reliability and validity of the CFQ for a Spanish population, allowing for comparisons across cultures. The CFQ may be useful to identify parental feeding attitudes that can contribute to preventing risky eating behaviors in their children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody mass index 3achild nutrition 3aeating habits 3aemployment 3afactor analysis 3afathers 3amonitoring 3amothers 3aquestionnaires 3aschool children 3aschools 0aBody mass index 0aChild Feeding Questionnaire 0aparenting practices 0aSpanish Child Feeding Questionnaire1 aBlanco-Gómez, Ainara1 aLuque, Verónica1 aFerré, Natàlia1 aFerrando, Pere Joan1 aGispert-Llauradó, Mariona1 aEscribano, Joaquín1 aClosa-Monasterolo, Ricardo0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2016 June, v. 48, no. 6 p.383-391.e1dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Nutrition Education and BehaviorwJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2016.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016800161300002000329520166100349592002802010650001402038650001102052650001102063650002502074650001502099650001002114650004602124650001502170650002202185650001802207650001702225650001102242650001502253650002102268650001502289650003702304700002302341773011302364856007502477852000902552655001202561IND60529145620221118155315.0160717e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052914562DNAL7 a10.1021/ac302287x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, Anastasia10aCharacteristics of Low-Temperature Plasma Ionization for Ambient Mass Spectrometry Compared to Electrospray Ionization and Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization  ap. 10657-10664.  aAmbient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) is an attractive method for direct analysis with applications in homeland security, forensics, and human health. For example, low-temperature plasma probe (LTP) ionization was successfully used to detect, e.g., explosives, drugs, and pesticides directly on the target. Despite the fact that the field is gaining significant attention, few attempts have been made to classify ambient ionization techniques based on their ionization characteristics and performance compared to conventional ionization sources used in mass spectrometry. In the present study, relative ionization efficiencies (RIEs) for a large group of compound families were determined with LTP-Orbitrap-MS and compared to those obtained with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). RIEs were normalized against one reference compound used across all methods to ensure comparability of the results. Typically, LTP analyte ionization through protonation/deprotonation (e.g., 4-acetamidophenol) was observed; in some cases (e.g., acenaphthene) radicals were formed. Amines, amides, and aldehydes were ionized successfully with LTP. A benefit of LTP over conventional methods is the possibility to successfully ionize PAHs and imides. Here, the studied model compounds could be detected by neither APCI nor ESI. LTP is a relatively soft ionization method because little fragmentation of model compounds was observed. It is considered to be an attractive method for the ionization of low molecular weight compounds over a relatively wide polarity range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aamides 3aamines 3aatmospheric pressure 3adesorption 3adrugs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aexplosives 3aforensic sciences 3afree radicals 3ahuman health 3aimides 3aionization 3amolecular weight 3apesticides 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aEngelhard, Carsten0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 84, no. 24 p.10657-10664dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac302287x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170520127100284592002801555650002101583650002301604650002001627650001501647650001401662650001801676650001401694650002301708650001901731650001101750650001701761650001601778650001301794650001901807650001801826650002201844650000901866650000901875650003001884653002401914653002201938653002401960653002301984700002402007700002602031700001802057700003002075700002002105700002002125700002402145700005902169700002102228700002302249700006202272773011202334856008202446852000902528655001202537IND60651004520221118231849.0190718e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065100452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakuleska, Lidija10aBone protective effects of purified extract from Ruscus aculeatus on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats  aRuscus aculeatus is a source of steroidal saponins that could mimic sex hormones and could help alleviate the risk of fracture in osteoporotic patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of an extract from R. aculeatus (ERA) on the proliferation of human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cell line and to investigate the effects of the ERA administered orally for 10 weeks at three doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) on the bone structure of rats with estrogen deficiency induced by bilateral ovariectomy. Bone turnover markers, hormones, histopathological and radiological disturbances were evidenced in the ovariectomized rats. ERA recovered most of the affected parameters in a dose-dependent manner similar to diosgenin and alendronate used as positive comparators. The main active compounds of ERA (ruscogenin and neoruscogenin) were docked into the Vit. D receptor and oestrogen receptors alpha and beta, and stable complexes were found with binding scores equal to those of estradiol and diosgenin.The findings of this study provide for the first time an insight into the effects of ERA on bone structure and suggest that ERA could be developed as a potential candidate for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporotic complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuscus aculeatus 3aactive ingredients 3abone metabolism 3acell lines 3adiosgenin 3adose response 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3apatients 3aplant extracts 3apostmenopause 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arisk 3avitamin D-binding protein 0aOvariectomized rats 0aMolecular docking 0aOestrogen receptors 0aVitamin D receptor1 aMichailova, Rositza1 aShkondrov, Aleksandar1 aManov, Vassil1 aZlateva-Panayotova, Nadya1 aMarinov, Georgi1 aPetrova, Reneta1 aAtanasova, Mariyana1 aKrasteva, Ilina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8559-03691 aDanchev, Nikolay1 aDoytchinova, Irini1 aSimeonova, Rumyana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4860-90530 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Oct., v. 132 p.110668-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009800171300001400269520148800283592002801771650001501799650002601814650002501840650001601865650001501881650002801896650001701924650001701941650001901958650001701977650002101994650003102015650002102046650002002067650001002087650001602097650001702113650000902130650004402139650002102183653002202204653002302226653002102249653001002270653000902280700001302289700002002302700001702322773007502339856008902414852000902503655001202512IND60570169120221122014342.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057016912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jinbao10aComparative toxicity of chloro- and bromo-nitromethanes in mice based on a metabolomic method  ap. 20-28.  aHalonitromethanes (HNMs) as one typical class of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts have been widely found in drinking water. In vitro test found HNMs could induce higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. However, data on toxic effect from in vivo experiment is limited. In this study, bromonitromethane (BNM), bromochloronitromethane (BCNM) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) were chosen as target HNMs, and exposed to mice for 30 d. Hepatic toxicity and serum metabolic profiles were determined to reveal toxic effects and mechanisms of the three HNMs. Results showed the three HNMs significantly decreased relative liver weight, indicating liver is one of the target organs. Further, the three HNMs exposure damaged hepatic antioxidant defense system, and increased oxidative DNA damage. Nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics analysis found amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were disturbed by HNMs exposure. Some metabolites in these metabolisms are related to oxidative stress and damage. Combined with above results, BNM had the highest toxicity, followed by BCNM and TCNM, indicating bromo-HNMs had higher toxicity than chloro-HNMs. Induction of oxidative stress is one of the toxicity mechanisms of HNMs. This study firstly provides the insight into in vivo toxicity of HNMs and their underlying mechanisms based on metabolomics methods, which is very useful for their health risk assessment in drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abyproducts 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3agenotoxicity 3ahaloacetic acids 3ahealth effects assessments 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aliver 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative stress 0aHalonitromethanes 0aMetabolic profiles 0aOxidative damage 0aLiver 0aMice1 aWu, Bing1 aZhang, Xu-Xiang1 aXian, Qiming0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 185 p.20-28dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245011400194300001800308520180200326592002802128653001402156653001802170653003402188653003002222653001602252653002102268653002502289653001502314700001902329700002502348773010502373856011702478852000902595655001202604IND60127065620221120093821.0151110e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706562DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1136:GVIAHP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarius, Hans Joachim10aGenetic variation in a host-parasite association: potential for coevolution and frequency-dependent selection  ap. 1136-1145.  aModels of host-parasite coevolution assume the presence of genetic variation for host resistance and parasite infectivity, as well as genotype-specific interactions. We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host clones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both host resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.Corresponding Editor: P.

We studied the neuroprotective effects of extracts of Brazilian green propolis in the mouse hippocampal cell line HT22. Ethanol extracts of Brazilian green propolis had a more potent preventive effect on oxidative stress-induced cell death, oxytosis/ferroptosis, in HT22 cells than water extracts of Brazilian green propolis, whereas it did not protect against anticancer drug-induced apoptotic cell death. Among the primary constituents of ethanol extracts of Brazilian green propolis, only artepillin C, kaempferide, and kaempferol demonstrated neuroprotective effects against oxytosis/ferroptosis. The flavonoid derivatives kaempferide and kaempferol are antioxidants with radical-scavenging abilities that additionally induce antioxidant response element-mediated transcriptional activity, suggesting that upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defense protects against oxidative stress. In contrast, artepillin C attenuated reactive oxygen species production; however, it did not induce antioxidant response element activation. These findings indicate that the ethanol extracts of Brazilian green propolis help to prevent oxidative stress-related neuronal cell death that is involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acolor 3aethanol 3ahippocampus 3ahoney bees 3akaempferol 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apropolis 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBrazilian green propolis 0aArtepillin C 0aKaempferide 0aAntioxidant response element 0aOxytosis/Ferroptosis 0a: ARE 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aEEP 0aGAPDH 0aGSH 0aHO-1 0aLDH 0aNrf2 0aROS 0aSOD 0aWEP1 aIchihara, Kenji1 aHirata, Yoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-49370 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Oct., v. 132 p.110669-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100003200169245010800201300001800309520208800327592002802415653003102443653002502474653001802499653002602517653002402543653001902567653002102586700002202607700001602629700002002645773010502665856011702770852000902887655001202896IND60127065820221120093822.0151110e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706582DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1153:HZDASR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerry, W.

One such zone involves the rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, and its congener O. propinquus. Orconectes rusticus was recently introduced into northern Wisconsin and Michigan lakes and streams, where it is hybridizing with and displacing resident O. propinquus. Here we report on a study investigating the dynamics of a hybrid zone between the two crayfish in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, where both the time (circa 1979) and location of the initial introduction are known. Our prediction was that hybridization should hasten the demise of O. propinquus because we expected that male O. rusticus (which are larger than congeners) would outcompete male O. propinquus for mates of both species. If hybrid progeny are unfit, then the result would be decreased reproductive output of O. propinquus females. However, we found a pattern of cytonuclear disequilibrium between allozymes and mtDNA suggesting that a majority (94.5%%) of F₁ hybrids resulted from matings between O. rusticus females and O. propinquus males. Also contrary to expectations, fecundity (O. rusticus and O. propinquus) and early hybrid survivorship did not differ significantly from nonhybrids. Moreover, adults of mixed ancestry were superior to both O. rusticus and O. propinquus in competition for a limiting food resource. Using a single-locus model, we estimated that hybridization increases the advance of O. rusticus genes in Trout Lake between 4.8%% and 36.3%% above that due to the previously documented ecological interactions. Consequently, whereas hybridization may be hastening the elimination of genetically pure O. propinquus, introgression is nevertheless slowing the loss of O. propinquus nuclear genes. Although our results suggest that O. rusticus and O. propinquus may not be true species under the biological concept, their ecological differences are of great conservation importance.Corresponding Editor: S.

Although the comet assay has been applied to frozen rodent tissue samples on several occasions, there is currently no agreement on the best way to freeze and thaw them. We have tested two different thawing procedures and compared the levels of DNA strand breaks (SBs) and Fpg-sensitive sites in fresh and frozen (for up to year) liver, kidney and lung tissue samples, from untreated and methyl methanosulfonate treated rats. Tissues were snap frozen, stored at −80 °C and processed in such a way that the tissue remained frozen until the cells were in suspension. Our results showed that comparable levels of DNA SBs were detected in fresh and frozen liver and lung samples stored at −80 °C for up to 1 year and 3 months, respectively. In kidney, similar levels of SBs were detected either in fresh or in frozen tissues stored for up to 1 year. However, more studies are needed to control the variability observed in the Fpg-sensitive site levels in this tissue at the different freezing periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acomet assay 3afreezing 3afrozen storage 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3arats 3astorage temperature 3asulfonates 3athawing 3atissues 0aFpg 0aFrozen 0aFresh 0aTissue 0aStability1 aEnciso, J.M.1 aPastor, L.1 aLópez de Cerain, A.1 aVettorazzi, A.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 July 09,  p.110671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245011300187300001800300520142500318592002801743653001401771653003001785653001201815653001901827653002001846653001301866700002101879773010501900856011702005852000902122655001202131IND60127066020221120093815.0151110e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012706602DNAL7 a10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1180:HFCIRT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThelen, G. C.10aHeterozygosity-fitness correlations in rainbow trout: effects of allozyme loci or associative overdominance?  ap. 1180-1187.  aPrevious studies with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have shown that increased heterozygosity at allozyme loci is correlated with several phenotypic traits associated with fitness. We expected to find a similar effect of heterozygosity at other nuclear loci if these associations are due to loci in linkage disequilibrium with the allozyme loci (i.e., associative overdominance), rather than the allozymes themselves. We examined the association between multiple locus heterozygosity and condition factor at 10 allozyme and 10 microsatellite loci. Individuals that were more heterozygous at allozyme loci had significantly greater condition factor in two hatchery cohorts of rainbow trout (1996 P == 0.006; 1997 P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no evidence at microsatellite loci that increased heterozygosity was associated with greater condition factor. Our results suggest that the observed relationship between heterozygosity at allozyme loci and condition factor in rainbow trout appears to be due to the allozyme loci themselves, rather than associative overdominance. We cannot, however, rule out that differences in the mutation process between allozymes and microsatellites may be responsible for these observations. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, these results support the view that allozymes and microsatellites are differentially affected by natural selection.Corresponding Editor: M.

Though Cd is a transition metal with no redox capacity, it generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) indirectly and causes oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in long-term Cd tolerance of poplar, candidate for Cd phytoremediation, are not well known. Hydroponically cultured poplar (Populus jacquemontiana var. glauca cv. ‘Kopeczkii’) plants were treated with 10 μM Cd for 4 weeks. Following a period of functional decline, the plants performed acclimation to the Cd induced oxidative stress as indicated by the decreased leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the recovery of most photosynthetic parameters. The increased activity of peroxidases (PODs) could have a great impact on the elimination of hydrogen peroxide, and thus the recovery of photosynthesis, while the function of superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms seemed to be less important. Re-distribution of the iron content of leaf mesophyll cells into the chloroplasts contributed to the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus and some antioxidative enzymes. The delayed increase in photosynthetic activity in relation to the decline in the level of lipid peroxidation indicates that elimination of oxidative stress damage by acclimation mechanisms is required for the restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus during long-term Cd treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3aacclimation 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acadmium 3achloroplasts 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroponics 3airon 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amesophyll 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidases 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 0acadmium 0aoxidative stress 0aphotosynthesis 0aPopulus 0astress hardening1 aSárvári, Éva,1 aSzöllősi, Erzsébet1 aTóth, Brigitta1 aMészáros, Ilona,1 aFodor, Ferenc1 aSzigeti, Zoltán0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 71, no. 9-10 p.323-334dDe GruyterwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2016-00923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009000155300002000245520138600265592002801651650001201679650001201691650002101703650001501724650001701739650002101756650001501777650001301792700001801805700001301823700001901836700001301855700001501868773011301883856007501996852000902071655001202080IND60529146020221118155047.0160717e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052914602DNAL7 a10.1021/ac302351n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li-Dong10aSignal-On Architecture for Electrochemical Aptasensors Based on Multiple Ion Channels  ap. 10554-10559.  aIn this work, we described a signal-on architecture for electrochemical aptasensors that is applicable to a wide range of aptamers. Herein, we use thrombin as the model sensing target. The signal-on aptasensor is composed of multiple ion channels embedded within a polymeric membrane, with the antithrombin aptamers chemically modified onto the inner walls of each ion channel working as the sensing element. As the thrombin concentration increased, [Ru(NH₃)₆]³⁺, which was electrostatically absorbed onto the negatively charged phosphate backbones of aptamers beforehand, was displaced and pushed into the ion channels from the inner walls, leading to an increase in the current of redox cations at the working electrode surface. Compared with the traditional two-electrode design using a single ion channel sensing system, our ion channel sensing system is applied multiple times within an ordinary three-electrode system, providing such advantages as a high signal-to-noise ratio and suitability for a wide variety of redox species. The results indicate that multiple ion channel sensing provides improvements of orders of magnitude in signal sensitivity. In particular, this signal-on architecture avoids the problems of limited signal gain and “false positives”. Moreover, the proposed aptasensor is simple, highly selective, stable, and applicable to real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aion channels 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphates 3athrombin1 aMu, Xiao-Jiao1 aPeng, Yi1 aChen, Zheng-Bo1 aGuo, Lin1 aJiang, Lei0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 84, no. 24 p.10554-10559dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac302351n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245012600210300001800336520141200354592002801766650002601794650002401820650002401844650001201868650001601880650001501896650002301911650001001934650001001944650001601954653002501970653003301995653002402028653001502052653002302067700002102090700003002111700003002141700001802171700003802189773014802227856008002375852000902455655001202464IND60608945920181009000000.0180815e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060894592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b026672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFermoso, Fernando G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2586-007X10aValuable Compound Extraction, Anaerobic Digestion, and Composting: A Leading Biorefinery Approach for Agricultural Wastes  ap. 8451-8468.  aIn a society where the environmental conscience is gaining attention, it is necessary to evaluate the potential valorization options for agricultural biomass to create a change in the perception of the waste agricultural biomass from waste to resource. In that sense, the biorefinery approach has been proposed as the roadway to increase profit of the agricultural sector and, at the same time, ensure environmental sustainability. The biorefinery approach integrates biomass conversion processes to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. The present review is focused on the extraction of value-added compounds, anaerobic digestion, and composting of agricultural waste as the biorefinery approach. This biorefinery approach is, nevertheless, seen as a less innovative configuration compared to other biorefinery configurations, such as bioethanol production or white biotechnology. However, any of these processes has been widely proposed as a single operation unit for agricultural waste valorization, and a thoughtful review on possible single or joint application has not been available in the literature up to now. The aim is to review the previous and current literature about the potential valorization of agricultural waste biomass, focusing on valuable compound extraction, anaerobic digestion, and composting of agricultural waste, whether they are not, partially, or fully integrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural wastes 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acomposting 3aethanol production 3afuels 3aroads 3avalue added 0abiorefinery approach 0avaluable compound extraction 0aanaerobic digestion 0acomposting 0aagricultural waste1 aSerrano, Antonio1 aAlonso-Fariñas, Bernabé1 aFernández-Bolaños, Juan1 aBorja, Rafael1 aRodríguez Gutiérrez, Guillermo,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 66, no. 32 p.8451-8468dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b026673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01691naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010200162300001800264520059600282592002800878650001400906650002300920650002600943650001800969650002000987650002201007650001001029700001401039700002001053700001901073700001601092700001301108773011801121856008101239852000901320655001201329IND60562214220221119124026.0170203e20170203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056221422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b026052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Li-Rong10aSynthesis of 1-Thio-Substituted Isoquinoline Derivatives by Tandem Cyclization of Isothiocyanates  ap. 1428-1436.  aA copper-catalyzed tandem arylation–cyclization process to access 1-(arylthio)isoquinolines from isothiocyanates and diaryliodonium salts is described.

The endemic genera of Malagasy songbirds are not allied obviously with any African or Asiatic taxa, and their affinities have been debated since the birds first were described. We used mitochondrial sequence data to estimate the relationships of 13 species of endemic Malagasy songbirds, 17 additional songbird species, and one species of suboscine passerine. In our optimal trees, nine of the 13 Malagasy species form a clade, although these birds currently are classified in three different families. In all optimal trees, the sister to this endemic clade is a group of Old World warblers including both African and Malagasy birds. The endemic Malagasy songbird clade rivals other island radiations, including the vangas of Madagascar and the finches of the Galapagos, in ecological diversity.Corresponding Editor: S.

A calibration curve of the tank has to be used to obtain actual concentration values from those measured by sampling. However, literature suggests that using a tank calibration curve was not a common procedure in the past. For the clay soil of the Sparacia (Italy) experimental station, this investigation aimed to establish a link between the relative performances of the USLE‐M and USLE‐MM models, usable to predict plot soil loss at the event temporal scale, and soil loss measurement errors. Using all available soil loss data, lower soil loss prediction errors were obtained with the USLE‐MM (exponent of the erosivity term, b₁ > 1) than the USLE‐M (b₁ = 1). A systematic error of the soil loss data is unexpected for the Sparacia soil because the calibration curve does not depend on the water level in the tank. In any case, this type of error does not have any effect on the b₁ exponent. Instead, this exponent decreases as the level of underestimation increases for increasing soil loss values. This type of error can occur at Sparacia if it is assumed that a soil loss measurement can be obtained by a bottle sampler dipped close to the bottom of the tank after mixing the suspension and assuming that the measured concentration coincides with the actual one. In this case, the risk is to obtain a lower b₁ value than the actual one. In conclusion, additional investigations on the factors determining errors in soil loss data collected by a sampling procedure are advisable because these errors can have a noticeable effect on the calibrated empirical models for soil loss prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3adata collection 3amixing 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3aItaly1 aFerro, Vito0 tHydrological processes.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 31, no. 4 p.847-853dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.110633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245014000200300001800340520170500358592002802063650001402091650002302105650001702128650001602145650002302161650001902184650002102203650001302224650002002237650003802257650001002295650001602305650001602321650001102337650004302348650001602391650001802407650002202425650002302447650000902470650002002479650001502499650001702514650001302531650003602544650002102580653002402601653001902625653001802644653001602662653001602678700001202694700001702706700001902723773014802742856008002890852000902970655001202979IND60608946020221119054616.0180815e20180722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060894602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b027852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Suwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9273-180110aHawthorn Polyphenol Extract Inhibits UVB-Induced Skin Photoaging by Regulating MMP Expression and Type I Procollagen Production in Mice  ap. 8537-8546.  aUltraviolet (UV) B radiation can cause skin aging by increasing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production and collagen degradation, leading to the formation of wrinkles. This study investigated whether hawthorn polyphenol extract (HPE) protects against UVB-induced skin photoaging using HaCaT human keratinocytes, normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and mice. Analysis of the phenol composition of HPE by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry showed that chlorogenic acid (13.5%), procyanidin B2 (19.2%), and epicatechin (18.8%) collectively accounted for 51.4% of total phenol content and represent the active ingredients of hawthorn fruit. A cell viability assay revealed that HPE treatment promoted cell proliferation in HaCaT cells and HDFs. On the other hand, MMP-1 and type I procollagen production was decreased and increased, respectively, in UVB-exposed cells treated with HPE as compared with those without treatment, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hematoxylin and eosin and Weigert staining of dermal tissue specimens from mice demonstrated that HPE also reversed UVB-induced epidermal thickening and dermal damage. The increase in production of reactive oxygen species and decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity as well as the increase in nuclear factor-κB activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation induced by UVB irradiation were reversed by HPE (100 or 300 mg/kg body weight), which also suppressed MMP expression and stimulated the production of type I procollagen in the dorsal skin of UVB-irradiated mice. These results suggest that HPE is a natural product that can prevent UVB radiation-induced skin photoaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrataegus 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3achlorogenic acid 3acollagen 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aeosin 3aepicatechin 3afibroblasts 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airradiation 3akeratinocytes 3amass spectrometry 3ametalloproteinases 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aphotoaging 3aprocyanidins 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aviability assays 0ahawthorn polyphenol 0aHPLC-MSI-MS/MS 0aUVB radiation 0aantioxidant 0aNF-κB/MAPK1 aYou, Lu1 aZhao, Yanxue1 aChang, Xuedong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 July 22, v. 66, no. 32 p.8537-8546dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b027853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01546naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300002000250520040700270592002800677650001500705650001900720650002600739650001300765650001200778650001300790650000900803700001900812700001700831700001300848700001800861700001600879700001800895700002000913773014400933856007401077852000901151655001201160IND60670505820221118011312.0191002e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067050582DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12391j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Jinjie10aSorption behaviour in a unique 3,12-connected zinc–organic framework with 2.4 nm cages  ap. 10631-10634.  aA polyhedral metal–organic framework (FJI-2) has been synthesized based on rare hexanuclear zinc clusters, which comprises 2.4 nm double-walled octahedral cages topologically featuring a new 3,12-connected structure.

Here we report the results of a study designed to test the hypothesis that polygynous mating results in significantly reduced Nₑ in an age-structured population. This hypothesis was tested in a natural population of a harem-forming fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae), in western India. The influence of the mating system on the ratio of variance Nₑ to adult census number (N) was assessed using a mathematical model designed for age-structured populations that incorporated demographic and genetic data. Male mating success was assessed by means of direct and indirect paternity analysis using 10-locus microsatellite genotypes of adults and progeny from two consecutive breeding periods (n == 431 individually marked bats). Combined results from both analyses were used to infer the effective number of male parents in each breeding period. The relative proportion of successfully reproducing males and the size distribution of paternal sibships comprising each offspring cohort revealed an extremely high within-season variance in male mating success (up to 9.2 times higher than Poisson expectation). The resultant estimate of Nₑ//N for the C. sphinx study population was 0.42. As a result of polygynous mating, the predicted rate of drift (1/2Nₑ per generation) was 17.6%% higher than expected from a Poisson distribution of male mating success. However, the estimated Nₑ//N was well within the 0.25––0.75 range expected for age-structured populations under normal demographic conditions. The life-history schedule of C. sphinx is characterized by a disproportionately short sexual maturation period scaled to adult life span. Consequently, the influence of polygynous mating on Nₑ//N is mitigated by the extensive overlap of generations. In C. sphinx, turnover of breeding males between seasons ensures a broader sampling of the adult male gamete pool than expected from the variance in mating success within a single breeding period.Corresponding Editor: B.

These modifications are constitutive or modulated in response to adaptive processes and can impact RNA base-pairing formation, protein recognition, RNA structure and stability. tRNAs are the most abundantly modified RNA molecules. Analysis of the roles of their modifications in response to stress, environmental changes, and infections caused by pathogens, has fueled new research areas. Nevertheless, the detection of modified nucleotides in RNAs is still a challenging task. We present here a reliable method to identify and localize tRNA modifications, which was applied to the human pathogenic bacteria, Staphyloccocus aureus. The method is based on a separation of tRNA species on a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We provided a list of modifications mapped on 25 out of the 40 tRNA species (one isoacceptor for each amino acid). This method can be easily used to monitor the dynamics of tRNA modifications in S. aureus in response to stress adaptation and during infection of the host, a relatively unexplored field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aamino acids 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anucleotides 3astress response 3atransfer RNA 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aPost-transcriptional tRNA modifications 0ananoLC/MSMS 0a2D gel isolation1 aWolff, Philippe1 aWesthof, Eric1 aRomby, Pascale1 aMarzi, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0399-46130 tBiochimie.g2019 Sept., v. 164 p.60-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012600207300001800333520106200351592002801413596009801441596009801539596009801637596009301735650001201828650001401840650002001854650002401874650002601898650002201924650001401946653002801960653003501988653002902023653001502052700001502067700001602082700005702098700005402155700005502209700005702264773014502321856008602466852000902552655001202561IND60773662120221116193123.0220419e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077366212DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c083512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3191-398010aBiomass-Modified Zirconium-Based Catalyst for One-Pot Reductive Etherification of Bioderived Aldehydes to Furanic Diether  ap. 4969-4979.  aThe furanic diether of 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan (BPMF) derived from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be used as a biobased fuel or fuel additive. It is highly desirable but challenging to develop a one-pot process for the transformation of HMF into BPMF because it is a cascade sequence reaction involving reduction and etherification reactions over multifunctional acid catalysts. In this work, zirconium-based catalysts were facilely prepared from a zirconium salt, sulfosalicylic acid, and biomass by a simple hydrothermal method. The obtained catalyst with both Brønsted and Lewis acids (BA and LA, respectively) can transform HMF into BPMF with a yield of 92.4% in 2-propanol by Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction and etherification in a one-pot strategy. Additionally, the reaction pathway and mechanism of the reductive etherification reaction was investigated and is presented. This work proposes an approach for the preparation of a solid acid catalyst with multifunctional BA and LA for reductive etherification of aldehydes to ethers.  aPublisher supplied data  a21908139cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21978160cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22078182cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21JC007cEducation Department of Shaanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009103 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3agreen chemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aisopropyl alcohol 3azirconium 0a5-hydroxymethylfurfural 0a2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan 0areductive etherification 0asolid acid1 aWang, Huan1 aJiang, Xulu1 aHe, Zhen-Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0469-11311 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3002-83141 aWang, Guan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8010-97401 aLiu, Zhao-Tie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-82340 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 10, no. 15 p.4969-4979dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c083513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009400175300001800269520127600287592002801563596007501591596007501666650001601741650001501757650002101772650001701793650001701810650001301827650001401840650002401854650001501878650000901893650001301902650001301915650002101928700002601949700002101975700002401996700002102020700002302041700002302064700002502087700002502112773010602137856008202243852000902325655001202334IND60676398120221121231304.0191116e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067639812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02115-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanzetto, Guilherme V.10aToxic effects of pyrethroids in tadpoles of Physalaemus gracilis (Anura: Leptodactylidae)  ap. 1105-1114.  aPyrethroid insecticides are one of the most commonly used pesticide groups, but these compounds have brought risks to non-target species, such as amphibians. This study evaluated the toxicological effects (mortality, swimming activity and oral morphology) caused to a South American species of anuran amphibian, Physalaemus gracilis, exposed to the pyrethroids cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Total spawnings of this anuran were collected in the natural environment and transported to the laboratory where they were kept under controlled conditions. Chronic assays were defined between 0.1 and 0.01 mg L⁻¹ of cypermethrin, and 0.009 and 0.001 mg L⁻¹ of deltamethrin. For cypermethrin, a further chronic toxicity test was performed at 0.05 and 2.0 mg L⁻¹, with hatchlings at stages S.20–S.25. Cypermethrin and deltamethrin were lethal enough to kill over 70% of exposed tadpoles in 1 week at concentrations that can be found in nature (0.01–0.1 mg L⁻¹). The exposure effects also influenced swimming activity and caused changes in oral morphology, which would make it difficult for the animals to survive in their natural habitat. Both pyrethroids presented a risk for P. gracilis, so they should be re-evaluated for non-target wild species.  aPublisher supplied data  agrantcFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul  agrantcFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul 3aPhysalaemus 3aamphibians 3achronic toxicity 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3ahabitats 3amortality 3anontarget organisms 3apyrethrins 3arisk 3aswimming 3atadpoles 3atoxicity testing1 aSlaviero, Jéssica G.1 aSturza, Paola F.1 aRutkoski, Camila F.1 aMacagnan, Natani1 aKolcenti, Cassiane1 aHartmann, Paulo A.1 aFerreira, Claudia M.1 aHartmann, Marilia T.0 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Nov., v. 28, no. 9 p.1105-1114dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02115-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245006200169300001800231520115700249592002801406596009801434596009801532596008701630596008701717650001101804650001901815650002101834650001501855650001701870650001101887650001801898650001901916700001901935700005601954700001302010700005602023700005402079773011902133856008802252852000902340655001202349IND60774623120221119194427.0220421e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077462312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c002712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gaopeng10aElectrode Engineering for Electrochemical CO₂ Reduction  ap. 4234-4249.  aExcessive carbon dioxide emissions cause severe global warming issues. One efficient way to deal with the problem is to convert CO₂ into valuable fuels and chemicals. The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO₂RR) has an excellent potential to reduce carbon emissions. Over the past few decades, research in this field has focused on creating high-performance catalysts. However, the overall efficiency of the CO₂RR process is limited at the device level, such as slow CO₂ mass transportation causing insufficient current density output, which is an urgent issue to be overcome in the design of advanced CO₂RR electrolyzers. Recently, gas diffusion electrodes have been intensively investigated to raise the CO₂RR performance into commercially relevant current densities by boosting the CO₂ mass transport rate. This review focuses on recent research progress on electrode engineering for increasing the CO₂RR performance, along with electrode-stabilizing strategies for long-term CO₂ electrolysis. Future directions are proposed to accelerate the development of advanced electrodes for industrial CO₂ electrolyzers.  aPublisher supplied data  a21938008cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22078232cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a19ZXNCGX00030cScience and Technology Major Project of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA  a20JCYBJC00870cScience and Technology Major Project of Tianjindhttps://doi.org/NA 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3amass transfer 3atransportation1 aYan, Tianxiang1 aChen, Xiaoyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7859-02991 aLiu, Hai1 aZhang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7532-19231 aMa, Xinbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2210-05180 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 36, no. 8 p.4234-4249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c002713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002900186245008300215300002000298506007600318520125600394592002801650506003701678650001901715650001701734650001401751650001201765650001201777650002301789650001601812651002601828653003601854653000801890653001901898653001601917653001501933700002001948700002201968700002001990700001902010700001902029700002402048700002302072773017602095856007902271852000902350655001202359IND60173735220221207094305.0150603e20130716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017373522DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12213701102doi7 aPMC37181682pmcid7 a238186192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLone Rangerc(Musician),10aTargeting global conservation funding to limit immediate biodiversity declines  ap. 12144-12148.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInadequate funding levels are a major impediment to effective global biodiversity conservation and are likely associated with recent failures to meet United Nations biodiversity targets. Some countries are more severely underfunded than others and therefore represent urgent financial priorities. However, attempts to identify these highly underfunded countries have been hampered for decades by poor and incomplete data on actual spending, coupled with uncertainty and lack of consensus over the relative size of spending gaps. Here, we assemble a global database of annual conservation spending. We then develop a statistical model that explains 86% of variation in conservation expenditures, and use this to identify countries where funding is robustly below expected levels. The 40 most severely underfunded countries contain 32% of all threatened mammalian diversity and include neighbors in some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich areas (Sundaland, Wallacea, and Near Oceania). However, very modest increases in international assistance would achieve a large improvement in the relative adequacy of global conservation finance. Our results could therefore be quickly applied to limit immediate biodiversity losses at relatively little cost.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations 3abiodiversity 3adatabases 3afunding 3amammals 3astatistical models 3auncertainty 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aecological/environmental policy 0aCBD 0asustainability 0aforeign aid 0agovernance1 aMooers, Arne O.1 aMiller, Daniel C.1 aNibbelink, Nate1 aRedding, David1 aKuhn, Tyler S.1 aRoberts, J.

IgG PT antibody levels in paired maternal and umbilical cord sera were measured from 805 mothers immunized recruited during labor and 200 mothers recruited during the prenatal care before immunization and followed until delivery. Antibodies were analyzed by commercial ELISA kits. 896 infants were followed to detect acute respiratory infections and paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop, apnea, cyanosis or post-tussive vomiting. For laboratory confirmation, B. pertussis- specific real time PCR was performed.We observed a high prevalence of titers >100 IU/mL (mother: 18.40% [95% CI 16–21%]; umbilical cord: 23.1% [95% CI 19.2–27.4%]), positive correlation of umbilical cord and maternal antibodies, higher antibody concentration in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated mothers and significant difference in antibody levels before and after vaccination (Wilcoxon test p = 0.000). The trans placental transport ratio was higher if the mother was vaccinated between 26 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and maximum eight weeks before delivery. Two cases of pertussis were confirmed in infants (incidence of 1.99 per 1000).The expected effect of Tdap maternal vaccination against pertussis was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aapnea 3acohort studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahospitals 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alabor 3amaternal immunity 3ametropolitan areas 3amothers 3aneonates 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprenatal care 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aumbilical cord 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avomiting 3aColombia 0aSeroepidemiological study 0aVaccination 0aPregnant 0aWhooping cough 0aColombia 0aLatin America1 aHoyos, María Cristina,1 aOchoa, Jesús,1 aMontoya, Nilton1 aGarcia, Diego,1 aOsorio, Elkin2 aPertussis Working Groupeauthor0 tVaccine.g2018 June 22, v. 36, no. 27 p.3984-3991dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001800261520159800279592002801877650002501905650002301930650001001953650001901963650001101982650001301993650000902006650001102015650002802026650001402054650002602068650001202094650001302106650001302119700001902132700002002151700002102171773010602192856008202298852000902380655001202389IND60676398420221122002105.0191116e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067639842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02102-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeir, Scott M.10aAcute toxicity of copper to the larval stage of three species of ambystomatid salamanders  ap. 1023-1031.  aCopper (Cu) appears to be consistently more toxic to anuran species relative to other vertebrate taxa. There are limited Cu toxicity data for salamanders; of the few studies conducted on salamanders, most examined Cu effects on the embryonic, but not the larval, stage. We performed acute toxicity experiments, to quantify LC50s, on Harrison stage 46 larvae (free swimming hatchlings with egg yolk completely absorbed) of three ambystomatid salamander species. Each LC50 experiment used exposure concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 µg/L with 10 replicates per concentration each containing one larva. We found very high toxicity for all species compared to previously published research on the embryo stage. Specifically, the 4-d LC50s for Ambystoma tigrinum and A. opacum were 35.3 and 18.73 µg/L, respectively. The same Cu concentrations caused similar toxicity to A. talpoideum (LC50 = 47.88 µg/L), but exposures required up to 48 d to elicit the same level of mortality. A time-to-event analysis indicated that time to mortality was significantly affected by Cu concentration. Additionally, for A. talpoideum, we observed that elevated levels of Cu decreased growth rate. Comparisons with previously reported Cu toxicity for embryos suggest that, as with fish, Cu may be more toxic to larval salamander stages than for embryos. Further, our data suggest that Cu is an important environmental contaminant that deserves increased scrutiny on the potential for population-level effects where contamination has occurred in wetlands and streams inhabited by salamanders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma talpoideum 3aAmbystoma tigrinum 3aAnura 3aacute toxicity 3acopper 3aegg yolk 3afish 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3asalamanders and newts 3astreams 3aswimming 3awetlands1 aYu, Shuangying1 aScott, David E.1 aLance, Stacey L.0 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Nov., v. 28, no. 9 p.1023-1031dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02102-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245013500184520111800319592002801437650001201465650001801477650001301495653001901508653001501527653001401542653002001556653001901576653001001595653001901605653002201624700002301646700002401669700006301693700002801756700002001784773010901804856008801913852000902001655001202010IND60752744520221120050432.0220205e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075274452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1054842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Marca, Emanuela Claudia10aTemporal dynamic of biofilms enhances the settlement of the central-Mediterranean reef-builder Dendropoma cristatum (Biondi, 1859)  aResearch on marine invertebrate settlement provides baseline knowledge for restoration technique implementation, especially for biogenic engineers with limited dispersion ability. Previously, we determined that the maturity of a biofilm strongly enhances the settlement of the vermetid reef-builder Dendropoma cristatum. To elucidate settlement-related biofilm features, here we analyse the structure and composition of marine biofilms over time, through microscopic observations, eukaryotic and prokaryotic fingerprinting analyses and 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The vermetid settlement temporal increase matched with the higher biofilm coverage on the substratum and the reduction of the eukaryotic abundance and diversity. The prokaryotic assemblage become, over time, more similar to that found on the reef-associated biofilm.Vermetids may detect these differences and selectively settle on those biofilms which show an advantageous structure and composition.These outcomes may support the production of ideal substrates for vermetid colonization and their further translocation to repopulate degraded reefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3ainvertebrates 3aresearch 0aVermetid reefs 0aSettlement 0aGastropod 0aBenthic ecology 0aMicroorganisms 0aARISA 0aNGS sequencing 0aMediterranean sea1 aCatania, Valentina1 aTagliavia, Marcello1 aMannino, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6419-70661 aChemello, R.q(Renato),1 aQuatrini, Paola0 tMarine environmental research.g2021 Dec., v. 172 p.105484-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1054843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010400129300001600233520155400249592002801803650000801831650002701839650001801866650001601884650001001900650001701910650001401927650001601941650002501957650000701982650002501989650003002014650001402044650001802058650001402076650002202090650002002112651001002132700001602142700001402158700002002172700001602192700001902208700001602227700002002243700001902263773017602282852000902458655001202467IND4501239220221123021006.0150420e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450123922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong-Xia10aFodinibius salinus gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from a salt mine  ap. 390-396.  aA novel, moderately halophilic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain YIM D17T, was isolated from a sample of sediment from a salt mine in Yunnan, south-western China. The taxonomy of strain YIM D17T was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Strain YIM D17T was Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic and non-motile and formed pink colonies on marine agar. Optimal growth occurred at 37 Â°C, pH 7.5â8.0 and in the presence of 10â15 % (w/v) NaCl. The major menaquinone was MK-7. The polar lipid profile was composed predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, one phospholipid, one glycolipid and one aminolipid. Minor amounts of other lipids were also detectable. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C17 : 1Ï9c/10-methyl-C16 : 0 (24.0 %), iso-C15 : 0 (23.6 %) and C16 : 1Ï7c/C16 : 1Ï6c (13.8 %). The DNA G+C content was 43.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate formed a distinct clade with the genera Gracilimonas and Balneola (both in the phylum Bacteroidetes) and was related to the species Gracilimonas tropica, Balneola vulgaris and Balneola alkaliphila, with sequence similarities of 85.6 %, 83.0 % and 82.8 % to the respective type strains.

Here, we investigate when in their life cycle mRNAs become pseudouridylated to illuminate the potential regulatory functions of endogenous mRNA pseudouridylation. Using single-nucleotide resolution pseudouridine profiling on chromatin-associated RNA from human cells, we identified pseudouridines in nascent pre-mRNA at locations associated with alternatively spliced regions, enriched near splice sites, and overlapping hundreds of binding sites for RNA-binding proteins. In vitro splicing assays establish a direct effect of individual endogenous pre-mRNA pseudouridines on splicing efficiency. We validate hundreds of pre-mRNA sites as direct targets of distinct pseudouridine synthases and show that PUS1, PUS7, and RPUSD4—three pre-mRNA-modifying pseudouridine synthases with tissue-specific expression—control widespread changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and 3′ end processing. Our results establish a vast potential for cotranscriptional pre-mRNA pseudouridylation to regulate human gene expression via alternative pre-mRNA processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3agene expression 3ahumans 0apseudouridine 0amRNA modification 0aRNA modification 0aepitranscriptome 0apre-mRNA processing 0aalternative cleavage and polyadenylation 0acotranscriptional 0apseudouridine synthase1 aSu, Amanda1 aBurns, Margaret C.1 aNussbacher, Julia K.1 aSchaening, Cassandra1 aSathe, Shashank1 aYeo, Gene W.1 aGilbert, Wendy V.0 tMolecular cell.g2022 Feb. 03, v. 82, no. 3 p.645-659.e9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.12.023  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245007800217300001300295520107600308592002801384650001701412650001901429650001301448650001501461650001201476650001601488650001601504653001901520653003201539653002101571653002601592653002601618700001901644700006001663700001901723700002201742773008901764856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60546795520221121155747.0160903e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054679552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowsky, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1655-201310aSeepage: Climate change denial and its effect on the scientific community  ap. 1-13.  aVested interests and political agents have long opposed political or regulatory action in response to climate change by appealing to scientific uncertainty. Here we examine the effect of such contrarian talking points on the scientific community itself. We show that although scientists are trained in dealing with uncertainty, there are several psychological reasons why scientists may nevertheless be susceptible to uncertainty-based argumentation, even when scientists recognize those arguments as false and are actively rebutting them. Specifically, we show that prolonged stereotype threat, pluralistic ignorance, and a form of projection (the third-person effect) may cause scientists to take positions that they would be less likely to take in the absence of outspoken public opposition. We illustrate the consequences of seepage from public debate into the scientific process with a case study involving the interpretation of temperature trends from the last 15 years. We offer ways in which the scientific community can detect and avoid such inadvertent seepage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3apolitics 3ascientists 3aseepage 3atemperature 3auncertainty 0aClimate change 0aGlobal warming “hiatus” 0aScientific norms 0aScientific assessment 0aClimate change denial1 aOreskes, Naomi1 aRisbey, James S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3202-91421 aNewell, Ben R.1 aSmithson, Michael0 tGlobal environmental change.g2015 July, v. 33 p.1-13dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245009100202300001800293500002000311520095400331592002801285650002001313650001601333650002301349650001501372650001601387650001201403650001601415650001201431700002001443700002401463773015101487856007401638852000901712655001201721IND60637828920221122040428.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063782892DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.139292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirven, Maritza A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2559-041X10aTannase improves gallic acid bioaccessibility and maintains the quality of mango juice  ap. 1523-1529.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of tannase on gallic acid (GA) bioaccessibility and auto‐oxidative browning of mango juice was investigated.

The result showed that the average metal concentration followed the order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cd, with the highest value of 27.9 g/kg (Fe) and lowest value 0.54 mg/kg (Cd). Anthropogenic inputs were the major sources of metals, followed by geochemical processes, and organic matter is also a control for metals. Spatially, high metal concentrations were distributed in the northern lake and low concentrations in Gonghu Bay and the eastern part of the lake. Risk assessment showed that Pb had the highest ecological risk (Er = 10.32), followed by Cu and Ni (Er = 8.77−8.81), while Zn had the lowest risk (Er = 1.59).

Initially hailed as the vanguard of a new era of rational policy-making, models are now habitually subject to critical analyses. Their quality, in other words, is routinely queried, yet what exactly is quality in this context? The prevailing paradigm views model quality as a multi-dimensional concept, encompassing technical dimensions (e.g. precision and bias), value judgments, problem-framing, treatment of “deep” uncertainties, and pragmatic features of particular decision contexts. Whilst those technical dimensions are relatively simple to characterise, the broader dimensions of quality are less easily formalised and as a result are difficult to take account of during model construction and evaluation. Here, we present a typology of governance regimes (risk-based, precautionary, adaptive and participatory) that helps make explicit what these broader dimensions of model quality are, and sketches out how the emphasis placed on them differs by regime type. We show that these regime types hold distinct positions on what constitutes sound evidence, on how that evidence should be used in policy-making, and to what social ends. As such, a model may be viewed within one regime as providing legitimate evidence for action, be down-weighted elsewhere for reflecting a flawed problem-framing, and outright rejected in another jurisdiction on the grounds that it does not cohere with the preferred ethical framework for decision-making. We illustrate these dynamics by applying our typology to a range of policy domains, emphasising both the disconnects that can occur, as well as the ways that modellers have adapted their practices to ensure that their evidence is brought to bear on policy problems across diverse regime types.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aethics 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3amathematical models 3apublic health 3auncertainty 0aScience policy 0aModel evaluation 0aRisk regulation 0aEnvironmental governance 0aCivic epistemologies 0aQuality evaluation1 aRichards, Keith0 tGlobal environmental change.g2015 July, v. 33 p.23-31dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011000155300001800265500002000283520098600303592002801289596005401317596006201371650001001433650000901443650001101452650003301463650001401496650001701510650001001527650002201537700001601559700001201575700001901587700001701606700005501623773015101678856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60637829020221122040418.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063782902DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.140732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoya10aEffects of aleurone‐rich fraction on the hydration and rheological properties attributes of wheat dough  ap. 1777-1786.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of incorporation of aleurone‐rich fraction (ALF) on the hydration and rheological properties of wheat dough. Incorporation of ALF significantly increased water absorption (P < 0.05) and competition for water in dough was observed. Peak viscosity, through viscosity, and final viscosity decreased with the amount of ALF added (P < 0.05), whereas 20% ALF had stronger gel ability than whole‐wheat flour. Dynamic rheological experiments revealed ALF blend dough were more stable than whole‐wheat dough, which was in accord with the higher dough stability and strength observed in Mixolab. Scanning electron microscopy showed that disruption of gluten network with ALF incorporation, whereas 20% ALF showed better stability dough structure than the whole‐wheat dough. Considering those influences on dough properties, the 20% ALF seems to be a promising substitute for whole‐wheat flour to producing dietary fibre‐rich products.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0401005cNational Key R&D Program of China  aCAAS‐XTCX2016005cCollaborative innovation task of CAAS 3adough 3agels 3agluten 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 3awheat 3awhole wheat flour1 aHu, Honghai1 aXu, Fen1 aLiu, Zhengquan1 aZhang, Liang1 aZhang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8849-84370 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.1777-1786dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.140733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007300162300002000235520081800255592002801073650001101101650001201112650001101124650001401135650001801149650001601167650002301183700001801206700002301224773012401247856007501371852000901446655001201455IND60559266120170927000000.0161204e20140925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055926612DNAL7 a10.1021/jp507146r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Gregorio,10aTheoretical Study on the Solvation of C60 Fullerene by Ionic Liquids  ap. 11330-11340.  aThe solvation of C60 fullerene by 24 different ionic liquids belonging to the imidazolium, piperazinium, and cholinium families was analyzed from a nanoscopic viewpoint using classic molecular dynamics simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. Charge transfer between the ions and fullerene were computed by DFT. Force field parametrization used in molecular dynamics simulations was corrected to reproduce DFT ion–C60 interaction mechanism. Structural, dynamic, and energetic factors were analyzed to infer the role of the studied ions on the behavior of fullerenes in ionic liquids. The intermolecular ion–C60 interaction energy controls the behavior of these fluids, leading to prevailing roles by interaction mechanism through the π system of C60 nanoparticle, both for anions and cations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3aenergy 3afullerene 3aionic liquids 3amethodology 3amolecular dynamics1 aAtilhan, Mert1 aAparicio, Santiago0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Sept. 25, v. 118, no. 38 p.11330-11340dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp507146r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245012100204520104300325592002801368650002001396650001401416650002001430650002401450650001001474650001501484650001701499650001501516650002601531653002101557653002501578653001001603653003401613700001801647700005301665700001601718700002001734700001301754700005701767773009501824856008401919852000902003655001202012IND60637492520221116213509.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063749252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2019.1015052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Guzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6500-039X10aEnhancing tricarboxylate transportation-related NADPH generation to improve biodiesel production by Aurantiochytrium  aAurantiochytrium, a unicellular eukaryotic marine microalga, is receiving considerable research attention because of its great potential in lipid and biodiesel production. To enhance the saturated fatty acid (SFA) and biodiesel production in Aurantiochytrium, we first aimed to improve tricarboxylate transportation-related NADPH generation by overexpressing the malic enzyme (ME)-encoding gene. The SFA yield of the resultant recombinant strain, termed SD116::ME, reached 6.42 g L−1. Subsequently, by feeding 30 mM malic acid at the late logarithmic phase, the SFA yield was further increased to 8.65 g L−1, which was an increase of >105% compared to the yield in the wild type. Moreover, the enhanced activities of ME and malic acid dehydrogenase led to an improvement in tricarboxylate transportation-related NADPH generation, which is essential for biodiesel production. This is the first report indicating a possibility for large-scale biodiesel production by regulating the NADPH generation system in Aurantiochytrium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiodiesel 3afuel production 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amalic acid 3amalic enzyme 3amicroalgae 3asaturated fatty acids 0aAurantiochytrium 0aSaturated fatty acid 0aNADPH 0aTricarboxylate transportation1 aWang, Zhuojun1 aHong, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3317-94011 aLiu, Ya-Jun1 aChen, Zhenghong1 aCui, Qiu1 aSong, Xiaojin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9094-37440 tAlgal research.g2019 June, v. 40 p.101505-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1015053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001900168245008500187300001800272500000900290520135600299592002801655650002201683650001301705650002101718650001501739650002701754650001401781650002701795650002001822650002001842650002301862650001401885650001201899650001401911650002501925651001101950651001901961651001801980700002601998700002102024700002202045773012202067852000902189856011202198856008402310961001302394655001202407IND4397894120221121180422.0191228e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439789412DNAL7 a10113/149312hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2006.05.03362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRíos, Domingo10aWhat Is the Origin of the European Potato? Evidence from Canary Island Landraces  ap. 1271-1280.  aepub  aThe modern cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was first recorded in Europe in the Canary Islands in 1567, but its origin has long been in dispute. Two competing hypotheses have proposed an “Andean” area (somewhere from the Andean uplands from Venezuela to northern Argentina) or a lowland south-central “Chilean” area, but the Andean origin hypothesis is today generally accepted. The identity of extant Canary Island potato landraces as exclusively of upland Andean origin is one part of a multicomponent argument that the European potato originated from there, rather than from Chile. We reassess these two competing hypotheses with nuclear microsatellite and chloroplast DNA analyses of 19 Canary Island landraces, 14 Andean landraces, 11 Chilean landraces, and two wild potato species as outgroups, and with chloroplast DNA data of 150 landraces from South America. Our molecular results document a wide variation of Andean- and Chilean-type cultivars on the Canary Islands and possible hybrids of the two. Our new data, integrated with historical, molecular, agronomic, and crossing data, support a hypothesis that there were multiple introductions of Andean and Chilean germplasm to the Canary Islands and that the early European potato was selected from Chilean introductions long before the late blight epiphytotics of the 1840s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3acenter of origin 3aprovenance 3ageographical variation 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3achloroplast DNA 3agenetic markers 3aDNA fingerprinting 3acultivars 3ahybrids 3agermplasm 3aagricultural history 3aEurope 3aCanary Islands 3aSouth America1 aGhislain, M.q(Marc),1 aRodríguez, Flor1 aSpooner, David M.0 tCrop science.g2007 May, v. 47, no. 3 p.1271-1280dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/149313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2006.05.03363Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02150naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002100167245005000188300001600238500000900254500001500263520109300278592002801371650002401399650001601423650001201439650001901451650001101470650001901481650001301500650001801513651001801531653001101549773012201560852000901682856009701691655001201788991559602910742620221122181053.0191122e197603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690407222DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800020017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, Robert E.10aTall Fescue Turf as Affected by Mowing Height  ap. 274-276.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aTall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a common turf and pasture grass in much of the United States. In an effort to determine the optimum cutting height for both uses, plots in a good stand of established tall fescue were mowed at 1.3, 2.5, 4, and 5 cm, when they reached a height 50% greater than the mowed height. The influence of cutting height on seasonal and total yield, appearance, density, and ground cover was determined. One-half at each plot was overseeded with fescue immediately prior to the test and also in the fall of the first year. In the first year, total yield was higher when mowed at the two lower cutting heights. There was no difference in yields the second year and overseeding had little effect on yield. Both cover and plant density were usually greater at the two intermediate cutting heights and in the overseeded plots when compared with non-overseeded plots. At the end of 4 years there was no difference in turf cover due to mowing height. This research indicates that with adequate fertilizer tall fescue can do well when maintained at low heights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3afertilizers 3agrasses 3alawns and turf 3amowing 3apasture plants 3apastures 3aplant density 3aUnited States 0aplants0 tAgronomy journal.g1976 Mar., v. 68, no. 2 p.274-276dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800020017x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245009700211300001100308506007600319520166400395592002802059506003702087650000802124650001202132650001202144650001002156651001102166651001202177651001202189651001002201651001102211700002202222700001502244700001902259700001902278700001802297700002102315700001902336700002102355700001602376700002402392700002402416773015902440856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60572859120221207122840.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057285912DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-017-0517-82doi7 aPMC54213332pmcid7 a284829142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Kristina10aTrends in educational inequalities in obesity in 15 European countries between 1990 and 2010  ap. 63.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity increased dramatically in many European countries in the past decades. Whether the increase occurred to the same extent in all socioeconomic groups is less known. We systematically assessed and compared the trends in educational inequalities in obesity in 15 different European countries between 1990 and 2010. METHODS: Nationally representative survey data from 15 European countries were harmonized and used in a meta-regression of trends in prevalence and educational inequalities in obesity between 1990 and 2010. Educational inequalities were estimated by means of absolute rate differences and relative rate ratios in men and women aged 30–64 years. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in the prevalence of obesity was found for all countries, except for Ireland (among men) and for France, Hungary, Italy and Poland (among women). Meta-regressions showed a statistically significant overall increase in absolute inequalities of 0.11% points [95% CI 0.03, 0.20] per year among men and 0.12% points [95% CI 0.04, 0.20] per year among women. Relative inequalities did not significantly change over time in most countries. A significant reduction of relative inequalities was found among Austrian and Italian women. CONCLUSION: The increase in the overall prevalence aligned with a widening of absolute but not of relative inequalities in obesity in many European countries over the past two decades. Our findings urge for a further understanding of the drivers of the increase in obesity in lower education groups particularly, and an equity perspective in population-based obesity prevention strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amen 3aobesity 3asurveys 3awomen 3aFrance 3aHungary 3aIreland 3aItaly 3aPoland1 aDe Gelder, Rianne1 aHu, Yannan1 aBopp, Matthias1 aVitrai, Jozsef1 aLahelma, Eero1 aMenvielle, Gwenn1 aSantana, Paula1 aRegidor, Enrique1 aEkholm, Ola1 aMackenbach, JohanP.1 avan Lenthe, FrankJ.0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.63-63dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-017-0517-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003300146245014200179520202800321592002802349650001902377650001302396650002502409650001702434650001602451650001602467650002002483650002402503650001602527650001302543650001002556650001502566650001102581700002202592700001902614700002502633700002102658700002302679700002302702700002502725700002202750700002302772773012302795856008102918852000902999655001203008IND60757585020221122230309.0211125e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075758502DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111123262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiattone, Maria Immacolata10aEffects of Nitrogen, Azoxystrobin and a Biostimulant Based on Brown Algae and Yeast on Wild Rocket Features at Harvest and During Storage  aRecently, the use of biostimulant substances of different origins has been affirmed. They act differently on the physiological processes of the plant, helping to improve its productive response and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Therefore, the response of the wild rocket to two substances known to have biostimulating activity (Azoxystrobin, and a fluid extract of brown algae and yeast), was evaluated. Two experimental trials (Exp 1 and Exp 2) were carried out in the greenhouse. The collected product, in addition to being evaluated from a qualitative point of view, was used for evaluation of shelf life. Exp 1 involved the comparison of two N levels with two Azoxystrobin levels (treated–Azo+, and untreated control). Exp 2 involved the comparison of two N levels, and two biostimulating substances based on Azoxystrobin (Azo+) and on fluid extracts of yeast and brown algae (YBA+), in addition to untreated control. A split-plot experimental design with three replications was used. Azo+ increased marketable yield of wild rocket by 16.8% and enhanced some qualitative features at harvest as the increase in chlorophyll (+17.8%) and carotenoids (+13.5%), and decrease in nitrates (−10.6%), regardless of the nitrogen level. Furthermore, Azo+ increased the shelf life (+2.5 days) of wild rocket stored at 3.5 °C. In particular, Azo+ slowed the loss of chlorophyll (yellowing) and the worsening of odor and visual appearance. As Azoxystrobin is a fungicide effective for the control of some diseases of wild rocket, its use should be promoted as it would offer not only the benefit of disease control but also improved production and shelf life. YBA+ caused an increase in the chlorophyll content (+12.5%) at harvest of wild rocket, but reduced its antioxidant activity (−40%). YBA+ did not cause substantial variations in shelf life with the exception of a slowdown in the degradation of carotenoids. Further research is desirable to evaluate other variables such as the dose and time of application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aagronomy 3aantioxidant activity 3aazoxystrobin 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adisease control 3aexperimental design 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3aodors 3ashelf life 3ayeasts1 aBoari, Francesca 1 aCantore, Vito 1 aCastronuovo, Donato 1 aDenora, Michele 1 aDi Venere, Donato 1 aPerniola, Michele 1 aRenna, Massimiliano 1 aSergio, Lucrezia 1 aCandido, Vincenzo 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111123263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144242013600177245010900313300001300422520086500435592002801300650001301328650001601341650001101357650001301368650000901381650001301390650001101403650001001414653002101424653001701445653001901462653002101481700002701502773012101529856007801650852000901728655001201737IND60694539820221123024814.0200513e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069453982DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapachristoforou, Alexandros10aAtracción y establecimiento directo de enjambres primarios y secundarios de abejas melíferas usando bolsas con tejido de enjambre10aAttraction and direct establishment of primary and secondary honey bee swarms using swarm-tissue sachets  ap. 8-11.  aIn an effort to attract swarms within an apiary and to induce their direct establishment in hive-traps, we investigated the use of a new honey bee swarm attractant in the form of a small sachet containing a wet-wipe tissue, including geranic acid, citral, geraniol and rose oil as attractants. When swarm-tissues sachets were placed in hive traps at a distance of either 5 or 30m from the colonies, 60% of the swarms were established directly and permanently inside hive traps. All established swarms were secondary, headed by virgin queen(s). No primary swarm was attracted. When swarm-tissue sachets were placed in hive traps and were also hung in nearby tree branches, 90.9% of the swarms were attracted. Nine primary swarms formed clusters around the swarm attractant sachets while one secondary swarm was attracted and established directly in a hive trap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapiaries 3aattractants 3acitral 3ageraniol 3aoils 3aresearch 3aswarms 3atrees 0aSwarm attraction 0aswarm-tissue 0aprimary swarms 0asecondary swarms1 aIlanidis, Konstantinos0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 52, no. 2 p.8-11dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04406naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010900171300001600280520235100296592002802647650002302675650001802698650001102716650002402727650002502751650001802776650002902794650001502823650001702838650001202855650001202867650002602879650001302905650001402918650002202932650001302954650001102967650001302978650002102991650001503012650001503027650001303042650001903055650002103074650001103095650001903106650002403125650002003149650001803169650001503187650002203202650001103224650001203235650001203247650002103259651001103280653001503291653001903306653001303325653002503338653002803363700006003391700002303451773010403474856008503578852000903663655001203672IND60535650920221117224211.0190408e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053565092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKernecker, Maria10aAgricultural management and flooding shape habitats for non-native earthworms in southern Quebec, Canada  ap. 240-250.  aAgricultural intensification leading to the cultivation of unmanaged field margins along rivers and streams is expected to impact soil biodiversity. Earthworm communities are typically smaller with fewer species in agricultural soils, but the effect of agriculture on earthworms could be mitigated by the more favorable soil moisture regime in riparian areas, as well as planting perennial grasses or keeping forest fragments as permanently vegetated buffers. The objective of this study was to compare earthworm community composition under contrasting land use (agricultural vs. riparian forest) ∼5m and ∼30m away from the Pike River in southern Quebec, Canada. Furthermore, we evaluated how earthworm communities were affected by management intensity, flooding, soil and vegetation patterns within these land uses. We established 4 transects at 3 sites along the Pike River representing 4 land uses (agricultural field, agricultural buffer, riparian forest fragment, upland forest fragment). Along each transect, earthworm populations and soil properties were evaluated at 5 discrete points on 4 occasions from fall 2009 to spring 2011. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were measured, and management and flooding intensity were documented through farmer surveys. Earthworm abundance and diversity were highest in a riparian forest transect (460individualsm−2, 9 species) and agricultural buffer (325individualsm−2, 10 species), and lowest in the agricultural fields with annual crop rotations and agrochemical inputs, which also had the lowest plant diversity. Redundancy analysis revealed that differences in earthworm species compositions across the study area were linked to site-specific management and flooding, represented by differences in soil moisture, vegetation diversity, and soil nutrient concentrations (dissolved organic carbon in soil solution, mineral nitrogen, extractable phosphorus). Generalized linear mixed modeling also showed that less intensively managed agricultural buffers and forest fragments with regular flooding supported higher earthworm diversity. We recommend further research on soil functions affected by earthworms in riparian areas because these non-native earthworms could affect the conservation value of unmanaged agricultural buffers and forest fragments in southern Quebec, Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aagrochemicals 3aautumn 3acommunity structure 3aconservation buffers 3acrop rotation 3adissolved organic carbon 3aearthworms 3aedge effects 3afarmers 3agrasses 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aintensive farming 3aland use 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aperennials 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3ariparian areas 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil properties 3asoil solution 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3astreams 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3aQuebec 0aEarthworms 0aRiparian areas 0aFlooding 0aManagement intensity 0aAgricultural landscapes1 aWhalen, Joann K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8774-05941 aBradley, Robert L.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2015 Nov., v. 96 p.240-250dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013200162300002000294520121100314592002801525650001401553650001201567650001101579650001301590650001401603650001901617650001601636650001501652653003001667653003001697653002201727653002501749653002101774653002601795700001701821700001901838700002001857700001301877700001801890700002001908773012601928856008002054852000902134655001202143IND60528332420221116144753.0160716e20150624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052833242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b043742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Won-Tae10aFacile Routes To Improve Performance of Solution-Processed Amorphous Metal Oxide Thin Film Transistors by Water Vapor Annealing  ap. 13289-13294.  aHere, we report on a simple and high-rate oxidization method for producing solution-based compound mixtures of indium zinc oxide (IZO) and indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) metal-oxide semiconductors (MOS) for thin-film transistor (TFT) applications. One of the issues for solution-based MOS fabrication is how to sufficiently oxidize the precursor in order to achieve high performance. As the oxidation rate of solution processing is lower than vacuum-based deposition such as sputtering, devices using solution-processed MOS exhibit relatively poorer performance. Therefore, we propose a method to prepare the metal-oxide precursor upon exposure to saturated water vapor in a closed volume for increasing the oxidization efficiency without requiring additional oxidizing agent. We found that the hydroxide rate of the MOS film exposed to water vapor is lower than when unexposed (≤18%). Hence, we successfully fabricated oxide TFTs with high electron mobility (27.9 cm²/V·s) and established a rapid process (annealing at 400 °C for 5 min) that is much shorter than the conventional as-deposited long-duration annealing (at 400 °C for 1 h) whose corresponding mobility is even lower (19.2 cm²/V·s).  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3agallium 3aindium 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3asemiconductors 3awater vapor 3azinc oxide 0ametal oxide semiconductor 0aindium gallium zinc oxide 0aindium zinc oxide 0athin-film transistor 0asolution process 0awater vapor annealing1 aSon, Inyoung1 aPark, Hyun-Woo1 aChung, Kwun-Bum1 aXu, Yong1 aLee, Taegweon1 aNoh, Yong-Young0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 24, v. 7, no. 24 p.13289-13294dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b043743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164300001600254520125300270592002801523650003701551650001501588650001501603650002501618650001301643650002101656650001901677650001701696650001101713650000701724650002301731650002101754650001601775700001801791700001301809700001201822773010201834856008101936990002302017852000902040655001202049IND60093191820221120101326.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009319182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Huijuan10aRemoval of Congo red dye from aqueous solution with hydroxyapatite/chitosan composite  ap. 336-342.  aChitosan (CS) has marked potential in environmental adsorption applications, but typically suffers from low specific gravity and sensitivity to pH. In this work, a hydroxyapatite-CS (HAp-CS) composite was developed via embedding of HAp into CS and used for removal of Congo red (CR) dye from aqueous solution. Effects of different weight contents of CS in HAp-CS composite, adsorbent dosage, initial pH, contact time and the initial dye concentration on CR removal were studied in detail using batch adsorption at room temperature. The kinetic data were best described by the pseudo-second-order model (R²>0.9999), while thermodynamic investigation of CR adsorption by HAp-CS composite confirmed a spontaneous adsorption. Further investigations demonstrated that the adsorption pattern fitted well with Langmuir model (R²>0.97) but less-satisfied with Freundlich model (R²<0.94). FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies showed that possible pathways for CR adsorption may include surface complexation, ion exchange and hydrogen bonding. HAp-CS composite containing 50wt% of CS exhibited adsorption capacity of 769mgg⁻¹ for CR (Langmuir model), which is much higher than that of pure CS, HA and other previously reported adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3achitosan 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxyapatite 3aion exchange 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3aspecific gravity 3atemperature1 aZhou, Ronghui1 aWu, Peng1 aWu, Lan0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 211-212 p.336-342dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.1003Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010100165300001600266520160500282592002801887650001501915650002501930650002401955650001601979650001401995650002002009700001602029700001802045700001602063700001402079700001602093773010202109856008102211990002302292852000902315655001202324IND60093191920221120101209.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009319192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Jianjun10aFree-standing open-ended TiO₂ nanotube membranes and their promising through-hole applications  ap. 343-352.  aFree-standing open-ended TiO₂ nanotube membranes were fabricated by raising voltage for a short time at the end of anodization process. Benefiting from its semiconducting nature and distinctive through-hole structure, the applications of open-ended TiO₂ nanotube membranes on flow-through photocatalysis and nanoreactor were demonstrated. As for flow-through photocatalysis, the photocatalytic property of TiO₂ is beneficial to reduce the concentration of RhB solution during RhB molecules diffuse through open-ended TiO₂ nanotube membrane. As for nanoreactor application, CdS@TiO₂ core–shell nanocables were successfully fabricated by a simple paired-cell reaction. A possible formation mechanism for the growth of core–shell structure was discussed on the basis of a series of electron microscopy characterization results. In addition, we evaluated the photocatalytic activity of CdS@TiO₂ samples synthesized at different reaction time through the degradation of rhodamine B under simulated sunlight irradiation. It was found that the CdS@TiO₂ samples synthesized at 24h exhibited about 100% enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to bare TiO₂ nanotubes, while the CdS@TiO₂ samples synthesized at 48h (core–shell nanocables) had the equivalent photocatalytic activity to the bare TiO₂ nanotubes. Such behavior that the photocalytic activity changes with CdS loading amount results from a compromise between a larger amount of light absorption and a lower efficiency of charge separation, as well as limited diffusion by channel blocking higher degree of CdS loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical engineering 3aelectron microscopy 3airradiation 3ananotubes 3asolar radiation1 aLin, Shiwei1 aPan, Nengqian1 aLi, Danhong1 aLi, Shipu1 aLi, Jianbao0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 211-212 p.343-352dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0703Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245007800173300001500251520126800266592002801534650002101562650000901583650001201592650001301604650001301617650001401630650002401644650001301668651001201681651001101693700002901704700002001733700002401753700002001777773008401797856008401881852000901965655001201974IND4482012720221120144001.0141110s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448201272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2011.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdvardsson, Johannes10aSouth Swedish bog pines as indicators of Mid-Holocene climate variability  ap. 93-103.  aDendroclimatic investigations of subfossil Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) from two raised bogs in southern Sweden yielded a continuous floating 1492-year long tree-ring record. By cross-dating with bog-pine chronologies from Lower Saxony, Germany, the South Swedish record was assigned an absolute age of 5219–3728 BC. The cross-match between ring-width chronologies from these two regions, separated by 500–700km, is remarkably strong and the correlation positive, which indicates that large-scale climate dynamics had a significant impact on the growth of bog pines during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) when bog-pine distribution reached a maximum in both regions. However, local population dynamics were also influenced by peatland ontogeny and competition, as shown by differences in replication and mean tree age between the Swedish and German records. Comparisons with chronologies developed from modern bog pines in southern Sweden indicate that more coherent climate was controlling pine growth on natural peatlands during warm periods in the past. This study demonstrates the usefulness of Swedish subfossil bog-pine material as a climate proxy, with particular potential for decadal- to centennial-scale reconstructions of humidity fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3abogs 3aclimate 3ahumidity 3aontogeny 3apeatlands 3apopulation dynamics 3atree age 3aGermany 3aSweden1 aLeuschner, Hanns-Hubert,1 aLinderson, Hans1 aLinderholm, Hans W.1 aHammarlund, Dan0 tDendrochronologia.g2012, v. 30, no. 2 p.93-103dElsevier GmbHx1125-78657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2011.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245012400248300001100372506007600383520175600459592002802215506003702243650001802280650002402298650001702322650001202339650001102351650003002362650001102392650001502403650001202418650001302430700002802443700002202471773011202493856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60572859320221207122844.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057285932DNAL7 a10.1186/s12983-017-0209-x2doi7 aPMC54230042pmcid7 a284911182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüsse, Sebastian1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-795014aThe head morphology of Pyrrhosoma nymphula larvae (Odonata: Zygoptera) focusing on functional aspects of the mouthparts  ap. 25.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The understanding of concerted movements and its underlying biomechanics is often complex and elusive. Functional principles and hypothetical functions of these complex movements can provide a solid basis for biomechanical experiments and modelling. Here a description of the cephalic anatomy of Pyrrhosoma nymphula (Zygoptera, Coenagrionidae) focusing on functional aspects of the mouthparts using micro computed tomography (μCT) is presented. RESULTS: We compared six different instars of the damselfly P. nymphula as well as one instar of the dragonfly Aeshna cyanea and Epiophlebia superstes each. In total 42 head muscles were described with only minor differences of the attachment points between the examined species and the absence of antennal muscle M. scapopedicellaris medialis (0an7) in Epiophlebia as a probable apomorphy of this group. Furthermore, the ontogenetic differences between the six larval instars are minor; the only considerable finding is the change of M. submentopraementalis (0la8), which is dichotomous in the early instars (I1,I2 and I3) with a second point of origin at the postero-lateral base of the submentum. This dichotomy is not present in any of the older instars studied (I6, middle-late and pen-ultimate). CONCLUSION: However, the main focus of the study herein, is to use these detailed morphological descriptions as basis for hypothetic functional models of the odonatan mouthparts. We present blueprint like description of the mouthparts and their musculature, highlighting the caused direction of motion for every single muscle. This data will help to elucidate the complex concerted movements of the mouthparts and will contribute to the understanding of its biomechanics not in Odonata only.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeshna cyanea 3aPyrrhosoma nymphula 3abiomechanics 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3amouthparts 3amuscles 3aontogeny1 aHörnschemeyer, Thomas,1 aGorb, StanislavN.0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.25-25dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-017-0209-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144242006800167245006700235300001400302520120700316592002801523650003101551650001301582650001601595650001801611650000901629650001001638650001901648650001801667650001701685650001701702650001101719650001301730650000901743650001301752650002501765651001001790653001701800653001901817653000801836653002501844700002301869700002301892773012201915856007802037852000902115655001202124IND60694540020221122220221.0200513e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069454002DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, Dattatraya G10aActividad antiinflamatoria del propóleos de Maharashtra, India10aAnti-inflammatory activity of propolis from Maharashtra, India  ap. 35-43.  aPropolis is a beehive product used in folk medicine. However, its composition and properties vary widely. Although anti-inflammatory activity of propolis collected from various regions of the world is reported, the potential of Indian propolis is not much explored. Present studies are carried out on propolis collected from Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra State, India. Determination of anti-inflammatory activity is carried out by topical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced ear oedema and systemic carrageenan induced rat paw oedema model. To standardize the constitution of the fractions studied, HPTLC profile of each of the fractions and volatile oil is recorded. The total ethanolic extract, all the fractions and volatile oil of propolis examined show significant topical anti-inflammatory activity. Ethyl acetate soluble fraction (EAFP) is found to be the most active fraction. Systemic study of EAFP shows that the activity is dose dependent and the dose of 200 mg/kg showed more reduction in inflammation at 4 h than that due to the standard Indomethacin at the concentration of 10 mg/kg. Thus the potential of propolis studied as a natural anti-inflammatory agent is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abeehives 3acarrageenan 3adose response 3aears 3aedema 3aessential oils 3aethyl acetate 3aindomethacin 3ainflammation 3amodels 3apropolis 3arats 3aresearch 3atraditional medicine 3aIndia 0avolatile oil 0achromatography 0aTPA 0arat paw oedema model1 aMujumdar, Arvind M1 aVaidya, Harshada S0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 52, no. 2 p.35-43dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011400161300001400275520061400289592002800903653001400931653002200945653003300967653002901000700001801029700001301047700002101060773014801081856007701229852000901306655001201315IND60522363020221119074818.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052236302DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2010-01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xi-Ying10aSyntheses and Structures of Silver(I) and Palladium(II) Complexes with Ferrocenyl-phosphonodithiolate Ligands  ap. 32-36.  aCoordinative interaction of [Ag(PPh₃)₂NO₃] or [Pd(MeCN)₂Cl₂] with in situ-prepared Na[FcP- (OR)S₂] afforded 1 : 1 products [FcP(OR)S₂Ag(PPh₃)₂] (R = Me 1, n-Pr 2) or the 1 : 2 product [{FcP(OMe)S₂}₂Pd] (3).

Chilean Andisols contain low quantities of Se and we have shown that bacteria can be used to enhance Se content of food plants and to improve the antioxidant system against different abiotic stresses. In this study, we prepared inocula based on previously selected Se tolerant endophytic bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. E6.2 and Bacillus sp. E5), which were supplemented with sodium selenite at 5mM. We studied the effect of this Se amount on bacterial synthesis of organic compounds and Se toxicity, NanoSe size, together with the role of Se in drought stress mitigation. Our results indicated that Acinetobacter sp. E6.2 produced elevated quantities of seleno-methionine (SeMet) and seleno-methyl-selenocysteine (SeMeSeCys) (10 and 3.77mgkg−1, respectively). However, highly stable NanoSe (Z potential around −40mV) was the main Se form found in both inocula. The size of NanoSe in Acinetobacter sp. was greater than in Bacillus sp. over time (i.e. 213±3.4nm and 169±0.92nm, respectively at 24h). Bacteria selenium supplementation did not induce oxidative stress due to similar superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Selenium did not affect cell tolerance to water deficit due to similar proline and indole acetic acid (IAA) production under drought stress conditions. The findings of this study suggest that these new endophytic bacteria inocula could be effective for Se biofortification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAndisols 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abiofortification 3acatalase 3aendophytes 3afeed supplements 3afood plants 3ahuman health 3aimmune system 3aindole acetic acid 3ainoculum 3aoxidative stress 3aproline 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asodium selenite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3awater stress 0aSelenium 0aBiofortification 0aEndophytic selenobacteria 0aOrganic selenium1 aAcuña, J.J.1 aGianfreda, L.1 aAzcón, R.1 aFunes-Collado, V.1 aMora, M.L.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2015 Nov., v. 96 p.319-326dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009100165300001600256520125900272592002801531650001501559650001201574650002501586650001401611650002201625650001001647650001101657650001901668650002301687700002201710700002101732700002001753773010201773856008101875990002301956852000901979655001201988IND60093192120221122223315.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009319212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLescano, Maia10aKinetic modeling of arsenic (III) oxidation in water employing the UV/H₂O₂ process  ap. 360-368.  aIn a previous study it has been shown that the combination of hydrogen peroxide and UVC radiation is an effective and feasible process to oxidize arsenic in water. In this work, a kinetic model for the photo-oxidation of As (III) is presented. An initial concentration of 200μg/L of As (III) was used. The model was based on mechanistic reaction steps and included the modeling of the local radiation absorption effects. The evaluation of the radiation field inside the reactor was achieved by solving the radiative transfer equation for the homogeneous system. Both dark and photochemical arsenic oxidation rates were incorporated in the complete kinetic expression. Three parameters were estimated and a simplified model that only considered photoactivated reactions was developed. The rates obtained from these simplifications were compared with the rates from the complete model and showed a satisfactory concordance. The study was carried out in a cylindrical reactor operated in batch recirculation mode and two germicidal lamps were used (λ=254nm) as the source of radiation. Experimental runs were performed varying the hydrogen peroxide concentration and incident radiation. Both models rendered a good representation of the experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aarsenic 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alamps 3amodels 3aphotooxidation 3aradiative transfer1 aZalazar, Cristina1 aCassano, Alberto1 aBrandi, Rodolfo0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 211-212 p.360-368dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0753Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015900155300002000314520200000334592002802334650001602362650003202378650001502410650001702425650001402442650002002456650001102476650001302487650001802500650003002518650002402548650002502572653001802597653003002615653001102645653005602656653002302712700001302735700002102748700001702769700001702786700001802803773012602821856007502947961001703022852000903039655001203048IND60528332720221116144818.0160716e20150624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052833272DNAL7 a10.1021/am508842v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yalong10aNanoparticles Affect PCR Primarily via Surface Interactions with PCR Components: Using Amino-Modified Silica-Coated Magnetic Nanoparticles as a Main Model  ap. 13142-13153.  aNanomaterials have been widely reported to affect the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, many studies in which these effects were observed were not comprehensive, and many of the proposed mechanisms have been primarily speculative. In this work, we used amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ASMNPs, which can be collected very easily using an external magnetic field) as a model and compared them with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, which have been studied extensively) to reveal the mechanisms by which nanoparticles affect PCR. We found that nanoparticles affect PCR primarily by binding to PCR components: (1) inhibition, (2) specifity, and (3) efficiency and yield of PCR are impacted. (1) Excess nanomaterials inhibit PCR by adsorbing to DNA polymerase, Mg²⁺, oligonucleotide primers, or DNA templates. Nanoparticle surface-active groups are particularly important to this effect. (2, a) Nanomaterials do not inhibit nonspecific amplification products caused by false priming as previously surmised. It was shown that relatively low concentrations of nanoparticles inhibited the amplification of long amplicons, and increasing the amount of nanoparticles inhibited the amplification of short amplicons. This concentration phenomenon appears to be the result of the formation of “joints” upon the adsorption of ASMNPs to DNA templates. (b) Nanomaterials are able to inhibit nonspecific amplification products due to incomplete amplification by preferably adsorbing single-stranded incomplete amplification products. (3) Some types of nanomaterials, such as AuNPs, enhance the efficiency and yield of PCR because these types of nanoparticles can adsorb to single-stranded DNA more strongly than to double-stranded DNA. This behavior assists in the rapid and thorough denaturation of double-stranded DNA templates. Therefore, the interaction between the surface of nanoparticles and PCR components is sufficient to explain most of the effects of nanoparticles on PCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aadsorption 3adenaturation 3amagnesium 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asurface interactions 0ananomaterials 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aeffect 0aamino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles 0agold nanoparticles1 aCui, Yan1 aPaoli, George C.1 aShi, Chunlei1 aWang, Dapeng1 aShi, Xianming0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 24, v. 7, no. 24 p.13142-13153dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam508842v3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012200166300001400288520104800302592002801350653001801378653002201396653001201418653002801430653000801458700002301466700002401489700002001513700002201533773014801555856007701703852000901780655001201789IND60522363120221119074827.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052236312DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2010-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogdanov, Milen G.10aNew Guanidinium-based Room-temperature Ionic Liquids.

The interplanar spacing of as-synthesized GO in X-ray diffraction spectra has been reduced by the thermal annealing at 1100°C. First-order Raman spectra revealed that the intensity ratio of the D and G bands of B-doped GO was significantly lower than those of as-synthesized and annealed GOs, suggesting more graphitization of the B-doped GO due to doping effect. The C1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of B-doped GO films not only indicated that considerable amount of functional groups has been removed but also exhibited the peak of CB band at around 283.7eV. Additionally, the B1s XPS spectrum of B-doped GOs could be deconvoluted into several peaks centered at 187.2, 188.9, 190.3, 192.0 and 193.7eV, being attributed to the presence of B atom in B₄C, B-sub-C, BC₂O, BCO₂ and B₂O₃, respectively. Comparison of the photoluminescence spectra of B-doped GO with that of 1100°C-annealed GO indicated that the overall intensity was decreased, presumably due to the B-induced graphitization. An additional band at around 600–700nm from B-doped GO is attributed to the generated boron carbide phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3aboron 3achemical engineering 3agraphene 3aoptical properties 3aoxides 3aspatial distribution1 aNa, Han Gil1 aKwak, Dong Sub1 aKwon, Yong Jung1 aHam, Heon1 aShim, Kwang Bo1 aKim, Hyoun Woo0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 211-212 p.369-377dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0813Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014600168300001600314520201500330592002802345650001802373650001802391650001502409650001902424650002602443650001202469650001202481650001202493650001902505650002402524650001102548650001102559650002002570650002402590650002702614650002902641650001602670650002302686650001502709650003102724650001202755650002502767650001802792650001402810650002002824650001802844650002702862653001202889653000802901653001402909653002102923653002202944653003302966700005402999773010403053856008503157852000903242655001203251IND60535651420221117224011.0190408e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053565142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndert, Janet10aImpact of pyrolysis and hydrothermal biochar on gas-emitting activity of soil microorganisms and bacterial and archaeal community composition  ap. 225-239.  aMost biochar studies are focusing on the usage of char produced by pyrolysis (pyrochar). However, only dry biomass can be subjected to pyrolysis. It is beneficial to produce biochar by hydrothermal carbonization (hydrochar) from wet biomass to avoid energy use for drying. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of pyrochar and hydrochar on greenhouse gas-emitting activity, abundance and composition of the soil bacterial and archaeal community. Three different moisture contents (40%, 60% and 80% of water holding capacity) and two N fertilization steps (with and without N addition) were investigated. The microcosm study was conducted in 120mL glass bottles with septum caps for periodic headspace gas analysis. N2O and CO2 emissions from pyrochar were in the same range as the char-free control. Hydrochar, however, caused high N2O emissions in the fertilized high moisture treatment and significantly higher CO2 emissions in all treatments compared to the control. Pyrochar increased CH4 emission in the unfertilized treatments, whereas hydrochar had no effect except a small reduction in the fertilized and highest moisture treatment. Enzyme activity in all pyrochar microcosms was in the same range as the char-free control, but lower in unfertilized hydrochar microcosms. Pyrochar soil amendment did not change bacterial and archaeal abundance. Hydrochar decreased archaeal abundance in the majority of the treatments. T-RFLP analysis revealed that pyrochar, hydrochar and control each developed a distinct bacterial community. Pyrochar had no effect on archaeal communities, whereas hydrochar induced the formation of significantly different communities compared to the control. Furthermore, hydrochar reduced the abundance of Acidobacteria and Firmicutes, while it remarkably increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. The results suggest that the addition of hydrochar induces considerably stronger effects on soil microbial communities than the addition pyrochar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abottles 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3adrying 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizer analysis 3afertilizer application 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouses 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3amethane 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3apyrolysis 3asoil amendments 3asoil bacteria 3awater holding capacity 0aBiochar 0aHTC 0aPyrolysis 0aGreenhouse gases 0aSoil microbiology 0aMicrobial community dynamics1 aMumme, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0125-62140 tApplied soil ecology.g2015 Nov., v. 96 p.225-239dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169520118800298592002801486650001601514650001501530650001501545650001301560650001201573650000901585650001801594650001901612650001501631650000701646650001501653650002001668650001501688650002501703653002501728653002501753653001901778653001901797700001701816700001301833773010801846856008601954852000902040655001202049IND60752745420221120065030.0220531e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075274542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaolin10aSimultaneous adsorption for cationic and anionic dyes using chitosan/electrospun sodium alginate nanofiber composite sponges  aThe coexistence of anionic and cationic dyes in dye wastewater has highlighted a great necessity to develop amphoteric adsorbents for their simultaneous removal. Herein, an amphoteric composite sponge was successfully fabricated by combining chitosan with electrospun sodium alginate nanofiber using lyophilization in acetic acid/water/dioxane mixed solvents, which owned the abundant functional groups and superior microstructure of interconnected pores and nanoscale fibers, beneficial for the adsorption capacity improvement. The optimum adsorption capacities for Acid Blue-113 and Rhodamine B were 926.2 ± 25.7 mg/g and 695.4 ± 17.0 mg/g, respectively, much higher than that of the controlled sample prepared with chitosan and non-spinning sodium alginate in traditional acetic acid/water solvents. Meanwhile, the sponge provided with the superior adsorption performance under various pH environment and cyclic adsorption. Importantly, it had considerable simultaneous adsorption capacity for binary system containing anionic and cationic dyes. Overall, the chitosan/electrospun sodium alginate nanofiber composite sponge shows potential for complex wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achitosan 3adioxane 3adyes 3afreeze drying 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3apH 3arhodamines 3asodium alginate 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAmphoteric adsorbent 0aSimultaneous removal 0aDye wastewater 0aMicrostructure1 aWang, Xuejun1 aLou, Tao0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 276 p.118728-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144242015200164245012500316300001400441520153300455592002801988650001502016650001102031650001202042650002102054650002002075650001002095650001502105650001302120650001502133650001402148650001002162650001802172650001302190650001102203650001602214650001102230653001402241653001402255653001702269653001302286653001702299700002602316700001802342700002302360773012202383856007802505852000902583655001202592IND60694540320221122220313.0200513e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069454032DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToomemaa, Kalle10aDeterminación de la cantidad de agua condensada por encima y por debajo del grupo de invierno de abejas melíferas en un clima del norte de Europa10aDetermining the amount of water condensed above and below the winter cluster of honey bees in a North—European Climate  ap. 81-87.  aThe amount of water condensed in the hives of overwintering honey bee colonies was investigated. In autumn, condensers of thin sheet metal were placed in hives above and below the frames of the winter nests of the experimental colonies. The condensed water could flow into plastic bottles for collection. Most of the water collected during the winter condensed on the lower devices, only 2.5 ± 1.31% on the upper ones. At an average food consumption of 7.17 ± 0.35 kg, the amount of water condensed was 445.27 ± 45.8 g. The total amount of water released by such food consumption would be 4.88 ± 0.24 kg. The upper condensers increased moisture and wet surfaces in the hive, whereas the lower ones did not. Test and control colonies did not differ significantly in food consumption and bee mortality. The top condenser created additional airspace above the cluster and probably metabolic water vapour released from the cluster, having risen up first started descending, but due to the longer distance to the lower condenser it cooled more and condensed on the hive walls. The results show that in hives without top ventilation, it would be appropriate to remove descended water vapour from below of the nest or to retain it in the hive for spring consumption of the bees. It enables to reduce humidity in the nest of bees without strengthened ventilation to withdraw increased heat loss and enforces the bees to rise the metabolic rate and heat production, which in turn would increase food consumption and water production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapiculture 3aautumn 3aclimate 3afood consumption 3aheat production 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3ahumidity 3ametabolism 3amortality 3anests 3aoverwintering 3aresearch 3aspring 3awater vapor 3awinter 0ahoney bee 0awintering 0awater vapour 0amoisture 0acondensation1 aMartin, Ants-Johannes1 aMänd, Marika1 aWilliams, Ingrid H0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 52, no. 2 p.81-87dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.52.2.173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01573naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009300167300002000260520036300280592002800643650002200671650001800693650001100711650001800722650001300740653002100753653001800774653002100792653003200813700002200845700002000867700002000887700002600907700002400933773014100957856008001098852000901178655001201187IND60528332920221116144829.0160716e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052833292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b040852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawamura, Ken-ichi10aZeolite Membrane for Dehydration of Isopropylalcohol–Water Mixture by Vapor Permeation  ap. 13728-13730.  aHighly stable FAU-type zeolite membrane for the separation of isopropanol (IPA)-water mixture by pervaporation is described.

The SH and MCC were used at different concentrations (0, 2.5, and 5.0% w/w), and glycerol (25–30 % w/w) was used as a plasticizer to obtain films by extrusion. The addition of 2.5% SH and MCC led to films with lower solubility, water vapor permeability and hygroscopicity than pure starch film, and incorporation of 2.5% MCC improved the film flexibility. The addition of 5% fiber (SH or MCC) resulted in more brittle and hygroscopic films. The incorporation of 2.5% SH and MCC generated films with better performance than that of pure starch ones, and this combination could be a strategy to obtain extruded films with a fully renewable source of polymeric matrix composed mainly of starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acassava starch 3acellulose 3aextrusion 3afood packaging 3aglycerol 3ahygroscopicity 3apermeability 3aplasticizers 3apolymers 3ashelf life 3asolubility 3asoybean hulls 3astarch 3awater vapor 0aBiodegradable packaging 0aAgro-industrial residue 0aExtrusion 0aMechanical properties 0aCellulosee1 aMarim, Renan Guilherme1 aUrbano, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5057-19821 aMali, Suzana0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2019 June, v. 20 p.100321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1003213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012700177300001600304520083200320592002801152650001301180650002201193650001201215650001101227650001201238650001301250650001501263650002201278650001501300650002401315650002201339650001301361651001201374653002401386653002201410653001201432653002301444653001901467700001401486700002201500773009401522856008501616852000901701655001201710IND60559267020221121021755.0161204e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055926702DNAL7 a10.2989/20702620.2016.12071342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHainduwa, Feliciana N10aImpact of fuelwood quality and quantity on the energy use of rural households in the Omusati Region, north-central Namibia  ap. 299-306.  aThe relation between fuelwood use and fuelwood quality and quantity was studied in two northern Namibian rural communities with different levels of fuelwood availability. Household surveys were conducted and fuelwood quality was assessed through laboratory studies. The study found differences in fuelwood use and adaptation of liveli-hoods to fuelwood availability. Where there was an abundance of quality fuelwood, the community chose fuelwood intuitively in accordance with the optimum physical properties and in a sustainable way. A fuelwood shortage, however, was found to impact negatively on work and social practices and fuelwood was collected through destructive harvesting practices, such as the cutting of green branches, and without consideration for optimum timber properties, such as tree age and calorific value.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3acollective action 3acutting 3aenergy 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aharvesting 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aphysical properties 3arural communities 3atree age 3aNamibia 0afuelwood properties 0afuelwood shortage 0aNamibia 0arural fuelwood use 0asustainability1 aHam, Cori1 aMeincken, Martina0 tSouthern forests.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 78, no. 4 p.299-306dTaylor & Francisx2070-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/20702620.2016.12071343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01925naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245009200198300001800290500001100308520096400319592002801283650002001311650001701331650002001348650001301368650002001381773015101401856007401552852000901626655001201635IND60637829820221122045250.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063782982DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.140542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraś, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6082-386410aInfluence of physiological and chemical factors on the absorption of bioactive peptides  ap. 1486-1496.  aREVIEW  aFood‐derived bioactive peptides can be released during digestion and have a potentially beneficial effect on human health. It is known that the penetration of peptides across the small intestine can take place in several ways. The research related to the bioavailability of peptides develops dynamically, but still raises many doubts. Since there are many barriers to absorption of peptides, there is still a need to carry out in vitro and in vivo investigations on the bioavailability of these compounds. Moreover, there are few in vivo studies regarding the absorption and activity of peptides in organs, hence the lack of unequivocal and reliable information about this process. Therefore, this review discusses the current research on in vitro and in vivo absorption of these compounds and factors that play a key role in this process and provides better understanding of the in vitro and in vivo bioavailability and bioaccessibility of peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ahuman health 3ain vivo studies 3apeptides 3asmall intestine0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.1486-1496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.140543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013100172300001600303520148700319592002801806650001501834650001101849650001901860650002501879650001101904650001001915650001501925650001601940650001201956700001901968700001801987773010202005856008102107990002302188852000902211655001202220IND60093192620221120101342.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009319262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelaissaoui, Bouchra10aMembrane gas separations and post-combustion carbon dioxide capture: Parametric sensitivity and process integration strategies  ap. 122-132.  aReducing the energy requirement is the primary challenge for post-combustion CO₂ capture technologies. Growing interest is being shown in membrane processes as an alternative to the reference technologies (such as gas–liquid absorption in amine absorption). However, these membrane processes remain energy intensive when the recommended CO₂ purity and capture ratio (both typically at 90%) are imposed. In this study, a systematic parametric analysis of the energy requirement of a single stage membrane gas separation module has been performed. Different inlet CO₂ contents and membrane selectivity performances have been compared. In contrast to previous studies, the capture ratio and CO₂ purity constraints have been relaxed below the 90% target in order to possibly identify the most appropriate role and place of membrane processes in a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) framework. It is shown that diluted CO₂ feed streams (such as natural gas turbine flue gases) systematically require excessive energy for CO₂ capture. However, single stage membrane units offer interesting possibilities with a very low energy requirement when used as a pre-concentration step for a moderate inlet CO₂ content (15–30%) or as a final step for concentrated streams (50% inlet CO₂ content or more). Finally, guidelines for improved integration strategies of membrane units in different carbon capture scenarios, with a particular emphasis on hybrid processes, are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical engineering 3aenergy 3agases 3aguidelines 3anatural gas 3astreams1 aWillson, David1 aFavre, Éric,0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 211-212 p.122-132dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01401naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245006200156300001400218520026600232592002800498650001400526650001500540650004400555650001300599650002200612653002500634653001700659653002600676653001900702653001800721700001700739700001800756700001900774773014800793856007700941852000901018655001201027IND60522363620221119145652.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052236362DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2010-01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ning10aTwo Novel Norlignan Derivatives from Curculigo breviscapa  ap. 79-82.  aTwo novel skeleton-rearranged norlignans, breviscaside A (1) and breviscapin B (2), have been isolated from the rhizomes of Curculigo breviscapa.

In this context, we investigated the combined effects of N application levels and inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense on maize plant biomass, grain yield, agronomic efficiency (AE), and N content in plants, focusing on the economic feasibility of maize production systems. The field trial involved four N application levels (control, low, average and high, i.e., 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, applied as sidedress) either with seed inoculation with A. brasilense or without inoculation. Inoculation with A. brasilense enhanced AE and N uptake in maize plants with increased shoot, root and grain N accumulation, augmenting grain yield by 7%. The increase in total N accumulation was mainly the result of improved N-NH₄⁺ accumulation in plant roots and shoots. Our results showed that it is possible to reduce the N fertilization level by 50% while increasing the operating profit by 11% with A. brasilense inoculation. Additionally, when inoculation was performed in the presence of a high N level, the operating profit was 11% higher than that for the same N level in the absence of inoculation. Therefore, in view of the low economic cost, ease of application, and high probability of a positive response by maize crops, even in the presence of different N application levels, inoculation with A. brasilense has the potential to be a key technology for improving plant-soil N management, leading to more sustainable maize production under tropical conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aagronomy 3acorn 3aeconomic costs 3aeconomic feasibility 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3aphytomass 3aprobability 3asavannas 3aseed inoculation 3atotal nitrogen 0aZea mays 0aImproved nitrogen management 0aPlant growth promoting rhizobacteria 0aSustainable crop production 0aTropical agriculture1 aRodrigues, Willian Lima1 aFernandes, Guilherme Carlos1 aBoleta, Eduardo Henrique Marcandalli1 aJalal, Arshad1 aRosa, Poliana Aparecida Leonel1 aBuzetti, Salatiér1 aLavres, José1 aTeixeira Filho, Marcelo Carvalho Minhoto0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2022 Mar., v. 134 p.126471-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.1264713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012600201300001600327500002000343520203600363592002802399596013602427596013002563596008102693596007802774596004202852596004202894650001502936650001202951650001902963650002302982650002103005650001503026650002603041650002003067650003003087650002403117650002603141650001403167650002303181650002303204650001303227650001103240650002103251650001103272650002103283650001603304650001503320651002203335700007603357700006803433773012603501856007303627852000903700655001203709IND60637830020221122045157.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063783002DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadinger, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2637-946410aEnvironmental filtering governs the spatial distribution of alien fishes in a large, human‐impacted Mediterranean river  ap. 701-714.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To analyse the occurrence and abundance of native versus alien fish species in relation to climate, land use, hydrologic alteration and habitat fragmentation in a heavily invaded and human‐impacted riverine ecosystem. To test whether co‐occurrence patterns of native versus alien species are structured by environmental filtering or biotic associations. LOCATION: Mediterranean, Iberian Peninsula, Ebro River catchment. METHODS: We modelled freshwater fish distributions and their association with environmental conditions using a hurdle model‐like approach involving boosted regression trees. Additionally, we applied a joint species distribution model to quantify the co‐occurrence of native versus alien fish species that can be attributed to shared environmental responses or potentially to biotic interactions. RESULTS: Our results point to environmental factors, rather than biotic associations, as major correlates of the increase of alien and the decline of native fishes in the Ebro River. We observed contrasting patterns of native versus alien species along the upstream‐downstream gradient. Alien species dominated in the lower reaches associated with warmer temperatures, higher shares of intensive land use and appeared facilitated by dams and river regulation. Native species richness was highest in the larger tributaries followed by a strong decline in the main stem which was related to the river network position and land use type. Fragmentation played a subordinate role in explaining fish richness and abundance patterns. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Given the strong association with temperature, a further range expansion of alien fishes in the Ebro with future climate change may be expected. More local‐scale factors related to habitat degradation and hydrologic alteration will further exacerbate the invasion success of many alien fishes. Further multiple, independent species introductions might mask isolation and fragmentation effects of dams on the future spread and distribution of alien fish.  aPublisher supplied data  aBiodivERsA3-2015-26cBiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities  aPCIN-2016-168cBiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities  aCGL2015-69311-REDTcSpanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities  aCGL2016-80820-RcSpanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities  a2014 SGR 484cGovernment of Catalonia  a2017 SGR 548cGovernment of Catalonia 3abiocenosis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acolonizing ability 3adams (hydrology) 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater fish 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahydrology 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aland use 3amodels 3ariver regulation 3arivers 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aIberian Peninsula1 aAlcaraz‐Hernández, Juan Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6885-66951 aGarcía‐Berthou, Emili1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8412-741X0 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.701-714dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245011000184300001600294500000900310500001500319520129600334592002801630650002001658650002901678650001601707650001301723653001101736700001701747700001401764773012201778852000901900856009601909655001202005991559609690742620221120044940.0191122e197603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690407362DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800020031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanhill, G.10aEffect of Increasing Foliage and Soil Reflectivity on the Yield and Water Use Efficiency of Grain Sorghum  ap. 329-332.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of increasing foliage and soil reflectivity on yield and water use efficiency of grain Sorghum crops (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) grown under arid conditions with stored soil water only, was studied during 3 years of randomized block field experiments. Suspensions of kaolin were sprayed on the soil and/or foliage at different growth stages to select the most effective placement and timing for the treatment. Soil-only applications were ineffective in increasing yields but canopy sprays resulted in an additional yield of 446 kg/ha, or 11% over the unsprayed controls, averaged over the 3 years of experimentation. The most effective period for foliage sprays started seven weeks after seedling emergence and ended 10 days later, immediately before the panicles emerged. During this period, known to be critical for Sorghum grain yield response to water status, the yield response averaged 2 kg grain/1 kg kaolin applied. Neither the total seasonal water use nor the rate of soil water depletion was affected by the foliage reflectance treatment. It is concluded that under arid conditions, kaolin suspensions sprayed twice on the foliage of unirrigated grain Sorghum crops during the prepanicle-emergence stage shows promise as an effective method of increasing grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aplant cultural practices 3afield crops 3aagronomy 0aplants1 aMoreshet, S.1 aFuchs, M.0 tAgronomy journal.g1976 Mar., v. 68, no. 2 p.329-332dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800020031x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01622naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002400188245006700212300001100279506007600290520049900366592002800865596005900893596006500952506003701017650001001054650002901064650001101093773010101104856008201205852000901287655001201296IND60572860020221207052646.0220802e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057286002DNAL7 aPMC54229332pmcid7 a284828572pmid7 a10.1186/s13059-017-1214-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalzberg, Steven L.10aHorizontal gene transfer is not a hallmark of the human genome  ap. 85.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrisp et al. recently reported that 145 human genes have been horizontally transferred from distant species.

Sedentary grazing with substantial external inputs has increased the cost of livestock production. As a result, the livelihoods of herders have become more vulnerable to climate variability and change. Sedentary grazing is the formal institutional arrangement in Inner Mongolia, China. However, this may not be an efficient institutional arrangement for climate change adaptation. Self-organized local institutions for climate change adaptation have emerged and are under development in the study area. In this study, we did exploratory analyses of multiple local institutions for climate change adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands, using an agent-based modeling approach. Empirical studies from literature and our field work show that sedentary grazing, pasture rental markets, and reciprocal pasture-use groups are three popular institutional arrangements in the study area. First, we modeled the social–ecological performance (i.e., livelihood benefits to herders and grassland quality) of these institutions and their combinations under different climate conditions. Second, we did exploratory analyses of multiple social mechanisms for facilitating and maintaining cooperative use of pastures among herders. The modeling results show that in certain value-ranges of some model parameters with assumed values, reciprocal pasture-use groups had better performance than pasture rental markets; and the comparative advantage of cooperative use of pastures over sedentary grazing without cooperation becomes more evident with the increase in drought probability. Agent diversity and social norms were effective for facilitating the development of reciprocal pasture-use groups. Kin selection and punishments on free-riders were useful for maintaining cooperation among herders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3akin selection 3alivelihood 3alivestock production 3amarkets 3amodels 3apastures 3aprobability 3asocial behavior 3aChina 0aSocial adaptation 0aClimate change 0aLocal institutions 0aAgent-based modeling 0aMongolian grasslands1 aBrown, Daniel G.1 aRiolo, Rick L.1 aPage, Scott E.1 aAgrawal, Arun0 tGlobal environmental change.g2013 Oct., v. 23 p.1266-1276dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245010600158300001600264520096100280536011901241592002801360650002201388650002001410650001401430650003201444650001101476650001401487650001101501650001001512650000801522650001501530650001201545650001001557653002401567653003801591653002201629653002101651773011101672856008001783852000901863655001201872IND60620965620221120041900.0181114e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062096562DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642187688702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yu10aEarnings of Academic Scientists and Engineers: Intersectionality of Gender and Race/Ethnicity Effects  ap. 625-644.  aWhile research increasingly examines the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity in science and engineering, not much is known regarding how they work together to affect career outcomes. This article examines gender earnings gaps among academic scientists and engineers by race/ethnicity. Using data from National Science Foundation’s Survey of Doctorate Recipients (2003, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2013), I find that White women earned less than their male counterparts in 2003 and 2006, but the earnings gap closed over time. African American women did not earn less than their male counterparts in any year. Asian American women earned less only in 2013 (due to the high income of Asian American men), and Hispanic women earned less only in 2010 (due to their low income relative to other groups). The findings of relative improvement in gender earnings equality are analyzed in the context of disadvantages women face in other aspects of their careers.  aFunding The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aAsian Americans 3aHispanics 3aNational Science Foundation 3aWhites 3aengineers 3aincome 3amales 3amen 3ascientists 3asurveys 3awomen 0agender earnings gap 0aacademic scientists and engineers 0aintersectionality 0amarginal effects0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 62, no. 5 p.625-644dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642187688703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013900168300001100307520166600318592002801984650002302012650002502035650002402060650001102084650001302095650002102108650002302129651000902152700003202161700002102193773014102214856008202355852000902437655001202446IND60676394820221122100425.0191216e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067639482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-019-1335-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmasieh, Kamran10aBiodiversity hotspots for modeled habitat patches and corridors of species richness and threatened species of reptiles in central Iran  ap. 92.  aIn recent years, the distribution range of reptiles has greatly shrunk. Reptiles are sensitive to habitat degradation and fragmentation, and are thus ideal focal species for studies on habitat connectivity modeling. In this study, we conducted habitat and corridor modeling for 11 species out of nine families of reptiles and two vulnerable species in Qom province, central Iran, in order to identify biodiversity hotspots of species richness and threatened species for these reptiles and to compare these hotspots with current protected areas. Habitat modeling was carried out using MaxEnt for each species, and habitat patches were obtained from suitable polygons which included occurrence points. Least-cost corridors among these patches were designed using CorridorDesigner. We identified 40 habitat patches and 32 corridors among these patches for the species. The highest species richness was six species for the overlaid map of identified patches and four for the overlaid map of identified corridors. Biodiversity hotspots of species richness and two threatened species for both habitat patches and corridors covered about 22% and 14% of Qom province, respectively. These two hotspots had large overlapping areas (more than half of their areas) and showed the same general pattern. Comparison between the two types of biodiversity hotspots (i.e., species richness and threatened species) and the available protected areas revealed that the hotspots are mainly located outside of the protected areas. Therefore, these hotspots should be given the highest priority for conservation and be taken into consideration by the Department of Environment of Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahabitat destruction 3amodels 3areptiles 3aspecies richness 3avulnerable species 3aIran1 aMirghazanfari, Seyyed Mehdi1 aMahmoodi, Shirin0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2019 Dec., v. 65, no. 6 p.92-92dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-019-1335-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520173100288592002802019650001002047650001502057650001102072650002202083650001102105650001402116650001502130650001102145650001402156650002302170650001402193650002302207651001102230653002402241653002302265653002802288653002502316653003102341653001102372700002902383700002202412700002602434700005702460700005802517773011902575856008402694852000902778655001202787IND60556565320221118121112.0161102e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055656532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastos, Alex C.10aOrigin and sedimentary evolution of sinkholes (buracas) in the Abrolhos continental shelf, Brazil  ap. 101-111.  aCup-shaped depressions (termed buracas by local fishermen) are common geomorphic features on the northeastern Abrolhos continental shelf (Brazil). Samples collected by technical diving from the walls of two depressions (Buraca Funda, B1, top at 59m, and Buraca Rasa, B2, top at 26m) and seismic profiles provide evidence of the processes leading to their formation. The top of the sedimentary succession consists of two units bounded by erosion unconformities. Unit 1 overlies an erosion surface (MR1) and is older than the radiocarbon dating limit. It is made up of packstone to rudstone accumulated on mid- to outer-shelf paleoenvironments. Voids in the limestone are filled by a meteoric cement 29,000calyrs BP in B2. It is assumed that Unit 1 formed in the late Pleistocene, mainly during MIS 5e. An erosion surface (MR2) carved sinkholes in Unit 1, with karstification taking place while the ACS was emergent during the last glacial period. The timing and span of subaerial exposure changes with depth within the shelf. Unit 2 accumulated on this karst surface in the Holocene, after postglacial sea level rise. At the B1 margin, Unit 2 consists of early-lithified packstone to rudstone with attached corals. In B2, the Holocene unit comprises a boundstone of encrusting invertebrates and calcareous algae similar to the living ones attached to the wall today. High productivity in the sinkholes probably promoted the growth of encrusting suspension feeders but also led to intense, multistory bioperforation of carbonates on the wall. The cup-shaped depressions are, therefore, the result of sinkhole formation during the last-glacial low sea levels and later carbonate accretion at sinkhole margins during the Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3acarbonates 3acement 3acontinental shelf 3acorals 3afishermen 3ageophysics 3akarsts 3alimestone 3aradiocarbon dating 3asea level 3asuspension feeding 3aBrazil 0aSubmarine sinkholes 0aRadiocarbon dating 0aCarbonate sedimentation 0aPleistocene-Holocene 0aAbrolhos continental shelf 0aBrazil1 aAmado-Filho, Gilberto M.1 aMoura, Rodrigo L.1 aSampaio, Frederico M.1 aBassi, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6833-98741 aBraga, Juan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2657-05840 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 462 p.101-111dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170300001800245520134300263592002801606650001501634650001101649650001801660650001101678650001501689650002601704650001001730650001901740650001401759650001501773650002201788650001601810700002701826700002401853773011701877856008601994852000902080655001202089IND60615822820221120133418.0181228e20181202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061582282DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2018.15136612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Preeti10aGeomorphological study of intertidal mudflats using RISAT-1 SAR images  ap. 1128-1137.  aThe coastal zone of the Gulf of Kachchh (GoK) is well known for their large tidal range and a vast expanse of intertidal mudflats. Since monitoring of the intertidal mudflats with field observations is not feasible, the paper presents the utilization of microwave remote sensing technique with RISAT-1 dual polarized data for the geomorphological studies of intertidal mudflats. Radar measures backscattering coefficient, which depends on surface roughness parameters, where the surface roughness of intertidal mudflats are functions of sediment ripple height and space between consecutive ripples. Ripple’s height and the distance between ripples (its wavelength) are represented here as root-mean-square height (RMSH) and correlation length (CL) respectively. A semi-empirical model is used to derive RMSH using cross-polarized backscattering coefficient, and CL is calculated using inversion algorithm on a ratio of backscattering coefficient. A surface sediment type map is generated, based on the retrieved surface parameters, and validated with another sediment type map which is classified using an optical multispectral image. Error statistics are calculated for simulated and observed backscattering ratios, which indicate the general acceptability of the model in estimating the surface roughness parameters of tidal mudflats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoasts 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amultispectral imagery 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asediments 3astatistics 3asurface roughness 3awavelengths1 aRamakrishnan, Ratheesh1 aRajawat, Ajay Singh0 tRemote sensing letters.g2018 Dec. 2, v. 9, no. 12 p.1128-1137dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2018.15136613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245019900208300001400407520180500421592002802226650001102254650001902265650002102284650001302305650001402318650001002332650001602342650001202358650001502370650001202385650002102397650001702418650002602435650001402461650001402475650002302489650002702512651001502539653001402554653001702568653001902585653001302604653002602617653001202643700006002655700002202715700002602737700002102763773011702784856008402901852000902985655001202994IND60556565520221118121116.0161102e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055656552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Adam J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2982-971510aClimate and landscape reconstruction of the Arroyo Chijuillita Member of the Nacimiento Formation, San Juan Basin, New Mexico: Providing environmental context to early Paleocene mammal evolution  ap. 27-44.  aThe sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and paleopedologic attributes of a laterally continuous outcrop exposure of the basal portion of the lower Paleocene Arroyo Chijuillita Member of the Nacimiento Formation located in the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness Area was examined to provide paleoenvironmental context for the Puercan North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA) terrestrial ecosystems of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. The studied outcrop spans the middle and late Puercan (Pu2-Pu3) NALMA, and thus is an ideal location to assess the potential causes of faunal turnover between Pu2 and Pu3. The stratal succession consists of fluvial channel and laterally continuous sandstone and associated fine-grained floodplain deposits, including paleosols that document variability in drainage and maturity. Quantitative and qualitative reconstructions of paleoclimate from paleosols, supplemented by analyses of fossil floras, indicate no change in climate through the studied interval. Further, there is no evidence that regional tectonics relate to changes in depositional environments. Given the lack of evidence for climate change or regional tectonics, and the characteristics of the fluvial facies and the paleosols across the study locality, we interpret the spatial and temporal variability in paleopedologic and sedimentologic characteristics to be the result of autocyclic channel avulsion and migration. Additionally, the stable climatic conditions and lack of tectonic influence between the Pu2 and Pu3 biozones suggest that mammalian turnover is unlikely to have been caused by extrinsic environmental changes (i.e. climate or tectonics) and is instead probably the result of rapid evolution following the K-Pg boundary and/or competition from the migration of new mammalian species into the basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adrainage 3aevolution 3afauna 3afloodplains 3afossils 3alandscapes 3amammals 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apaleosolic soil types 3asandstone 3atectonics 3atemporal variation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aNew Mexico 0aPaleocene 0aPaleoclimate 0aSan Juan Basin 0aPaleosol 0aFluvial Sedimentology 0aPuercan1 aPeppe, Daniel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4263-133X1 aAtchley, Stacy C.1 aWilliamson, Thomas E.1 aFlynn, Andrew G.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 463 p.27-44dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01292naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005900166300001600225520024400241592002800485650002300513650001300536650004600549650001200595650001500607650004400622700001400666700001900680700001900699700002400718773012000742856008300862852000900945655001200954IND60676395020221122063528.0210820e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067639502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-019-02819-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing-hu12aA New Coumarin Glycoside from Physochlaina physaloides  ap. 806-808.  aA new coumarin glycoside, namely physochloside A, together with four known compounds, was isolated from the ethanol extract of Physochlaina physaloides.

This is the first time that this Danian hyperthermal event has been identified in a deep-water, middle to lower bathyal setting from the Western Tethyan realm.The analysis of benthic foraminiferal assemblages shows gradual changes in the assemblages prior to the onset of the LDE and an increase in food supply to the seafloor during the LDE, in agreement with results from shallower Southern Tethyan settings. The benthic assemblage changes across the LDE at Caravaca share some characteristics with other hyperthermal events, including the negative carbon isotope excursion, the increased abundance of buliminids, or the common occurrence of A. aragonensis, an opportunistic species that proliferated during other Paleogene hyperthermal events. In addition, the increased abundance of Nuttallides truempyi, a dissolution-resistant form that thrived during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the abundance of calcareous infaunal morphogroups, which calcify in less carbonate-undersaturated pore waters, indicate slightly CaCO3-corrosive bottom waters during the LDE.Turnover of calcareous plankton across the LDE is similar to other sites globally distributed, including the evolution of photosymbiotic foraminiferal lineages and the radiation of the nannofossil “fasciculiths group”. The occurrence of innovative morphostructures (Diantholitha and Lithoptychius) towards the base of the LDE may indicate a more efficient biological pump. This hypothesis is supported by increased percentages of benthic infaunal morphogroups and a decrease in the abundance of oligotrophic species.A reworked interval has been identified immediately above the LDE. Higher up in the section, benthic and planktic assemblages from the post-LDE interval point to the recovery of the environmental conditions, including a decrease in the food supply to the seafloor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3afood availability 3aisotopes 3amicrofossils 3apaleoecology 3aplankton 3aSpain 0aUpper Danian 0aHyperthermal 0aMicrofossils 0aCarbonate corrosivity 0aFood-flux1 aOrtiz, Silvia1 aArreguín-Rodríguez, Gabriela J.1 aMonechi, Simonetta1 aMillán, Isabel1 aMolina, Eustoquio0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 463 p.45-59dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01253naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245003500178300001600213520031400229592002800543650001400571650001400585650001500599653000800614653000800622653000800630653001500638653001800653653002400671700002100695773010500716856008500821852000900906655001200915IND60599810120221120151110.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059981012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkeels, Christopher L.10aPrediction after IV estimation  ap. 420-422.  aIn the context of a single equation in a system of simultaneous equations there is evidently some confusion in the literature as to the correct approach to the problem of prediction.

These materials are advantageous in offering massive surface-to-volume ratios, favorable transport properties, intriguing physicochemical properties, and confinement effects resulting from the 2D ultrathin structure. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in emerging energy and catalysis applications based on beyond-graphene elemental 2D materials. First, we briefly introduce the general classification, structure, and properties of elemental 2D materials and the new advances in material preparation. We then discuss various applications in energy harvesting and storage, including solar cells, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators, thermoelectric devices, batteries, and supercapacitors. We further discuss the explorations of beyond-graphene elemental 2D materials for electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and heterogeneous catalysis. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the future development of elemental 2D materials in energy and catalysis are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric generators 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3aphotocatalysis1 aWang, Ruoxing1 aZhang, Hua1 aWu, Wenzhuo0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Oct. 4, v. 50, no. 19 p.10983-11031dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cs00821g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011900210300001400329520172500343592002802068650002002096650001802116650002002134650001402154650001102168650001902179650001402198650001202212650003102224650001002255650002102265650001002286650001402296650002002310650001502330650001602345650001402361651002502375651001302400653002802413653002202441653002002463653002002483700002502503700002002528700001802548773009702566856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60597292520221116142623.0190726e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059729252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2017.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9236-978510aIs a biofix necessary for predicting the flight phenology of Lobesia botrana in Douro Demarcated Region vineyards?  ap. 57-64.  aThe European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis and Schiffermüller), is among the most economically important vineyard pests in European and Mediterranean areas. Predicting the insect's flight phenology during the growing season is critical to improve Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tactics through better timing of sampling or control operations. The aim of this study was to characterize the flight phenology of L. botrana in Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) in Portugal, as well as to develop degree-day (DD) models for predicting main pest flights, based on data of male catches in sex pheromone traps and temperature data recorded over a 20-year period. Nonlinear models based on Boltzmann regression equations were developed using the cumulative percentage of male catches and accumulated DD, considering two starting points for this accumulation, a biofix (first male catch) and a calendar date (January 1st), both using 7.3°C and 33°C as lower and upper thresholds, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the cumulative percentage of L. botrana catches and accumulated DD are highly related, using both events as starting points for DD accumulation, although, in the case of the second and third flights, the best correlations were obtained using the model developed from January 1st. Although the use of a biofix seems to improve model's accuracy, from the practical point of view and considering large scale application for an IPM strategy, the use of a fixed calendar date (January 1st) should be preferred. These results could be useful in timing L. botrana control measures, especially biorational pesticides applications that require accurate information on insect phenology to be effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobesia botrana 3abiopesticides 3acontrol methods 3aequations 3aflight 3agrowing season 3aheat sums 3ainsects 3aintegrated pest management 3amales 3anonlinear models 3apests 3aphenology 3apheromone traps 3aprediction 3atemperature 3avineyards 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 0aEuropean grapevine moth 0aDegree-day models 0aPest management 0aPheromone traps1 aGonçalves, Fátima,1 aOliveira, Irene1 aTorres, Laura0 tCrop protection.g2018 Aug., v. 110 p.57-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2017.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245019000159300001800349520053700367592002800904650001400932650001200946650002300958650001200981650001300993650002201006650001401028650002201042700001901064700001601083700001601099700001801115700001701133700002001150773011901170856008101289852000901370655001201379IND60550438420221119064738.0160911e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055043842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b010242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yang10aPd-Catalyzed Highly Regio- and Stereoselective Formation of C–C Double Bonds: An Efficient Method for the Synthesis of Benzofuran-, Dihydrobenzofuran-, and Indoline-Containing Alkenes  ap. 7456-7467.  aA highly regio- and stereoselective C–C double bond formation reaction via Pd-catalyzed Heck-type cascade process with N-tosylhydrazones has been developed.

The approach is based on reducing the search space by bounding the diameters that can be used for every network pipe. To reduce the search space, two opposite extreme flow distribution scenarios are analyzed and velocity restrictions to the pipe flow are then applied. The first scenario produces the most uniform flow distribution in the network. The opposite scenario is represented by the network with the maximum flow accumulation. Both extreme flow distributions are calculated by solving a quadratic programming problem, which is a very robust and efficient procedure. This approach has been coupled to a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA has an integer coding scheme and variable number of alleles depending on the number of diameters comprised within the velocity restrictions. The methodology has been applied to several benchmark networks and its performance has been compared to a classic GA formulation with a non-bounded search space. It considerably reduced the search space and provided a much faster and more accurate convergence than the GA formulation. This approach can also be coupled to other metaheuristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahydrodynamics 3apipes 3aquadratic programming 3awater distribution1 aMartínez, Juan1 aLopez, Rafael,0 tWater.g2017 Nov. 02, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w91108453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168500002200295500001500317520123000332592002801562650001901590650001801609650001201627650001701639650001101656650001001667650001901677650001701696650001901713650001201732651001001744651001001754653002001764653001701784653001401801653001901815653001101834700001801845700002101863700001501884700001901899700001601918773009501934856008402029852000902113655001202122IND60556565920221118120228.0161102s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055656592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Bai-Nian10aReconstruction of atmospheric CO2 during the Oligocene based on leaf fossils from the Ningming Formation in Guangxi, China  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aRecently, several leaf fossils with good cuticles were discovered from the Oligocene deposits in Guangxi, China. The high fossilization potential of these leaves and easily identifiable stomata and epidermal cells make them an excellent source for CO2 reconstruction. In this study, atmospheric CO2 of the Oligocene is reconstructed using the mechanistic-theoretical model based on stomatal data, photosynthesis and gas exchange control and using an alternative method based only on stomatal ratio. Fossil leaves of Buxus ningmingensis, Chuniophoenix slenderifolius and Cephalotaxus ningmingensis, two angiosperms and one gymnosperm, were considered. It was found that some differences were present between the results obtained by the two methods. The SR-based method yields a somewhat narrower CO2 range (from 355 to 578ppmv) than the model approach (from 255 to 972ppmv) which encloses the former range. The CO2 results derived from the three species using the two approaches are overlapped to a high degree with CO2 data from other terrestrial plants and phytoplankton material. More data provided by different proxies are desirable to unravel the interactions between atmospheric CO2 and climate change for the Oligocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aphytoplankton 3afossils 3agas exchange 3amodels 3aBuxus 3aclimate change 3aCephalotaxus 3aphotosynthesis 3astomata 3aChina 0aChina 0aAtmospheric CO2 0aGas exchange 0aOligocene 0aStomatal ratio 0aleaves1 aWang, Qiu-Jun1 aKonrad, Wilfried1 aMa, Fu-Jun1 aDong, Jun-Ling1 aWang, Zi-Xi0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007400167300001400241520103100255592002801286650000901314650002101323650001001344650000901354650002401363650001301387650002901400650001801429653002101447653002901468700001701497700001601514700001501530773013701545856008301682852000901765655001201774IND60746494420221120022423.0210820e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074649442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaodan12aA time-resolved transcriptome landscape of the developing mouse ovary  ap. 57-64.  aThe ovarian structure is complex and diverse, including egg cells, granulosa cells and other cell types. Its organ function depends heavily on normal development. Numerous studies have focused on certain gene function changes during ovarian development, but systematic analyses of its molecular changes are extremely rare. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the mouse ovary from 11 time points across multiple developmental stages, which enables us to explore the dynamics of ovarian development. By performing coexpression analysis, we identified gene modules with similar expression trends and determined 159 functional gene interaction networks based on machine learning. Most of these gene interaction networks are related to biological processes involved in the development of the ovary, which provides functional predictions for some genes with unknown functions and a reference for subsequent functional research. In general, our study provides a resource for understanding ovarian development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeggs 3agene interaction 3agenes 3amice 3aovarian development 3aresearch 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aMachine learning 0aGene interaction network1 aLiu, Guoping1 aZhang, Ning1 aHua, Keqin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 572 p.57-64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245010500184500001900289520089400308592002801202650001801230650001501248650001401263650003001277650001101307650001301318650001701331650001301348650001001361653002501371653002601396653001801422653003001440653002201470653001901492653001301511700003901524700002001563700003801583700002801621773010801649856008801757852000901845655001201854IND60701910520221121184914.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070191052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1036962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Leandro de Paulo10aBrinkman equation in reactive flow: Contribution of each term in carbonate acidification simulations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article studies the individual contribution of each term in the Navier-Stokes-Darcy (Brinkman) equation to the fluid linear momentum balance and the consequences of opting for the Darcy or Brinkman equations in 3D reactive flow simulations of a vuggy carbonate. A two-scale continuum model was used to simulate the acidification of a carbonate sample using the Darcy and Brinkman equations. Rock heterogeneity is considered in the initial porosity and permeability fields, which are calculated directly from micro-CT images. Simulations showed that the Darcy equation predicts the acid breakthrough earlier in most cases. The convective acceleration term in the Brinkman equation plays an important role in describing the fluid momentum balance at high injection velocities, and this is a clear evidence against the use of the Darcy equation to model reactive flow in such conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acarbonates 3aequations 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3amomentum 3apermeability 3aporosity 3awater 0aDigital rock physics 0aCarbonate dissolution 0aReactive flow 0aTwo-scale continuum model 0aBrinkman equation 0aDarcy equation 0aMicro-CT1 aOliveira, Thomas David Serafini de1 aSurmas, Rodrigo1 ada Silva, Mônica Antunes Pereira1 aPeçanha, Ricardo Pires0 tAdvances in water resources.g2020 Oct., v. 144 p.103696-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1036963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014400174520150300318592002801821650001601849650003301865650001601898650001301914650001601927650001801943650001601961650002001977650001801997650001402015650001002029650001902039650001202058650002002070650001402090650001402104650001902118650004402137650001402181650002202195653001602217653001902233653002302252653001202275653002302287700001902310700002302329700002902352700002102381700003202402700002602434700002402460773010302484856008602587852000902673655001202682IND60702643620221120154303.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070264362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1043692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Vuong Viet10aSynergistic infection of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis in hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.)  aFrancisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis (Fno) and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) are deadly infectious pathogens in farmed tilapia, particularly during cold season when the water temperature drops to under 25 °C. We hypothesized that infection of the ectoparasite Ich might enhance susceptibility of hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) to the facultative intracellular bacterium Fno. To prove the hypothesis, the experiment was designed as follows. Hybrid red tilapia naturally infected by Ich at 9 ± 6 theronts/fish gills and 4 ± 3 theronts/fish skin were distributed into 5 distinct groups exposed to different concentrations of Fno. In parallel, the same number of Ich-free tilapia were challenged to only Fno in the same manner. The results showed that cumulative mortality in the Fno single infection with 2.88 × 10⁶ CFU mL⁻¹ of water was 25 ± 7%, whereas 100% mortality was found in the coinfection treatment at dose of 1.93 × 10⁵ CFU mL⁻¹ of water. No mortality was observed in both control groups (Ich-infected and Ich-free fish). The coinfected fish revealed typical clinical signs and histopathological manifestations of francisellosis and ichthyophthiriasis. This study revealed synergistic effect of the Ich and Fno infection in hybrid red tilapia leading to the exacerbated mortality. Thus, farming management of fish to be free from the Ich ectoparasite might reduce risk of francisellosis and probably other bacterial diseases in farmed tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancisella 3aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 3aOreochromis 3abacteria 3acold season 3aectoparasites 3afarmed fish 3afarming systems 3afish diseases 3afish skin 3agills 3ahistopathology 3ahybrids 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apathogens 3arisk reduction 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asynergism 3awater temperature 0aCoinfection 0aFrancisellosis 0aIchthyophthiriasis 0aTilapia 0aWhite spot disease1 aDong, Ha Thanh1 aSenapin, Saengchan1 aKayansamruaj, Pattanapon1 aPirarat, Nopadon1 aRung-ruangkijkrai, Tilladit1 aTiawsirisup, Sonthaya1 aRodkhum, Channarong0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Oct., v. 147 p.104369-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1043693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01384naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014900169300001800318520030400336592002800640650001300668650002300681650002300704650003100727650002300758650003600781650002200817700002200839773011900861856008100980852000901061655001201070IND60550438520171220000000.0160911e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055043852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b010292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafiński, Zbigniew10aEnantioselective Synthesis of Chromanones Bearing Quaternary Substituted Stereocenters Catalyzed by (1R)-Camphor-Derived N-Heterocyclic Carbenes  ap. 7468-7476.  aA catalytic asymmetric intramolecular crossed-benzoin reaction for the synthesis of chromanones by novel camphor-derived N-heterocyclic carbenes is described.

We develop a proof of concept using (1) local measurements of precipitation, temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) at a set of well-monitored sites in the US, and (2) available time series of snow cover from satellite and gridded daily precipitation and daily average temperature for the study region of South Tyrol, in the Italian Alps. We demonstrate how the method can reproduce the snow water balance to an acceptable extent, critically depending on the accuracy of input precipitation and temperature, highlighting the importance of a reliable representation of weather forcing if the estimate has to be robust and representative. Although not always accurate at a point, our approach yields a SWE reasonably consistent with observations, and snowmelt flows compatible with measured streamflow. At the same time, the model allows an interpretation of discrepancies between observations and simulations to detect inconsistencies between snow cover and weather forcing. This method is in principle applicable for large-scale hydrological assessments thanks to the increasing global coverage of snow cover, precipitation and temperature data. As the only other type of observation available to calibrate models is often streamflow, the direct calibration of the snow component of a model using snow cover and weather forcing reduces the number of model processes and parameters to be calibrated with streamflow, and is expected to increase model robustness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat sums 3asatellites 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aAlps region 3aItaly 3aUnited States1 aBagli, Stefano1 aCallegari, Mattia1 aNotarnicola, Claudia1 aMazzoli, Paolo0 tWater.g2017 Nov. 02, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w91108483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007200173520216300245592002802408650001502436650001002451650001502461650000902476650001302485650001302498650000802511650001402519650000902533650002002542653002802562653001502590653001402605653001502619653002002634653001502654700001902669700001902688700002502707700002202732700002402754700002202778700002302800700002402823700002102847700002502868773010402893856008802997852000903085655001203094IND60743553220221120202333.0220517e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074355322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHotaling, Scott10aBiological albedo reduction on ice sheets, glaciers, and snowfields  aThe global cryosphere, Earth's frozen water, is in precipitous decline. The ongoing and predicted impacts of cryosphere loss are diverse, ranging from disappearance of entire biomes to crises of water availability. Covering approximately one-fifth of the planet, mass loss from the terrestrial cryosphere is driven primarily by a warming atmosphere but reductions in albedo (the proportion of reflected light) also contribute by increasing absorption of solar radiation. In addition to dust and other abiotic impurities, biological communities substantially reduce albedo worldwide. In this review, we provide a global synthesis of biological albedo reduction (BAR) in terrestrial snow and ice ecosystems. We first focus on known drivers—algal blooms and cryoconite (granular sediment on the ice that includes both mineral and biological material)—as they account for much of the biological albedo variability in snow and ice habitats. We then consider an array of potential drivers of BAR whose impacts may be overlooked, such as arthropod deposition, resident organisms (e.g., dark-bodied glacier ice worms), and larger vertebrates, including humans, that transiently visit the cryosphere. We consider both primary (e.g., BAR due to the presence of pigmented algal cells) and indirect (e.g., nutrient addition from arthropod deposition) effects, as well as interactions among biological groups (e.g., birds feeding on ice worms). Collectively, we highlight that in many cases, overlooked drivers and interactions among factors have considerable potential to alter BAR, perhaps rivaling the direct effects of algal blooms and cryoconite. We conclude by highlighting knowledge gaps for the field with an emphasis on the underrepresentation of genomic tools, understudied areas (particularly high-elevation glaciers at tropical latitudes), and a dearth of temporal sampling in current efforts. We detail a global framework for long-term BAR monitoring that, if implemented, would yield a tremendous amount of insight for BAR and would be particularly valuable in light of the rapid ecological and physical changes occurring in the contemporary cryosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalgae 3aarthropods 3adust 3agenomics 3aglaciers 3aice 3asediments 3asnow 3asolar radiation 0aBiogeophysical feedback 0aSnow algae 0aIce algae 0aCryoconite 0aGlacier biology 0aCryosphere1 aLutz, Stefanie1 aDial, Roman J.1 aAnesio, Alexandre M.1 aBenning, Liane G.1 aFountain, Andrew G.1 aKelley, Joanna L.1 aMcCutcheon, Jenine1 aSkiles, S.

A series of molecular balances were synthesized that contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated alkyl groups. Our findings indicate that fluorine’s polarizing ability does enhance CH−π binding and depends on molecular orientation. Surprisingly, when the terminal end of the alkyl group is completely fluorinated, the balance tips toward fluorophobicity and assumes an unusual constrained conformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3afluorine 3aorganic chemistry 3asolutions 3asynthesis1 aFields, Michael1 aGrabnic, Timothy1 aJanesko, Benjamin

Also challenging is the analysis of a mixture spectrum without separation, which has been limited to simple molecules. Through nonuniform sampling using modified heteronuclear multiple bond correlation combined with indirect covariance, a high-resolution ¹³C–¹³C correlation spectrum was obtained with ¹H sensitivity. Built on the thus-obtained ¹³C–¹³C connectivities, deconvolution of the mixture spectra was achieved through a new signal-processing procedure, termed DECODE, tailored to the indirect covariance eigendecomposition. When applied to a complex natural product mixture of rotenone and brucine with many quaternary carbons, the method resolved very close carbon peaks and extracted clean individual spectra. Essentially providing molecule-wide ¹³C connectivities for complex molecules from ¹H-detected 2D spectra, our approach should prove useful in many areas of NMR analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarbon 3acovariance 3arotenone1 aPark, Sunghyouk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1981-32740 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 May 08, v. 92, no. 10 p.7037-7044dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c002773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009300176300001400269520047000283592002800753650003500781650001500816650001500831650001500846650001100861650001200872653000700884653000700891653000700898653002000905653001100925653001700936653001500953700002400968773010300992856008501095852000901180655001201189IND60599810920221120170717.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059981092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoerrenberg, Philipp10aIs soccer good for you?

However, various vegetation indices may show diverse trend patterns over the same area. This study analysed the consistency of the vegetation spatiotemporal trends from AVHRR version 3 NDVI (NDVI3g) with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) over SA during various seasons, assuming that MODIS products are of higher quality. Results showed that the spatiotemporal vegetation trends derived from the NDVI3g were analogous to both MODIS NDVI and EVI indicating greening over semi-arid regions where croplands dominate and browning over tropical/subtropical forest areas. Correlations among them were better during winter monsoon. Discrepancies occurred in tropical/subtropical densely vegetated (humid) and complex topographic areas specifically during summer monsoon (SM). This study improved the understanding of the heterogeneous vegetation trends over the vast complicated terrain of SA. It was revealed that NDVI3g is reliable to quantify vegetation trends over SA, however, calibration errors still could introduce biases during SM season.  aThis work was jointly supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19030401) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences “The Belt and Road Initiatives” Program on International Cooperation: (Grant No. 134111KYSB20160010 and 131C11KYSB20160061).  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA19030401cCAS Strategic Priority Research Program 3aadvanced very high resolution radiometer 3acropland 3alandscapes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonsoon season 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asemiarid zones 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3atopography 3atropical forests 3awinter 3aSouth Asia1 aJia, Gensuo1 aZhang, Anzhi1 aSingha, Mrinal0 tRemote sensing letters.g2018 Dec. 2, v. 9, no. 12 p.1195-1204dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2018.15192703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245008100200300002000281506007600301520124300377592002801620506003701648650001101685650001101696650002901707653001201736653002101748700002501769773017501794856007901969852000902048655001202057IND60173733520221207125545.0150603e20130709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017373352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13095331102doi7 aPMC37108132pmcid7 a237983942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinye10aOn revenue maximization for selling multiple independently distributed items  ap. 11232-11237.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsider the revenue-maximizing problem in which a single seller wants to sell k different items to a single buyer, who has independently distributed values for the items with additive valuation.

They showed that selling separately guarantees at least a [Formula] fraction of the optimal revenue; and for identically distributed items, bundling yields at least a [Formula] fraction of the optimal revenue. In this paper, we prove that selling separately guarantees at least [Formula] fraction of the optimal revenue, whereas for identically distributed items, bundling yields at least a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. These bounds are tight (up to a constant factor), settling the open questions raised by Hart and Nisan. The results are valid for arbitrary probability distributions without restrictions. Our results also have implications on other interesting issues, such as monotonicity and randomization of selling mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aincome 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 0aauction 0amechanism design1 aYao, Andrew Chi-Chih0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 July 9, v. 110, no. 28 p.11232-11237dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13095331103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245017600209300001400385520095400399592002801353650001501381650001301396650001701409650001701426650004501443650001101488650002601499650001301525653003501538653001601573653002501589653001501614700002101629700001601650700001601666700001501682700002001697700001701717700002101734700002101755700001601776700002001792773013701812856008301949852000902032655001202041IND60746495020221120022304.0210820e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074649502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakaguchi, Minoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6822-250210aProlyl oligopeptidase participates in the cytosine arabinoside-induced nuclear translocation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a human neuroblastoma cell line  ap. 65-71.  aPreviously, we reported that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a binding partner of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) in neuroblastoma NB-1 cells and that the POP inhibitor, SUAM-14746, inhibits cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)-induced nuclear translocation of GAPDH and protects against Ara-C cytotoxicity. To carry out a more in-depth analysis of the interaction between POP and GAPDH, we generated POP-KO NB-1 cells and compared the nuclear translocation of GAPDH after Ara-C with or without SUAM-14746 treatment to wild-type NB-1 cells by western blotting and fluorescence immunostaining. Ara-C did not induce the nuclear translocation of GAPDH and SUAM-14746 did not protect against Ara-C cytotoxicity in POP-KO cells. These results indicate that the anticancer effects of Ara-C not only include the commonly known antimetabolic effects, but also the induction of cell death by nuclear transfer of GAPDH through interaction with POP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell death 3acytosine 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahumans 3aprolyl oligopeptidase 3aresearch 0aNuclear translocation of GAPDH 0aNB-1 cells 0aCytosine arabinoside 0aSUAM-147461 aNishiuchi, Ryota1 aBando, Mika1 aYamada, Yui1 aKondo, Rie1 aMitsumori, Mika1 aShiokawa, Ai1 aKanazawa, Miyuki1 aIkeguchi, Shiori1 aKikyo, Fumi1 aTanaka, Satoshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 572 p.65-71dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245012500158300001600283500001400299520133400313592002801647650001601675650002201691650001001713650002301723650001401746650002201760650001301782653001201795653001401807653003001821653002601851653001401877653003201891653002401923700001901947700001601966700002301982700001902005773011102024856007102135852000902206655001202215IND60725605820221119030020.0210127s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072560582DNAL7 a10.1071/AM200072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Brien, Casey10aEvaluation of olfactory and visual cues to deter southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) from their burrows  ap. 110-119.  aNAL-light  aHuman–wildlife conflicts threaten a huge diversity of species and affect the livelihoods of millions of people. There is an increasing need to develop management strategies that meet the needs of humans and wildlife. A variety of conflict mitigation measures are available, but for many species like the southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) their effectiveness has not been scientifically tested. Deterrents could provide a cost effective and efficient means of reducing wombat damage to agriculture. Anecdotal accounts suggest that ‘Blood & Bone’ (a plant fertiliser) and compact discs may deter wombats. This study aimed to assess their effectiveness in deterring free-living wombats from burrows on agricultural land using remote cameras to monitor changes in activity and behaviour before and after treatment application. Mixed-effects models revealed a significant decrease in the number of visits to burrows following the application of compact discs (P<0.01). ‘Blood & Bone’ did not deter wombats from burrows (P=0.81), but increased exploratory behaviour (P=0.01) and decreased travelling behaviour (P=0.05) were observed. This suggests that visual cues may be more effective in deterring wombats from burrows than olfactory cues, possibly because they are more easily detected from further away.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiorhinus 3aagricultural land 3ablood 3acost effectiveness 3amammalogy 3aspecies diversity 3awildlife 0acoexist 0adeterrent 0ahuman–wildlife conflict 0aLasiorhinus latifrons 0arepellent 0asouthern hairy-nosed wombat 0awildlife management1 aSparrow, Elisa1 aDibben, Ron1 aOstendorf, Bertram1 aTaggart, David0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2021, v. 43, no. 1 p.110-119dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:J000001169x0310-00497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM200073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04607naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245012500178520319200303592002803495650001703523650002203540650002003562650001103582650002003593650001403613650001803627650001503645650001503660650001403675650001503689650001103704653002403715653001903739653001903758653001703777653001803794653001903812700002603831700002203857700002503879700003203904773010403936856008804040852000904128655001204137IND60743553720221120233204.0220517e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074355372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, Theresa M.10aDetrital zircon record of magmatism and sediment dispersal across the North American Cordilleran arc system (28–48°N)  aAs zircon U-Pb geochronology has become a leading method in sediment provenance studies and basin analysis over the past 20 years, the volume of detrital zircon data made available in published literature has enabled researchers to go beyond source-to-sink provenance studies to explore increasingly complex geologic problems. In this review, we utilize the growing body of detrital zircon data acquired from Jurassic-Paleocene forearc and foreland basin strata of the North American Cordillera to investigate the Mesozoic to earliest Cenozoic evolution of the arc and its associated basins between 28°N and 48°N. Our compilation includes 830 detrital zircon samples (101,898 individual ages) from 70 studies published between 2000 and 2020. For comparative purposes, we also compile 1307 igneous zircon U-Pb ages that characterize the magmatic history of the arc. We place primary emphasis on detrital zircon ages between 251 and 56 Ma that we infer to be uniquely derived from magmatic sources in the arc. Informed by existing knowledge of magmatic, structural, and sedimentological processes that acted on the orogen, we investigate spatial and temporal trends in these “arc-derived zircon” to establish a detrital record of arc magmatism, investigate source-to-sink relationships between the arc and adjacent basins, and discuss controls on sediment dispersal across the orogen. Our review shows that compilations of detrital zircon data from the Cordilleran forearc and foreland basin systems are excellent proxies for arc magmatism because the basins are enriched in arc-derived zircon and compilations provide space- and time-integrated records of crystallization ages. The compiled detrital zircon data support a history of continuous arc magmatism throughout Mesozoic and earliest Cenozoic time, characterized by low-volume magmatism from Triassic-Early Jurassic time (~251–174 Ma) and episodic higher-volume magmatism from Middle Jurassic-Late Cretaceous time (~174–66 Ma). These trends elucidate the initiation and timing of magmatic events at the orogen-scale and corroborate our understanding of cyclic arc behavior. Detrital zircon distributions are spatially and temporally variable both within and across basins, which we discuss relative to topographic development of the orogen and attendant responses of sediment dispersal systems. Detrital zircon distributions in the forearc signal rapid transfer of sediment from the arc to basins dominantly via fluvial processes. In contrast, detrital zircon distributions across the foreland reflect the presence of topographic barriers in the hinterland region of the arc that effectively isolated parts of the foreland. The presence of hinterland topography in turn highlights the important role of ash-fall events in delivering arc-derived zircon to the foreland, underscoring the need to consider ash-fall processes in paleodrainage reconstructions. These broad regional trends, and in general the close linkage between orogenic process and sediment dispersal, emerge from our compilation because it averages out much of the local variability observed in studies of more limited geographic or temporal extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aCretaceous period 3aJurassic period 3abasins 3acrystallization 3aevolution 3ageochronology 3ahinterland 3aprovenance 3asediments 3atopography 3azircon 0asediment provenance 0asource-to-sink 0apaleogeography 0amagmatic arc 0aforearc basin 0aforeland basin1 aSurpless, Kathleen D.1 aColgan, Joseph P.1 aJohnstone, Samuel A.1 aHolm-Denoma, Christopher S.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 Sept., v. 220 p.103734-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001800279520210800297592002802405596007702433596009102510650000802601650001702609650003802626650002102664650001302685650002102698650001302719650002102732650001502753650002202768650001502790650001502805650003102820650001802851650001402869650001402883650003002897653002602927653004202953700005902995700001903054700006303073773013503136856008303271852000903354655001203363IND60773660420221121033013.0220419e20220418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077366042DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2241-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOksel, Cansu10aIdentification and Genetic Characterization of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae from Sweet Cherry in Turkey  ap. 1253-1261.  aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes bacterial canker, is the most polyphagous bacterium in the P. syringae complex because of its broad host range. This pathogen is considered the major bacterial disease in cherry orchards. In this study, several samples were collected from infected sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) trees in different locations of the Marmara region in Turkey between 2016 and 2018. Sixty-three isolates were identified as P. syringae pv. syringae by pathogenicity, LOPAT, GATTa, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry tests. Total genomic DNA was extracted to confirm identity, followed by PCR amplification of syrB and cfl genes. Out of 63 isolates, 12 were randomly selected for repetitive element sequence-based PCR and multilocus sequence typing analyses to gain insight into the relationships of those isolates. The cluster analysis of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-, repetitive extragenic palindromic-, and BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic-palindromic-PCR techniques could classify the isolates into two distinct clusters. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out to obtain the relation between isolates and the location. The multilocus sequencing typing analysis of gyrB, rpoDp, rpoDs, and gltA genes allowed a clear allocation of the isolates into two separate main clusters. The relationships among the isolates were also evaluated by constructing a genealogical median-joining network (MJN). The isolates from six locations produced 11 haplotypes that were illustrated in the MJN. The results of this study proved that location could not be an indicator for showing the genetic diversity of P. syringae pv. syringae from cherry orchards. As the genetic variability of Pseudomonads has been demonstrated, this study also showed high diversity among different isolates even within the populations. While more research is recommended, the results of this study contributed to a better understanding of the evolutionary progress of P. syringae pv. syringae and the genetic diversity of sweet cherry isolates.  aPublisher supplied data  aTENX-1926-CCOCPaTENX-S-1083cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aTUBITAK 2214-A 1059B141801417cScientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey 3aDNA 3aPrunus avium 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aTurkey (country) 3abacteria 3abacterial canker 3acherries 3acluster analysis 3adesorption 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahost range 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aphylogenetic analysis 0arepetitive element sequence-based PCR1 aAvin, Farhat A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4323-10581 aMirik, Mustafa1 aBaysal-Gurel, Fulya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9920-98800 tPlant disease.g2022 Apr. 18, v. 106, no. 4 p.1253-1261dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2241-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012900177500001900306520096700325592002801292650002301320650003201343650000901375650001701384650001501401650002301416650001601439653001501455653000801470653001501478653002301493653002001516653002001536700003001556700002801586700002801614700003001642700002301672700002301695700004101718700003901759773009501798856008601893852000901979655001201988IND60701911320221121113244.0200907e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070191132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1082442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinton, Mariana Basso10aUltrasound and low-levels of NaCl replacers: A successful combination to produce low-phosphate and low-sodium meat emulsions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMeat emulsions were made with 50% of phosphate level commonly used in the meat industry, and 0, 25, and 50% NaCl reduction. In addition, salt replacers (KCl, CaCl₂, or MgCl₂) were used in the formulations with 25 and 50% salt reduction, corresponding to 10 and 20% of the total amount of salts added, respectively. After embedding in casings, the samples were sonicated (25 kHz and 230 W) in an ultrasonic bath (US) at 20 °C for 0, 18, and 27 min. The addition of CaCl₂ or MgCl₂ impaired (P < .05) the technological properties of the low-sodium samples. Defects caused by NaCl reduction were not eliminated by 18-min US. However, the combination of KCl and 27-min US eliminated the technological defects caused by the 50% NaCl reduction, with no major impact on lipid oxidation during storage (21 days/4 °C), as observed in the TBARS and sensory profile results. Therefore, it is possible to produce low-phosphate and low-sodium meat emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid peroxidation 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3ameat science 3aphosphates 3asensory evaluation 3aultrasonics 0aLow-sodium 0aKCl 0aUltrasound 0aEmulsion stability 0aLipid oxidation 0aSensory profile1 ados Santos, Bibiana Alves1 aCorrea, Leticia Pereira1 aLeães, Yasmim Sena Vaz1 aCichoski, Alexandre José1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 ados Santos, Mirian1 aPollonio, Marise Aparecida Rodrigues1 aCampagnol, Paulo Cezar Bastianello0 tMeat science.g2020 Dec., v. 170 p.108244-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1082443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003000137245012100167300001600288500001400304520102300318592002801341650002501369650001201394650001201406650003001418650001401448650001001462650001901472650002001491650001501511650001701526650001301543651001501556653002401571653001101595653001401606653001401620653002401634653001801658653001201676700002101688700001701709700001601726773011101742856007101853852000901924655001201933IND60725606020221119025901.0210127s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072560602DNAL7 a10.1071/AM200102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJørgensen, Kristina Sand10aObservations on the behaviour of the northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) in a translocated population  ap. 132-136.  aNAL-light  aThe natural distribution of the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) is confined to Epping Forest National Park, Queensland; however, a small number of animals have been translocated to establish an insurance population at Richard Underwood Nature Refuge (RUNR), Queensland. Northern hairy-nosed wombat behaviour is poorly understood, mostly due to its cryptic behaviour. Thirty-two wildlife cameras set up at burrow mouths at RUNR were used to capture social and solitary behaviour. Over a six month period between December 2016 and May 2017, 0.3% (21 videos of 6607) of recordings captured social behaviour, suggesting that the northern hairy-nosed wombat actively avoids social interactions at the burrow mouth. Vocalisation was only observed during social interaction. The results were similar to data from Epping Forest National Park and studies on other wombat species. In this respect the translocated population appeared to behave in a manner typical of the wild population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiorhinus krefftii 3aburrows 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3amammalogy 3amouth 3anational parks 3asocial behavior 3aunderstory 3avocalization 3awildlife 3aQueensland 0aburrowing behaviour 0amammal 0amarsupial 0asemi-arid 0asocial interactions 0atranslocation 0awombats1 aMelzer, Alistair1 aHarper, Dave1 aNevin, Owen0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2021, v. 43, no. 1 p.132-136dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:J000001169x0310-00497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM200103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01293naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169300001400267520028200281592002800563650002300591650001200614650002100626653000700647653000800654653000700662653002500669653002400694653001800718700002200736773010300758856008500861852000900946655001200955IND60599811320221121110300.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059981132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2014.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdi, Tahsin10aEmpirical likelihood-based inference for the generalized entropy class of inequality measures  ap. 54-57.  aWe propose an empirical likelihood-based method of inference for comparing inequality between two populations.

The state-of-the-art catalysts suffer from poor water splitting activity in alkaline media due to their sluggish kinetics, high cost, and scarcity on earth to be scaled up. Herein, we present an electrochemical analysis of a nanostructured electrocatalyst based on a face-centered cubic (FCC) copper-rich Cu–Ni–Fe–Cr–Co alloy with a quasi-spherical morphology electrodeposited on a highly porous nickel substrate. Electrochemical studies determine the enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen reactions in an alkaline medium, which has been induced by the synergistic effect of alloy metals. It is shown that the performance of the presented electrocatalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction is superior to the recently reported electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Benefiting from its long-term durability, the material can pave the way to developing high-performance electrocatalysts for full electrochemical water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data  aQA970816cSharif University of Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002398  a95-S-48740cIran National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003968 3aalloys 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3asynergism1 aMojaddami, Majdoddin1 aZamani Faradonbeh, Zahra1 aZekiy, Angelina Olegovna1 aSimchi, Abdolreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9111-29770 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 36, no. 8 p.4502-4509dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c044323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245008600163500001900249520091300268592002801181650000801209650000901217650001101226650001001237650002301247650001701270650001701287650002301304653001601327653002101343700001801364700001701382700002001399700001501419700001601434773009501450856008601545852000901631655001201640IND60701911420221121113230.0200907e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070191142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1082452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aColour characteristics of beef longissimus thoracis during early 72 h postmortem  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to investigate the characteristics of beef meat colour during the initial 72 h postmortem to assess the possible effects of mitochondria on meat colour development.

In the southeast Pacific Ocean along the coasts of Chile and Peru, seasonal upwelling events lead to hypoxic conditions, which are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity with climate change. Aquaculture operations must take into account the physiological adaptability of a species for environmental conditions. For Cojinoba (Seriolella violacea), a native target species for aquaculture diversification in northern Chile, little is known in regard to physiological capacity for hypoxia. Therefore, hypoxia tolerance studies were conducted followed by measurement of resting and active metabolism and associated energy facilitation in response to hypoxia in juvenile Cojinoba. Hypoxia tolerance studies found they were resilient to dissolved oxygen levels of 1.0 mg O₂ Lˉ¹ for 8 h. Swimming metabolism studies exposed Cojinoba to normoxia (7.5 mg O₂ Lˉ¹) or hypoxia (1.0 mg O₂ Lˉ¹), and quantified minimum metabolic rate (MO₂ min), active metabolic rate (MO₂ max), critical swimming speed (Ucᵣᵢₜ) and associated energetic metabolites and hematological variables. In hypoxia, there was a decrease in MO₂ max (34%) leading to a large (82%) decrease in aerobic metabolic scope. MO₂ min decreased as well by 12%, with lactate increasing presumably to temporarily maintain basic metabolic function. In addition, Ucᵣᵢₜ decreased by 53% in hypoxia, although tail beat frequency was similar in normoxia and hypoxia up to a velocity of 40 cm s⁻¹. Moreover, although erythrocyte concentration increased in hypoxia, hemolysis was observed in exercised fish in this condition. There was a notable increase (5-fold compared to normoxia) in lactate levels of exercised fish in the hypoxia group, which suggests a quick conversion to anaerobic metabolic pathways to maintain energy balance when swimming in hypoxic environments. Therefore, Cojinoba have adaptive responses that may facilitate survival during severe hypoxic events although overall physiological performance is diminished.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriolella violacea 3aaquaculture 3abiochemical pathways 3aclimate change 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy balance 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3ahemolysis 3ahypoxia 3ajuveniles 3alactic acid 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anormoxia 3atail 3aChile 3aPacific Ocean 3aPeru 0aHypoxia tolerance 0aSwimming behavior 0aMetabolic rate 0aAnaerobic metabolism1 aAguirre Badani, Alvaro,1 aBrokordt, Katherina1 aFlores, Héctor,1 aOliva, Marcia1 aAllen, Peter J.1 aÁlvarez, Claudio A.0 tAquaculture.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.737560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7375603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245018900158300002000347520093000367592002801297650002401325650002401349650001301373650002201386650001601408650001801424650001901442650001401461650003201475650001301507650001701520650002101537650001201558650002101570650001101591653001701602653002101619653001801640653002301658700002501681700002201706773012601728856008001854852000901934655001201943IND60528330520221116143325.0160716e20150624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052833052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b032402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cheng10aLow-Temperature Fabrication of Mesoporous Titanium Dioxide Thin Films with Tunable Refractive Indices for One-Dimensional Photonic Crystals and Sensors on Rigid and Flexible Substrates  ap. 13180-13188.  aHighly transparent mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO₂; anatase) thin films were prepared at room temperature via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of hybrid polymer–TiO₂ nanoparticle thin films. This approach utilized a UV-curable polymer in conjunction with the photocatalytic activity of TiO₂ to form and degrade the organic component of the composite films in one step, producing films with well-controlled porosity and refractive index. By adjustment of the loading of TiO₂ nanoparticles in the host polymer, the refractive index was tuned between 1.53 and 1.73. Facile control of these properties and mild processing conditions was leveraged to fabricate robust one-dimensional photonic crystals (Bragg mirrors) consisting entirely of TiO₂ on silicon and flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrates. The mesoporous Bragg mirrors were shown to be effective chemical vapor sensors with strong optical responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acomposite materials 3acrystals 3afilms (materials) 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotonics 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aporosity 3aporous media 3arefractive index 3asilicon 3atitanium dioxide 3avapors 0aUV treatment 0amesoporous films 0aBragg mirrors 0aflexible substrate1 aColella, Nicholas S.1 aWatkins, James J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 24, v. 7, no. 24 p.13180-13188dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b032403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245015000156300001600306520114800322592002801470653005401498653005201552653001401604653001601618653002201634653002301656700002301679700001901702773015001721856007701871852000901948655001201957IND60522360720221119074920.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052236072DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2009-09012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tao10aFormation and Crystal Structure of 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Hexachlorophosphate and Dichlorophosphate(V), [TPT]+[PCl6]– and [TPT]+[PO2Cl2]–  ap. 989-994.  a2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium hexachlorophosphate, [C₁₉H₁₅N₄]⁺[PCl₆]⁻, [TPT]⁺[PCl₆]⁻ (1), and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium dichlorophosphate(V), [C₁₉H₁₅N₄]⁺[PO₂Cl₂]⁻, [TPT]⁺[PO₂Cl₂]⁻ (2), were synthesized by reactions of anhydrous 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, [TPT]⁺Cl⁻, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate [TPT]⁺Cl− ・H₂O, with PCl₅ in dry acetonitrile, and their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

In EFB, death of brood is generally recorded in colonies in the pupal stage, but sometimes in the prepupal and larval stages. We found that the disease affected 6.18 to 18.56% of A. cerana colonies and 7.88 to 25.33% of the brood. The bacteria were isolated from colonies showing EFB symptoms, and characterized using bacteriological, serological and molecular tools. The causal bacterium showed optimum growth in specific basal medium, pH 7.0–7.2 under anaerobic condition with about 1.0% CO2 at 35°C. It was further characterized through positive ELISA tests and PCR assays. These studies confirmed that the colonies were infected by M. plutonius, the causal agent of EFB. The diseased colonies were treated by feeding four doses of 10 mg of ciprofloxacin (98% a.i.) until the disappearance of all EFB symptoms. A molecular diversity of 8 bp between M. plutonius from A. cerana and from A. mellifera was observed and submitted to the EMBL-EBI Cambridge, UK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis cerana 3aEuropean foul brood 3aMelissococcus plutonius 3aapiculture 3abacteria 3aciprofloxacin 3aculture media 3adeath 3alarvae 3apH 3aprepupae 3apupae 3aresearch 3aIndia 0aApis cerana F. 0aantiserum 0aELISA 0aITS 0aPCR 0aprimers1 aMohan Rao, Kukkamudi1 aChakravarty, Swarup Kumar1 aKatna, Sapna0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 51, no. 4 p.306-311dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.51.4.033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04372naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015500174520236500329592002802694650004802722650002102770650002502791650002102816650002802837650001102865650001002876650001002886650001802896650002202914650001002936650002202946650001502968650002002983650001203003650001003015650001403025650001703039650001403056650001503070650001903085650001103104650001703115650003703132650001203169651001003181653001603191653001903207653002003226653002503246653001903271700002603290700001603316700001903332700001903351700001803370700001703388700001603405700001803421700002003439700001703459773009903476856009003575852000903665655001203674IND60752743020221120024942.0211204e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075274302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7375712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumithra, T.G.10aRed sea bream iridovirus infection in cage farmed Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer): Insights into the pathology, epizootiology, and genetic diversity  aRed sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) is an emerging viral pathogen having significant socio-economic and environmental impacts on marine and brackish aquaculture systems. The study documents certain interesting findings of an RSIV disease outbreak that caused 50% cumulative mortality among cage farmed Asian sea bass in India. The confirmatory diagnosis was made based on internationally approved protocols. The affected fish showed splenomegaly, anaemia, and abnormally enlarged cells within the spleen, liver, kidney, and brain. The consistent presence of two fish pathogens, viz., Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio fluvialis, in the liver, along with characteristic vibrio-induced pathologies were noted, indicating the possible role of these bacterial pathogens in RSIV pathogenesis during the outbreak. More strikingly, the surviving fish were found to carry the virus even after two months post-outbreak, warranting future investigations on the carrier status of RSIV survivors. Transmission electron microscopy in the survivors demonstrated atypical virus particles within the degenerated cells of the vital organs, suggesting the role of host immune response in preventing the maturation of RSIV particles in the survivors. Phylogram based on MCP and ATPase genes demonstrated the spread of the same RSIV clone across different countries, regardless of the fish species. Results also revealed the presence of two RSIV subtypes. Both subtypes were mainly distributed in marine demersal fishes of Asian countries. Presently, subtype 2 is the most frequently reported one. Subtype 1 revealed higher genetic diversity with a wider geographical spread and host range. Molecular analyses revealed that MCP and ATPase genes could be targeted in RSIV subtyping, with MCP as a better candidate. A purifying selection was observed on the MCP gene that can be applied for diagnostic protocols. In short, the study generates certain thought-provoking insights on RSIV through the analyses of a recent outbreak along with the genetic and epizootiological data of global strains. Further, the paper also forms the first report on the presence of RSIV in surviving fish post-disease outbreak in the absence of clinical signs. Altogether, the results highlight the necessity of strengthening quarantine and RSIV diagnostic measures to have sustainable aquaculture practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus 3aLates calcarifer 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio fluvialis 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aanemia 3abrain 3acages 3acarrier state 3adisease outbreaks 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahost range 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3aliver 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aquarantine 3asocioeconomics 3aspleen 3asplenomegaly 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviruses 3aIndia 0aATPase gene 0aSurviving fish 0aMegalocytivirus 0aMajor capsid protein 0aRSIV subtyping1 aKrupesha Sharma, S.R.1 aNeelima, L.1 aDhanutha, N.R.1 aJoshy, Aswathy1 aAnusree, V.N.1 aGayathri, S.1 aRaghu, R.K.1 aPraveen, N.D.1 aThomas, Sujitha1 aRajesh, K.M.0 tAquaculture.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.737571-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7375713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015900165300001600324520047000340592002800810650001100838650002100849650002900870650001300899650001400912650002000926650002100946700002000967700001800987700002001005700005801025700005801083773011801141856008301259852000901342655001201351IND60608337920221122004119.0180807e20180119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060833792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b037472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiao-Ye10aDual Photoredox/Nickel-Catalyzed Regioselective Cross-Coupling of 2-Arylaziridines and Potassium Benzyltrifluoroborates: Synthesis of β-Substitued Amines  ap. 421-424.  aA dual visible light photoredox and nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of 2-arylaziridines and potassium benzyltrifluoroborates is described for the first time.

Investigation into the acaricidal activities of botanicals have increased recently but information about their molecular mechanism of action is scarce. Here, RNA-seq analysis of the ticks exposed to Cymbopogon citratus essential oil and citronellal was performed and the responsive genes were identified. More than 6.39 G clean reads with Q₂₀ ≥ 94.88% were obtained for each H. longicornis sample, with an average GC content of 50.94%. Using the Trinity method, 166,710 unigenes with a mean length of 869 bp and a maximum contig length of 29,156 bp were obtained. The upregulation of genes was concentration-dependent in most of the treated groups. Many genes responsive to C. citratus oil and citronellal were stress-related and they include genes associated with adrenergic signaling/calcium channels, cGMP-PKG signaling, apoptosis, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mTOR signaling pathway, and longevity regulating pathway. The upregulation of genes (CACNAID, ADCY9, TPM1, and MYH6) associated with calcium channels suggests a neurotoxic mode of action, whereas, the upregulation of apoptosis-associated genes (CYC, DRONC, CASP7, CASP9, BCL2L1, bcl-xL, etc.) suggests a cytotoxic mode of action. The metabolism of C. citratus essential oil generates oxidative stress which increases the intra-mitochondrial free Ca²⁺ and triggers the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that culminates to mitochondrial depolarization, ATP depletion, and either necrotic or apoptotic death. The neurotoxic and cytotoxic effects exhibited by the monoterpenes in H. longicornis is vital and could be exploited for the advancement of acaricide development and eco-friendly tick control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aHaemaphysalis longicornis 3aacaricides 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acitronellal 3acytotoxicity 3aessential oils 3afocal adhesions 3alongevity 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3aneurotoxicity 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3aproteolysis 3areactive oxygen species 3asequence analysis 3atick control 3aticks 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aAdult immersion test 0aDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) 0aIllumina sequencing 0aLemongrass 0aMonoterpenes1 aZhang, Meng1 aZhang, Xiaojing1 aWang, Tongxuan1 aYu, Zhijun1 aLiu, Jingze0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Nov., v. 179 p.104971-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2021.1049713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144242011100170245010700281300001600388520087400404592002801278650002401306650002301330650002501353650002601378650001501404650001101419650003201430650001001462650001001472650001501482650001201497650001901509650001101528650001401539650001601553650001401569650001301583653001601596653003501612653002901647653001501676653002101691700002101712700002701733700002801760773012401788856007801912852000901990655001201999IND60694537920221123013932.0200513e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069453792DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.51.4.042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDisayathanoowat, Terd10aAislamiento y caracterización de bacterias del intestino medio de la abeja asiática (Apis cerana indica)10aIsolation and characterization of bacteria from the midgut of the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana indica)  ap. 312-319.  aAerobic bacteria were isolated from the midgut of Apis cerana indica on five different media.

Western blot (WB) analysis with an antibody to recombinant SO7 (rbSO7) revealed expression of the protein from 6 to 72 hr (fully sporulated) of sporulation and in sporozoites (SZ). SO7 was absent in host-derived second-stage merozoites (MZ) and was present in culture-derived first-stage MZ but at a level of only 25%% of that exhibited by SZ. During invasion of Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells by SZ in vitro, the level of SO7 within cells, as determined by WB analysis, remained relatively constant until 48 hr of development and then decreased by about 40%% at the next time point (72 hr). The SO7 secreted into the culture media during in vitro development increased to a relative maximum at 48 hr and then decreased to about 20%% of maximum at 72 hr. Immunostaining with anti-rbSO7 indicates that SO7 is highly concentrated in both refractile bodies (RB) of SZ, with some limited distribution in the apical complex. Anti-rbSO7 intensively stained the intracellular parasites and the first-stage schizonts during in vitro development of E. tenella in MDBK cells. Upon release from the schizonts, the first-stage merozoites stained with 1 or 2 bright spots typically at each end. The results suggest that SO7 is closely associated with the SZ RB and is developmentally regulated but may not play a direct role in cellular invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoocysts 3amessenger RNA 3amerozoites 3asporulation 3aantigens 3aschizonts 3asporocysts (Protozoa) 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3aEimeria tenella 3asporozoites 3abiological development 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line 2aEimeria tenellaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aKidneyxcytologyxparasitology. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aOrganellesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSporozoitesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 0adevelopmental stages1 aJenkins, M.

Compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic chiral space group P2₁2₁2, with the cell parameters: a = 12.3596(11), b = 25.978(2), c = 7.9585(7) Å , V = 2555.3(4) Å³ [R1 = 0.068 and wR2 = 0.172]. It represents a novel metal-organic framework comprising of the mixed ligands of pdon and bpdc, where the cupric atoms are bridged by alternating the μ₂- and μ₄-bpdc groups into two-dimensional positively charged layers. The bpdc ligand has resulted from the in situ oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage of the pdon ligand. Compound 2 displays antiferromagnetic interactions. Above 40 K, χm ⁻¹ obeys the Curie-Weiss law with C = 1.37 cm³ Kmol⁻¹ and Θ = −13.95 K.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCopper(II) 0aMetal-Organic Framework 0aCrystal Structure 0aMagnetic Properties1 aLiu, Ming-Xing1 aJiang, Wen-Jun1 aCai, Tie-Jun1 aDeng, Qian0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 64, no. 9 p.1016-1020dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:16822x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2009-09043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245006400178300001600242520197900258592002802237650002502265650001202290650001902302650002202321650002102343650001602364650002202380650001302402650002102415650001302436650002002449650001902469650002502488650002902513650001202542650001902554651001502573653001902588653002402607653002102631653001902652700001702671773009202688856008702780852000902867655001202876IND60112680620221117220542.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011268062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedsworth, Louise W.10aClimate policy at the local level: Insights from California  ap. 664-677.  aLocal governments in the United States have been hotbeds of climate change activity. Recently, states have sought to incorporate these primarily voluntary actions into broader climate change mitigation programs. Using the example of California, a national leader in U.S. climate policy, this article examines the scope for effectiveness of local climate action and assesses factors related to adoption of local climate policies. The analysis draws on two original surveys of city and county governments, designed to learn about adoption of comprehensive policy tools (emission inventories and climate action plans) and programs in specific areas (energy, water, land use, transportation). Adoption rates are fairly high and growing; by mid 2010 roughly 70% of all jurisdictions were already engaged or planning to engage in comprehensive climate actions, up from roughly 50% in 2008. The adoption of specific programs varies with the degree of local government authority in different sectors, and is generally higher for programs targeting municipal facilities and operations than those targeting residents and businesses. Population size, household income, and strong support from local leaders and the public are all associated with higher rates of adoption, particularly for comprehensive actions. Partisan attitudes are more important for comprehensive actions than for programs in specific areas such as energy efficiency and renewable energy, mirroring the findings of state and national public opinion surveys, which find broader support for actions like clean energy than for explicit climate change-oriented actions. Qualitative analysis reveals additional keys to success, including partnering with other local governments and private organizations and leveraging cost savings and other potential co-benefits of action. As states move to incorporate local actions into broader plans, mandates will also play an increasing role in setting a floor for local efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3ahousehold income 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alocal government 3aplanning 3apopulation size 3apublic opinion 3aqualitative analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3asurveys 3atransportation 3aCalifornia 0aClimate change 0aEmissions reduction 0aLocal government 0aLocal planning1 aHanak, Ellen0 tGlobal environmental change.g2013 June, v. 23 p.664-677dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245010200184300001400286520109700300592002801397650001901425650001201444650001201456650002401468650001301492650001301505651001001518653001901528653001501547653001801562653002301580653001101603653002001614700002501634773008901659856008701748852000901835655001201844IND60546794320221121185711.0160903e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054679432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson14aThe relative importance of climate change in the context of multiple stressors in semi-arid Ghana  ap. 40-56.  aThis paper investigates the relative importance of climate change in the context of multiple stressors in semi-arid Ghana. It draws upon ethnographic research in two agrarian villages, and integrates theories from resilience, vulnerability and feminist political ecology. The findings empirically demonstrate that many farmers do not worry about climate change, even in situations where local perceptions and the climate data show a clear pattern of variability. Additionally, the paper provides evidence of a ‘gendered double exposure,’ whereby patriarchy and local culture shape how different social groups are impacted by climate change. Overall, the emerging findings suggest that an overemphasis on scenario-based climate change impacts may detract attention from equally important non-climatic factors that loom large in people's lives. The article's central argument is not meant to downplay the ongoing impacts of climate change in Africa. It rather suggests that climate change should be addressed as one problem among many socio-ecological challenges facing smallholder farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecology 3afarmers 3ameteorological data 3apolitics 3avillages 3aGhana 0aClimate change 0aResilience 0aVulnerability 0aMultiple stressors 0aGender 0aLocal knowledge1 aBezner Kerr, Rachel,0 tGlobal environmental change.g2015 May, v. 32 p.40-56dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245009100178300001600269520177700285592002802062650001202090650001902102650002002121650001502141650002202156651001402178651002302192653003002215653002602245653003002271653002302301653001402324700002002338700002202358773009202380856008702472852000902559655001202568IND60112680820221117220530.0160903e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011268082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFidelman, Pedro I.J.10aUnpacking multilevel adaptation to climate change in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia  ap. 800-812.  aMultilevel governance is regarded as a promising approach to deal with the multidimensional nature of climate change adaptation. However, the policy context in which it is implemented is very often complex and fragmented, characterised by interacting climate and non-climate strategies. An understanding of multilevel decision-making and governance is particularly important, if desired adaptation outcomes are to be achieved. This paper examines how climate change adaptation takes place in a complex multilevel system of governance, in the context of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region. It examines over one hundred adaptation strategies at federal, state, regional and local levels in terms of type, manifestation, purposefulness, drivers and triggers, and geographic and temporal scope. Interactions between strategies are investigated both at the same level of governance and across governance levels. This study demonstrates that multilevel approach is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition in responding to complex multiscale and multisector issues, such as climate change adaptation. Short-term adaptation measures; a predominant incremental, sectoral, top-down approach to adaptation; and the lack of a framework for managing interactions are major threats to effective climate adaptation in the GBR region. Coping with such threats will require long-term transformative action, establishing enabling conditions to support local adaptation, and, most important, creating and maintaining strategic interactions among adaptation strategies. Coordinating and integrating climate and non-climate strategies across jurisdictions and policy sectors are the most significant and challenging tasks for multilevel governance in the GBR region and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0aClimate change adaptation 0aMultilevel governance 0aSocial-ecological systems 0aGreat Barrier Reef 0aAustralia1 aLeitch, Anne M.1 aNelson, Donald R.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2013 Aug., v. 23 p.800-812dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245009700167300001800264520072400282592002801006653001801034653001501052653002201067653002101089653002301110700002101133773015201154856007701306852000901383655001201392IND60522361320221119074631.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052236132DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2009-09072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHering, Stefanie A.10aHigh-pressure Syntheses and Crystal Structures of Monoclinic B-Ho2O3 and Orthorhombic HoGaO3  ap. 1032-1040.  aMonoclinic holmium sesquioxide B-Ho₂O₃ and orthorhombic holmium orthogallate HoGaO₃ were synthesized in a Walker-type multianvil apparatus under high-pressure / high-temperature conditions of 11.5 GPa / 1250 °C and 7.5 GPa / 1250 °C, respectively.

The multifoliolate leaf characteristics presents a potential mechanism whereby quality and leafiness can be changed. This investigation was designed to study the penetrance of the multifoliolate trait into ‘Mesa-Sirsa,’ a non-dormant trifoliolate cultivar. Hand and bee-pollinated reciprocal crosses were made between a trifoliolate (tf) Mesa-Sirsa clone and four multifoliolate (mf) alfalfa clones to determine if genes for the mf trait could be transmitted and expressed in the F₁ generation. Specific leaf weight and internode length were studied in the F₁ generation of controlled handpollinated crosses. The multifoliolate characteristic was effectively transmitted in both hand and bee-pollinated experiments with an average expression of 33%. Expression of the mf trait among progeny of the four multifoliolate clones ranged from 8 to 47%. Average specific leaf weight was consistently higher in the mf progeny compared to the tf progeny, however, these differences were not significant expect in progeny of Mesa-Sirsa × mf 2. Average internode length varied significantly among crosses and between the tf and mf progeny of crosses MS × mf 1 and MS × mf 2. The multifoliolate clones used in this study had the normal tetraploid complement of 32 chromosomes. The multifoliolate characteristic is an easily transmittable trait and through careful selection could be used to improve the leafiness and canopy architecture of nondormant alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3abee pollination 3acanopy 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3ainternode length 3aleaf morphology 3aleaves 3anutritive value 3apenetrance 3aphotosynthesis 3aprogeny 3areciprocal crosses 3atetraploidy1 aDobrenz, A.
