Public health authorities release aerosolized pesticides directly into the atmosphere to help control adult mosquito populations and thereby reduce the threat of diseases, such as Zika Virus. The primary adulticides (i.e. pesticides used to control adult mosquito populations) in Houston, TX are permethrin and malathion. These adulticides are typically sprayed at night using ultra-low volume sprayers. Particulate matter (PM) samples including total suspended and fine PM (PM < 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) were collected at four ground-based sites across Houston in 2013 and include daytime, nighttime, and 24 h samples. Malathion is initially sprayed as coarse aerosol (5–25 μm), but is measured in fine aerosol (<2.5 μm) and coarse aerosol in the urban atmosphere. Particle size is relevant both for deposition velocities and for human exposure. Atmospheric permethrin concentrations measured in nighttime samples peak at 60 ng m⁻³, while malathion nighttime concentrations peak near 40 ng m⁻³. Malaoxon, an oxidation product of malathion, was also frequently detected at concentrations >10 ng m⁻³, indicating significant nighttime oxidation. Based on the loss of malathion and the increase in malaoxon, the atmospheric half-life of malathion in Houston was estimated at <12 h, which was significantly shorter than previous half-life estimates (∼days). Importantly, malaoxon is estimated to be 22–33 times more toxic to humans than malathion. Both the aerosol size and the half-life are critical for mosquito control, human exposure, and risk assessment of these routine pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZika virus 3aadulticides 3aaerodynamics 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3adisease transmission 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aimagos 3amalaoxon 3amalathion 3amosquito control 3amosquito-borne diseases 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3apermethrin 3apublic health 3arisk assessment 3asummer 3atoxicity 0aMalathion 0aMalaoxon 0aDISCOVER-AQ 0aParticulate matter 0aPermethrin 0acis-Permethrin 0aTrans-Permethrin1 aClark, Adelaide E.1 aYoon, Subin1 aHildebrandt Ruiz, Lea1 aSheesley, Rebecca J.1 aUsenko, Sascha0 tChemosphere.g2021 July, v. 275 p.129951-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1299513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010300131300001600234500001400250520128300264592002801547650002901575650001701604650002201621650001201643650002201655650001901677650001301696650001201709650001101721650001401732650001301746650001501759650001301774650002101787650001601808650002501824650001401849650001201863650001101875653001101886653001401897653001701911653001001928700001501938700001201953700002201965700001601987773013802003852000902141655001202150IND60723740220221122032613.0210117e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072374022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManjunatha, N.10aEffect of bean common mosaic virus infection on yield potential and nodulation of cowpea genotypes  ap. 185-191.  aNAL-light  aA study was conducted to assess the effect of Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) disease incidence on yield potential and nodulation of cowpea genotypes. All the genotypes were artificially inoculated with virus inoculum collected from C-152 cowpea plants. The results showed BCMV could interfere with yield potential and rhizobium-cowpea symbiotic relationship. Based on extent of disease incidence, number of nodules plant⁻¹ varied among the genotypes. The resistance control, V-5 produced more of number nodules plant⁻¹ (22.8). The study indicated that genotype, IC 202782 was superior in terms of resistance, 100 seed weight (12.7 g), green fodder yield (17.8 t ha⁻¹) and fodder quality under virus pressure. The genotype, IC 8996 was also found resistant to BCMV infection and good grain yielder (15.5 q ha⁻¹) with maximum height (68.3 cm).The statistical analysis showed disease incidence and yield attributes were negatively associated whereas, number of nodules and fodder quality parameters had positive association. The genotypes obtained with superior characteristics in terms of resistance, grain and quality fodder yields, are expected to be useful to growers and to breeding programmes seeking to control yield losses caused by viruses, particularly BCMV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBean common mosaic virus 3aagroforestry 3abreeding programs 3acowpeas 3adisease incidence 3aforage quality 3agenotype 3agrowers 3aheight 3ainfection 3ainoculum 3anodulation 3apressure 3arange management 3aseed weight 3astatistical analysis 3asymbiosis 3aviruses 3ayields 0aCowpea 0aGenotypes 0aGreen fodder 0aVirus1 aSah, R.

However, it has been difficult to separate the true effect of DO from that of nitrite, as DO variation often affects nitrite accumulation. The effect of DO on N2O production by an enriched nitrifying sludge, consisting of both AOB and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), was investigated in this study. Nitrite accumulation was minimised by augmenting nitrite oxidation through the addition of an enriched NOB sludge. It was demonstrated that the specific N2O production rate increased from 0 to 1.9 ± 0.09 (n = 3) mg N2O–N/hr/g VSS with an increase of DO concentration from 0 to 3.0 mg O2/L, whereas N2O emission factor (the ratio between N2O nitrogen emitted and the ammonium nitrogen converted) decreased from 10.6 ± 1.7% (n = 3) at DO = 0.2 mg O2/L to 2.4 ± 0.1% (n = 3) at DO = 3.0 mg O2/L. The site preference measurements indicated that both the AOB denitrification and hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation pathways contributed to N2O production, and DO had an important effect on the relative contributions of the two pathways. This finding is supported by analysis of the process data using an N2O model describing both pathways. As DO increased from 0.2 to 3.0 mg O2/L, the contribution of AOB denitrification decreased from 92% − 95%–66% − 73%, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the contribution by the NH2OH oxidation pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aemissions factor 3ahydroxylamine 3amodels 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3asludge 0aDissolved oxygen 0aNitrous oxide 0aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria 0aPathways 0aSite preference 0aModel1 aNi, Bing-Jie1 aErler, Dirk1 aYe, Liu1 aYuan, Zhiguo0 tWater research.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 66 p.12-21dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245014600209300001600355506007600371520172700447592002802174506003702202650001302239650000802252650001602260650001502276650001002291650001602301650002602317650002302343650001002366650000902376650001402385650001402399650004702413650001802460650000902478650001402487650001002501650002702511653001602538653001202554653001502566653000802581653001402589653001102603700001902614700002502633700001702658773012402675856008202799852000902881655001202890IND60547222520221207135827.0160903e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054722252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.09.0142doi7 aPMC43364412pmcid7 a257376562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQasem, Jafar A.10aCharacterization and evaluation of an arbitrary primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) product for the specific detection of Brucella species  ap. 220-226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLaboratory detection of Brucella is based largely on bacterial isolation and phenotypic characterization. These methods are lengthy and labor-intensive and have been associated with a heightened risk of laboratory-acquired infection. Antibody based indirect detection methods also suffer from limitations in proper diagnosis of the organism. To overcome these problems, nucleic acid amplification has been explored for rapid detection and confirmation of the presence of Brucella spp. PCR-based diagnostics is useful for screening large populations of livestock to identify infected individuals and confirms the presence of the pathogen. Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was performed and identified a 1.3kb PCR fragment specifically amplifiable from DNA isolated from Brucella. A BLAST search revealed no significant homology with the reported sequences from species other than the members of Brucella. The isolated fragment seems to be a part of d-alanine–d-alanine ligase gene in Brucella sp. Translational BLAST revealed certain degree of homology of this sequence with orthologs of this gene reported from other microbial species at the deduced amino acid level. The sequence information was used to develop PCR based assays to detect Brucella sp. from various samples. The minimum detection limit of Brucella from blood and milk samples spiked with Brucella DNA was found to be 1ng/ml and 10ng/ml, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the PCR based detection protocol was successfully used for the detection of Brucella from various organs and spiked samples of diseased sheep. Diagnosis of Brucellosis by PCR based method reported in this study is relatively rapid, specific and simple.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3ablood 3abrucellosis 3adiagnostic techniques 3agene amplification 3agenes 3amilk 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arapid methods 3arisk 3ascreening 3asheep 3atranslation (genetics) 0aBrucellosis 0aabortus 0amelitensis 0aPCR 0aDiagnosis 0aKuwait1 aAlMomin, Sabah1 aAl-Mouqati, Salwa A.1 aKumar, Vinod0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2015 Mar., v. 22 p.220-226dElsevier B.V.aKing Saud Universityx1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245015000154300001800304520027100322592002800593650002700621650001000648650001800658650001900676650001900695650001500714650001500729650001100744650002100755700001400776700001800790700001600808773012800824856007200952852000901024655001201033IND60658268420221120102330.0190817e20080807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065826842DNAL7 a10.1039/b802127a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng10aPhase-selectivity photocatalysis: a new approach in organic pollutants’ photodecomposition by nanovoid core(TiO₂)/shell(SiO₂) nanoparticles  ap. 3756-3758.  aCore(TiO₂)/shell(SiO₂) nanoparticles, with a void layer between the TiO₂ core and the silica layer, act as phase-selectivity photocatalysts for the photodecomposition of organic pollutants (gas phase) without any damage to their organic supports (solid phase).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3agases 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asilica 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Tao1 aChen, Wenxing1 aHori, Teruo0 tChemical communications.g2008 Aug. 7, , no. 32 p.3756-3758dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b802127a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009000166300001400256500002000270520130900290592002801599650002901627650002601656650002501682650002801707650002501735650001101760650001201771650001701783650002001800651001101820773011101831856008001942852000902022655001202031IND60789234820221121214500.0220819e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078923482DNAL7 a10.1111/1746-692X.121482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Jonathan10aBrazilian Agriculture: Balancing Growth with the Need for Equality and Sustainability  ap. 32-36.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBrazil's agricultural sector has grown rapidly over the past 20 years, but two reservations have been frequently expressed with respect to the country's development model. The first is that the benefits of agricultural growth have accrued principally to a narrow group of large‐scale commercial farmers, while smaller‐scale traditional farmers, and the rural economy more generally, have languished. A second concern relates to the environmental footprint of agricultural development, and in particular agriculture's contribution to the loss of rainforest. This article suggests that future growth can be reconciled with rapid poverty reduction and improved environmental sustainability. In order to sustain agricultural growth, policies need to support further innovation and tackle constraints that stem from the wider context in which the sector operates. Achieving that growth more equitably will require support for development pathways within and outside agriculture, with policies that take a more realistic view of which farmers have the potential to be economically viable. Improved environmental progress will mean putting ambitious legislation into practice. Government policies have identified the correct priorities, which need to be better reflected in the allocation of public funding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural industry 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic sustainability 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3apoverty 3arain forests 3arural economics 3aBrazil0 tEuroChoices.g2017 Apr., v. 16, no. 1 p.32-36dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl4053123x1478-09177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1746-692X.121483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245008600212300001600298506007600314520080400390592002801194506003701222650000801259650002101267650002201288650003501310650002201345650002201367650002701389650003301416650003001449650002201479651001001501651000901511651001701520653002201537653000801559653002501567773010201592856008201694852000901776655001201785IND60547222620221207135825.0160903e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054722262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.09.0152doi7 aPMC43364462pmcid7 a257376512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaklabi, Abdullah10aGenetic diversity of Moringa peregrina species in Saudi Arabia with ITS sequences  ap. 186-190.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genus Moringa was the family of Moringaceae and Moringa oleifera and Moringa peregrina are the most famous species of Moringa. M. peregrina is widely grown in Saudi Arabia, Iran and India. Therefore, based on these reports, this study aimed to investigate the first systematic attempt to regulate the genetic diversity of the species M. peregrina in Saudi Arabian samples collected from several geographic locations using internal transcribed sequences. Genomic DNA was separated by CTAB extraction method and PCR was performed. Later on, DNA sequencing was performed for PCR products with ITS. In conclusion, the present study affords the first report on genetic stability of M. peregrina using ITS analysis in Saudi Arabia. Further studies are suggested in order to study in different regions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aMoringa oleifera 3aMoringa peregrina 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aIndia 3aIran 3aSaudi Arabia 0aMoringa peregrina 0aDNA 0aITS and Saudi Arabia0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2015 Mar., v. 22 p.186-190dElsevier B.V.x1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015100166520129900317592002801616650002501644650001201669650001701681650002401698650001801722650001701740650001001757650002001767650002101787650002101808650001801829650001601847650002501863650002401888650001601912650001701928650001501945700003201960700002301992700002002015700002402035773012602059856007802185852000902263655001202272IND60745387720221122011528.0210723e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074538772DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100710712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakya, Shrijana 10aAnti-Oxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Substance Generated Newly in Paeoniae Radix Alba Extract Fermented with Plant-Derived Lactobacillus brevis 174A  aFermentation of medicinal herbs can be a significant technique to obtain bioactive compounds. Paeoniae Radix (PR) used in the present study is a well-known herbal medicine that exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility that a bioactive compound is newly generated in PR extract by fermentation with a plant-derived lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus brevis 174A. We determined the anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The PR extract fermented with Lactobacillus brevis 174A markedly increased the total phenolic content, decreased intracellular ROS levels, inhibited the release of nitric oxide (NO). It also suppressed inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-ɑ, while simultaneously downregulating the gene expressions of iNOS, IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and IL-1β compared to the unfermented PR extract. Furthermore, the bioactive compound newly generated from the fermentation was identified as pyrogallol. It inhibits the inflammatory responses in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that fermentation of the herbal extract used as a medium together with the plant-derived lactic acid bacterial strain may be a practical strategy to produce medicines and supplements for healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aPaeonia 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3adose response 3afermentation 3agenes 3ahealth services 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterleukin-6 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3apyrogallol1 aDanshiitsoodol, Narandalai 1 aSugimoto, Sachiko 1 aNoda, Masafumi 1 aSugiyama, Masanori 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 July 02, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100710713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013200131300001600263500001400279520208000293592002802373650002402401650003002425650001702455650002202472650001802494650001402512650001202526650001102538650002802549650002602577650001102603650001102614650001102625650001302636650001702649650002102666650001102687650001202698653002302710653002202733653002002755653001702775700001602792700002102808700001802829773013802847852000902985655001202994IND60723740520221121220244.0210117e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072374052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumawat, S.

The treatment consists of three pearl millet cultivars viz., BAIF Bajra 1, AVKB 19 and GFB 1; three cutting management practices viz. no cut, one cutting at 40 DAS and two cuttings at 40 and 80 DAS; and two levels of nitrogen viz., 100% RDN (60 kg/ha) and 150% RDN (90 kg/ha). The results showed that maximum plant height (182.07 cm) and yield attributes viz., tillers/m row length (35.11) and leaf stem ratio (2.66) of fodder pearl millet was recorded by ‘cultivar, AVKB 19’ whereas maximum yield viz., green fodder (211.68 q/ha), grain (15.16 q/ha) and dry matter (44.56 q/ha) yield were recorded with pearl millet cultivar GFB-1. The study on cutting management indicated that plant height (165.83 cm), tillers/m row length (45.57), and after two cut for fodder gave the highest green fodder (311.77 q/ha), dry matter (68.82 q/ha) and crude protein (10.54 q/ha) yield, nitrogen uptake (224.09 kg/ha) and net return (Rs. 78380/ha). Further, higher plant height (165.67 cm); yield attributes viz., tillers/m row length (30.89) and leaf: stem ratio (2.31); yield viz., green fodder (200.17 q/ha), stover (63.14 q/ha), grain (12.92 q/ha) and dry matter (41.69 q/ha) yield; quality parameters viz., crude protein per cent (7.76%) and yield (7.06 q/ha); nitrogen uptake (193.22 kg/ha) and economics viz., net return (Rs. 74772/ha) and B: C ratio (4.22) were recorded with 150% RDN (recommended dose of nitrogen). Similarly, interaction effect of variety and cutting and nitrogen and cutting management had significant effect on green fodder, dry matter and crude protein yield. Pearl millet variety GFB-1 with two cuts for green fodder was superior in respect of dry matter production, crude protein yield, and nitrogen up take as well as net returns to all other varieties along with different cutting management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus americanus 3aadministrative management 3aagroforestry 3acosts and returns 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3acutting 3adosage 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aleaves 3alength 3anitrogen 3aplant height 3arange management 3astover 3atillers 0aCutting management 0aFodder production 0aNitrogen levels 0aPearl millet1 aArif, Mohd.1 aShekhawat, S.

However, the contribution of multiple ecotypes to odorant production in the complicated and dynamic lake ecosystems remains unclear. In this study, the odorants and environmental conditions in algae-dominated zones (ADZs) and macrophyte-dominated zones (MDZs) in Lake Taihu were identified and characterized. Results showed that the ADZs were characterized by an abundance of pigments and nutrients and low DO levels, while the MDZs were featured as high TOC/TN ratios and high DO levels. Most odorants in ADZs and several in MDZs exceeded the odorant threshold content. The dominant odorants were dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), β-ionone and β-cyclocitral in ADZs, which were associated with the accumulation and decomposition of algal detritus. For MDZs, the dominant odorants were 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and geosmin, which were at least partially attributed to the massive addition of bait in a traditional aquaculture area. In addition, the odorant concentration in the water of ADZs was approximately 3 to 21 times higher than that in MDZs, while in the benthic sediment, the odorant concentration in ADZs was approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than in MDZs. This study highlights the production and accumulation of nuisance odorants in the benthic sediment of ADZs, indicating a risk of diffusion from the sediment to the water column. This was supported by the correlation of odorants in the water column with that in the sediment. The results of this study will be helpful for the management of different ecotypes suffering from nuisance odorants problems.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX07203003cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  a41703105cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41573061cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3a2-methylisoborneol 3aalgae 3aaquaculture 3aclimate change 3adetritus 3adimethyl disulfide 3aecotypes 3aeutrophication 3ageosmin 3alakes 3aodor compounds 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asediments1 aFang, Jiaqi1 aWang, Guoxiang1 aHuang, Hexiao1 aWang, Zhuosen1 aSi, Zejun1 aZhang, Limin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Dec., v. 27, no. 34 p.42221-42229dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07896-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01122naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245006500168300001800233520018700251592002800438650001600466650002300482650002100505650001300526700002000539700002500559700002700584773012800611856007200739852000900811655001200820IND60657252120221120163138.0190816e20020520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065725212DNAL7 a10.1039/b203183c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, Christopher S.

However, sequence assemblies of most plant genomes remain fragmented. Only recent breakthroughs in accurate long‐read sequencing have made it possible to achieve highly contiguous sequence assemblies with a few tens of contigs per chromosome, that is a number small enough to allow for a systematic inquiry into the causes of the remaining sequence gaps and the approaches and resources needed to close them. Here, we analyse sequence gaps in the current reference genome sequence of barley cv. Morex (MorexV3). Optical map and sequence raw data, complemented by ChIP‐seq data for centromeric histone variant CENH3, were used to estimate the abundance of centromeric, ribosomal DNA, and subtelomeric repeats in the barley genome. These estimates were compared with copy numbers in the MorexV3 pseudomolecule sequence. We found that almost all centromeric sequences and 45S ribosomal DNA repeat arrays were absent from the MorexV3 pseudomolecules and that the majority of sequence gaps can be attributed to assembly breakdown in long stretches of satellite repeats. However, missing sequences cannot fully account for the difference between assembly size and flow cytometric genome size estimates. We discuss the prospects of gap closure with ultra‐long sequence reads.  aPublisher supplied data  a17‐17564ScCzech Science Foundation  a18‐14450JcCzech Science Foundation  aCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000827cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aHE 9114/1‐1cGerman Research Foundation  aMA 6611/4‐1cGerman Research Foundation  aFKZ 031B0884cGerman Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)  cOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL. 3abarley 3abiotechnology 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3achromosomes 3aflow cytometry 3agenome 3ahistones 3aribosomal DNA 3asatellites1 aToegelová, Helena1 aTulpová, Zuzana1 aKuo, Yi‐Tzu1 aStein, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-87311 aDoležel, Jaroslav,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6263-04921 aHouben, Andreas1 aŠimková, Hana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4159-76191 aMascher, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-60130 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2022 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.1373-1386dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.138163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013500167500001900302520183600321592002802157650000802185650002602193650001902219650002002238650001702258650001302275650001902288650001102307650001602318650004302334650001002377653001402387653001902401653001802420700001902438700002102457773011502478856008402593852000902677655001202686IND60734850820221116152239.0210610e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073485082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Ida H.10aDevelopment and validation of real-time PCR assays for the detection of Ehrlichia species and E. chaffeensis in clinical specimens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEhrlichiosis, caused by Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia, is considered an emerging infectious disease due to the increasing number of reported cases. Symptoms are non-specific and occur within 1 to 2 weeks following the bite of an infected tick. Confirmatory laboratory diagnostic methods vary in sensitivity and specimen requirements, which can lead to delayed diagnosis. PCR testing serves as an efficient approach to Ehrlichia confirmation in the acute stage of illness. Published assays have been effectively used to detect human ehrlichiosis at limit of detections ranging from 10 to 50 genomic copies (GC) of Ehrlichia DNA. With the discovery of new species capable of human infection, we wanted to develop assays that are sensitive and encompass a wide range of Ehrlichia. Here we developed and validated two sensitive and specific real-time PCR assays (PanE1 and PanE2) for the detection of Ehrlichia species, as well as two real-time PCR assays (ECh2 and ECh4) for the detection of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, specifically. The limit of detection was determined to be 10 GC per reaction with 100% confidence, and as little as 1 GC with lower efficiencies. Accuracy was assessed at 100% correlation. Specificity from exclusivity testing demonstrated that neither the Ehrlichia species assays (n = 60), nor the E. chaffeensis specific assays (n = 64) had cross reactivity with near neighbors or environmental bacteria. A positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of ≥93% was determined by evaluating banked clinical specimens from 62 patients with the assays. These real-time PCR assays are effective tools to detect human Ehrlichia species during the acute stage of illness. Early detection of Ehrlichia infection by these real-time PCR assays can facilitate diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia chaffeensis 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aehrlichiosis 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3anew species 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aticks 0aEhrlichia 0aE. chaffeensis 0aReal-time PCR1 aAustin, Amy L.1 aKato, Cecilia Y.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2021 July, v. 186 p.106225-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010100178300001800279500001900297520045000316592002800766650001600794650001000810650001300820700001800833700001800851700002000869700006300889700006700952700005901019700005601078773012001134856008301254852000901337655001201346IND60697622620210618000000.0200605e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069762262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c015272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuleymanov, Abdusalom A.10aTriazene-Activated Donor–Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Ring-Opening and (3 + 2) Annulation Reactions  ap. 4517-4522.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDonor–acceptor cyclopropanes substituted with 3,3-dialkyltriazenyl groups are described herein.

A total of 165 commercial rice samples from Sri Lanka were collected to determine their cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb) concentrations. The exposure risk for Sri Lankans from the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of these toxicants was assessed. Simultaneously, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs) and the hazard index (HI). The results revealed that the average levels of Cd, As, and Pb in commercial rice were 0.080 ± 0.130, 0.077 ± 0.040, and 0.031 ± 0.050 mg/kg, respectively, with ranges of 0.003–0.727, 0.019–0.217, and 0.001–0.345 mg/kg (expressed on a dry weight basis), respectively. The average EDIs of Cd, inorganic As (iAs), and Pb were 0.772, 0.490, and 0.306 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day, respectively; these were below provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) values recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), but iAs was above the recommended reference doses (RfDs) recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). However, approximately 25% and 75% of the Cd and iAs HQs for the Sri Lankan population, respectively, were greater than 1, suggesting a potential health risk, whereas the HQs for Pb was less than 1. Considering the additive effect, HI values of the P90, P95, P97.5, and P99 percentiles would reach 4.773, 6.458, 8.392, and 11.614, implying that intake of the combined metals might result in potential health risks.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019M663571cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadditive effect 3aarsenic 3abody weight 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3adietary exposure 3aenvironmental protection 3ahuman health 3alead 3amarkets 3apollution 3aresearch 3arice 3arisk 3atoxic substances 3aSri Lanka1 aHan, Jialiang1 aXu, Xiaohang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7084-31321 aXu, Zhidong1 aAbeysinghe, Kasun S.1 aAtapattu, Anjana J.1 aDe Silva, P.

Conventional metal recovery technologies include physical, chemical and biological methods, but they are generally energy and chemical intensive. The recent development of bioelectrochemical technology provides a new approach for efficient metal recovery, because it offers a flexible platform for both oxidation and reduction reaction oriented processes. While dozens of recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of the bioelectrochemical metal recovery concept, the mechanisms have been different and confusing. This study provides a review that summarizes and discusses the different fundamental mechanisms of metal conversion, with the aim of facilitating the scientific understanding and technology development. While the general approach of bioelectrochemical metal recovery is using metals as the electron acceptor in the cathode chamber and organic waste as the electron donor in the anode chamber, there are so far four mechanisms that have been reported: (1) direct metal recovery using abiotic cathodes; (2) metal recovery using abiotic cathodes supplemented by external power sources; (3) metal conversion using bio-cathodes; and (4) metal conversion using bio-cathodes supplemented by external power sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenvironmental health 3ametals 3aorganic wastes 3aoxidation 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aBioelectrochemical system 0aMetal recovery 0aWastewater 0aRedox potential 0aMicrobial fuel cell1 aRen, Zhiyong Jason0 tWater research.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 66 p.219-232dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004700099040001800146100001700164245005400181300001600235500000900251520108700260592002801347650001501375650002301390650001601413650001401429650001101443650002001454650002301474650001601497650001801513700001801531700001701549773020601566852000901772856009401781655001201875991587025540742620221119071656.0191028e197604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690486942DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1976.00472425000500020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClapp, D.

The insecticide oxidized to its sulfoxide and sulfone but none of its oxygen analogs were detected. The disulfoton and disolfoton sulfoxide degraded in 32 days or less while the disulfoton sulfone persisted for more than 64 days. The influences of soil moisture content, temperature, and disulfoton concentration were found to be interrelated in their effects on the rate of disulfoton dissipation and sulfone formation. In general, the most rapid degradation of disulfoton on a percentage basis occurred at lower initial concentrations of disulfoton, irrespective of the moisture content of the soil and the temperature, and the slowest degradation occurred at higher initial levels of disulfoton in association with higher moisture levels and high or low temperatures. The conditions for the greatest percent conversion of disulfoton to its sulfone generally coincided with the conditions of the most rapid dissipation of the disulfoton.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisulfoton 3adisulfoton sulfone 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asilt loam soils 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3awater content1 aNaylor, D.

A recent genetic study indicated that the gene locus for the anti-oxidant defense enzyme methionine sulphoxide reductase A (MsrA) is positively associated with the development of visceral adiposity. This work tested the hypothesis that Msr activity is diminished in visceral fat as a result of obesity. It used two animal models of obesity, wild-type rats fed a high-fat (45% of calories from fat) diet and Zucker rats fed a 10% fat calorie diet. The data indicate that MsrA activity was selectively reduced by ? 25% in the visceral adipose, but not subcutaneous adipose or liver, of both rat models as compared to control, wild type rats receiving a 10% fat calorie diet. MsrB activity was similarly reduced only in visceral fat. The data indicate that Msr activity is reduced by obesity and may alter oxidative stress signalling of obesity. 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3aanimal models 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3aliver 3aloci 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3aoxidoreductases 3arats 3asignal transduction 3avisceral fat1 aPicklo Sr., Matthew J.0 tFree radical research.g2011, v. 45, no. 9 p.1052-1060dOverseas Publishers AssociationwJournal:28232x1029-24707nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10715762.2011.591793  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HNRC1708.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001600267520084900283592002801132650001101160650001701171650001401188650001101202650001701213650001801230650001601248650001301264650001201277650001501289650001201304650001701316700002501333700002201358700002501380773012301405856008401528852000901612655001201621IND60099655420221118054928.0141105e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009965542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2013.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWee, Natalie K.Y.14aThe mammalian copper transporters CTR1 and CTR2 and their roles in development and disease  ap. 960-963.  aCopper is vital to cell function. The influx of reduced copper ions is controlled by two functionally homologous transmembrane solute carrier transporters CTR1 (encoded by SLC31A1) and CTR2 (encoded by SLC31A2). These copper transporters vary in their expression profiles and intracellular localisation patterns. CTR1 plays roles in the developing embryo as well as regulating homeostasis in the adult mammal. In contrast, the regulation, expression and function of CTR2 is poorly defined. Both are capable of transporting other divalent metal ions and are the primary transporters for platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin. This review summarises our current understanding of these two copper transporters and highlights their roles in cellular processes, embryonic development, differentiation, cancer, immunity and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acell biology 3acisplatin 3acopper 3adrug therapy 3aembryogenesis 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunity 3amammals 3ametal ions 3asolutes 3atransporters1 aWeinstein, Daniel C.1 aFraser, Stuart T.1 aAssinder, Stephen J.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2013 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.960-963dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011200153300002000265520183000285592002802115650004402143650002502187650001702212650002402229650002402253650001002277650002102287650001602308650001702324650001302341650001902354650001902373650002002392650001502412650001402427650001702441650003302458650001102491650001202502650003402514650001102548700001502559700001902574700002202593700002302615700001802638700001802656773012402674856007402798852000902872655001202881IND60664867620221118015546.0190912e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066486762DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra48062c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlba, M.10aSelective dual-side functionalization of hollow SiO₂ micropillar arrays for biotechnological applications  ap. 11409-11416.  aWe report a method for the fabrication and selective functionalization of the internal and external surfaces of high-aspect-ratio hollow silicon dioxide (SiO₂) micropillar arrays. The strategy enables independent surface reactions with no cross-contamination. The dual-functionalization is carried out during the fabrication of the micropillars in four steps. First, a sample of macroporous silicon is prepared by electrochemical etching and then it is thermally oxidized to create a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the internal surface of the macropores. Next, the internal surface is functionalized with mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTMS). Subsequently, the micropillars are released by etching the back side of silicon wafers using a solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Finally, the external surface of the micropillars is chemically modified in a multi-step biofunctionalization with aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES), glutaraldehyde (GTA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The resulting structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the surface reactions were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The internal and external sides were photolabeled with tetramethyl rhodamine-5-maleimide and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), respectively, and analyzed using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The peculiar three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the micropillars allows these double-active surfaces to be imaged at the same time. Results demonstrated the successful dual-side chemical modification and the feasibility of imaging both internal and external sides. Due to its remarkable architecture and chemical versatility, these micropillar arrays are a promising engineered platform for a range of applications such as biosensing, 3D cell culture and drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abovine serum albumin 3acell culture 3aconfocal microscopy 3across contamination 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimage analysis 3aisothiocyanates 3amacropores 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asilicon 3atetramethylammonium compounds 3awafers1 aRomano, E.1 aFormentín, P.1 aEravuchira, P.

The results of the present study indicated that the mutual solubility of the compounds decreased with an increase in the water content of the solvent and a decrease in the temperature of the solution. The experimental data set was correlated by applying the UNIQUAC model. The average variance between the experimental and calculated compositions was 0.35%, indicating that the model can accurately predict behavior of the compounds at different temperatures and degrees of hydration. The adjustment of interaction parameters enables both the simulation of liquid–liquid extractors for deacidification of vegetable oil and the prediction of phase compositions for the oil and alcohol-rich phases that are generated during cooling of the stream exiting the extractor (when using ethanol as the solvent).  aPublisher supplied data 3adeacidification 3aethanol 3aextractors 3afree fatty acids 3amodels 3aprediction 3arice bran oil 3asolubility 3asolvents 3avariance 3avegetable oil 3awater content 3awater temperature1 aGaravazo, Bruna R.1 aRodrigues, Christianne E.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 June, v. 110, no. 3 p.418-427dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245017400215506011700389506007600506520187700582592002802459506003702487650001602524650001802540650001102558650001902569650001102588650001202599650001302611650002502624651001202649653002402661653000902685653001702694653002902711653001302740700001802753700001802771700005802789773011902847856008802966852000903054655001203063IND60696921520221207085050.0220719e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069692152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9787-832710aMicroplastic particle emission from wastewater treatment plant effluents into river networks in Germany: Loads, spatial patterns of concentrations and potential toxicity  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are considered to be a point source of microplastic (particles <5 mm) for riverine environments. However, data on microplastic effluent concentrations in WWTPs is collected with a broad range of methods, which impede comparisons across data sets. We provide an estimate of the annual emissions of microplastic particles by WWTPs into the ten major river basins of Germany. We analyze the concentration patterns of microplastics among different stream orders resulting from the spatial organization of WWTPs along the river network. The local in-stream microplastic concentrations are estimated through a network model that accounts for routing of microplastics through the entire fluvial network under the assumption of no losses by sedimentation, entanglement or degradation. Previous studies have observed microplastic concentrations in treated WWTPs effluents ranging several orders of magnitude. In 19 studies reviewed (2016–2020), the concentrations of observed microplastic concentrations (size range between 10 and 5000 μm) in 79 WWTP effluents ranged between 4 ∗ 10⁰ and 4.5 ∗ 10⁵ items/m³ with a median of around 6400 items/m³. The total, median microplastic load emitted by WWTPs in Germany is 7 ∗ 10¹² items/year. The simulated microplastic concentrations, on average, tend to increase with increasing stream order suggesting that the WWTP effluent fraction accumulates with a higher rate than discharge. Simulated WWTP-derived in-stream concentrations are higher than observed concentrations with all sources of microplastic, not only those from WWTPs. Observed microplastic concentrations in rivers as well as the considerably higher simulated, WWTP-derived microplastic concentration, even for low flow conditions, are approximately one order of magnitude below currently known toxic effect levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironment 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3astreams 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3aGermany 0aRiver ecotoxicology 0aWWTP 0aStream order 0aEnvironmental assessment 0aDilution1 aKumar, Rohini1 aYang, Soohyun1 aBüttner, Olaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4332-54410 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 737 p.139544-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245007100213300001600284500001100300506007600311520088800387592002801275506003701303650001501340650001701355650001201372650001301384650001101397650002301408650001701431700002101448700005901469773014701528856008201675852000901757655001201766IND60588794420221207090428.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058879442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-017-2603-02doi7 aPMC57652092pmcid7 a287792092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagliuso, Alessandro14aThe ever-growing complexity of the mitochondrial fission machinery  ap. 355-374.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mitochondrial network constantly changes and remodels its shape to face the cellular energy demand. In human cells, mitochondrial fusion is regulated by the large, evolutionarily conserved GTPases Mfn1 and Mfn2, which are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and by OPA1, embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In contrast, the soluble dynamin-related GTPase Drp1 is recruited from the cytosol to mitochondria and is key to mitochondrial fission. A number of new players have been recently involved in Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, ranging from large cellular structures such as the ER and the cytoskeleton to the surprising involvement of the endocytic dynamin 2 in the terminal abscission step. Here we review the recent findings that have expanded the mechanistic model for the mitochondrial fission process in human cells and highlight open questions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscission 3acytoskeleton 3acytosol 3adynamins 3ahumans 3amechanistic models 3amitochondria1 aCossart, Pascale1 aStavru, Fabrizia1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0345-20130 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Feb., v. 75, no. 3 p.355-374dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2603-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009800167300001800265520214700283592002802430650002202458650001602480650001502496650001402511650002102525650001002546650001102556650000902567650001502576650001402591650001102605650002102616650002202637651001002659700001302669700001702682700001702699700005502716700001802771773011902789856008702908852000902995655001203004IND60653894420221120234705.0190722e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065389442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dong10aCoke Yield Prediction Model for Pyrolysis and Oxidation Processes of Low-Asphaltene Heavy Oil  ap. 6205-6214.  aAccurate prediction of coke yield is the basis for simulation and operation of the in situ combustion process. In view of the low asphaltene content of heavy oil in China, this study established coke yield prediction models for the pyrolysis and oxidation processes of low-asphaltene heavy oil based on the coking characteristics of the main fractions, including saturates (S), aromatics (A), and resins (R). The models were verified by the experimental coke yields of heavy oils using a fixed-bed reaction system. The prediction model for the pyrolysis process included evaporation rate equations and kinetic equations for coking reactions. Besides the same parts with pyrolysis, the model for the oxidation process included the kinetic equation of coke oxidation. The evaporation rate equations were determined by fitting the mass loss rate in the evaporation range of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) pyrolysis results with a maximum error of 6%. The kinetic parameters for the conversion of each fraction to the coke precursor were determined by the isoconversional method based on TGA results of the separated SAR fractions. Considering the interactions among fractions during oxidation, this study included mixtures of SAR fractions as the samples and obtained the mass loss results of a single SAR by subtraction. The activation energies of SAR pyrolysis range from 99 to 180 kJ/mol and those of SAR oxidation range from 92 to 130 kJ/mol. The kinetic parameters of coke from the coke precursor were obtained by temperature-programmed coking data of a prepared intermediate, with an activation energy of 177 kJ/mol in an inert atmosphere and 65 kJ/mol in an oxidizing atmosphere. The kinetic parameters of coke oxidation were derived by the isothermal kinetic method in TGA, with an activation energy of 136 kJ/mol. The experimental coke yields of Fengcheng and Hongqian heavy oils under various pyrolysis and oxidation conditions were predicted by this model with an error around 10%, indicating that this model could be successfully applied to the prediction of the coking process of low-asphaltene heavy oil under complex conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aasphaltenes 3acombustion 3aequations 3aevaporation rate 3afuels 3amodels 3aoils 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3aresins 3athermogravimetry 3ayield forecasting 3aChina1 aHou, Jin1 aLuan, Haijun1 aPan, Jingjun1 aSong, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5484-35941 aZheng, Ruonan0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 June 10, v. 33, no. 7 p.6205-6214dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245007900215300001600294506007600310520223900386592002802625506003702653650001902690650002402709650001802733650000802751650001502759650001602774650002102790650001502811650001702826650001102843650002002854650001802874650002602892650001502918650001402933650001802947650002402965650002402989650001003013650001203023653001303035653001603048653001503064700001503079700001703094700001703111700001403128700001703142700001603159773011403175856008503289852000903374655001203383IND60613834720221207061722.0190726e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061383472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.02.0222doi7 aPMC59624142pmcid7 a295304672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarela-Stokes, A.S.10aTick microbial communities within enriched extracts of Amblyomma maculatum  ap. 798-805.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur objective of this study was to explore the bacterial microbiome in fresh or fresh-frozen adult Amblyomma maculatum (Gulf Coast ticks) using extracts enriched for microbial DNA. We collected 100 questing adult A. maculatum, surface disinfected them, and extracted DNA from individual ticks collected the same day or after storage at −80 °C. Because only extracts with microbial DNA concentrations above 2 ng/μL were considered suitable for individual analysis, we expected fewer samples to meet these requirements. Of individual ticks extracted, 48 extracts met this minimum concentration. We pooled 20 additional extracts that had lower concentrations to obtain seven additional pools that met the minimum DNA concentration. Libraries created from these 55 samples were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform, and data sets were analyzed using QIIME to identify relative abundance of microorganisms by phylum down to genus levels. Proteobacteria were in greatest abundance, followed by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, at levels between 1.9% and 6.4% average relative abundance. Consistent with the Francisella-like endosymbiont known to be present in A. maculatum, the genus Francisella was detected at highest relative abundance (72.9%; SE 0.02%) for all samples. Among the top ten genera identified (relative abundance ≥ 0.5%) were potential extraction kit contaminants, Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium, the soil bacterium Actinomycetospora, and the known A. maculatum-associated genus, Rickettsia. Four samples had Rickettsia at greater than 1% relative abundance, while nine additional samples had Rickettsia at low (0.01–0.04%) relative abundance. In this study, we used the entire microbe-enriched DNA extract for whole ticks for microbiome analysis. A direct comparison of the microbiome in microbe-enriched DNA and total genomic DNA extracts from halves of the same tick would be useful to determine the utility of this extraction method in this system. We anticipate that future tick microbiome studies will be valuable to explore the influence of microbial diversity on pathogen maintenance and transmission, and to evaluate niche-specific microbiomes within individual tick tissues.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacteria 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aBacteroidetes 3aDNA 3aFirmicutes 3aFrancisella 3aMethylobacterium 3aRickettsia 3aSphingomonas 3aadults 3adata collection 3aendosymbionts 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3apathogens 3asoil bacteria 3astorage temperature 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3atissues 0aIxodidae 0aMississippi 0aMicrobiome1 aPark, S.H.1 aStokes, J.V.1 aGavron, N.A.1 aLee, S.I.1 aMoraru, G.M.1 aRicke, S.C.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2018 May, v. 9, no. 4 p.798-805dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008400172300001600256520186600272592002802138650002402166650001102190650001102201650002202212650001402234650001302248650002802261650002102289650001502310650001902325650001802344650001302362650001802375650003302393653001402426653003002440653002102470700002002491700001702511700001702528700001802545700001502563773009502578856008702673852000902760655001202769IND60601363920221118070153.0190325e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060136392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.07.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZainoodin, A.M.10aHigh power direct methanol fuel cell with a porous carbon nanofiber anode layer  ap. 946-954.  aThree anode electrodes containing Pt–Ru Black as a catalyst were fabricated with a porous layer made with different carbon materials: carbon black (CB), carbon nanofiber (CNF) and a combination of both carbon materials (CB+CNF). The carbon-based porous layer was coated onto a carbon cloth with PTFE pre-treatment for delivering hydrophobic properties and applied in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Characterisation of electrochemical properties for three different anode electrodes was performed with cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature in a half-cell configuration. The evolution of the surface morphology of diffusion layer and electrodes was characterised by using variable-pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM). The electrochemical results indicate that electrode with CNF layer showed the highest current densities compared to CB and CB+CNF with the same catalyst loading. VP-SEM measurements show the network formation within the structure, which could facilitate the methanol mass transfer and improve the catalyst efficiency. The electrodes were applied to a single-cell DMFC, and the cell performance was experimentally investigated under passive operating mode and room temperature. A maximum power density of 23.0mWcm−2 at a current density of 88.0mAcm−2 with a 3M dilute methanol solution was achieved. The results show that the electrodes with a CNF layer could improve the performance of DMFC as compared with commercially used CB and prove it’s potentially application in DMFC technology especially for portable power source applications due to several advantages as followings: operating at low concentration of methanol, operating at room temperature, low catalyst loading in anode and cathode, cheaper, less hazardous and no parasitic load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3amethanol 3aparasite load 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aElectrode 0aDirect methanol fuel cell 0aCarbon nanofiber1 aKamarudin, S.K.1 aMasdar, M.S.1 aDaud, W.R.W.1 aMohamad, A.B.1 aSahari, J.0 tApplied energy.g2014 Jan., v. 113 p.946-954dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.07.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100001500196245011800211300001400329506007600343520141700419592002801836506003701864650001801901650002401919650001901943650001901962650001801981650001001999650001702009650001402026650001802040650000902058650001502067650001402082650001202096650001202108650002202120650001902142650001002161650001202171650001302183653000902196653001702205653002302222653002702245700001502272700001602287700001502303700001302318700001602331773012102347856009002468852000902558655001202567IND60569280320221207142209.0190405e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056928032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.05.0042doi7 aPMC55554422pmcid7 a288393472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRout, P.K.10aEstimation of genetic parameters and genetic trends for milk yield traits in Jamunapari goats in semiarid tropics  ap. 62-65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Jamunapari goats are reared as dairy animals in semi-arid conditions, therefore it is necessary to evaluate the genetic potential for the genetic improvement of milk production traits. The data comprised of 2217 phenotypic records for milk yield at 90days (MY90) and 140days (MY140), total milk yield (TMY) and lactation length (LL) obtained from the progeny of 173 sires and 446 dams during the period 1990–2013. The data were analysed using mixed linear models exploring random effects due to direct additive, maternal and permanent environment variance due to animal. The most appropriate genetic models for milk yield traits were those that included permanent environment effects due to the animal. The direct additive heritability estimates were 0.15±0.05, 0.26±0.07, 0.25±0.08 for MY90, MY140 and TMY, respectively. The additive heritability estimate for LL was low and non-significant at 0.02±0.03. The repeatability estimates were moderate to high ranging from 0.68 to 0.73 for milk yield traits. The repeatability for lactation length was 0.20±0.03. Maternal variances were low ranging from 0.03 for MY90 to 0.13 for TMY. There was an increase in mean milk yield of 0.25, 0.70 and 0.72kg/year respectively at 90 and 140days, and for TMY. Genetic trends and phenotypic trends for MY90, MY140 and TMY were positive and indicated significant improvement in milk traits due to selective breeding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adairy animals 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic models 3agenetic traits 3agenetic trend 3agoats 3aheritability 3alactation 3alinear models 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3arearing 3aselection methods 3asemiarid zones 3asires 3atropics 3avariance 0aGoat 0aAnimal model 0aSelective breeding 0aMilk production traits1 aMatika, O.1 aKaushik, R.1 aDige, M.S.1 aDass, G.1 aSingh, S.K.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Aug., v. 153 p.62-65dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245005600169300001800225520139800243592002801641650004401669650003701713650001101750650000901761650001301770650002101783650004401804650002401848650002001872650003701892651001001929700002001939700001401959700001501973700005701988773011902045856008702164852000902251655001202260IND60653894520221120234602.0190722e20190616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065389452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiaxun10aMolecular Characterization of Henan Anthracite Coal  ap. 6215-6225.  aA type of Chinese anthracite coal was analyzed by several analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (NMR), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Combining the experimental data, a reasonable macromolecular model of anthracite coal (C₂₅₈H₁₇₂O₁₂N₄S) was proposed. HRTEM results showed that the anthracite coal mainly contained aromatic laminates with different lattice sizes, with the length distribution characterized as 35.0% (<5.5 Å), 17.5% (5.5–7.4 Å), 22.5% (7.5–11.4 Å), and 10% (11.5–14.4 Å). The FTIR analysis suggested that ether, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups were the main oxygenated functionalities. The ratio of these groups was approximately 4:3:3, which was consistent with the results of the XPS. On the basis of the rich analytical data, a three-dimensional molecular representation of the anthracite coal was constructed. Then, the properties of the model like NMR were simulated and exhibited a good agreement with the experimental spectrum in peak ranges and composition. The molecular model obtained in this work is useful for further studying the reaction mechanisms during the anthracite utilization processes, and the methodology adopted here can be extrapolated to other coal representations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acoal 3amoieties 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areaction mechanisms 3astable isotopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aChina1 aJiang, Yuanzhen1 aYao, Wang1 aJiang, Xue1 aJiang, Xiumin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8406-99150 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 June 16, v. 33, no. 7 p.6215-6225dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014500178300001600323520173500339592002802074650002702102650002302129650001302152650001002165650004302175650001402218650001502232650002902247650001902276650002602295650001302321653001302334653001902347653001702366653002502383653003202408700001802440700001702458700002202475700002402497700002002521700002102541700001802562700002102580700002002601700001802621700002002639700001502659700001902674773013302693856009002826852000902916655001202925IND60557241120221122011512.0180830e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055724112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorcajada, Juan P.10aValidation of a colistin plasma concentration breakpoint as a predictor of nephrotoxicity in patients treated with colistin methanesulfonate  ap. 725-727.  aNephrotoxicity limits the effective use of colistin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) infections. We previously defined a steady-state colistin plasma concentration (Css) of 2.42 mg/L that predicted nephrotoxicity at end of treatment (EOT). The objective of this study was to validate this breakpoint in a prospective cohort. This was a multicentre, prospective, observational study conducted at three hospitals with a cohort of patients treated for MDR-GNB infection with colistin methanesulfonate from September 2011 until January 2015. Nephrotoxicity was evaluated at Day 7 and at EOT using the RIFLE criteria. Css values were measured and analysed using HPLC. Taking the previously defined breakpoint for colistin concentration as a criterion, patients were divided into two groups (Css, ≤2.42 mg/L vs. >2.42 mg/L). Sixty-four patients were included. Seven patients (10.9%) had a Css > 2.42 mg/L and were compared with the remaining patients. Bivariate analysis showed that patients with a Css > 2.42 mg/L were older and had a significantly higher incidence of nephrotoxicity at Day 7 and EOT. Although not statistically significant, nephrotoxicity occurred earlier in these patients (6.2 days vs. 9.2 days in patients with lower Css; P = 0.091). Multivariate analysis of nephrotoxicity showed that Css > 2.42 mg/L was the only predictive factor. Nephrotoxicity was more frequent and occurred earlier in patients with colistin plasma concentrations higher than the previously defined breakpoint (2.42 mg/L). Colistin therapeutic drug monitoring should be routinely considered to avoid reaching this toxicity threshold and potential clinical consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abivariate analysis 3acolistin 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahospitals 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3anephrotoxicity 3aobservational studies 3apatients 0aColistin 0aNephrotoxicity 0aRisk factors 0aPlasma concentration 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring1 aSorlí, Luisa1 aLuque, Sonia1 aBenito, Natividad1 aSegura, Concepción1 aCampillo, Nuria1 aMontero, Milagro1 aEsteve, Erika1 aMirelis, Beatriz1 aPomar, Virginia1 aCuquet, Jordi1 aMartí, Carmina1 aGarro, Pau1 aGrau, Santiago0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2016 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.725-727dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016500161300001800326520126000344592002801604650002201632650001401654650001101668650001601679650001201695650004401707650001401751650001501765650001501780650001101795650002001806650001201826650002601838650001201864700002101876700001801897700001701915773013101932856007502063852000902138655001202147IND60540956620221118041425.0160820e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054095662DNAL7 a10.1021/ja413192m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Ashleigh
L.10aPhotochemical Route to Actinide-Transition Metal Bonds: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of a Series of Thorium and Uranium Heterobimetallic Complexes  ap. 3647-3654.  aA series of actinide–transition metal heterobimetallics has been prepared, featuring thorium, uranium, and cobalt. Complexes incorporating the binucleating ligand N[ο-(NHCH₂PⁱPr₂)C₆H₄]₃ with either Th(IV) (4) or U(IV) (5) and a carbonyl bridged [Co(CO)₄]⁻ unit were synthesized from the corresponding actinide chlorides (Th: 2; U: 3) and Na[Co(CO)₄]. Irradiation of the resulting isocarbonyls with ultraviolet light resulted in the formation of new species containing actinide–metal bonds in good yields (Th: 6; U: 7); this photolysis method provides a new approach to a relatively unusual class of complexes. Characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that elimination of the bridging carbonyl and formation of the metal–metal bond is accompanied by coordination of a phosphine arm from the N₄P₃ ligand to the cobalt center. Additionally, actinide–cobalt bonds of 3.0771(5) Å and 3.0319(7) Å for the thorium and uranium complexes, respectively, were observed. The solution-state behavior of the thorium complexes was evaluated using ¹H, ¹H–¹H COSY, ³¹P, and variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy. IR, UV–vis/NIR, and variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements are also reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achlorides 3acobalt 3airradiation 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphine 3aphosphorus 3aphotolysis 3asodium 3astable isotopes 3athorium 3aultraviolet radiation 3auranium1 aLukens, Wayne W.1 aLu, Connie C.1 aArnold, John0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Mar. 05, v. 136, no. 9 p.3647-3654dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja413192m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009100171500001900262520202800281592002802309650000802337650002802345650002502373650001602398650001302414650001002427650001402437650002202451650001502473650003302488650001102521650001602532650001602548650000902564651001002573653002002583653002502603653004102628653003202669700005202701700001802753700002102771700001402792700001802806700001502824700001502839773012002854856008802974852000903062655001203071IND60696921820221116202047.0201216e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069692182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yueming14aThe impact of synoptic patterns on summertime ozone pollution in the North China Plain  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface ozone pollution is a challenging environmental issue in most parts of China. In particular, the North China Plain (NCP) region suffers from the severest ozone pollution throughout the country. In addition to the emission of precursors, ozone concentration is closely related to meteorological conditions resulting from regional atmospheric circulation. In this study, we investigate the relationship between synoptic patterns and summertime ozone pollution in the NCP using the objective principal component analysis in T-mode (T-PCA) classification method. Four dominant synoptic patterns are identified during the summers of 2014–2018. The heaviest ozone pollution is found to be associated with a high pressure anomaly over the Northwest Pacific and a distinct low pressure center in Northeast China. The southwesterly wind surrounding the low pressure center brings dry, warm air from inland South China, resulting in a high temperature, low humidity environment in the NCP, which favors the chemical formation of surface ozone. Locally, this type is associated with a moderate planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) of ~860 m and a stronger warm anomaly within the boundary layer than the upper level. We also notice a non-linear relationship between surface ozone concentration and the PBLH, i.e., ozone concentration first increases with PBLH till ~0.9 km, and then remains stable. This initial increase may relate to enhanced mixing with upper levels where ozone concentration is typically higher than that near the surface. However, when PBLH further increases, this downward mixing effect is balanced with the stronger upward turbulent mixing so that surface ozone shows little change. The synoptic patterns identified here, however, is unlikely responsible for the observed increasing trend in ozone concentration over the NCP region. Our study sheds light on the meteorological contribution to surface ozone pollution in North China and provides a reference for the pollution control and prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric circulation 3achemical composition 3aenvironment 3ahumidity 3aozone 3apollution 3apollution control 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asummer 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3awind 3aChina 0aOzone pollution 0aSynoptic circulation 0aEffects of meteorological conditions 0aT-PCA classification method1 aLi, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0540-04121 aGuo, Jianping1 aJiang, Zhongjing1 aChu, Yiqi1 aZhang, Liang,1 aYang, Yang1 aLiao, Hong0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 735 p.139559-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008700170300001800257520104200275592002801317650001701345650001001362650001201372650002001384650001101404650001001415650001301425650002101438650001301459650002201472700002001494700002401514773012601538856008401664852000901748655001201757IND60099655820221118054813.0141105e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009965582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowland, Andrew14aThe UDP-glucuronosyltransferases: Their role in drug metabolism and detoxification  ap. 1121-1132.  aHuman UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) exists as a superfamily of 22 proteins, which are divided into 5 families and 6 subfamilies on the basis of sequence identity. Members of the UGT1A and 2B subfamilies play a key role in terminating the biological actions and enhancing the renal elimination of non-polar (lipophilic) drugs from all therapeutic classes. These enzymes primarily catalyse the covalent linkage of glucuronic acid, derived from the cofactor UDP-glucuronic acid, to a substrate with a suitable acceptor functional group. This process is referred to as glucuronidation. While the liver is the major detoxification organ, and as such contains the greatest abundance and diversity of UGTs, these enzymes also exhibit significant, but variable extra-hepatic expression. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of the functional roles of UGT, their regulation and tissue expression, and clinical significant factors (ontogeny, interactions and polymorphisms) that affect glucuronidation activity in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aglucuronic acid 3ahumans 3aliver 3aontogeny 3apharmacokinetics 3aproteins 3asequence analysis1 aMiners, John O.1 aMackenzie, Peter I.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2013 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1121-1132dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300002000269520149700289592002801786650004401814650001301858650001101871650001301882650001401895650002801909650002101937650001701958650001301975650001901988650001602007650001302023650001902036650001802055650002002073650001002093650002202103650002102125700002202146773012402168856007402292852000902366655001202375IND60664868120221118015555.0190912e20140325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066486812DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra48068b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Obaid ur10aPhysico-mechanical and electrochemical corrosion behavior of soy alkyd/Fe₃O₄ nanocomposite coatings  ap. 14936-14947.  aThe present article reports the synthesis of butylated melamine formaldehyde (BMF) cured soy alkyd (SA-BMF) and nanoferrite (Fe₃O₄) dispersed SA-BMF (SA-BMF–Fe₃O₄) nanocomposite anticorrosive coatings. The structural elucidation of SA-BMF and SA-BMF–Fe₃O₄ was performed by Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Physico-mechanical properties such as impact resistance, bend test, scratch hardness, cross hatch adhesion test of these coatings were analyzed by standard protocols. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the coating material. The corrosion resistance performance of SA-BMF and SA-BMF–Fe₃O₄ coated CS was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. The salt spray test for coated and uncoated carbon steel (CS) strips in 5 wt% NaCl solution was also performed. Study revealed that the presence of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles played a prominent role in the performance of SA-BMF matrix as reflected by high thermal stability, good hydrophobicity, enhanced physico-mechanical properties and higher corrosion resistance performance. Among different compositions, SA-BMF–Fe₃O₄-2.5 coatings exhibited far superior physico-mechanical and corrosion inhibition properties than SA-BMF coatings and other similar reported systems. The possible mechanisms of corrosion inhibition by nanocomposite coatings are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aformaldehyde 3ahardness 3ahydrophobicity 3airon oxides 3amelamine 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3asodium chloride 3asteel 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aSharīf, Aḥmad,0 tRSC advances.g2014 Mar. 25, v. 4, no. 29 p.14936-14947dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra48068b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009000171520223900261592002802500650001502528650002002543650001902563650001202582650001902594650001102613650000902624650002002633650001402653653001302667653003402680653001402714653001302728653001002741700002002751700001502771700001202786700005602798700001502854773011902869856008802988852000903076655001203085IND60696921920221116201929.0220719e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069692192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fuquan10aIntegrating multiple factors to optimize watchtower deployment for wildfire detection  aTraditional human-vision-based watchtower systems are being gradually replaced by the machine-vision-based watchtower system. The visual range of machine-vision-based watchtower is smaller than the range of traditional human-vision-based watchtower, which has led to a sharp increase in the number of towers that should be deployed. Consequently, the overlapping area between watchtowers is larger and overlaps are more frequent than in conventional watchtower networks. This poses an urgent challenge: identifying the optimal locations for deployment. If the number of required watchtowers must be increased to extend the detection coverage, overlaps among watchtowers are inevitable and result in viewshed redundancy. However, this redundancy of the viewshed resources of the watchtowers has not been utilized in the design of fire detection systems. Moreover, fire ignition factors, such as climatic factors, fuels, and human behaviour, cause the fire occurrence risk to differ among forest areas. Thus, the fire risk map of the area should also be considered in watchtower deployment. A fire risk model is used as the first step in producing the fire risk map, which is used to propose a new watchtower deployment model for optimizing the watchtower system by integrating viewshed analysis, location allocation, and multi-coverage of the high-fire-risk area while considering the budget constraints for providing optimal coverage. We use a real dataset of a forest park to evaluate the applicability of our approach. The proposed approach is evaluated against the FV-NB (Full coVerage with No Budget constraint) algorithm and the XV-B (maXimum possible coVerage with a Budget constraint) algorithm in terms of performance. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach realizes higher coverage gain and excellent multiple-coverage of the fire risk area by integrating the viewshed and the fire risk level into location allocation while satisfying requirements on the overall coverage and budget. The proposed approach is more suitable in the environments with moderate watchtower density, in which overlapping areas are frequent. It offers as much as 8.9–17.3% improvement of multiple-coverage of the high-fire-risk area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3afire detection 3aforests 3ahuman behavior 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3awildfires 0aWildfire 0aGeographic information system 0aFire risk 0aCoverage 0aModel1 aZhao, Pengcheng1 aXu, Shuwen1 aWu, Yin1 aYang, Xubing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5504-83921 aZhang, Yan0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 737 p.139561-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1395613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013500152300002000287520062200307592002800929650001500957650001400972650001300986700001700999700001901016700001801035700001601053700001701069773012401086856007401210852000901284655001201293IND60664868220221118015717.0190912e20140424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066486822DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra48069k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Yun10aPerfect spin-filter, spin-valve, switching and negative differential resistance in an organic molecular device with graphene leads  ap. 18522-18528.  aBy performing first-principle quantum transport calculations, we proposed a multiple-effect organic molecular device for spintronics.

One of these materials is lime-hemp concrete, a self-bearing bio-based insulation material with low thermal conductivity and good CO2 uptake but with weak mechanical properties. In this study alternative magnesium binders are proposed to substitute the traditionally used lime binder in hemp concrete, comparing the environmental impact of these binder composites. To make the comparison, experimental mixtures with both traditionally used and alternative binder composites were produced and their mechanical and thermal properties tested. The magnesium binders showed promising results as these composites were approximately two times stronger, having similar density and thermal conductivity. Afterwards the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of all tested composites. Lime based binder composites achieved negative CO2 emissions, varying from −46.5 to −68.6 kg CO2/m³. Alternative binder, magnesium phosphate cement, demonstrated significantly greater environmental impact than all other binders due to its hardener, potassium phosphate, which is highly energy and resource intensive. Magnesium oxychloride cement showed promising results with bio-based filler, as their combined environmental impact was lower in most categories compared to lime-hemp concrete, and negative CO2 emissions of −37.38 kg CO2/m³ were achieved. These negative CO2 emissions were achieved with biogenic CO2 uptake from hemp growth and low binder content, thus achieving low thermal conductivity of 0.062 W/m²*K at 214 kg/m³ density.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3aconcrete 3aconstruction industry 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahemp 3ainsulating materials 3alife cycle assessment 3amagnesium 3amechanical properties 3apotassium phosphates 3athermal conductivity 0aHemp-lime concrete 0aHempcrete 0aMagnesium binders 0aLife Cycle Assessment 0aGlobal Warming Potential 0aHemp 0aLime1 aVan den Heede, Philip1 aBelie, Nele de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0851-62421 aBajare, Diana1 aSahmenko, Genadijs1 aKorjakins, Aleksandrs1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7207-73790 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2018 June, v. 133 p.288-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003100155245011500186300001400301520166500315592002801980650002802008650000802036650002402044650002502068650001202093650001402105650001302119650001702132650001702149650001802166650003702184650001402221650002902235650001402264650001402278650002402292653002102316653002602337653002102363700002902384700003102413700002802444700002502472700003002497700003202527700002902559700005902588700003102647773013102678856009002809852000902899655001202908IND60557241320221121232949.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055724132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Muñiz, Martha Yumiko10aRepurposing the anticancer drug mitomycin C for the treatment of persistent Acinetobacter baumannii infections  ap. 88-92.  aAcinetobacter baumannii is an emergent opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for recalcitrant infections owing to its high intrinsic tolerance to most antibiotics; therefore, suitable strategies to treat these infections are needed. One plausible approach is the repurposing of drugs that are already in use. Among them, anticancer drugs may be especially useful due their cytotoxic activities and ample similarities between bacterial infections and growing tumours. In this work, the effectiveness of four anticancer drugs on the growth of A. baumannii ATTC BAA-747 was evaluated, including the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil and three DNA crosslinkers, namely cisplatin, mitomycin C (MMC) and merphalan. MMC was the most effective drug, having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of growth in Luria–Bertani medium at ca. 7 µg/mL and completely inhibiting growth at 25 µg/mL. Hence, MMC was tested against a panel of 21 clinical isolates, including 18 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates, 3 of which were sensitive only to colistin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of MMC in all tested strains were found to be similar to those of A. baumannii ATCC BAA-747, and MMC also effectively killed stationary-phase, persister and biofilm cells. Moreover, MMC was able to increase survival of the insect larvae Galleria mellonella against an otherwise lethal A. baumannii infection from 0% to ≥53% for the antibiotic-sensitive A. baumannii ATCC BAA-747 strain and the MDR strains A560 and A578. Therefore, MMC is highly effective at killing the emergent opportunistic pathogen A. baumannii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aDNA 3aGalleria mellonella 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3acisplatin 3acolistin 3acytotoxicity 3afluorouracil 3ainsect larvae 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amitomycin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasms 3apathogens 3asecondary infection 0aDrug repurposing 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aAnticancer drugs1 aLópez-Jacome, Luis Esau1 aHernández-Durán, Melissa1 aFranco-Cendejas, Rafael1 aLicona-Limón, Paula1 aRamos-Balderas, Jose Luis1 aMartinéz-Vázquez, Mariano1 aBelmont-Díaz, Javier A.1 aWood, Thomas K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6258-529X1 aGarcía-Contreras, Rodolfo0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2017 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.88-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011700173300001600290500001500306520173300321592002802054650002602082650001502108650001602123650002602139650001702165650001402182650001402196650001502210650001602225650001302241650001002254650001402264653001402278653003802292653001402330653001702344653001602361653001602377653001502393700001902408700002802427700002302455773013302478856009002611852000902701655001202710IND60557241420221122011527.0180830e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055724142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Zhanni10aMultifaceted antibiotic treatment analysis of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections  ap. 674-679.  a2019-12-06  aGiven the overall prevalence and poor prognosis of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (BSIs), the study of treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes is important. The aim of this study was to conduct a multifaceted antibiotic treatment analysis of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) BSI and to characterise optimal early antibiotic therapy (within the first 7 days of drawing the index blood culture) for this serious infection. Antibiotic selection was categorised as optimal targeted (intravenous cloxacillin or cefazolin), optimal broad (piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem), adequate (vancomycin) or inadequate (other antibiotics or oral therapy). A TSE (timing, selection, exposure) score was developed to comprehensively characterise early antibiotic therapy, where higher points corresponded to prompt initiation, optimal antibiotic selection and longer exposure (duration). Amongst 71 cases of complicated MSSA-BSI, end-of-treatment (EOT) response (i.e. clinical cure) was improved when at least adequate antibiotic therapy was initiated within 24 h [71.7% (33/46) vs. 48.0% (12/25); P = 0.047]. Clinical cure was also more likely when therapy included ≥4 days of optimal targeted antibiotics within the first 7 days [74.4% (29/39) vs. 50.0% (16/32); P = 0.03]. The TSE score was an informative index of early antibiotic therapy, with EOT cure documented in 72.0% (36/50) compared with 42.9% (9/21) of cases with scores above and below 15.2, respectively (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, lower Charlson comorbidity index, presence of BSI on admission, and optimising early antibiotic therapy, as described above, were associated with clinical cure in patients with MSSA-BSI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3avancomycin 3acloxacillin 3aintravenous injection 3apiperacillin 3aprognosis 3ameropenem 3ablood flow 3acomorbidity 3apatients 3ablood 3acefazolin 0aNafcillin 0aStaphylococcus aureus bacteraemia 0aCefazolin 0atherapeutics 0aCeftriaxone 0aCloxacillin 0aVancomycin1 aAriano, Robert1 aLagacé-Wiens, Philippe1 aZelenitsky, Sheryl0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2016 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.674-679dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011200172300001800284520111000302592002801412650001201440650001201452650001701464650002001481650001001501650000901511650001301520650002001533650001601553650001901569700002201588700006101610773011901671856008701790852000901877655001201886IND60653894920221120070142.0190722e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065389492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhani, Roozbeh10aAnalysis of the Combined Ammonia Production and Cyclohexane Dehydrogenation by a Novel Bifunctional Reactor  ap. 6717-6726.  aIn the current work, a novel process including a multitubular thermally coupled reactor for the simultaneous production of benzene and ammonia is proposed. The ammonia synthesis reaction inside the internal tubes provides the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction’s heat demand in the external tube. Moreover, this novel configuration eliminates the required interstage cooler in the conventional ammonia synthesis plant, leading to a remarkable reduction in operational costs. Furthermore, the cyclohexane dehydrogenation process has been employed to supply all of the ammonia synthesis hydrogen demand; therefore, the production, transportation, and storage cost of hydrogen have been greatly reduced. Besides, the danger of hydrogen gas transportation has been avoided. As another advantage of the proposed configuration, cyclohexane conversion in the thermally coupled reactor has been increased from 0.842 to 0.887 compared to a conventional cyclohexane dehydrogenation reactor. Finally, the performance of the proposed reactor has been studied under various inlet temperatures and molar flow rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abenzene 3acyclohexanes 3adehydrogenation 3afuels 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aoperating costs 3atemperature 3atransportation1 aBoostani, Fatemeh1 aIranshahi, Davood1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6360-28640 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 June 10, v. 33, no. 7 p.6717-6726dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b010883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245011600189300001800305520142100323592002801744650002701772650001301799650002001812650001801832650001601850650001401866650001001880650001901890650001601909650001001925650000901935650001101944650001401955650003201969650002202001650001102023650001802034650003602052650001202088650002602100650002902126650003702155650004102192650001702233650005002250650003302300650003102333650002702364650006602391650000902457650002402466650004202490650002902532650003802561650004402599650005002643700002302693700004402716700002702760700002402787773008502811856008102896852000902977655001202986IND4470961720221120214422.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447096172DNAL7 a214820692pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz-Chamorro, Lidia10aAcquired resistance to Listeria monocytogenes during a secondary infection in a murine model fed dietary lipids  ap. 1053-1060.  aOBJECTIVE: The ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can suppress immune system functions. This property may cause adverse effects by impairing host resistance to infection. The present study focused on estimating the impact of different dietary lipids on the immune system of mice after a secondary infection with Listeria monocytogenes. METHODS: BALB/c mice were divided into five dietary groups of olive oil, fish oil, sunflower oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, or low fat that was administered for 8 wk. The mice were immunized with 10³ colony-forming units. Thirty-eight days later, each mouse was challenged with 10⁴ colony-forming units. Mice survival and bacterial clearance from livers and spleens were determined. In addition, cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule productions were quantified from the sera. RESULTS: Survival percentage in mice fed a fish oil diet was 100% and bacterial numbers from spleen were decreased at 72 h. Interleukin-12, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 productions were decreased. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were increased, whereas macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) production was unaltered. CONCLUSION: Immune defense in mice fed a fish oil diet was improved after secondary exposure, acquiring an adequate resistance. This result could be attributable to an increase of a T-helper type 1 response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadhesion 3aadverse effects 3acell adhesion 3adietary fat 3afish oils 3ahosts 3ainterleukin-12 3alisteriosis 3aliver 3amice 3amodels 3aolive oil 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asecondary contact 3aspleen 3asunflower oil 2aAdaptive Immunityxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsximmunology 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3ximmunology 2aFish Oilsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aImmunization 2aIntercellular Adhesion Molecule-1xmetabolism 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-12xmetabolism 2aListeria monocytogenes 2aListeriosisximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxmortality. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aOleic Acidximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aPlant Oilsxpharmacology 2aSpleenximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aVascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1xmetabolism1 aPuertollano, Elena1 aÁlvarez de Cienfuegos López, Gerardo,1 aPuertollano, María A.1 ade Pablo, Manuel A.0 tNutrition.g2011 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1053-1060dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012700154300001800281520027000299592002800569650001800597650002300615650002700638650002300665650001300688650002100701650002800722650002000750650001400770700001900784700001800803773013300821856007500954852000901029655001201038IND60658952720221118162455.0190826e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065895272DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11162k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuweizhe,10aElectrocatalytic detection of dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid and uric acid at silicon carbide coated electrodes  ap. 6458-6460.  aThis communication demonstrates that the SiC coated glassy carbon electrode resolved the overlapping voltammetric responses of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA), which could be used for selective determination of DA in the presence of AA and UA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3asilicon carbide 3auric acid1 aChang, Han-Wei1 aTsai, Yu-Chen0 tChemical communications.g2011 May 24, v. 47, no. 22 p.6458-6460dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc11162k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245012400159300002000283520081000303592002801113650002301141650001201164650002201176650001001198650001601208650002101224650001701245650000701262653001601269653001701285653003201302653001601334653001101350653002701361700001501388700001401403700001301417700005501430700005801485700001701543700001301560700001701573700001501590700001801605700005401623773014201677856007801819852000901897655001201906IND60596274120221118185356.0180617e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059627412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b054842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Long10aCovalent Organic Framework Functionalized with 8-Hydroxyquinoline as a Dual-Mode Fluorescent and Colorimetric pH Sensor  ap. 15364-15368.  aReal-time and accurate detection of pH in aqueous solution is of great significance in chemical, environmental, and engineering-related fields. We report here the use of 8-hydroxyquinoline-functionalized covalent organic framework (COF-HQ) for dual-mode pH sensing. In the fluorescent mode, the emission intensity of COF-HQ weakened as the pH decreased, and also displayed a good linear relationship against pH in the range from 1 to 5. In addition, COF-HQ showed discernible color changes from yellow to black as the acidity increased and can be therefore used as a colorimetric pH sensor. All these changes are reversible and COF-HQ can be recycled for multiple detection runs owing to its high hydrolytical stability. It can be further assembled into a mixed matrix membrane for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aacidity 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3apH 0achemosensor 0acolorimetric 0acovalent organic frameworks 0afluorescent 0alow pH 0amixed matrix membranes1 aHe, Linwei1 aMa, Fuyin1 aLiu, Wei1 aWang, Yaxing1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1842-339X1 aSilver, Mark A.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2285-36161 aChen, Lanhua1 aZhu, Lin1 aGui, Daxiang1 aDiwu, Juan1 aChai, Zhifang1 aWang, Shuao1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1526-11020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 25, v. 10, no. 18 p.15364-15368dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b054843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002100134245008600155300001600241520130500257592002801562650001301590650001501603650002901618650002701647650001301674650001001687650001201697650001001709650001401719650001001733650003301743650001201776650002501788650001801813650001001831650001401841651001701855651001101872651001301883653002301896653001301919653001401932653001501946653001501961653001801976653002101994700002202015700001802037700002602055773010102081852000902182856007102191655001202262IND4458757220221120204016.0200516e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445875722DNAL7 a10.3852/10-0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehl, James W.M.10aBotryosphaeriaceae associated with Pterocarpus angolensis (kiaat) in South Africa  ap. 534-553.  aThere have been several recent reports of Pterocarpus angolensis (kiaat) trees dying in South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, where this tree is used in traditional medicine and is a valuable source of timber for woodcarving and furniture. A survey of material from diseased P. angolensis trees in South Africa yielded isolates of the Botryosphaeriaceae, an important fungal family known to cause a number of tree diseases. The aim of this study was to identify these Botryosphaeriaceae and to determine their pathogenicity to P. angolensis with branch inoculations. Seven species of the Botryosphaeriaceae were identified based on a combination of morphological characteristics and sequences from the ITS and EF-1α gene regions. Four of these represent undescribed taxa for which the names Pseudofusicoccum violaceum, P. olivaceum, Diplodia alatafructa and Fusicoccum atrovirens are provided. The remaining three species collected include Lasiodiplodia theobromae, L. pseudotheobromae and L. crassispora. Inoculation trials on tree branches showed that L. pseudotheobromae and one isolate of D. alatafructa differed significantly from control inoculations. The high levels of virulence and common occurrence of L. pseudotheobromae suggest that this species could play a role in tree dieback and death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodia 3aFusicoccum 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aPterocarpus angolensis 3abranches 3adeath 3adieback 3afungi 3afurniture 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3asurveys 3atraditional medicine 3atree diseases 3atrees 3avirulence 3aSouth Africa 3aZambia 3aZimbabwe 0abranch inoculation 0aDiplodia 0aendophyte 0aendophytic 0aFusicoccum 0aLasiodiplodia 0aPseudofusicoccum1 aSlippers, Bernard1 aRoux, Jolanda1 aWingfield, Michael J.0 tMycologia.g2011 May 1, v. 103, no. 3 p.534-553dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/10-0033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03045naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245013400211300001800345506007600363520166500439592002802104506003702132650001002169650001202179650001802191650001802209650001602227650001902243650001102262650001902273650001602292650001302308650001102321700002102332700002302353700001602376773012602392856008402518852000902602655001202611IND60099656320221207142701.0141105e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009965632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.0152doi7 aPMC36336892pmcid7 a234664922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Hanshuang14aThe carboxyl tail of alpha-actinin-4 regulates its susceptibility to m-calpain and thus functions in cell migration and spreading  ap. 1051-1063.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlpha-actinin-4 links the cytoskeleton to sites of adhesion and has been shown to be modulated to enable cell migration. Such focal adhesions must be labile to accomplish migration, with this detachment occurring at least in part via m-calpain activation (Glading et al., 2001, 2002; Xie et al., 1998). In this study, we report that alpha-actinin-4 is initially cleaved by m-calpain between tyrosine 13 and glycine. Removal of the first 13 amino acids does not affect alpha-actinin-4 binding to actin filaments and its localization within fibroblasts but drives cell migration with less persistence. Binding of phosphoinositides PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 to alpha-actinin-4, as well as binding of alpha-actinin-4 to actin filaments all inhibit m-calpain cleavage of ACTN4 between tyrosine 13 and glycine 14. Interestingly, the carboxyl terminus of alpha-actinin-4 including its calcium binding motifs, is inhibitory for a secondary cleavage of alpha-actinin-4 between lysine 283 and valine 284. The minimal length of inhibitory domain is mapped to the last 11 amino acids of alpha-actinin-4. The C-terminal tail of alpha-actinin-4 is essential for maintaining its normal actin binding activity and localization within cytoplasm and also its colocalization with actin in the lamellipodia of locomoting fibroblasts. Live cell imaging reveals that the 1–890 fragment fails to rescue neither the basal or growth factor-stimulated migration nor the revert the spread area of fibroblasts to the level of NR6WT. These findings suggest that the C-terminal tail of alpha-actinin-4 is essential for its function in cell migration and adhesion to substratum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3afibroblasts 3aimage analysis 3alysine 3amicrofilaments 3apseudopodia 3atyrosine 3avaline1 aTravers, Timothy1 aCamacho, Carlos J.1 aWells, Alan0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2013 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1051-1063dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245012100151300001800272520150900290592002801799650001501827650001501842650001301857650001401870650001401884650002301898650002201921650000901943650001301952650001801965650001301983650001801996650002102014700001802035700001802053773013102071856007502202852000902277655001202286IND60540957020221118041548.0160820e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054095702DNAL7 a10.1021/ja500121v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gao10aThermally Robust Au99(SPh)42 Nanoclusters for Chemoselective Hydrogenation of Nitrobenzaldehyde Derivatives in Water  ap. 3673-3679.  aWe report the synthesis and catalytic application of thermally robust gold nanoclusters formulated as Au₉₉(SPh)₄₂. The formula was determined by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry in conjunction with thermogravimetric analysis. The optical spectrum of Au₉₉(SPh)₄₂ nanoclusters shows absorption peaks at ∼920 nm (1.35 eV), 730 nm (1.70 eV), 600 nm (2.07 eV), 490 nm (2.53 eV), and 400 nm (3.1 eV) in contrast to conventional gold nanoparticles, which exhibit a plasmon resonance band at 520 nm (for spherical particles). The ceria-supported Au₉₉(SPh)₄₂ nanoclusters were utilized as a catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrobenzaldehyde to nitrobenzyl alcohol in water using H₂ gas as the hydrogen source. The selective hydrogenation of the aldehyde group catalyzed by nanoclusters is a surprise because conventional nanogold catalysts instead give rise to the product resulting from reduction of the nitro group. The Au₉₉(SPh)₄₂/CeO₂ catalyst gives high catalytic activity for a range of nitrobenzaldehyde derivatives and also shows excellent recyclability due to its thermal robustness. We further tested the size-dependent catalytic performance of Au₂₅(SPh)₁₈ and Au₃₆(SPh)₂₄ nanoclusters, and on the basis of their crystal structures we propose a molecular adsorption site for nitrobenzaldehyde. The nanocluster material is expected to find wide application in catalytic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3athermogravimetry1 aZeng, Chenjie1 aJin, Rongchao0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Mar. 05, v. 136, no. 9 p.3673-3679dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja500121v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008300163300001200246520181400258592002802072650002102100650001202121650002002133650001502153650001302168650001002181700001402191700001702205773009402222856008402316852000902400655001202409IND50070818620221119162319.0190318e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007081862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardi, V.14aThe use of guided self-help delivered on mobile technology in anorexia nervosa  ap. 471.  aOutpatients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) frequently report motivation to initiate change but difficulties in sustaining change in their home environments. As systematic reviews suggest that self-help programs may play an important role in the treatment of eating disorders, strategies to support change and overcome behavioural rigidity in an ecologically-valid manner would likely promote treatment success. The present study examined the acceptability and benefit of a guided self-help intervention delivered via mobile technology in AN. Women with AN (N=18) completed a 3-week guided self-help intervention along with baseline and post-intervention self-report and behavioural assessments. The intervention included the use of video clips (“vodcasts”) that reviewed a variety of ED-relevant themes, a manual and provided limited guidance. Participants completed standardized measures to assess eating psychopathology, depression and anxiety symptoms, cognitive flexibility, and readiness to change before and after the intervention. Results indicate that participants found the video clips acceptable and useful in increasing awareness. The vodcasts that described recovery stories and discussed the implications of detailed versus big picture thinking were both highly rated and used most frequently. Adherence was good (18/23 participants completed) and small increases in BMI (ES= .25), significant improvements in eating disorder symptoms (ES range=.4/.5), mood symptoms (ES range= 4/.7), and cognitive flexibility (ES=.4) were detected post-intervention. Given the advantages of a mobile guided self-help intervention in terms of access/availability, as well as the acceptability and symptomatic changes reported, present findings suggest that it may be a useful candidate for further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia nervosa 3aanxiety 3abody mass index 3amotivation 3apatients 3awomen1 aCunha, A.1 aTreasure, J.0 tAppetite.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 71 p.471-471dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011300159300001800272520117400290592002801464650002401492650001401516650002101530650004901551650002201600650001401622650000701636650002201643700001701665700001701682700002501699700002101724700001901745700001601764700002301780773013101803856007501934852000902009655001202018IND60540957120221118041601.0160820e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054095712DNAL7 a10.1021/ja50016422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Scott
D.10aNon-Heme Manganese Catalysts for On-Demand Production of Chlorine Dioxide in Water and Under Mild Conditions  ap. 3680-3686.  aTwo non-heme manganese complexes are used in the catalytic formation of chlorine dioxide from chlorite under ambient temperature at pH 5.00. The catalysts afford up to 1000 turnovers per hour and remain highly active in subsequent additions of chlorite. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies revealed a Mnᴵᴵᴵ(OH) species as the dominant form under catalytic conditions. A Mnᴵᴵᴵ(μ-O)Mnᴵⱽ dinuclear species was observed by EPR spectroscopy, supporting the involvement of a putative Mnᴵⱽ(O) species. First-order kinetic dependence on the manganese catalyst precludes the dinuclear species as the active form of the catalyst. Quantitative kinetic modeling enabled the deduction of a mechanism that accounts for all experimental observations. The chlorine dioxide producing cycle involves formation of a putative Mnᴵⱽ(O), which undergoes PCET (proton coupled electron-transfer) reaction with chlorite to afford chlorine dioxide. The ClO₂ product can be efficiently removed from the aqueous reaction mixture via purging with an inert gas, allowing for the preparation of pure chlorine dioxide for on-site use and further production of chlorine dioxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3achlorine dioxide 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3amanganese 3apH 3aspectral analysis1 aKim, DoYeon,1 aXiong, Silei1 aMedvedev, Grigori A.1 aCaruthers, James1 aHong, Seungwoo1 aNam, Wonwoo1 aAbu-Omar, Mahdi M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Mar. 05, v. 136, no. 9 p.3680-3686dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50016423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245018400184300001600368520136200384592002801746650003101774650001801805650002901823650002601852650001401878650001201892650001001904650001601914650000901930650003701939650001501976653000901991653002102000653002102021653002702042653002302069700002502092700001802117700002702135700002302162773013302185856009002318852000902408655001202417IND60557241920221122030312.0180830e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055724192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomínguez-Herrera, Juan10aEfficacy of ceftaroline versus vancomycin in an experimental foreign-body and systemic infection model caused by biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis  ap. 661-665.  aIn this study, the efficacy of ceftaroline versus vancomycin against biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in a murine model of foreign-body and systemic infection was compared. Two bacteraemic biofilm-producing MRSE strains were used (SE284 and SE385). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for strains SE284 and SE385, were, respectively, 0.25 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L for ceftaroline and 4 mg/L and 2 mg/L for vancomycin. The in vitro bactericidal activities of ceftaroline and vancomycin were evaluated using time–kill curves. A foreign-body and systemic infection model in neutropenic female C57BL/6 mice was used to ascertain in vivo efficacy. Animals were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 15) without treatment (controls) or treated with ceftaroline 50 mg/kg every 8 h or vancomycin 110 mg/kg every 6 h. In vitro, ceftaroline showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, whilst vancomycin presented time-dependent activity. In the experimental in vivo model, ceftaroline and vancomycin decreased the liver and catheter bacterial concentrations (P < 0.05) and increased survival (P < 0.05) for both strains. In conclusion, ceftaroline is as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of experimental foreign-body and systemic infection caused by biofilm-producing MRSE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aanimal models 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3acatheters 3afemales 3aliver 3amethicillin 3amice 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3avancomycin 0aMRSE 0aPharmacokinetics 0aPharmacodynamics 0aForeign-body infection 0aSystemic infection1 aLópez-Rojas, Rafael1 aSmani, Younes1 aLabrador-Herrera, Gema1 aPachón, Jerónimo0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2016 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.661-665dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001800299520229700317592002802614650002502642650001202667650001702679650001302696650001002709650002302719650002502742650001002767650001502777650001102792650003102803650001802834650001402852650001902866650001502885650002402900650000902924650001202933650001002945650001402955651001102969653002502980653001703005653001403022653001703036700002103053700002003074700002303094700001903117700006503136700001903201773011803220856008503338852000903423655001203432IND60613835520221117033626.0190416e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061383552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMechai, Samir10aEvidence for an effect of landscape connectivity on Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto dispersion in a zone of range expansion  ap. 1407-1415.  aIn North America, different strains of the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto cluster into phylogenetic groups that are associated with different levels of pathogenicity and, for some, specific rodent reservoir hosts. Here we explore whether landscape connectivity, by impacting host dispersal, influences B. burgdorferi s.s. spread patterns. This question is central to modelling spatial patterns of the spread of Lyme disease risk in the zone of northward range-expansion of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Canada where the study was conducted. We used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to characterise B. burgdorferi s.s. in positive ticks collected at 13 sites in southern Quebec, Canada during the early stages of B. burgdorferi s.s. invasion. We used mixed effects logistic regression to investigate whether landscape connectivity (probability of connectivity; PC) affected the probability that samples collected at different sites were of the same strain (MLST sequence type: ST). PC was calculated from a habitat map based on high spatial resolution (15 m) Landsat 8 imagery to identify woodland habitat that are preferred by rodent hosts of B. burgdorferi s.s. There was a significant positive association between the likelihood that two samples were of the same ST and PC, when PC values were grouped into three categories of low, medium and high. When analysing data for individual STs, samples at different sites were significantly more likely to be the same when PC was higher for the rodent-associated ST1. These findings support the hypothesis that dispersion trajectories of B. burgdorferi s.s. in general, and some rodent-associated strains in particular, are at least partly determined by landscape connectivity. This may suggest that dispersion of B. burgdorferi s.s. is more common by terrestrial mammal hosts (which would likely disperse according to landscape connectivity) than by birds, the dispersal of which is likely less constrained by landscape. This study suggests that accounting for landscape connectivity may improve model-based predictions of spatial spread patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. The findings are consistent with possible past dispersal patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. as determined by phylogeographic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLandsat 3aLyme disease 3abacteria 3abirds 3adisease reservoirs 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahosts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arodents 3aticks 3awoodlands 3aQuebec 0aBorrelia burgdorferi 0aConnectivity 0aLandscape 0aLyme disease1 aMargos, Gabriele1 aFeil, Edward J.1 aLindsay, L.

However, such information is limited to a few compounds (e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonate), primarily based on rodent experiments, and the underlying toxicological mechanism(s) for many PFAS in the environment remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated 8:8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid (8:8 PFPiA), an under-studied PFAS with high persistency in the environment and biota, using the zebrafish model. We exposed zebrafish embryos (<4 hpf) to various concentrations of 8:8 PFPiA (0, 0.0116, 0.112, 0.343, 1.34, 5.79 μM) for 144 h. Although there was no significant change in survival, hatchability and malformations, zebrafish locomotor speed at 120 h significantly decreased in dark photoperiod. At 144 h, several genes related to thyroid hormones that are essential for neurodevelopment, including corticotropin releasing hormone b (crhb), iodothyronine deiodinase 3a (dio3a), thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (tshr) and nkx2 homeobox1 (nkx 2.1), were up-regulated by 8:8 PFPiA at 5.79 μM. 8:8 PFPiA also significantly down-regulated a neurodevelopmental gene, elav like neuron-specific RNA binding protein (elavl3), at 1.34 and 5.79 μM; in addition, one oxidative stress gene was slightly but significantly up-regulated. Further, global DNA methylation was significantly decreased at higher treatment levels, identifying effects of 8:8 PFPiA on epigenetic regulation. However, promoter DNA methylation of selected genes (dio3, tshr, nkx2.1) were not statistically altered, though dio3 methylation showed a decreasing trend with 8:8 PFPiA exposure. Our results specifically advance an understanding of molecular toxicology of PFPiA and more broadly present an approach to define diverse responses during animal alternative assessments of PFASs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aDanio rerio 3aRNA 3acorticotropin 3aenvironment 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3aiodide peroxidase 3amodels 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3arodents 3athyrotropin 3atoxicology 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) 0aPerfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiA) 0aBehavior 0aThyroid disruption 0ahpf 0aLOD 0aPFASs 0aPFCA 0aPFOA 0aPFOS 0aPFPA 0aPFPiA 0aPFSA 0aPFUnDA 0aSE 0a5-mC1 aStroski, Kevin M.1 aKilleen, Grace1 aSmitherman, Cynthia1 aSimcik, Matt F.1 aBrooks, Bryan W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 736 p.139600-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1396003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007700169300001400246520130600260592002801566650001501594650001501609650001401624650001001638653003101648653001301679653001001692653001101702653001201713700001901725700002001744773013101764856008401895852000901979655001201988IND60613835620221117033000.0190416e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061383562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2017.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco, Carlos14aThe role of typeface curvilinearity on taste expectations and perception  ap. 63-74.  aPeople associate specific shape properties with basic taste attributes (such as sweet, bitter, and sour). It has been suggested that more preferred visual aesthetic features are matched to sweetness whereas less-preferred features are matched with tastes such as bitter and sour instead. Given the range of visual aesthetic features that have been shown to be associated with typeface designs, it would seem reasonable to suggest that typefaces might therefore be associated with specific taste properties as well. Should that be the case, one might then wonder whether viewing text presented in, say, a rounder typeface would also potentially influence the perception of sweetness, as compared to viewing the same information when presented in a more angular typeface. Here, we summarize the latest findings supporting the existence of a crossmodal correspondence between typeface features, in particular curvilinearity, and basic tastes. Moreover, we present initial evidence that suggests that, under certain circumstances, typeface curvilinearity can influence taste ratings. Given such evidence, it can be argued that typeface may well be an important, if often neglected, aspect of our everyday lives which can be potentially useful in the design of food and drink product and brand experiences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3agastronomy 3asweetness 3ataste 0aCrossmodal correspondences 0aTypeface 0aTaste 0aDesign 0aProduct1 aHyndman, Sarah1 aSpence, Charles0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2018 Apr., v. 11 p.63-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2017.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010300170300001600273500001100289520103400300592002801334650003101362650001301393650001001406650001101416650001801427650001301445650001901458650001401477650002401491650001301515650001501528650003701543700006001580773014701640856008201787852000901869655001201878IND60588795620221119223719.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058879562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-017-2628-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaumont, CélineM.10aExploiting non-canonical translation to identify new targets for T cell-based cancer immunotherapy  ap. 607-621.  aReview  aCryptic MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) are produced via two mechanisms: translation of protein-coding genes in non-canonical reading frames and translation of allegedly non-coding sequences. In general, cryptic MAPs are coded by relatively short open reading frames whose translation can be regulated at the level of initiation, elongation or termination. In contrast to conventional MAPs, the processing of cryptic MAPs is frequently proteasome independent. The existence of cryptic MAPs derived from allegedly non-coding regions enlarges the scope of CD8 T cell immunosurveillance from a mere ~2% to as much as ~75% of the human genome. Considering that 99% of cancer-specific mutations are located in those allegedly non-coding regions, cryptic MAPs could furthermore represent a particularly rich source of tumor-specific antigens. However, extensive proteogenomic analyses will be required to determine the breath as well as the temporal and spatial plasticity of the cryptic MAP repertoire in normal and neoplastic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aopen reading frames 3apeptides 3aplasticity 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex1 aPerreault, Claude1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9453-73830 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Feb., v. 75, no. 4 p.607-621dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2628-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245003500174300001600209520093500225592002801160650000801188650002101196650001201217650002501229650001001254650002201264700002101286700002501307773010301332856008101435990002301516852000901539655001201548IND60094071320221120162621.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009407132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceb.2011.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkopelitis, Damianos S10aPlant small RNAs as morphogens  ap. 217-224.  aRNA interference (RNAi) in plants has long been known to produce a non-cell autonomous signal capable of silencing target genes over great cellular distances.

Interestingly, some of these mobile small RNAs play critical roles in plant development, forming gradients that regulate the activity of their targets in a dosage-dependent manner. These properties resemble features of morphogens in animals, leading us to postulate that such cell-fate-defining small RNAs employ similar principles for the generation, stabilization and interpretation of their expression gradients. Here we review our understanding of small RNA mobility in plants, evaluate their potential as morphogen-like signals, and consider how the graded accumulation patterns that underlie their patterning/biological activity could be created and maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aanimals 3abioactive properties 3agenes 3aplant development1 aHusbands, Aman Y1 aTimmermans, Marja CP0 tCurrent Opinion in Cell Biology.g2012 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.217-224dElsevier Ltdx0955-06747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2011.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245013600221500001900357520133700376592002801713650001801741650001501759650001201774650001901786650002501805650002301830650001101853650001701864650001101881650002201892653003601914653003601950653002301986653002302009773012002032856008802152852000902240655001202249IND60696922820221116202114.0200719e20200920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069692282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1396022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkodie, Samuel Asumadu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5035-598310aCausal effect of environmental factors, economic indicators and domestic material consumption using frequency domain causality test  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEconomic growth-induced climate change is multifaceted with different dimensions, hence, requires scientific scrutiny. Herein, an assessment of the causal effect of environmental factors, economic assessment and domestic material consumption is presented. We utilized the novel Breitung-Candelon spectral Granger-causality aka frequency domain causality and parameter stability tests to account for the direction of causality. These tests, a resemblance to machine learning algorithm were required to examine the sequential shock of unobserved features of series not reported in traditional Granger-causality tests. The empirical results found a short-run relationship between renewables and economic growth, suggesting a strong effect of wealth on renewable energy consumption. We confirmed a strong and long-term metallurgical coal-controlled metal footprint through steelmaking, and coal-driven energy-based economic structure. The feedback hypothesis was validated between biomass consumption and economic growth. There was evidence that metal ore consumption predicts economic growth, income level and renewable energy consumption while it causes ambient air pollution. From a policy perspective, the study demonstrates that the diversification of the energy mix with renewable energy sources will reduce fossil fuel footprint.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic structure 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aincome 3aissues and policy 0aSpectral granger-causality test 0aFrequency domain causality test 0aParticulate matter 0aMaterial footprint0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 736 p.139602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1396023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245019200157300002000349520130700369592002801676650002301704650001201727650002101739650001701760650002101777650001401798650001501812650001301827650000901840700002101849700001601870700001701886700001901903700001801922700002101940700001701961700002301978773012402001856007402125852000902199655001202208IND60664869220221118015630.0190912e20140305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066486922DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00010b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikata, Yuji10a8-TQEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(8-quinolylmethyl)ethylenediamine) analogs as fluorescent cadmium sensors: strategies to enhance Cd²⁺-induced fluorescence and Cd²⁺/Zn²⁺ selectivity  ap. 12849-12856.  aIn order to exploit the untapped sensing potential of the TQEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-quinolylmethyl)ethylenediamine) family of fluorescent probes, 8-TQEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(8-quinolylmethyl)ethylenediamine) analogs were designed and characterized. Although 8-TQEN lacks practicality owing to poor solubility in both aqueous media and organic solvents, 6-MeO-8-TQEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(6-methoxy-8-quinolylmethyl)ethylenediamine, 1b) exhibits Cd²⁺-selective fluorescence enhancement at 395 nm in DMF–HEPES buffer (1 : 1), (ICd/I₀ = 25, λₑₓ = 332 nm, ϕCd = 0.025). Zn²⁺ induces weaker fluorescence (IZₙ/I₀ = 9, IZₙ/ICd = 0.35). In contrast, both the parent probes TQEN (IZₙ/I₀ = 23, ICd/IZₙ = 0.64) and 6-MeOTQEN (IZₙ/I₀ = 11, ICd/IZₙ = 1.29 exhibit higher sensitivity toward Zn²⁺. When the quinoline groups were replaced with 8-hydroxyquinoline different responses were observed. The propanediamine derivative, 8-TQOEPN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(8-quinolyloxyethylene)propanediamine, 2c) exhibits significant fluorescence enhancement at 423 nm upon Cd²⁺ binding (λₑₓ = 325 nm, ICd/I₀ = 19, ϕCd = 0.31). Fluorescence enhancement is Cd²⁺-specific as Zn²⁺ induces only more modest emission increases (IZₙ/I₀ = 8.8, IZₙ/ICd = 0.45).  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3acadmium 3aethylenediamines 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aquinoline 3asolubility 3asolvents 3azinc1 aTakekoshi, Ayaka1 aKizu, Asako1 aNodomi, Yuki1 aAoyama, Masato1 aYasuda, Keiko1 aTamotsu, Satoshi1 aKonno, Hideo1 aBurdette, Shawn C.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Mar. 05, v. 4, no. 25 p.12849-12856dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra00010b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002100134245005900155300001600214520097800230592002801208650003201236650001601268650001401284650000901298650001501307650001301322650003301335650001301368650001801381653001701399653001601416653002101432653001501453653001301468653001601481700001901497773010101516852000901617856007101626961001301697655001201710IND4458758420221120184317.0200516e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445875842DNAL7 a10.3852/10-2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuels, Gary J.10aHypocrea peltata: a mycological Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?  ap. 616-630.  aHypocrea peltata (Pezizomycotina, Hypocreales, Hypocreaceae) is a common, widespread essentially subtropical species, with an uncharacteristically large stroma and asci containing four large and four small bicellular ascospores. Its only anamorph consists of indehiscent aleuriospores; it does not form a Trichoderma anamorph, which is typical of most Trichoderma/Hypocrea species. Hypocrea peltata grows very well at 37 C. The large stromata and failure to form a Trichoderma anamorph could lead one to doubt its generic placement. However sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), 28S nuclear large subunit (LSU) of rDNA and RNA polymerase subunit II (rpb2) regions indicate that it represents a unique lineage within Trichoderma/Hypocrea. ITS and rbp2 sequences derived from cultures of H. peltata are identical to the “unidentified Hypocreaceae” reported in the literature as being isolated from lung of a patient with non-fatal pulmonary fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aTrichoderma 3aanamorphs 3aasci 3aascospores 3afibrosis 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apatients 3aribosomal DNA 0aHypocreaceae 0aHypocreales 0amedical mycology 0apeptaibols 0ashiitake 0asystematics1 aIsmaiel, Adnan0 tMycologia.g2011 May 1, v. 103, no. 3 p.616-630dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/10-2273Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02881naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001600278520118200294592002801476650002701504650003001531650002201561650001701583650001101600650002101611650002001632650002301652650001501675650001201690650001201702650001301714650001101727650002301738650001201761650001301773650002101786650000701807650001301814650002201827650001001849650001401859653002401873653003001897653002301927653001301950653001701963653002101980700002302001700002502024700002802049773012202077856008302199852000902282655001202291IND60613835820221117033442.0190416e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061383582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Magda A.10aPurification and characterization of xylanase isoenzymes from red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus  ap. 321-327.  aXylanase activity in the guts of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus during larval development had been investigated. The activity in the guts from the 5th to the 12th instars ranged from 12.5 to 67 U/gut with specific activity ranged from 50 to 124 U/mg protein. The 10th instars larvae had the highest enzyme activity. Purification of two predominant xylanase isoenzymes was performed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. XyI and XyII had specific activities of 468.6 and 402 U/mg proteins, native molecular weights of 25 and 42 kDa, respectively. They had monomeric forms, showed identical optimum activity at pH 5.5 and 40 °C. XyII exhibited higher thermal stability and activation energy than XyI. Inhibition by Hg2+, Cu2+, EDTA and stimulation by dithiol-reducing agents revealed the presence of at least one sulfhydryl group in the active site of the enzyme and they were metalloenzyme. They exhibited high specificity towards natural xylans. They produced xylotriose, xylotetraose and xylopentaose as the main hydrolysis products of beechwood xylan. The results were compared with those previously recorded for different insect species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 3aactivation energy 3aactive sites 3acopper 3adigestive system 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3ainsects 3ainstars 3aisozymes 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amercury 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aproteins 3athermal stability 3axylan 3axylanases 0aPhoenix dactylifera 0aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 0aLarval development 0aXylanase 0aPurification 0aCharacterization1 aGhanem, Manal M.E.1 aAbd-Elaziz, Ahmed M.1 aShams-Eldin, Ibrahim M.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2018 Apr., v. 14 p.321-327dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245010300208300001400311520127900325592002801604650001201632650001501644650001101659650001301670650001301683650002901696650002501725650003001750650001001780650001301790650002601803650002601829650001401855650001401869650002301883653002701906653001501933653001501948653002601963653003101989653001302020700005702033700001502090700001502105773011802120856008802238852000902326655001202335IND60614532420221117232415.0181102e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061453242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, R.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2276-972110aEnvironmental impacts of the use of bottom ashes from municipal solid waste incineration: A review  ap. 23-35.  aThis paper presents a literature review concerning the performance from an environmental viewpoint of construction related products made with municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash. It starts with an initial assessment of the bottom ash, and how it performs when used as aggregate substitute in cement-based products, as cement constituent and as raw feed in cement production. Evaluation of the material’s environmental performance when used as aggregate replacement in unbound and cement-bound base and subbase layers for road pavement construction, as well as in asphalt concrete layers, is also undertaken. This paper also appraises the behaviour of ceramic-based products, including glass, glass-ceramics, and general ceramics. As a result of the high quantities of potentially leachable contaminants inherent to the bottom ash, the environmental assessment carried out throughout this paper is mostly based on the materials’ leaching behaviour, but also based on life cycle assessments and gas emission analyses. The results of several leaching trials, conducted according to various specifications, were reviewed and paralleled with corresponding regulations, with the objective of establishing the products’ viability from an environmental point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3abottom ash 3acement 3aceramics 3aconcrete 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aglass 3aleaching 3alife cycle assessment 3amunicipal solid waste 3apavements 3aviability 3awaste incineration 0aMunicipal solid wastes 0aBottom ash 0aAggregates 0aCement-based products 0aRoad pavement construction 0aCeramics1 aBrito, J. de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6766-27361 aLynn, C.J.1 aDhir, R.K.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Jan., v. 140 p.23-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009200161300001800253520030100271592002800572650002700600650002300627650002600650650001300676650001700689700001600706700001500722700002400737700002500761700002100786700002000807700002300827700002200850700002300872773013400895856007501029852000901104655001201113IND60658953320221118162213.0190826e20110711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065895332DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11168j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarra, Ilich A.10aHighly porous and robust scandium-based metal–organic frameworks for hydrogen storage  ap. 8304-8306.  aThe metal–organic frameworks NOTT-400 and NOTT-401, based on a binuclear [Sc₂(μ₂-OH)(O₂CR)₄] building block, have been synthesised and characterised; the desolvated framework NOTT-401a shows a BET surface area of 1514 m² g⁻¹ with a total H₂ uptake of 4.44 wt% at 77 K and 20 bar.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrogen 3asurface area1 aYang, Sihai1 aLin, Xiang1 aBlake, Alexander J.1 aRizkallah, Pierre J.1 aNowell, Harriott1 aAllan, David R.1 aChampness, Neil R.1 aHubberstey, Peter1 aSchröder, Martin,0 tChemical communications.g2011 July 11, v. 47, no. 29 p.8304-8306dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc11168j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245014600177300001800323520123700341592002801578650001201606650001701618650001001635650001101645650004401656650001401700650001501714700002401729700006101753773011901814856008701933852000902020655001202029IND60653895720190814000000.0190722e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065389572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b011202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaimes M., Leonardo10aPrediction of the Penetration Grade and Softening Point of Vacuum Residues and Asphalts by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Chemometric Methods  ap. 6264-6272.  aFor the first time, the development of prediction models of the penetration grade and the softening point of vacuum residues (VRs) and pavement asphalts, from the structural data obtained with proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) and relaxometry data obtained via low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF NMR), is reported. The correlation between the structural data (¹H NMR, percentage of different proton kinds), the relaxometry data (T₂, spin–spin relaxation time), and the properties, was measured with principal component regression (PCR). The best models were those obtained with PCR, which were validated via k-fold cross-validation, with k = 10. In particular for the VR, the best model for the penetration grade was obtained from LF NMR, with a training R² of 0.99 and a validation R² of 0.96; the best softening point was obtained from the combination of ¹H NMR and LF NMR, with R² values of 0.99 and 0.87, respectively. For the asphalts, the best model for the penetration grade was also obtained from the combination of ¹H NMR and LF NMR, with R² values of 0.99 and 0.94, respectively. Note that these prediction methods require less sample quantity, time, and personal effort than the ASTM standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3achemometrics 3afuels 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apavements 3aprediction1 aSantos S., Nicolás1 aMolina V., Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7897-25260 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 June 11, v. 33, no. 7 p.6264-6272dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b011203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001600268520153900284592002801823650001801851650002101869650001001890650000901900650001601909650001801925650001901943650001101962650001801973650002201991650002002013650001702033653001902050653001002069653002002079653001002099653000802109653000802117653000902125653001002134653001802144653001602162653002602178700002102204700002002225773012202245856008302367852000902450655001202459IND60613835920221117033947.0190416e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061383592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2018.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByeon, Boseon10aTissue-specific heat-induced changes in the expression of ncRNA fragments in Brassica rapa plants  ap. 338-356.  aNon-coding RNA fragments (ncRFs) represent a large spectrum of short ncRNAs processed from precursor ncRNAs such as tRNA, rRNA, snoRNA and several others. Several recent papers suggest that ncRFs are processed in a specific manner in different tissues or in response to stress. Here, we analyzed alterations in the expression of ncRFs in different Brassica rapa tissues in response to heat stress. Specifically, we analyzed the abundance of tRNA fragments (tRFs), rRNA fragments (rRFs), snoRNA fragments (snoRFs) and snRNA fragments (snRFs). The most significant changes in response to heat stress were observed in tRNAGlu and tRNAAsp. Whereas the number of reads mapping to the former one dropped drastically in all tissues but the apical meristem and pollen, the number of reads mapping to the latter significantly increased. Analysis of tRFs showed that three isoacceptors, tRF5′Asp(GUC), tRFGly(UCC) and tRFPseudo(UCC) were severely underrepresented in heat-stressed tissues. Heat also induced changes in the processing of ncRFs from precursor molecules; a bias towards the processing of ncRFs from the 3′ end was even more prominent after the heat stress application. The analysis of predicted targets of ncRFs revealed an enrichment in several groups of genes involved in the response to various stresses. To conclude, our work showed that heat stress results in tissue-specific changes in the expression of ncRFs in Brassica rapa and suggested a tissue-specific regulation of various mRNAs and pathways in response to heat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aapical meristems 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3apollen 3aribosomal RNA 3asmall nuclear RNA 3astress response 3atransfer RNA 0aNon-coding RNA 0ancRNA 0ancRNA fragments 0ancRFs 0atRF 0arRF 0asnRF 0asnoRF 0aBrassica rapa 0aHeat stress 0aEpigenetic regulation1 aBilichak, Andriy1 aKovalchuk, Igor0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2018 Apr., v. 14 p.338-356dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2018.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015500168300001600323506011700339506007600456520161700532592002802149506003702177650001302214650001502227650003502242650002002277650002202297650001202319650001102331650001702342650000902359650001002368650000902378650001402387650001302401650001102414650001602425650000902441651001002450653002902460653001902489653001102508653001702519653000902536653001802545653003402563700002002597700002202617773018302639856008302822852000902905655001202914IND60625270320221207143022.0220706e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062527032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejar.2018.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDar, Mahmoud A.14aThe differential abilities of some molluscs to accumulate heavy metals within their shells in the Timsah and the Great Bitter lakes, Suez Canal, Egypt  ap. 291-298.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study aims to investigate the different patterns of heavy metal bio-mineralization by some molluscs species (bivalves and gastropods) collected from the Timsah and Great Bitter lakes within their shells. Samples were collected from the two lakes, during the period from May 2016 to June 2017. The samples included seven mollusc species. The bio-available forms of the selected heavy metals: iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn), were determined in triplicates, using flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, then three individuals of each gastropod and bivalve species were selected for measuring heavy metals concentrations in their shells. Results showed that, the harvested (Fe) and (Mn) were the highest mineralized metals in the shell structures of the different species; while their bio-mineralization factor of metals (BMFM) ratios were significantly low. (Ni), (Pb) and (Cd) recorded the highest BMFM ratios; meanwhile, (Zn) and (Cu) showed significantly low BMFM in spite of their abundance in the mud fractions. The different species in the Timsah Lake had a BMFM of (<1.00). In the meantime, Brachidontes pharaonis harvested the highest BMFM where (2.36) was the value of (Cd); Cardium papyraceum procured the highest (Pb) (2.16) and Fusinus sp. showed the highest BMFM of (Ni) (1.10) in the Great Bitter Lake. The recorded variations in the BMFM ratios among the different species ascertain the probability of heavy metal mineralization selectivity depending on the local conditions much more than the heavy metals bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBivalvia 3aGastropoda 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioavailability 3abiomineralization 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alakes 3alead 3amanganese 3amolluscs 3anickel 3aprobability 3azinc 3aEgypt 0aDifferential selectivity 0aMineralization 0aShells 0aMud fraction 0aBMFM 0aBio-available 0aTimsah and Great Bitter lakes1 aBelal, Aisha A.1 aMadkour, Amany G.0 tEgyptian Journal of Aquatic Research (Online).g2018 Dec., v. 44, no. 4 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.aNational Institute of Oceanography and FisherieswJournal:21572x1687-42857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejar.2018.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245019200156500001100348520150400359592002801863650000901891650001301900650001601913650001401929650001001943650001801953650001201971650001401983650002301997700001802020700001702038700001702055700001902072700001902091700001702110700001802127700002002145700005602165700001502221773011802236856007402354852000902428655001202437IND60789231820221122070054.0220819e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078923182DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.134642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Kyuyeon14aThe effect of pharmacological treatment and lifestyle modification in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials  aREVIEW  aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver disease that affects approximately 25% of the world's population, and various treatments have been applied for NAFLD patients. We compared the effectiveness of each intervention conducted to treat NAFLD by evaluating meta‐analyses of pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modification including diet and exercise. We searched Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library and included meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of pharmacological intervention and lifestyle modification on NAFLD. The quality of included meta‐analyses was evaluated by AMSTAR‐2. If the effect size was expressed as mean difference, it was converted to standardized mean difference based on the random‐effects model. A total of 1694 meta‐analyses were identified, and 27 meta‐analyses were eventually included in the review. Regarding pharmacological interventions, there was a high strength of evidence for the ALT reduction effect of silymarin on inactive controls (SMD = 0.88, p < 0.01, seven trials, 518 participants). Meanwhile, it was confirmed that appropriate diet and exercise were important in reducing liver fat (SMD = 1.51, p < 0.01, 12 trials, 765 participants). This umbrella review assessed the effects of pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications in the treatment of NAFLD. The results of this review can be utilized for clinical decisions when treating NAFLD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aexercise 3afatty liver 3alifestyle 3aliver 3ameta-analysis 3aobesity 3asilymarin 3astatistical models1 aPark, Seoyeon1 aKoyanagi, Ai1 aJacob, Louis1 aYon, Dong Keon1 aLee, Seung Won1 aKim, Min Seo1 aKim, Seung Up1 aKim, Beom Kyung1 aShin, Jae Il1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2326-18201 aSmith, Lee0 tObesity reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.e13464-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.134643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245007700172520121900249592002801468650002201496650001501518650002401533650002401557650002201581650002301603650003101626650002101657650001501678700003201693700001901725700003101744700003701775700001901812700002401831700002101855700002101876700003201897773012601929856007802055852000902133655001202142IND60745384820221122185953.0210723e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074538482DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100710432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña-Bautista, Carmen 10aLipid Peroxidation Assessment in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease Diagnosis  aAlzheimer disease (AD) is an increasingly common neurodegenerative disease, especially in countries with aging populations. Its diagnosis is complex and is usually carried out in advanced stages of the disease. In addition, lipids and oxidative stress have been related to AD since the earliest stages. A diagnosis in the initial or preclinical stages of the disease could help in a more effective action of the treatments. Isoprostanoid biomarkers were determined in plasma samples from preclinical AD participants (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 31) by chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Participants were accurately classified according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuropsychological examination. Isoprostanoid levels did not show differences between groups. However, some of them correlated with CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau) and with cognitive decline. In addition, a panel including 10 biomarkers showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.96 (0.903–1) and a validation AUC of 0.90 in preclinical AD prediction. Plasma isoprostanoids could be useful biomarkers in preclinical diagnosis for AD. However, these results would require a further validation with an external cohort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abiomarkers 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acognitive disorders 3adisease diagnosis 3alipid peroxidation 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative stress 3aprediction1 aÁlvarez-Sánchez, Lourdes 1 aFerrer, Inés 1 aLópez-Nogueroles, Marina 1 aCañada-Martínez, Antonio José1 aOger, Camille 1 aGalano, Jean-Marie 1 aDurand, Thierry 1 aBaquero, Miguel 1 aCháfer-Pericás, Consuelo 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 June 29, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100710433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010200167520165500269592002801924650001801952650001701970650001501987650001202002650002102014650001402035650001102049650001702060650002602077650001502103650001402118650002402132650002102156650000902177650002002186650001602206650001402222700003002236700002102266700002002287700002702307700002402334700001802358700002502376700001902401700002302420700002602443700002302469700002502492773012602517856007802643852000902721655001202730IND60745384920221122112450.0210723e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074538492DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100710462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Amico, Ramona 10aHidrox® and Chronic Cystitis: Biochemical Evaluation of Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Pain  aInterstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder condition characterized by frequent urination, inflammation, oxidative stress, and pain. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of an oral administration of Hidrox® (10 mg/kg) in the bladder and spinal cord in a rodent model of IC/BPS. The chronic animal model of cystitis was induced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of cyclophosphamide (CYP) for five consecutive days. Treatment with Hidrox® began on the third day of the CYP injection and continued until the 10th day. CYP administration caused macroscopic and histological bladder changes, inflammatory infiltrates, increased mast cell numbers, oxidative stress, decreased expression of the tight endothelial junction (e.g., zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin), and bladder pain. Treatment with Hidrox® was able to improve CYP-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. It was also able to reduce bladder pain which was aggravated by the activation of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. In particular, Hidrox® reduced the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the activation of astrocytes and microglia, consequently reducing mechanical allodynia. These results indicate that nutritional consumption of Hidrox® can be considered as a new therapeutic approach for human cystitis, increasing the conceivable potential of a significant improvement in the quality of life associated with a lowering of symptom intensity in patients with IC/BPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3aastrocytes 3abladder 3acyclophosphamide 3ahistology 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterstitial cystitis 3amast cells 3aoccludins 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3aquality of life 3aspinal cord 3aurination1 aTrovato Salinaro, Angela 1 aCordaro, Marika 1 aFusco, Roberta 1 aImpellizzeri, Daniela 1 aInterdonato, Livia 1 aScuto, Maria 1 aOntario, Maria Laura1 aCrea, Roberto 1 aSiracusa, Rosalba 1 aCuzzocrea, Salvatore 1 aDi Paola, Rosanna 1 aCalabrese, Vittorio 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 June 29, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100710463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245007300129300001600202500001400218520210100232592002802333650001702361650000902378650001402387650002502401650001902426650001402445650002902459650001202488650001102500650001902511650002102530650001402551650001302565650001602578650001002594650001602604651001002620653000802630653002102638653002402659653000802683653002002691653002202711653001802733653002902751653002002780700001702800700001602817700001502833700001802848773013802866852000903004655001203013IND60723736920221120131738.0210117e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072373692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisra, A. K.10aEstimates of wheat straw availability and variation in straw quality  ap. 112-118.  aNAL-light  aA study was conducted to determine the straw grain ratios (S/G ratio) and straw quality of wheat cultivars to develop wheat straw availability estimates at national and state levels. The sampling locations were the farmer's field spread over 8 major wheat producing Indian states viz., Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. These states together contribute more than 85 percent of total wheat production in India. A significant variation (P<0.001) in straw to grain ratios was observed among wheat cultivars grown in different states. Variability (P<0.001) within the cultivar was also observed when it was grown under different agro climatic regions and agronomical practices. At present (year 2010–11) 112 million tonnes of wheat straw is expected to be available in the country and in next 10 years (year 2020) this quantity will increase up to 120 million tonnes, registering a growth of 6 percent. As per the projections, the share of UP in total wheat straw pool will be the highest (33%), followed by Punjab (19%), Haryana (15%), Rajasthan (11%), MP (10%) and Bihar (6%). The straw availability from other wheat producing states is expected to be 6 percent. Similarly significant variations (P<0.01) in all the quality attributes were observed among the wheat cultivars. Among the various chemical constituents, the CP content varied greatly (50.1%) followed by the lignin (42.96%), hemi cellulose (37.12%), ADF (30.39%), cellulose (28.37%) and NDF (21.2%). The dry matter digestibility of straw from different wheat cultivars ranged from 35.0 to 52.3 percent. It was concluded that straw grain ratios are variable and therefore the projection based on area specific ratios will be more realistic for assessing the straw availability in the country. Chemical composition and digestibility of straw varied among the wheat cultivars. Results suggested that the variability in nutritional parameters among varieties need to be exploited by plant breeders, particularly in areas where straw is an important component of ruminant feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aarea 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aclimatic zones 3acultivars 3adry matter digestibility 3afarmers 3alignin 3aplant breeders 3arange management 3aruminants 3asampling 3avariability 3awheat 3awheat straw 3aIndia 0aADF 0aAnimal nutrition 0aForage availability 0aNDF 0aNutritive value 0aStraw grain ratio 0aStraw quality 0aWheat straw availability 0aWheat varieties1 aSingh, K.

Here, a detailed, thermodynamically consistent reaction mechanism for the methanation reactions of CO and CO₂ over Ni-based catalysts is presented. This microkinetic model is based on the mean-field approximation and comprises 42 reactions among 19 species. The model was developed based on experiments from a number of studies in powder and monolith catalysts. These are numerically reproduced by flow field simulations coupled with the kinetic scheme. The reaction mechanism features multiple paths for the conversion of CO and CO₂ into CH₄, including a carbide pathway and direct hydrogenation of CO₂ on the surface. The model developed describes the methanation process adequately over a wide range of temperatures, catalyst loadings, support materials, and reactant ratios. Hence, it can serve as a microkinetic basis for reaction engineering and up-scaling purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amethane production 3amodels 3anickel 3aprocess design 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 3athermodynamics1 aMaier, Lubow1 aDeutschmann, Olaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9211-75290 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 60, no. 16 p.5792-5805dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c003893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245010800200500001100308520164100319592002801960596010301988596014302091650002002234650001402254650001202268650002202280700006402302700002302366700006302389700002302452773011802475856007402593852000902667655001202676IND60789232120221121005243.0220819e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078923212DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.134562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowlden, Adam P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0691-299410aSystematic review of electronically delivered behavioral obesity prevention interventions targeting men  aREVIEW  aGlobally, obesity persists at epidemic rates. Men are underrepresented within behavior‐based obesity prevention research. As men prefer individualized, self‐guided interventions, electronic delivery of treatment modalities has potential to reach this population. The purpose of this study was to systematically review primary, secondary, or tertiary behavioral obesity prevention interventions that used controlled designs; targeted men; and incorporated at least one electronically delivered treatment modality explicitly designed to elicit an intervention effect. Literature searches were delimited to peer‐reviewed articles; published between 2000 and 2021; in the English language; and indexed in PsycINFO, CINHAL, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and WOS electronic databases. Interventions satisfying inclusion criteria were critiqued for methodological quality using the Jadad Scale (0 = lowest quality; 10 = highest quality). Eleven studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (n = 1748; total participants) with five reporting group‐by‐time intervention effects on the primary variable targeted. Jadad scale quality assessment scores ranged from 5.00 to 9.00 with a mean of 7.72. Majority of the interventions applied a randomized control trial design (n = 10). Most interventions were theory based, with eight rooted in social cognitive theory. Behavior change strategies included self‐monitoring (n = 10), personalized feedback (n = 8), health counseling (n = 8), and goal setting (n = 9). Community‐level theories have the potential to guide future obesity prevention interventions targeting men.  aPublisher supplied data  a1K01HL145128cNational Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD  aL30HL159690cNational Institutes of Health Loan Repayment Program, Division of Loan Repayment, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 3abehavior change 3acognition 3aobesity 3asystematic review1 aWilkerson, Amanda H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5116-90121 aDunlap, Kandyce B.1 aStellefson, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1717-41141 aElijah, Odunayo A.0 tObesity reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.e13456-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.134563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010600168300001800274500001900292520054100311592002800852650002300880650001500903650001500918700002100933700002300954700002100977700006000998700006101058773012001119856008301239852000901322655001201331IND60697619620210618000000.0200605e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069761962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c013702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabat, Nazarii10aGold-Catalyzed Spirocyclization Reactions of N-Propargyl Tryptamines and Tryptophans in Aqueous Media  ap. 4344-4349.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aN-Propargyl tryptamine and tryptophan derivatives that are readily available from both synthetic and biocatalytic approaches undergo gold-catalyzed dearomative cyclizations in aqueous media to the corresponding spirocyclic derivatives.

Here, we investigated righting, foraging behavior and growth of small sea urchins Strongylocentrotus intermedius exposed to five light spectra (blue light: 440–490 nm, green light: 510–550 nm, red light: 630–670 nm, yellow light: 570–600 nm and white light) for 60 days. In the present study, S. intermedius exposed to red light had a smaller test diameter than those exposed to other light spectra (P < 0.05). No significant difference of daily weight gain was found among light spectra groups (P > 0.05). Consistently, the lantern length and weight of S. intermedius under red light were smallest among five light spectra. These results indicate that red light significantly inhibits the growth of S. intermedius. The successful foraging proportion showed no significant difference among the five light spectra (P > 0.05). Righting response time and foraging time, however, were significantly higher in S. intermedius under blue light than those exposed to other light spectra (both P < 0.01). This highlights the importance and necessity of kelp beds and shelters at the reseeding site to avoid the long-term effects of blue light on foraging and righting behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongylocentrotus intermedius 3aaquaculture 3ablue light 3agreen light 3amacroalgae 3ared light 3aweight gain 3awhite light 0aLight spectra 0aBehavior 0aGrowth 0aStock enhancement1 aHu, Fangyuan1 aLeng, Xiaofei1 aChi, Xiaomei1 aYin, Donghong1 aDing, Jingyun1 aLi, Xiang1 aZuo, Rantao1 aChzhan, I︠A︡t︠s︡in,1 aZhao, Chong0 tAquaculture.g2021 May 15, v. 537 p.736518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011100176300001600287520172100303592002802024650002102052650001602073650002902089650002402118650002402142650001902166650002502185650001502210650002002225650001802245650001402263650001502277650002502292653001402317653002202331653002402353653004202377653002002419653004102439700001702480700001602497700002002513700001902533700002102552700002502573700002302598700001902621773008202640856008402722852000902806655001202815IND60545192020221120205838.0160901e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054519202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, João H.O.S.10aSolar photocatalytic oxidation of recalcitrant natural metabolic by-products of amoxicillin biodegradation  ap. 307-320.  aThe contamination of the aquatic environment by non-metabolized and metabolized antibiotic residues has brought the necessity of alternative treatment steps to current water decontamination technologies. This work assessed the feasibility of using a multistage treatment system for amoxicillin (AMX) spiked solutions combining: i) a biological treatment process using an enriched culture to metabolize AMX, with ii) a solar photocatalytic system to achieve the removal of the metabolized transformation products (TPs) identified via LC-MS, recalcitrant to further biological degradation. Firstly, a mixed culture (MC) was obtained through the enrichment of an activated sludge sample collected in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Secondly, different aqueous matrices spiked with AMX were treated with the MC and the metabolic transformation products were identified. Thirdly, the efficiency of two solar assisted photocatalytic processes (TiO2/UV or Fe3+/Oxalate/H2O2/UV–Vis) was assessed in the degradation of the obtained TPs using a lab-scale prototype photoreactor equipped with a compound parabolic collector (CPC). Highest AMX specific biodegradation rates were obtained in buffer and urban wastewater (WW) media (0.10 ± 0.01 and 0.13 ± 0.07 gAMX gbiomass−1 h−1, respectively). The resulting TPs, which no longer presented antibacterial activity, were identified as amoxicilloic acid (m/z = 384). The performance of the Fe3+/Oxalate/H2O2/UV–Vis system in the removal of the TPs from WW medium was superior to the TiO2/UV process (TPs no longer detected after 40 min (QUV = 2.6 kJ L−1), against incomplete TPs removal after 240 min (QUV = 14.9 kJ L−1), respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aamoxicillin 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic residues 3aaquatic environment 3abiodegradation 3abiological treatment 3abyproducts 3adecontamination 3amixed culture 3aoxidation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aβ-Lactam 0aAmoxicilloic acid 0aTiO2 photocatalysis 0aPhoto-Fenton mediated by ferrioxalate 0aSolar radiation 0aCompound parabolic collectors (CPCs)1 aReis, Ana C.1 aHomem, Vera1 aSilva, José A.1 aAlves, Arminda1 aBorges, Maria T.1 aBoaventura, Rui A.R.1 aVilar, Vítor J.P.1 aNunes, Olga C.0 tWater research.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 65 p.307-320dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245011900207500001100326520136700337592002801704650001601732650001401748650002201762650002401784650002201808650001201830650001101842650002201853651001101875700002501886700003101911700003001942700003801972700003902010773011802049856007402167852000902241655001202250IND60789232420221123043928.0220819e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078923242DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.134612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAceves‐Martins, Magaly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9441-142X10aCultural factors related to childhood and adolescent obesity in Mexico: A systematic review of qualitative studies  aREVIEW  aCulture and culturally specific beliefs or practices may influence perceptions and decisions, potentially contributing to childhood obesity. The objective of this study is to identify the cultural factors (expressed through decisions, behaviors, individual experiences, perceptions, attitudes, or views) related to childhood and adolescent obesity in Mexico. Ten databases and one search engine were searched from 1995 onwards for qualitative studies. The Sunrise Enabler Model, described within the Cultural Care Theory, guided this review. Sample, the phenomenon of interest, study design, and evaluation data were extracted, and the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Twenty‐four studies were included. Of these, 12 studies included children or adolescents, 12 included parents, eight included schoolteachers, four included school staff (other than teachers), four included food vendors, and one included policymakers. Cultural values, beliefs, lifeways (especially food and food costumes), kinship, and social factors (particularly immediate and extended family) strongly influenced childhood and adolescent obesity‐related lifestyles in Mexico. Most cultural factors related to childhood obesity in Mexico identified in this review may be modifiable and amenable to practical interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3aexperimental design 3aextended families 3akinship 3amodels 3asystematic review 3aMexico1 aLópez‐Cruz, Lizet1 aGarcía‐Botello, Marcela1 aGodina‐Flores, Naara L.1 aGutierrez‐Gómez, Yareni Yunuen1 aMoreno‐García, Carlos Francisco0 tObesity reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.e13461-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.134613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245007800135300001600213500001400229520111900243592002801362650001701390650001501407650001101422650002201433650002001455650001501475650001101490650002901501650001501530650001401545650002401559650001301583650002101596650001301617650001601630650001501646651001001661653001901671653002301690653002201713653002101735653001901756653001801775700001501793700002001808700001601828700001901844700001601863773013801879852000902017655001202026IND60723737320221120152308.0210117e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072373732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiradar, Nagaratna10aLivelihood analysis of livestock farmers in arid region of Deccan Plateau  ap. 131-136.  aNAL-light  aResource-poor farmers form a major part in arid eco system of the country.

A study was taken up to analyse the role of livestock in the livelihood of farmers, emphasising more on resource poor farmers using sustainable livelihood framework. Analysis of data collected by employing standardised interview schedule to 162 households of 3 districts of arid zone of Southern India revealed asymmetrical livelihood pentagon with limited social and financial capitals. Landholding explained 65 percent variation on livestock income indicating more equitable distribution of livestock income across farmers of different landholding categories. Therefore, promotion of collective actions, technology dissemination and also incessant research on livestock husbandry for resource-poor farmers should become part of the strategic plan to reduce agrarian crisis and bring in social parity in rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aarid zones 3aassets 3acollective action 3adata collection 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alimited resource farmers 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3alivestock husbandry 3aplateaus 3arange management 3aresearch 3arural areas 3atechnology 3aIndia 0aArid districts 0aEmployment pattern 0aFinancial capital 0aRural Livelihood 0aSocial capital 0aSRL framework1 aSharma, P.1 aPandey, Sadhana1 aSatyapriya,1 aSingh, Maharaj1 aRadotra, S.0 tRange management & agroforestry.g2013 June, v. 34, no. 1 p.131-136dRange Management Society of IndiawJournal:2080x2249-52317nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010300160300001600263520174700279592002802026650001102054650002402065650002002089650000902109650001902118650002602137650001302163650001102176650001902187650001302206650002502219650002402244650001502268653001102283653002202294653002602316653000702342653003902349700001202388700001202400700001302412700001202425700001302437700001202450700001202462700001602474700001202490773010802502856008302610852000902693655001202702IND60083626520221122021012.0190411e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008362652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.10aAugmented reality intravenous injection simulator based 3D medical imaging for veterinary medicine  ap. 197-202.  aAugmented reality (AR) is a technology which enables users to see the real world, with virtual objects superimposed upon or composited with it. AR simulators have been developed and used in human medicine, but not in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to develop an AR intravenous (IV) injection simulator to train veterinary and pre-veterinary students to perform canine venipuncture. Computed tomographic (CT) images of a beagle dog were scanned using a 64-channel multidetector. The CT images were transformed into volumetric data sets using an image segmentation method and were converted into a stereolithography format for creating 3D models. An AR-based interface was developed for an AR simulator for IV injection. Veterinary and pre-veterinary student volunteers were randomly assigned to an AR-trained group or a control group trained using more traditional methods (n=20/group; n=8 pre-veterinary students and n=12 veterinary students in each group) and their proficiency at IV injection technique in live dogs was assessed after training was completed. Students were also asked to complete a questionnaire which was administered after using the simulator.The group that was trained using an AR simulator were more proficient at IV injection technique using real dogs than the control group (P⩽0.01). The students agreed that they learned the IV injection technique through the AR simulator. Although the system used in this study needs to be modified before it can be adopted for veterinary educational use, AR simulation has been shown to be a very effective tool for training medical personnel. Using the technology reported here, veterinary AR simulators could be developed for future use in veterinary education.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3acomputed tomography 3adata collection 3adogs 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3amedicine 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3astudents 3aveterinary education 3aveterinary medicine 3avolunteers 0aCanine 0aAugmented reality 0aIntravenous injection 0aCT 0aSimulation-based medical education1 aLee, J.1 aLee, A.1 aPark, N.1 aLee, S.1 aSong, S.1 aSeo, A.1 aLee, H.1 aKim, J.

Vertical light heterogeneity (i.e., patterns of light attenuation from the forest canopy to the floor) may be related to light competition among trees, while horizontal light heterogeneity (i.e., variations in light intensity at a given height within forests) may be associated with light‐niche partitioning among tree species. However, light heterogeneity in vertical and horizontal directions and their associations with forest structure are rarely studied to date. Here we report the first comprehensive study to compare the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity in differently aged forests in two forest types. LOCATION: Twelve forest stands of different ages in cool‐temperate forests (consisting of deciduous broad‐leaved trees) and five of different ages in warm‐temperate forests (evergreen conifer and deciduous broad‐leaved trees) in Japan. METHODS: We measured vertical light profiles at 1‐m intervals from the understorey (1 m above the ground) to the top canopy (12–22 m depending on stands) at 16 locations for each stand (20 m × 20 m). We also measured structural parameters (diameter at breast height, height, and crown dimensions) for all major trees in these stands. RESULTS: Along the secondary successional gradients, the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity changed in a systematic manner in both forests. The vertical light attenuation rate was steeper in early succession and more gradual in late succession, and the horizontal light heterogeneity was relatively small in early succession and more pronounced in late succession. The vertical light attenuation rate was different between the two forest types; the light intensity dropped more sharply from the canopy surface in the cool‐temperate forests due to the crown being vertically shorter and denser (i.e., higher leaf density per unit volume). CONCLUSION: In early succession, a steeper light attenuation rate is likely related to the strong light competition among co‐occurring trees and thus a self‐thinning process. In late succession, the high spatial light heterogeneity in forests (i.e., larger horizontal light heterogeneity and gradual light attenuation rate) may allow more species to partition light, and thus may enhance species coexistence and diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Research Council Advanced Grant PANTROP 834775  cKAKENHI # 17H03734  cKAKENHI # 21H02564 3aJapan 3aconifers 3aforest canopy 3aleaf density 3alight intensity 3asecondary succession 3atree and stand measurements 3aunderstory1 aHiura, Tsutom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6735-19351 aOnoda, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6245-23420 tJournal of vegetation science.g2022 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.e13135-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.131353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008300171520185000254592002802104650001002132650001002142650001302152650001202165650001302177650001902190650003302209650001402242650001802256650001302274650002902287653002302316653002802339653001702367653004402384653002002428653003102448700006602479700006202545700001902607773012402626856008302750852000902833655001202842IND60734848420221116152404.0211206e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073484842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1051642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastilla, Clément10aIon mobility mass spectrometry of in situ generated biomass pyrolysis products  aLignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable energy source that can be used as biofuel after physicochemical conversion, e.g. by fast pyrolysis. However, the chemical variations from wood and other biomass species affect this conversion. Chemical characterization is needed to obtain more information on the pyrolysis products depending on the biomass type and pyrolysis conditions. Here, we compared the fast pyrolysis molecular pattern of five lignocellulosic biomasses (beech, hickory, miscanthus and two brands of resinous wood pellets) obtained from a direct analysis method of solid samples coupled to ion mobility and time of flight mass spectrometry (IM-TOF MS). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) with its ultra-high resolving power was used, with a similar solid analysis introduction approach, to probe for the presence of possible unresolved isobaric compounds in the IM-TOF MS analysis. Isobaric interferences were found to be negligible and molecular formulas determined using IM-TOF MS were confirmed as reliable. Principal component analysis on the molecular formulas allowed the extraction of marker ions preferentially found in hardwood and miscanthus or softwood species. Ion mobility drift time values from these biomass markers were converted into collision-cross sections (CCS), a direct measure of structure and shape of a molecule. No significant CCS differences were observed between the markers of the five wood samples, showing isomeric similarities between the samples. In order to move forward on the structural elucidation and characterization of the pyrolysis products, IM-TOF MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were performed on standard molecules and compared to the biomass pyrolysis products, highlighting the presence of isomers in the wood pyrolysis products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarya 3aFagus 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3ahardwood 3alignocellulose 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrolysis 3aresinous wood 3asoftwood 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAmbient ionization 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aIon mobility 0aUltra high resolution mass spectrometry 0aBiomass pellets 0aMultivariate data analysis1 aRüger, Christopher P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9634-92391 aLavanant, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2963-03271 aAfonso, Carlos0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 June, v. 156 p.105164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1051643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245012200167300001800289520033300307592002800640650001500668650001100683650002500694650001100719650002700730700001800757700002700775700002400802700002800826773012900854856007200983852000901055655001201064IND60657249820221118073754.0190816e20020619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065724982DNAL7 a10.1039/b202940e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, I.

However, these modeling studies have been performed without a detailed assessment of the factors that jointly control groundwater storage and crop yield. The objective of this paper is to present results from a study that applied sensitivity analysis to the linked DSSAT-MODFLOW modeling system to determine the governing environmental and management factors that control groundwater storage and crop yield in an intensively irrigated groundwater region basin. Methods are applied to Finney County, in southwest Kansas, USA. Sensitivity analysis was accomplished using the Morris screening method followed by the Sobol’ variance-based method using random sampling. A combination of soil, hydrologic, plant cultivar, and climate parameters are included in the analysis. A combination of Python scripts and SimLab pre- and post-processing routines were used to generate values of parameters, update model files for DSSAT and MODFLOW, run the model simulations, and calculate sensitivity indices. Results indicate that climatic parameters account for 44%, 29%, 40%, and 36% variation in maize, soybean, winter wheat, and sorghum yields. Hydrogeologic parameters (i.e., hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and riverbed conductance) have relatively low influence on crop yield. Water table elevation, recharge, and irrigation pumping are considerably sensitive to soil- and climate-related parameters, while evapotranspiration, river leakage, and groundwater discharge are highly influenced by hydrogeological parameters. These results can be used to explore effects of management strategies on groundwater and agricultural sustainability in similar regions in the face of a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3arivers 3asoybeans 3astream channels 3asustainable agriculture 3awater table 3awinter wheat 3aKansas 0aIrrigation 0aGroundwater 0aClimate 0aDSSAT 0aMODFLOW 0aSensitivity analysis1 aBailey, Ryan T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-14741 aKisekka, Isaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2460-77770 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Sept., v. 612 p.128161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1281613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245013700167500001400304520151000318592002801828650001001856650002701866650002501893650002901918650001501947650001601962650002001978650001301998650000902011650002002020650001402040650001102054650001602065650002402081650001302105651001002118651001602128651001002144653001302154653003402167653001202201700001702213700001802230700001602248700001202264700001602276700001602292700001402308700001202322773009802334856009002432852000902522655001202531IND60728324420221119213202.0210415e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072832442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ye10aIsolation, identification and vaccine development of serotype III Streptococcus parauberis in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in China  aNAL-light  aStreptococcus parauberis is an important disease in farming fish that could infect a series of fish causing streptococcosis, which leads to significant economic losses. In this research, we first characterized the streptococcosis caused by S. parauberis in farming fish in China. In 2019, bacteria were isolated from diseased turbot in 3 farms located in Penglai, Haiyang, and Laizhou city, Shandong Province, and identified as S. parauberis by 16S rRNA sequencing and Biolog GenIII. Capsule polysaccharide (cps) genes of isolates were obtained by whole genome sequencing and aligned with the cps cluster in GenBank. By cps genes analysis, the isolates were all classified as serotype III, which were different from the isolates that infect flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in Japan and South Korea, but the same with the isolates in Spain and the USA reported recently. Then the serotype III S. parauberis vaccines were developed for turbot. The specific antibody could be detected in the vaccinated fish, and the specific antibody from oil emulsified vaccine group fish was significantly higher than that of the water-based vaccine group from 14 days post vaccination. The relative percent of survival were 78.00% and 100% for water-based vaccine and Marcol 52 emulsified vaccine, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. parauberis infection in farming fish in China, and would provide important information for disease control and prevention for streptococcosis in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aStreptococcus parauberis 3aantibodies 3aaquaculture 3adisease control 3aflounder 3aoils 3apolysaccharides 3aserotypes 3aturbot 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 3aSpain 0aSerotype 0aTurbot (Scophthalmus maximus) 0aVaccine1 aLiu, Yaokuan1 aWang, Pengmei1 aMo, Zhaolan1 aLi, Jie1 aLiu, Shulan1 aLi, Guiyang1 aZhu, Ming1 aLi, Jie0 tAquaculture.g2021 May 30, v. 538 p.736525-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012200165300001600287520123700303592002801540650002001568650001601588650001901604650001501623650002001638650002601658650002101684650001001705653001001715653001501725653002401740653002701764653003101791700001801822700002101840700001801861773010801879856008301987852000902070655001202079IND60083626720221122034046.0190411e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008362672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoll, Xavier14aThe effects on cardio-respiratory and acid–base variables of a constant rate infusion of alfaxalone–HPCD in sheep  ap. 209-212.  aAlfaxalone in a 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) formulation is an intravenous (IV) hypnotic agent characterised by the stability of cardiorespiratory effects after a single-bolus administration. The objective of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular, respiratory, and acid–base effects of alfaxalone–HPCD administered during a continuous rate infusion in six Ripollesa sheep. After instrumentation, a 2mg/kg IV bolus of alfaxalone followed by a continuous infusion of 10mg/kg/h was administered to the sheep. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and arterial blood gases were recorded. Occasional side effects and time to standing were also noted.No significant changes were observed in arterial blood pressure, but during the infusion and the initial stages of recovery, a significant increase in heart rate occurred during the last 120min of the study. Significant respiratory depression was detected during the infusion period and the first 15min of recovery. This study showed that a constant rate infusion alfaxalone in un-premedicated sheep produced clinically acceptable haemodynamic results and a mild respiratory depression that may require intermittent positive pressure ventilation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablood gases 3ablood pressure 3aheart rate 3ainstrumentation 3aintravenous injection 3arespiratory rate 3asheep 0aSheep 0aAlfaxalone 0aSteroid anaesthesia 0aConstant rate infusion 0aCardio-respiratory effects1 aSantos, Laura1 aGarcía, Félix,1 aAndaluz, Anna0 tveterinary journal.g2013 May, v. 196, no. 2 p.209-212dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012600164300001800290520175400308592002802062650002602090650002102116650001702137650001502154650001202169650001602181650001302197650001302210650001102223650001602234651002702250700002202277700002102299773009302320856004802413852000902461655001202470IND4467455620221120071550.0121003e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446745562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-2012-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComeau, Luc A.10aWinter quiescence and spring awakening of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica at its northernmost distribution limit  ap. 2269-2279.  aTo test the hypothesis that oysters, Crassostrea virginica, from the northernmost part of the species range in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (48Â°N) open their valves at lower temperatures than those reported for more southern oysters, Hall element sensors were used to monitor their gaping behaviour. These observations were made in a flow-through system and the temperature, salinity and relative fluorescence of unfiltered seawater were monitored. Photoperiod was controlled (15Â h dark:9Â h light) and light levels were measured but not closely controlled. Gaping behaviour was followed from February to June 2010 (113Â days) and from April to May 2011 (34Â days) and was classified into three successive phases: quiescent, awakening and active. Although valves were either closed or slightly open during the quiescent phase (maximum gape angleÂ =Â 0.49Â°, SEÂ =Â 0.04), they abruptly opened to maximum angles of about 5.88Â° (SEÂ =Â 0.29) during the awakening phase. Moreover, there was noticeable synchrony amongst individuals, since approximately one-half of the monitored population awoke within a 6.6-h period in both study years. Correlative analyses identified temperature as a factor influencing valve movement, and oysters awakened when temperatures were 0.2â4.0Â Â°C (meanÂ =Â 2.2, SEÂ =Â 0.2). Oysters exerted their maximal gape angle as soon as temperatures reached 2.8â6.6Â Â°C (meanÂ =Â 4.8, SEÂ =Â 0.2). During the active phase, valves remained open 68.6Â % (2010) and 79.7Â % (2011) of the time. An unexpected result was the observation of a diurnal rhythm in valve openness whereby the openness was greatest near the end of the afternoon and least in the early morning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3acircadian rhythm 3afluorescence 3amonitoring 3aoysters 3aphotoperiod 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aspring 3atemperature 3aGulf of Saint Lawrence1 aMayrand, Ãlise1 aMallet, AndrÃ©0 tMarine biology.g2012 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.2269-2279dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2012-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007600161520186900237592002802106650002002134650001802154650000902172650001102181650000902192650002802201650001102229650001302240650001802253650001302271650001402284650001602298653001402314653001802328653000802346653003802354700001402392700001602406700001502422700001902437700001602456700001802472773012402490856008302614852000902697655001202706IND60734848720221116152500.0211206e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073484872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1051692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Li10aModeling on the pyrolysis of particles of low-rank coal and CaO mixture  aPyrolysis of low-rank coal at the presence of CaO can result in uniform mixture of residual char and CaO, which can further produce calcium carbide for providing alternative way of ethyne production. Large mixture (i.e. with the addition of CaO) coal particle at centimeter-scale is usually used in such industrial pyrolysis process, for which intraparticle phenomena and pyrolysis behaviors remain largely unknown. The pyrolysis process of a centimeter-scaled mixture coal particle in ellipsoidal shape was studied with a model coupling pyrolysis kinetics and intraparticle transport phenomena. The model was validated against experimental data from both the literature and the present experiments. It was demonstrated that the addition of CaO into the coal particle can promote coal pyrolysis. Quantitative results regarding the effect of particle properties show that smaller particle size can promote the whole pyrolysis process while larger porosity is favorable for the timely removal of volatile from the particle. As for the effect of operating conditions, higher operating temperature and higher purge rate of nitrogen can promote particle heating, and therefore beneficial for the pyrolysis process. Considering pyrolysis efficiency, energy consumption and process complexity, the mixture coal particle with the size of a = 40 mm, b = 29 mm and c = 20 mm in ellipsoidal shape and the porosity of 0.07 at the operating temperature of 923 K and nitrogen purge rate of 0.1 m/s was appropriate for the potential industrial pyrolysis process. The present simulation results on the effect of particle properties and operating conditions could help to provide a simple, quick method of selecting proper particle properties and operating conditions for the industrial application of low-rank coal through pyrolysis with the addition of CaO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbide 3acalcium oxide 3acoal 3aenergy 3aheat 3aindustrial applications 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aPyrolysis 0aCoal particle 0aCaO 0aIntraparticle transport phenomena1 aLan, Shi,1 aZhang, Jian1 aWu, Yingya1 aWang, Chengxiu1 aGao, Jinsen1 aLan, Xingying0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 June, v. 156 p.105169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1051693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004700099040001800146100002300164245012200187300001400309500000900323520149000332592002801822650002501850650001101875650001901886650001101905650002001916650001801936650001401954650001801968650002401986650002902010650000902039650001602048650000902064650002402073650002002097650001502117651001902132651001902151700001802170773020402188852000902392856009402401655001202495991587031040742620221119072229.0190912e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790318592DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600010017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarten, Charles T.12aA Multivariate Analysis of Factors Affecting Radiocesium Uptake by Sagittaria latifolia in Coastal Plain Environments  ap. 78-82.  aepub  aplants and soils were sampled at 11 sites on or near the Energy Research and Development Administration's Savannah River Plant near Aiken, South Carolina. Plants and soils were analyzed for radiocesium concentrations. Concentration ratios (CR) were calculated as a relative measure of availability. On the basis of eight sites, which were similar in soil properties, three principal components, extracted from a correlation matrix, explained 80.8% of the total variation in measurements of soil characteristics. Principal component I was directly associated with soil moisture, soil organic matter, extractable potassium, percent very fine sand, and inversely related to percent coarse soil. Component II was related to coarse soil and fine sandy soil. Component III was related to extractable soil potassium and extractable radiocesium. A multiple regression of log (CR) against the principal component scores demonstrated a decrease in the availability of radiocesium to with increasing soil moisture, organic matter, extractable potassium, and percent very fine sand and silt. Availability was greatest on coarse sandy soils. Maximum likelihood factor analysis across all eleven sites, based on a partial correlation matrix adjusted for differences among locations, indicated that, regardless of soil radiocesium concentrations, the availability of radiocesium was directly related to soil particle size (% weight) >0.5 mm and inversely related to particle size (% weight) <0.25 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSagittaria latifolia 3acesium 3acoastal plains 3aenergy 3afactor analysis 3aparticle size 3apotassium 3aradionuclides 3aregression analysis 3aresearch and development 3asand 3asandy soils 3asilt 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3asoil water 3aSavannah River 3aSouth Carolina1 aPaine, Donald0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1977 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.78-82dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600010017x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03688naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245007000208300001400278506007600292520184800368592002802216506003702244650001802281650002002299650001502319650001402334650002602348650002802374650002102402650001702423650001702440650001802457650001302475650001502488650001102503650001402514650003102528650001602559650001702575650001202592650001802604653000702622653000802629653000902637653000702646653000702653653001002660653000802670653000902678653001202687653001002699653000902709653001002718653001202728653001002740700001902750700001602769700001402785773010002799856008202899852000902981655001202990IND60547220320221207144325.0160903e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054722032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.07.0062doi7 aPMC42816122pmcid7 a255618882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Angelo, C.10aExperimental model for ELF-EMF exposure: Concern for human health  ap. 75-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLow frequency (LF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are abundantly present in modern society and in the last 20years the interest about the possible effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) EMFs on human health has increased progressively. Epidemiological studies, designed to verify whether EMF exposure may be a potential risk factor for health, have led to controversial results. The possible association between EMFs and an increased incidence of childhood leukemia, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases was not fully elucidated. On the other hand, EMFs are widely used, in neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, orthopedics and dermatology, both in diagnosis and in therapy.In vitro studies may help to evaluate the mechanism by which LF-EMFs affect biological systems.Invitro model of wound healing used keratinocytes (HaCaT), neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) as a model for analysis of differentiation, metabolism and functions related to neurodegenerative processes, and monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used as a model for inflammation and cytokines production, while leukemic cell line (K562) was used as a model for hematopoietic differentiation.MCP-1, a chemokine that regulates the migration and infiltration of memory T cells, natural killer (NK), monocytes and epithelial cells, has been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases.Since, varying the parameters of EMFs different effects may be observed, we have studied MCP-1 expression in HaCaT, SH-SY5Y, THP-1 and K562 exposed to a sinusoidal EMF at 50Hz frequency with a flux density of 1mT (rms).Our preliminary results showed that EMF-exposure differently modifies the expression of MCP-1 in different cell types. Thus, the MCP-1 expression needs to be better determined, with additional studies, with different parameters and times of exposure to ELF-EMF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3abrain neoplasms 3achemokines 3achildhood 3aelectromagnetic field 3aepidemiological studies 3aepithelial cells 3ahuman health 3ainflammation 3akeratinocytes 3aleukemia 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amonocytes 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aorthopedics 3arisk factors 3asociety 3atissue repair 0aAD 0aELF 0aEMFs 0aHD 0aLF 0aMCP-1 0aPMA 0aPEMF 0aELF-EMF 0aHaCaT 0aK562 0aMCP-1 0aSH-SY5Y 0aTHP-11 aCostantini, E.1 aKamal, M.A.1 aReale, M.0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2015 Jan., v. 22 p.75-84dElsevier B.V.x1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03972naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245011900197500002000316520199700336592002802333596008602361596008502447596008502532596008502617596008502702596008502787650002002872650002502892650001402917650001202931650001502943650002802958650002802986650001403014650002803028650001103056650002303067651001103090700006303101700006303164700006403227773012803291856007403419852000903493655001203502IND60781664520221119200102.0220630e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078166452DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.131292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStreit, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6709-264910aIntraspecific trait variation of grassland species in response to grazing depends on resource acquisition strategy  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTION: Grazing is an important disturbance for maintenance of structure and functioning of the plant communities in grassy ecosystems. Functional characteristics of plants, which are responsible for their response to grazing, vary at inter‐ and intraspecific levels. Here, we assessed: (1) the extent of intraspecific trait variation when compared to interspecific variability; and (2) how grazing regime affects intraspecific trait variation in leaf functional traits of species with different leaf economics strategies. LOCATION: A multisite grazing experiment in subtropical grasslands, southern Brazil. METHODS: For 30 dominant grassland plant species we measured functional traits related to resource acquisition strategy and grazing response (SLA, specific leaf area; LDMC, leaf dry matter content; LA, leaf area; and FT, leaf resistance to traction) under three grazing treatments (grazing exclusion, traditional, or deferred grazing) arranged in a randomized block design. We quantified the overall proportion of intra‐ and interspecific variation and, for each species, we tested for the grazing treatment effects on intraspecific trait variation through Bayesian analysis of variance. RESULTS: The overall contribution of intraspecific variation was up to 37% of the total variation. For most grass species, grazing exclusion led to lower values of SLA and higher values of LA, while no effect of grazing treatments was detected on intraspecific variation of LDMC and FT. Altogether, the effect of grazing management on intraspecific trait variation was more prevalent in species presenting a conservative strategy than in species with an acquisitive strategy. CONCLUSION: The expression of leaf traits is variable within species, especially for those species with a conservative strategy of resource acquisition. The extent of intraspecific trait variation in response to grazing depends on the considered traits and the resource acquisition strategy of the studied species.  aPublisher supplied data  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a150510/2021‐7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a307689/2014‐0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a310345/2018‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a403750/2012‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a558282/2009‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aBayesian theory 3aanalysis of variance 3aeconomics 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ainterspecific variation 3aintraspecific variation 3aleaf area 3aleaf dry matter content 3aleaves 3aspecific leaf area 3aBrazil1 aMenezes, Luciana S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2961-01901 aPillar, Valério D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6408-28911 aOverbeck, Gerhard E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8716-51360 tJournal of vegetation science.g2022 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.e13129-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.131293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01149naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007400160300001800234520024800252592002800500650002300528650001100551650001900562650000900581650001200590700002000602700001600622773012800638856007200766852000900838655001200847IND60657250120221121082207.0190816e20020531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065725012DNAL7 a10.1039/b202967g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajiwara, Takashi10aComplexed bridging ligand, {Cu(bptap)₂}, as a ferromagnetic coupler  ap. 1256-1257.  aA novel complexed bridging ligand [Cu(bptap)₂] which acts as a ferromagnetic coupler forms one dimensional chain consisting of tri-copper(ii) [Cu₂{Cu(bptap)₂}]⁴⁺ units in which adjoining copper(ii) ions are ferromagnetically coupled.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3aferromagnetism 3aions 3aligands1 aKamiyama, Asako1 aIto, Tasuku0 tChemical communications.g2002 May 31, , no. 12 p.1256-1257dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b202967g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015200172300001600324520158500340592002801925650001101953650002101964650001701985650001802002650001102020650001602031650001502047650002102062650001802083650001102101650001402112650001302126650002702139650001302166650001502179650001702194650001302211650001902224650001902243650002002262650002302282650002502305650001002330650002202340700002502362700001802387700001502405773009202420856008102512852000902593655001202602IND60124337320221120074618.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012433732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-014-0459-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Pérez, J. G.10a‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit and ‘Clemenules’ mandarin trees show different physiological and agronomic responses to irrigation with saline water  ap. 191-204.  aThe aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation in two citrus species, ‘Clemenules’ mandarin (CLM) and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit (SR), both grafted on ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin (a rootstock considered as a Cl⁻excluder, but a Na⁺non-excluder). The experiment was carried out over 3 years (2008–2010) in the IMIDA experimental orchard located at Torre Pacheco (Murcia), using 15-year-old trees irrigated with water of two salinity levels: 0 and 40 mM NaCl. Our data indicate different physiological and agronomic responses of the two citrus species (CLM and SR). The higher salt tolerance observed in CLM was due to the lower accumulation of Cl⁻in leaves and the greater reduction in vegetative growth with no effect on the quantity or quality of yield. Further, the quality of yield was improved due to the increase in total soluble solids and acidity, since the quality of the juice of CLM fruits is negatively affected in semi-arid regions by lower acidity levels. However, in SR, a high leaf Cl⁻concentration reduced both vegetative growth and yield and affected fruit quality negatively by increasing the titratable acidity. The increase in the acidity in SR fruits due to salinity translated into a delay of the ripening process, since more time was required to reach optimal levels for the fresh market. Thus, based on these results, we recommend the use of salt-tolerant species such as ‘Clemenules’ mandarin grafted on ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin for semi-arid regions, where the only irrigation water available is saline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aagronomic traits 3afresh market 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agrapefruits 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3ajuice quality 3aleaves 3amandarins 3aorchards 3aphysiological response 3aripening 3arootstocks 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asemiarid zones 3asodium chloride 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 3avegetative growth1 aGarcia-Sánchez, F.,1 aRobles, J.

Its efficient capture, especially from the mixtures with low SF₆ concentrations, is urgently needed while challenging. Herein, we use a calcium (Ca)-based metal–organic framework (MOF; SBMOF-1) with multiaromatic ring-functionalized channels to achieve a record selectivity as high as 727 for an industrially relevant SF₆/N₂ mixture (volume concentration of SF₆: 0.03%) at 298 K and 1 bar. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory calculations identified that SF₆ molecules were energy-favorably trapped in the functionalized MOF channels by the strong interactions between the channel walls and six fluorine atoms on SF₆. Excellent breakthrough results accompanied with good stability and regenerability recommend its promising application for practical SF₆ capture from low-concentration SF₆ mixtures, which also provides a new benchmark for SF₆/N₂ separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3achemistry 3acoordination polymers 3adensity functional theory 3afluorine 3agreenhouse effect 3aprocess design 3asulfur hexafluoride1 aChang, Miao1 aYan, Tongan1 aYing, Yunpan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2279-71911 aYang, Qingyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6961-28551 aLiu, Dahuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1005-31680 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 60, no. 16 p.5976-5983dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c006623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003000189245010800219300001600327506007600343520105900419592002801478506003701506650000801543650001001551650001001561650002501571650003401596650001301630650001501643650002501658650001001683650001001693650000901703650001201712650001201724650001401736650001901750650001701769650001201786653001001798653003401808653001901842653002101861773010201882856008201984852000902066655001202075IND60547220420221207144328.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054722042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.07.0072doi7 aPMC42504822pmcid7 a254733712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Hakeem, Malak Mohammed10aImplication of SH2B1 gene polymorphism studies in gestational diabetes mellitus in Saudi pregnant women  ap. 610-615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome-wide association studies have identified loci that are firmly associated with obesity. The Src-homology-2 B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) loci is abundantly expressed in the brain, liver, heart, muscle, and fat tissues. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing health concern that usually appears during the latter half of pregnancy, and it is characterized by carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity. The SH2B1 gene polymorphism has been linked with an increased risk of weight gain in several but not all population studies. This study aimed to investigate the genetic association of rs4788102 variants in the SH2B1 gene with GDM in Saudi pregnant women. Genomic DNA samples from 200 women with GDM and 300 women without GDM were genotyped using the TaqMan method. The distribution of the GG, GA, and AA genotypes was significantly different between GDM and non-GDM women (p<0.05). Thus, we identified rs4788102 variants as additional risk factors for GDM in Saudi women, and we suggest that these variants may have a prognostic value.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abrain 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agestational diabetes 3aheart 3aliver 3aloci 3amuscles 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3arisk factors 3atissues 0aSH2B1 0aGestational diabetes mellitus 0aPregnant women 0aSaudi population0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 21 p.610-615dElsevier B.V.x1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004700099040001800146100003900164245005900203300001600262500000900278520162800287592002801915650001601943650000801959650001701967650001301984650000901997650001302006650001602019650001102035650001902046700001802065700001902083700002002102773020602122852000902328856009402337655001202431991587030590742620221119072343.0191028e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790318652DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600010023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Anthony W.c(Reiki master),10aTrifluralin Volatilization Losses from a Soybean Field  ap. 105-110.  aepub  aWe measured trifluralin (α,α,α-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) concentrations in air and calculated volatilization losses from a 1.26-ha field during application at soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] planting and for 120 days after. Air samples, collected at three heights above the soil on 9 days during the season, showed that distinct trifluralin air concentration gradients existed throughout the study with concentrations highest closest to the ground. The highest concentration was measured during the application period (prior to soil herbicide incorporation) when a trifluralin level of 16,500 ng/m³ was recorded 20 cm above the ground. Generally, air concentrations were highest early in the season and decreased rapidly the first month. After herbicide incorporation, trifluralin air concentrations at 20 cm reached a maximum of 3,400 ng/m³ on day 2, and never exceeded 100 ng/m³ after day 35. Soil trifluralin levels at the 0.5-cm depth decreased from 1.65 to about 0.3 µg/g on day 35 and to about 0.1 µg/g after 120 days. Seasonal trifluralin volatilization loss, excluding the application period, was estimated to be 22.4% of that applied with vapor losses during application amounting to 3.5% of the applied herbicide. Thus, total seasonal aerial losses were 25.9% of the originally applied herbicide. Of the total aerial losses, 13 and 15% were lost during application and through day 1, respectively. About half was lost during the first 9 days, and 90% in 35 days. Combined seasonal losses by other pathways (excluding volatilization) were almost 2.5 times greater than aerial losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aair 3aair sampling 3aplanting 3asoil 3asoybeans 3atrifluralin 3avapors 3avolatilization1 aHarper, L.

In this study, the mechanisms of cyanobacterial bloom expansion were investigated by studying meteorological factors, water quality, algal biomass, and bloom area in Lake Taihu before and after typhoons (2007–2016). Our results showed that typhoon-induced sediment resuspension caused a short-term increase in nutrients, but nutrients returned to pre-typhoon levels after the typhoon passages. The short-term nutrient release during a typhoon did not result in an obvious increase in Microcystis cell density in two bays of Lake Taihu (Gonghu and Meiliang). Under strong winds, Microcystis aggregates were uniformly distributed in the water column downwind and then dispersed into different directions by wind-driven currents. In particular, Microcystis in the surface water were transported to the center of Lake Taihu. After a typhoon, dispersed Microcystis refloated and formed blooms. Thus, the bloom area was enlarged compared with before a typhoon. Several days after a typhoon, the bloom area gradually reduced as a result of a steady breeze on the horizontal accumulation of Microcystis.  aPublisher supplied data  aBE2018737cScience and Technology Project of Jiangsu Province  a2015B36214cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aMicrocystis 3aalgae 3abiomass 3alakes 3apollution 3aresearch 3asediments 3asurface water 3atyphoons 3awater quality 3aChina1 aZhu, Yuyang1 aZhang, Yong1 aChen, Xuqing1 aWang, Ruochen1 aZhu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2907-60200 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Dec., v. 27, no. 34 p.42294-42303dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09292-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007400151245012700225500001900352520145100371592002801822650001101850650001501861650001401876650001401890650002201904650002201926650002201948650002701970650001101997650001302008650002202021650001302043650001302056650001402069651001402083653002802097653002402125653002002149653001802169700001802187700002702205773010302232856008602335852000902421655001202430IND60734848920221116152539.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073484892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1059712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetino Mamet, Leandro Nicolás1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1165-591010aMultiple-scale processes shape the population genetics of Tehuelche scallop, Aequipecten tehuelchus, in Northern Patagonia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe population genetic structure and oceanographic boundaries to gene flow are relevant for understanding biological connectivity in marine environments. However, the relative contribution of historical (e.g., sea-level change) and recent (e.g., fisheries) processes in shaping current patterns of genetic structure and diversity are commonly unknown. This study focuses in the population genetics of the commercially harvested Tehuelche scallop, Aequipecten tehuelchus. This species presents three morphotypes; tehuelchus, madrynensis, and a non-common variant felipponei, which are meristically differentiated by the number of ribs. The genetic structure of the two main morphotypes (tehuelchus and madrynensis) was studied using microsatellite loci in seven locations of the Argentine coast. Historic demography analyses revealed a trend of population expansion after the last glacial period. Two genetic groups were detected that correspond to morphotypes distributed northward (tehuelchus) and southward (madrynensis) of the Peninsula Valdés tidal front. On the other hand, the lack of genetic differentiation among locations with fishery activity in the northern cluster indicates that the commercially exploited demes may belong to a single genetic stock. As this stock is distributed in waters under federal and provincial jurisdictions, the findings highlight the need to integrate management of the species across political boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3ademography 3afisheries 3agene flow 3agenetic resources 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amorphs 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3ascallops 3asea level 3aArgentina 0aBiological connectivity 0aPopulation genetics 0aMicrosatellites 0aMarine fronts1 aSoria, Gaspar1 aMunguía Vega, Adrián0 tFisheries research.g2021 Aug., v. 240 p.105971-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1059713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017900159300001600338500002000354520187700374592002802251596004602279650002402325650001402349650001102363650002802374650001002402650000902412650001602421650001702437650001602454650001202470650002002482650001502502650001002517650002602527650001302553650001302566650001402579650002402593650001202617700001902629700002502648700001702673700002002690700002202710700002202732700006402754773014002818856007402958852000903032655001203041IND60789233020221123020410.0220819e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078923302DNAL7 a10.1111/vco.128232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGedney, Allison10aEvaluation of the anti‐tumour activity of Coriolus versicolor polysaccharopeptide (I'm‐Yunity) alone or in combination with doxorubicin for canine splenic hemangiosarcoma  ap. 688-696.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCanine splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is an aggressive tumour of vascular endothelium that carries a grave prognosis following standard of care treatment with surgery and doxorubicin. A previous pilot study revealed potential anti‐tumour activity of I'm‐Yunity polysaccharopeptide (PSP) for canine HSA. The aim of this prospective study was to assess patient outcome when treated with PSP alone or in combination with doxorubicin post‐splenectomy compared to patients treated with surgery and doxorubicin that received a placebo in place of PSP. Dogs undergoing splenectomy for splenic HSA were eligible. Following splenectomy, owners were offered treatment with PSP alone or adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy (unblinded). Patients with owners that selected to proceed with doxorubicin chemotherapy were blindly randomized to receive placebo or PSP. Dogs were evaluated weekly for 15 weeks, then scheduled for monthly visits until death. One hundred and one dogs were included in the final analysis: 51 PSP alone, 25 doxorubicin/placebo, and 25 combination PSP/doxorubicin. On multivariate analysis, dogs treated with single agent PSP, female dogs, decreased haematocrit at diagnosis, and stage III disease were negatively significantly associated with outcome; however, an interaction between treatment group and sex was documented. Gender‐specific outcomes revealed no significant difference in survival between treatment groups for male dogs, but female dogs treated with PSP alone had significantly reduced survival compared to females receiving doxorubicin/placebo (HR 0.21; p = .004). Anaemia (HR 5.28; p < .001) and stage III disease (HR 2.9; p = .014) remained negatively associated with survival when controlling for sex and treatment group. The addition of PSP to doxorubicin post‐splenectomy did not improve survival in dogs with splenic HSA.  aPublisher supplied data  cIntegrated Chinese Medicine Holdings, Inc 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aadjuvants 3aanemia 3aantineoplastic activity 3adeath 3adogs 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aendothelium 3afemales 3ahemangiosarcoma 3ahematocrit 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aprognosis 3aprospective studies 3asurgery1 aSalah, Pascale1 aMahoney, Jennifer A.1 aKrick, Erika1 aMartins, Reenie1 aScavello, Heather1 aLenz, Jennifer A.1 aAtherton, Matthew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9830-31510 tVeterinary and comparative oncology.g2022 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.688-696dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:J000000162x1476-58107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vco.128233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01288naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245007400156300001800230520020800248592002800456650002000484650002300504650001700527650002100544650002100565650002100586650000900607700001700616700001300633700001300646700001400659700001500673700001600688773012900704856007200833852000900905655001200914IND60657250320221121042254.0190816e20020619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065725032DNAL7 a10.1039/b202976f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Pengju10aNovel zinc fluorescent probe bearing dansyl and aminoquinoline groups  ap. 1424-1425.  aA novel fluorescent chemosensor (L) demonstrates a remarkable selectivity and sensitivity for zinc(ii) ion as evidenced from the solution characterisations and in vitro experiments using Hela cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminoquinolines 3achemical reactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3azinc1 aChen, Lizhen1 aLin, Jun1 aLiu, Qin1 aDing, Jun1 aGao, Xiang1 aGuo, Zijian0 tChemical communications.g2002 June 19, , no. 13 p.1424-1425dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b202976f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245009200159300001800251500001900269520099500288592002801283650001401311650001301325650001901338650001301357650001401370700001501384700001701399700001801416700005801434773017101492856008001663852000901743655001201752IND60735867120221119105355.0210428e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073586712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c008002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Xu10aCFD Simulation of Internal Flow and Mixing within Droplets in a T-Junction Microchannel  ap. 6038-6047.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work performed a three-dimensional numerical investigation on the effect of the viscosity ratio on the circulation topology and mixing inside droplets in a T-junction microchannel using the volume-of-fluid method. The results suggest that the recirculation zone shrinks at both ends of the droplet with increasing viscosity ratios, whereas it expands in the droplet’s main body. A modified non-dimensional circulation time was defined by considering the local circulation, which can better capture the influence of the viscosity ratio on the mixing intensity. The results show that the mixing intensity decreases with higher viscosity ratios, especially at the front end of the droplet. The mixing inside the droplets is limited mainly due to the isolation of the symmetrical recirculation vortices. Accordingly, an improvement to the T-junction was proposed to break the balance of the flow symmetry at the droplet formation stage, thus significantly enhancing the mixing intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adroplets 3aprocess design 3atopology 3aviscosity1 aXu, Feishi1 aYao, Chaoqun1 aLiu, Tingting1 aChen, Guangwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5290-79210 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 60, no. 16 p.6038-6047dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c008003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245015100130300001600281500001400297520144200311592002801753650002801781650001701809650001401826650001101840650002101851650002601872650001101898650001301909650001001922650002501932650001701957650002101974650001601995650001902011651002102030653002002051653001702071653001302088653002902101700001702130773013802147852000902285655001202294IND60723738120221120182624.0210117e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072373812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Rashmi10aComparative performance of Indian and Japanese barnyard millet cultivars under varied fertility conditions for dual use in Indian Central Himalaya  ap. 175-178.  aNAL-light  aField experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of four barnyard millet genotypes belonging to two different species viz. VL 207, VL 172 (Echinochloa frumentacea) and PRB 401, PRJ 1 (E. utilis) under four different soil fertility conditions (Absolute control, 50% of recommended dose of fertilizer, 75% of RDF and 100% of RDF) under mid Himalayan conditions (1850 m amsl) with a view to identify most suitable variety for dual purpose use. The results showed that there was gradual increase in plant height with increase in nitrogen fertilizer dose. Also, significant differences (P<0.05) were observed among the cultivars for total grain and fodder (kg/ha) yield. Genotype PRJ 1 had the highest grain and fodder yield (2143 and 6427 kg/ha, respectively) while the lowest was observed for VL 127 (1677 and 5182 kg/ha, respectively). PRJ 1also had the highest mean values of 1000- seed weight (4.8 g). The result showed that there were significant differences among the genotypes in response to fertility conditions and dual purpose cultivar PRJ 1 performed better even at low fertility conditions than other cultivars evaluated. The study concluded that genotypes PRJ 1 and PRB 401 belonging to Japanese barnyard millet had high potential as compared to Indian barnyard millet genotypes (VL 207 and VL 172) and can be recommended for cultivation in Uttarakhand hills as dual purpose crop for nutritional and fodder security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa frumentacea 3aagroforestry 3acultivars 3adosage 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3agenotype 3ahills 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant height 3arange management 3aseed weight 3asoil fertility 3aHimalayan region 0aBarnyard millet 0aDual purpose 0aHimalaya 0aJapanese barnyard millet1 aYadav, V.

The objective of this research was to study the efficiency of cultivating oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) on date palm wastes mixed with other agricultural wastes available in KSA. Four agricultural wastes were mixed with date palm leaves at different ratios, with two supplements and three spawn rates were used. Wheat straw mixed with date palm at ratio of 25 (date palm): 75 (agro-waste) showed the best results in most of the parameters measured. Corn meal was superior over wheat bran as a supplement in all treatments. Parameter values increased with the increase of the spawn rate of P. ostreatus. Treatments with date palm leave wastes contained higher carbohydrates and fibers. No significant differences were found among the fruiting bodies produced on the different agro-wastes studied for the different proximates analyzed. Analyses of metal concentration showed that potassium was the highest in all the treatments tested followed by Na, Mg, Ca, and Zn. This is the first study that reported the success of growing oyster mushroom on date palm leaf wastes mixed with other agro-wastes obtainable in KSA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aagricultural wastes 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acorn meal 3afruiting bodies 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3asodium 3awheat bran 3awheat straw 3azinc 3aSaudi Arabia 0aOyster mushroom 0aDate palm 0aEarliness 0aProximate analysis 0aAgro wastes 0aSaudi Arabia1 aBouqellah, Nahla A.1 aAl Kaff, Nadia S.0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 21 p.616-625dElsevier B.V.x1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2014.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012700164300001600291520163300307592002801940650001701968650002501985650002002010650001002030650001602040650001502056650002002071650001402091650002302105650000902128650002002137650001302157650001002170650001402180650001602194650002202210650001602232653002702248653001402275653003102289653001702320653001602337700002202353700001902375700001702394773010802411856008302519852000902602655001202611IND60083627120221121231605.0190411e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008362712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, C.M.10aBlue light from light-emitting diodes directed at a single eye elicits a dose-dependent suppression of melatonin in horses  ap. 231-235.  aThe production of melatonin during night-time hours decodes day length for seasonally breeding animals.

The light source was a light-emitting diode (LED; 468nm) directed at either a single eye or both eyes. All treatments, except the sample collected after 1h exposure to light, occurred during the dark phase of the 24h cycle. Serum melatonin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that there was no difference between the level of melatonin inhibition achieved when light was administered to one or two eyes (P=0.7028). One-way ANOVA of melatonin levels at light intensities of 10, 50 and 100 lux were significantly different to dark (P<0.05) and not different to light (P>0.05) intensities. There was no difference between melatonin levels at 3 lux (P>0.05) and dark intensities. The threshold level of low wavelength light required to inhibit melatonin production in the horse lies between 3 and 10 lux. Melatonin inhibition can be achieved by exposing a single eye to low wavelength blue light. This is a novel finding with important implications for management of artificial lighting regimens in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimal breeding 3abarns 3ablood serum 3ablue light 3abreeding season 3acatheters 3across-over studies 3aeyes 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amares 3amelatonin 3aphotoperiod 3aradioimmunoassays 3awavelengths 0aHorse (Equus caballus) 0aMelatonin 0aLight-emitting diode (LED) 0aReproduction 0aSeasonality1 aPrendergast, R.L.1 aSheridan, J.T.1 aMurphy, B.A.0 tveterinary journal.g2013 May, v. 196, no. 2 p.231-235dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011200170300001300282520070700295592002801002650001201030650001601042650001701058650000901075650001301084650001401097650001101111650001501122653000901137653002801146653000801174653003401182653002301216653001801239700001901257700002601276700002701302700001901329700001901348773009901367856008201466852000901548655001201557IND60599129120221118055158.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059912912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoronat, Mercedes10aPartially oxidized gold nanoparticles: A catalytic base-free system for the aerobic homocoupling of alkynes  ap. 6-14.  aThe mechanism of alkyne homocoupling over gold nanoparticles and clusters, isolated and supported on CeO2, has been theoretically investigated by means of periodic DFT calculations. The theoretical study indicates that O2 dissociation on gold generates basic O atoms able to abstract the proton of the alkyne, and cationic Auᵟ⁺ and Au⁺ species that decrease the activation barrier for the CC bond forming step. Kinetic results show that the base-free homocoupling of alkynes is effectively catalyzed by gold nanoparticles supported on different solids, and confirm the theoretical prediction that the dissociation of oxygen on the gold nanoparticle is the controlling step of the global reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aceric oxide 3adissociation 3agold 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprediction 0aGold 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aDFT 0aOxidative coupling of alkynes 0aReaction mechanism 0aCH activation1 aLaursen, Siris1 aLeyva-Pérez, Antonio1 aOliver-Meseguer, Judit1 aCombita, Diego1 aCorma, Avelino0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 June, v. 315 p.6-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009800188300001600286500001500302520146200317592002801779650000901807650000901816650001701825650001301842650002601855650001601881650002801897650001201925650004001937650003101977650000902008650003702017650003102054650004402085650003802129650005302167650005402220650002202274651001902296653002502315700001702340773011702357856005502474852000902529655001202538IND4471086220221120152240.0120927e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447108622DNAL7 a228890462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01262.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteen, S.

METHODS: Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in‐agar inhibition test. RESULTS: Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two ‐preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi‐antimicrobial‐resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aears 3adogs 3aotitis media 3acleaners 3aanti-infective agents 3aPseudomonas 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aDogs 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Testsxveterinary 2aOtitisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aPseudomonasxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aTreatment Outcome 3aUnited Kingdom 0aantimicrobial agents1 aPaterson, S.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2012 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.599-603dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01262.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245013200209300001500341520182400356592002802180653001402208653002602222653001302248653002302261653002302284653001502307700002202322700001602344700002202360700001602382700001802398700002102416700002102437700002402458773013202482856008202614852000902696655001202705IND60557825120221119204112.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055782512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.reth.2016.09.0032doi7 aPMC65818362pmcid7 a312455072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshihara, Kenji10aRecognition of, interest in, and understanding of induced pluripotent stem cells and regenerative medicine in Japanese students  ap. 96-106.  aWe studied the recognition of, interest in, and understanding of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and regenerative medicine in a total of 2659 junior high school, senior high school, and university students. The number of valid responses received was 2396 (90.1%). We report the following seven observations [1]. More than 80% of students reported recognition of iPS cells, regenerative medicine, and Professor Shinya Yamanaka, and a similar number were interested in and supportive of regenerative medicine [2]. Regenerative medicine was viewed as a medical treatment option. However, females were more cautious regarding use of regenerative medicine as a treatment compared with males [3]. Approximately 90% of students were interested in the latest medical care. Among the new treatment methods, they more frequently selected those that they were more familiar with and perceived less invasive to be ideal [4]. Regarding organ or tissue donation in regenerative medicine, students focused more on the characteristics of the donors [5]. Approximately 90% were supportive of storing their own cells. However, approximately 50% of students supported storing iPS cells for use in regenerative medicine [6]. Most students were anxious regarding the side effects, safety, and treatment costs of regenerative medicine, but supported the need of education regarding regenerative medicine [7]. More than 70% of students thought that education of regenerative medicine was necessary for the public. These findings suggest the importance of social approach, in addition to medical approach such as research and development, to improve QOL in community by developing the public understanding of regenerative medicine through science communication and school education, for the establishment of systems to promote this field.  aPublisher supplied data 0aiPS cells 0aRegenerative medicine 0aStudents 0aJunior high school 0aSenior high school 0aUniversity1 aIchinomiya, Asuka1 aInami, Mami1 aHashimoto, Tomomi1 aYuzawa, Rie1 aIshizu, Miari1 aHirohara, Toshie1 aYashiro, Yoshimi1 aTakizawa, Toshiyuki0 tRegenerative Therapy.g2016 Dec., v. 5 p.96-106dElsevier B.V.aThe Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicinex2352-32047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reth.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148242008700166245008700253300001400340520102200354592002801376650001401404650001601418650001101434650001401445650001701459650002501476650001001501650000901511650001001520650001701530650001001547650001701557650000901574650001401583650003101597650002001628650001401648773015101662856008401813852000901897655001201906IND4504656120150624000000.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND450465612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anicom.2012.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSéguéla, J.10aPseudocranial cava syndrome associated with a thoracic mesothelioma in a greyhound10aPseudocranial cava syndrome associated with a thoracic mesothelioma in a greyhound  ap. 49-55.  aAn 11-years-old male, Sloughi greyhound was presented to the clinic with a 1-month history of tachypnea and cough and a swelling of the neck for one day. On physical examination, the breathing was disharmonious, heart sounds were muffled and oedema of the neck was noted. The thoracic exploration by x-ray, by ultrasonography and by thoracotomy ensured, after biopsy, to conclude a diagnosis of scattered pleural mesothelioma; this tumour was responsible for pleural effusion and for “pseudocranial vena cava syndrome”. Palliative treatment was performed but the dog was euthanatized two months later. The case report shows an original clinical presentation of a cranial vena cava syndrome, which is often encountered in clinics but which has to focus on a thoracic disease; moreover, it shows that make a diagnosis of mesothelioma is difficult in the dog and the need for it to resort to immunohistochemic markers; it focuses on the low efficiency of available treatment and the guarded prognosis of this tumour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGreyhound 3aX-radiation 3abiopsy 3abreathing 3acase studies 3aclinical examination 3acough 3adogs 3aedema 3aheart sounds 3amales 3amesothelioma 3aneck 3aprognosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aultrasonography 3avena cava0 tPratique médicale & chirurgicale de l'animal de compagnie.g2012 , v. 47, no. 2 p.49-55dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:J000000146x0758-18827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anicom.2012.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166300001800277520112500295592002801420650002401448650001201472650002101484650001301505650001801518650001301536650001101549650003301560700002001593700002101613700002301634773010501657856008601762852000901848655001201857IND60578221020221121181623.0170812e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b010742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Jingyi10aSelf-Assembly of Polystyrene-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) Micelles: From Solutions to Silica Particles Surfaces  ap. 5978-5984.  aThe structural understanding of self-assembled nanomaterial in solutions and immobilized on material surfaces has the potential to unlock some of the key questions in self-assembly processes such as the influence of surface forces on the nanostructure of polymer micelles. Here, we demonstrate the design and characterization of charged polymer micelles and their interaction with oppositely charged silica particle surfaces. Small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy analysis revealed information on the size, shape, and morphology of the micelles in solution and bound to the surface. Electron density distributions calculated from the scattering data established that the surface-bound micelles strongly interact with the silica surface. The surface-induced dispersion and coulomb forces and the modified conformational entropy of polymer chains led to morphological changes in the polymer aggregates. This has important implications for the design of nanostructured surfaces in biomedical or industrial applications for instance as controlled release or bioresponsive materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3aentropy 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3ananomaterials 3apolymers 3asilica 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aZhang, Haijiang1 aGaan, Sabyasachi1 aSalentinig, Stefan0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 49, no. 16 p.5978-5984dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b010743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168520083500312592002801147650001401175650001201189650001301201650002101214650001101235650001201246650002101258650001101279650001601290650001601306650001601322700001301338700001401351700001601365700001901381700001501400700001801415773011101433856008501544852000901629655001201638IND60685209720221119092452.0200330e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068520972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1063872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bingyang10aUltrasound acoustic cavitation enhances depolymerization of organosolv lignin to phenolic monomers and low molecular weight lignin bio-oils  aLignin-first is a strategy for producing value-added phenolics and high-quality bio-oils from lignin.

They can take up and release hydrogen in catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. The thermophysical properties (heat capacity, density, viscosity, surface tension, and refractive index) of carbazole and N-ethylcarbazole, as well as those of their hydrogenated derivatives, were measured. Furthermore, thermochemical properties (enthalpy of vaporization, sublimation, and fusion) were derived from experiments. Molar enthalpies of formation of the gaseous carbazole derivatives were calculated and validated with high-level quantum chemical calculations. Molar enthalpies of formation data in the liquid phase were derived by combining the high-level quantum chemistry values of the gas-phase enthalpies of formation with experimentally determined enthalpies of vaporization. Thermodynamic analysis of the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions of the carbazole derivatives was performed. This analysis, among others, revealed a rather weak dependence of thermodynamic hydrogen release characteristics on the alkyl chain length. The thermophysical properties of the derivatives show a strong dependence on the degree of hydrogenation. Therefore, the state of hydrogenation should always be considered when dealing with substance properties of LOHCs.

In this study, for ordinary concrete and for fly ash concrete with 15%, 30% and 45% fly ash replacement ratios by mass, the depth of fully carbonated zone and the pH value were measured according to a rapid carbonation test of concrete under artificial climatic conditions. By considering pozzolanic reactions of fly ash and carbonation reactions in concrete, the effects of fly ash content and micro-environmental climates (temperature and relative humidity) were analyzed in terms of the depth of fully carbonated zone and the thickness of partially carbonated zone. Results show that the depth of carbonation increased gradually with the age of carbonation but at a decreasing carbonation rate. With an increase in fly ash replacement, the depth of fully carbonated zone and the thickness of partially carbonated zone both increased. Especially for fly ash concrete incorporating 45% fly ash (FA45), the depth of fully carbonated zone and the thickness of partially carbonated zone were approximately two to three times of those of the control mixture (FA0). Micro-environment temperature had little effect on the thickness of partially carbonated zone, however, the higher the micro-environment temperature, the deeper was the fully carbonated zone. The depth of fully carbonated zone and the thickness of partially carbonated zone decreased with an increase in the relative humidity of the micro-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3acarbonation 3aclimatic factors 3aconcrete 3acorrosion 3afly ash 3apH 3arelative humidity 3asteel 3atemperature 0aCarbonation depth 0aFly ash concrete 0apH value 0aTemperature 0aRelative humidity1 aWang, Wei1 aLi, Qing-tao1 aHao, Ming1 aXu, Yuan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.309-317dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013600169300001600305500001500321520175500336592002802091650001102119650001302130650002002143650001402163650001402177650001202191650003402203650002702237650001902264650002002283650001402303650002802317651001102345653003202356653000902388653001302397653002002410653003202430653001802462653001402480700002002494700002502514773011502539856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60543861720221119131900.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernick, Adam10aMetadata beyond the sequence enables the phylodynamic inference of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1a isolates from Western Canada  ap. 367-374.  a2019-12-06  aBovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has been recognized as an important pathogen of livestock in Canada. The high mutation rate of this virus leads to a great degree of diversity between isolates resulting in the ability to infer precise evolutionary relationships. Many studies have attempted to elucidate the regional and global evolution of BVDV, but so far few have applied Bayesian methods to this end. We aimed to describe the molecular epidemiology and phylodynamics of BVDV 1a isolates in Western Canada using 5′UTR and E1–E2 sequence data, collection dates and locations. Sequences were obtained from isolates submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Saskatoon, Canada. Path sampling and stepping stone model testing were employed to identify the model that best fit the data. We found that these Western Canadian isolates share a most recent common ancestor dated near 1909. Furthermore, the E1–E2 region shows a median substitution rate about ten times greater than the 5′UTR. It was also noted that caution should be exercised when inferring phylogenetic relationships using the 5′UTR alone, as it becomes difficult to resolve relationships within major clades. Phylogeographic and population size fluctuation estimates require more thorough sampling than was performed here to be reliable. We have found that there are significant gains to be made by utilizing a Bayesian analysis and by incorporating additional types of data beyond the sequence. These include the estimation of most common recent ancestor dates and the precise inference of transmission routes. Future work will expand upon these findings by more thoroughly sampling BVDV isolates spatially and temporally and further refining the Bayesian model employed here.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3amutation 3aBayesian theory 3aphylogeny 3alivestock 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeography 3apopulation size 3apathogens 3a5' untranslated regions 3aCanada 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aBVDV 0aBayesian 0aModel selection 0aMost common recent ancestor 0aPhylodynamics 0aEvolution1 aGodson, Dale L.1 aVan der Meer, Frank,0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.367-374dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011000176300001500286520130800301592002801609650002601637650001401663650001101677650001401688650002601702650001701728650001201745653003601757653002001793653002601813653003301839653002101872700001801893773011201911856008602023852000902109655001202118IND60591209120221119100823.0210603e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059120912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Margarida10aMapping of the literature on social responsibility in the mining industry: A systematic literature review  ap. 88-101.  aThe discussion in recent years about the sustainability of the mining industry has emphasized its commitment to social responsibility as an emerging topic. In this context, this article aims to develop a mapping of the literature on social responsibility in the mining industry. In accordance, a systematic literature review approach was adopted and, grounded on a rigorous screening processes, 72 significant papers were selected for analysis from the ISI Web of Knowledge database. The paper provides a bibliometric analysis regarding this specific field and, based on a content analysis approach, highlights a growing interest by the academic community and identifies two key research streams: i) Relationships with local communities, and ii) CSR reporting. Cluster 1 shows that relationships with stakeholders are important to mining companies in obtaining relevant social performance, and in acquiring local legitimacy from surrounding communities; cluster 2 highlights the importance of the elaboration, dissemination and quality of social reports, particularly concerning credibility. The review also points to shortcomings identified in literature, which correspond to potential significant opportunities for future research, either quantitative, qualitative, action research or mixed in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3adatabases 3amining 3ascreening 3asocial responsibility 3astakeholders 3astreams 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aMining industry 0aBibliometric analysis 0aSystematic literature review 0aContent analysis1 aMendes, Luís0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.88-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017800173520109000351592002801441650001901469650002201488650002001510650001301530650001801543650002101561650001501582650002201597650002201619650001601641653001301657653002101670653002101691653001801712653003001730700002401760773011101784856008501895852000901980655001201989IND60685209920221119090707.0200330e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068520992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1063902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmirkhosrow, Mahsa10aSimulation model evaluation of desorber column in CO2 capture process by MEA scrubbing: A rigorous rate-based model for kinetic model and mass transfer correlations analysis  aA rate-based model of desorber column in carbon dioxide capture process by MEA solution was performed using Aspen Plus software.

Vitamin A deficiency is one of the health problems associated with micronutrient deficiency. It is caused by insufficient intake of food rich in vitamin A among vulnerable groups leading to impaired growth, reduced life span, and economic losses among resource-poor families. Strategies such as vitamin A supplementation, food fortification, and diet diversification have been adapted to combat vitamin A deficiency (VAD). However, these approaches have benefited urban dwellers leaving rural residents with deficiency sufferings, as they lack access to these alternatives. Biofortification of maize by breeding with higher provitamin A content holds immense promise as a cost-effective and sustainable approach in alleviating VAD in sub-Saharan African maize consumers. Biofortified maize has a greater potential to alleviate vitamin A deficiency in these countries. Despite the existence of biofortification programs in Africa, there is little documentation on what has been conducted, challenges, and future of maize biofortification programs in Africa; this limits any strategic planning required to produce maize varieties rich in micronutrients, including vitamin A. Therefore, the present study is a detailed systematic review to highlight the past, present, and future success of provitamin A maize biofortification and its adoption challenges in sub-Sahara Africa as a strategy for combating vitamin A deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofortification 3acarotenes 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3afood fortification 3ahunger 3alongevity 3asystematic review 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aBiofortification 0aVitamin A deficiency 0aMaize 0aProvitamin A 0aHidden hunger 0aMicronutrients1 aMushongi, Arnold A.1 aVenkataramana, Pavithravani B.1 aMbega, Ernest R.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 June 01, v. 299 p.111029-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1110293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007300175300001400248520117200262592002801434650001901462650001301481650001901494650001101513650002101524650002401545650001201569653001701581653002401598653001301622653001701635653001301652653001801665700002101683700002001704700001901724700001901743773013201762856008601894852000901980655001201989IND60552791020221122230929.0161021e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055279102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSturzenegger, P.N.10aParticle-stabilized gel-core microcapsules: Synthesis and properties  ap. 44-50.  aWe propose a new and versatile synthesis route for the formation of particle-stabilized gel-core microcapsules. With this route, microcapsules can be produced in a large size range of a few to hundreds of micrometres. Due to the high mechanical stability developed upon gelation, the capsules can be harvested as dry powders. Implementing in-situ hydrophobization to modify the wetting properties of particles allows preparing capsule shells from almost any kind of particulate materials. In the present work, we demonstrate the formation of microcapsules with shells from 60nm gamma alumina and 200nm alpha alumina particles. These particle shells are combined with sodium acrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) based gel-cores. Shape, gel-core microstructure, and swelling of the capsules in deionized water are characterized. Modelling the release of a low molecular weight dye from the capsules reveals Fickian kinetics for 16 and polymer relaxation dominated kinetics for 280μm sized capsules, respectively. Given the flexibility in materials selection, our processing route could lead to the design of new microcapsule systems for sensing and release applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3agelation 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene glycol 3apowders 0aMicrocapsule 0aMechanically stable 0aGel-core 0aColloidosome 0aEmulsion 0aRelease model1 aGonzenbach, U.T.1 aKoltzenburg, S.1 aMartynczuk, J.1 aGauckler, L.J.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Apr. 05, v. 447 p.44-50dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245017800172300001800350520175800368592002802126596006702154650002102221650001302242650001602255650002402271650001602295650001302311650000902324650001502333650000902348650001202357650001802369650001302387650001302400650001402413650001302427650001202440650001302452650002502465650002102490700006702511700006002578700006402638700006102702773012502763856008302888852000902971655001202980IND60742399720221116205714.0220126e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074239972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02421-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeilamy Pour, Hamed10aSynergistic Effects of Selenium and Magnesium Nanoparticles on Growth, Digestive Enzymes, Some Serum Biochemical Parameters and Immunity of Asian Sea Bass (Lates calcarifer)  ap. 3102-3111.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of selenium and magnesium nanoparticles and their combination on growth, serum biochemical and immune parameters, serum hepatic enzymes, and digestive enzymes in Asian Sea bass (Lates calcarifer), with an average weight of 32.78 ± 1.16 g for 42 days.

Existing speckle noise removal techniques have drawbacks such as lose of edge information, texture information and inability to remove low frequency noise. To overcome these issues, a new discrete shearlet transform (DST) with nonlinear diffusion is proposed in this paper. DST comprises of localization, directionality and multiscale features which are crucial for ultrasound despeckling. Adaptive thresholding and nonlinear diffusion are combined with DST to remove both high frequency and low frequency noises so that the superior filtering performance can be achieved. The comparison performance of the proposed method with other despeckling techniques indicates the superiority of this technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aimage analysis 3atexture 3aultrasonography0 tNational Academy science letters.g2018 Apr., v. 41, no. 2 p.91-95dSpringer IndiawJournal:21643x0250-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-018-0620-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013600167300001600303520120800319592002801527650001601555650002201571650002701593650000901620650001301629650001401642650001301656650001001669650001201679650003201691650001201723650001701735653001401752653002001766653002301786653002001809653002201829700002201851700002101873700002201894773008101916856008101997852000902078655001202087IND60627965520221116163840.0190128s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062796552DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000033812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Shaer, Layla14aThe fish that cried wolf: the role of parental care in novel predator recognition in juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania siquia)  ap. 963-980.  aThis study tested if convict cichlids (Amatitlania siquia) with prior predator experience could socially transfer their predator knowledge to their offspring. Prior to reproduction, pairs were assigned to either an experimental or control associative learning treatment, and given novel predator odour from a wolf cichlid (Parachromis dovii) paired with either alarm cue or water respectively. We hypothesized that upon re-exposure to the odour, experimental pairs would socially transfer their acquired predator knowledge to their naïve offspring, which in turn would exhibit antipredator behaviour. While fry from both treatment groups did not show a difference in shoal formation, there is some evidence to suggest a trend in the experimental group regarding parental ability to transfer information to offspring and influence shoal behaviour. When tested individually, experimental fry decreased their activity more than control fry in the presence of the predator odour. This study provides evidence of a unique form of predator learning between parents and offspring, suggesting that biparental care may also serve to provide offspring with information about the habitat into which they are born.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmatitlania 3aParachromis dovii 3aantipredatory behavior 3afish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alearning 3aodors 3aparents 3apredator-prey relationships 3aprogeny 3areproduction 0aalarm cue 0abiparental care 0aAmatitlania siquia 0asocial learning 0apredator learning1 aPaciorek, Timothy1 aCarroll, Zachary1 aItzkowitz, Murray0 tBehaviour.g, v. 153, no. 8 p.963-980dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000033813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017100207300001800378500001100396520161100407592002802018596005902046650002302105650001102128650002002139650003102159650001802190650001102208650001302219650000902232650002002241650002202261650001002283651001002293651000902303651001302312651001302325700002302338700002602361700001802387700002502405700001802430773012502448856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60742399820221116205955.0220126e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074239982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02419-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhri, Yadolah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3579-764110aConcentration of Potentially Harmful Elements (PHEs) in Trout Fillet (Rainbow and Brown) Fish: a Global Systematic Review and Meta-analysis and Health Risk Assessment  ap. 3089-3101.  aReview  aIn this work, articles regarding the concentration on potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in fillet trout (rainbow and brown) fishes were retrieved from Cochrane, Scopus, and PubMed databases between 1 January 1983 and 30 April 2020. The pooled concentration of PHEs in fillet trout fishes was meta-analyzed using a random-effect model (REM) and following the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The meta-analysis of 42 articles (43 data report) revealed that a sort of PHEs in fillet trout was 19,996.64 μg/kg ww for Fe; 1834.75 μg/kg ww for Co; 772.21 μg/kg ww for Cu; 335.78 μg/kg ww for Ni; 290.46 μg/kg ww for Se; 226.20for Cr; 178.11 μg/kg ww for Pb; 77.40 μg/kg ww for Hg; 19.40 μg/kg ww for Cd; and 3.66 μg/kg ww for inorganic As. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment indicated that the lowest and highest hazard index (HI) in the adults was Pakistan (0.0012) and Turkey (0.2388), respectively, and in children was Pakistan (0.0057) and Turkey (1.114), respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk was acceptable for adult consumers in all countries (HI > 1 value) but non-carcinogenic risk for children was not acceptable in Turkey. The sort of countries based on carcinogenic risk in the adults due to inorganic As was China (1.44E−06) > Iran (9.14E−08) > Turkey (4.45E−08) > Portugal (9.04E−10). The carcinogenic risk was threshold for adult consumers in China (CR < 10–⁶). Consumption of fillet trout (rainbow and brown) content of PHEs in many countries cannot endanger the health of consumers.  aPublisher supplied data  a#21152cShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadults 3acarcinogenicity 3ahealth effects assessments 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asystematic review 3atrout 3aChina 3aIran 3aPakistan 3aPortugal1 aNematollahi, Amene1 aAbdi-Moghadam, Zohreh1 aDaraei, Hasti1 aGhasemi, Seyed Mehdi1 aThai, Van Nam0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Aug., v. 199, no. 8 p.3089-3101dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02419-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169300001400293520126800307592002801575650001501603650001801618650002501636650001001661650001501671650002001686650001101706650001801717650002401735650001601759650002001775653001501795653002201810653002901832653002201861653003701883653002501920700001401945700002201959773011101981856008602092852000902178655001202187IND60591209520221119100852.0210603e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059120952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwan, Tsz Him10aTechno-economic analysis of a food waste valorisation process for lactic acid, lactide and poly(lactic acid) production  ap. 72-87.  aA sustainable food waste valorisation process was proposed by designing a plant with a capacity of 10 metric tons (MT) hour⁻¹ of food waste powder with a 20-year lifetime. Three scenarios were proposed with different products: Scenario I) lactic acid, Scenario II) lactide, Scenario, and III) poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Mass balance showed conversion yields of 3.1 MT of 80% lactic acid, 1.7 MT of lactide, and 1.3 MT of poly(lactic acid) from 10 MT of food waste powder. All scenarios were economically feasible, but Scenario I had the highest annual net profits (US$ 22,184,169), internal rate of return (31.1%), net present value (US$234,803,060) and the shortest payback period (5.1 years) at a discount rate of 5%. The minimum selling prices of lactic acid, lactide and poly(lactic acid) were US$943 MT⁻¹, US$2073 MT⁻¹ and US$3330 MT⁻¹, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the prices of lactic acid, lactide and poly(lactic acid) were the largest determinants of the profitability in the plant while the sale of by-products (animal feed) was also critical to the plant's economics. This work has cast insights on the techno-economic performance of a sustainable food waste treatment under a decentralised approach in urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic feasibility 3afeeds 3afood waste 3apolylactic acid 3aprices 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3aurban areas 3awaste treatment 0aFood waste 0aFungal hydrolysis 0aLactic acid fermentation 0aLactide synthesis 0aPoly(lactic acid) polymerisation 0aSensitivity analysis1 aHu, Yunzi1 aLin, Carol Sze Ki0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.72-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002300166245010600189300001600295520105800311592002801369653002001397653000801417653001701425653002101442653002201463653001901485700002201504700001901526773011501545856011401660852000901774655001201783IND60124212520221122035951.0151025e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012421252DNAL7 a10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[527:TEOTIO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldogh, Sáándor14aThe effects of the illumination of buildings on house-dwelling bats and its conservation consequences  ap. 527-534.  aAs the illumination of buildings at night increases, light pollution and negative impacts on wildlife also increase. In order to assess the effect of direct lighting on house-dwelling bats, we examined colonies of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis emarginatus and M. oxygnathus in illuminated and non-illuminated buildings found in close proximity to each other. We investigated the onset and timing of nocturnal emergence and measured the body mass and the forearm length of juvenile bats. Results show that bright artificial lighting delays the onset or significantly prolongs the duration of emergence and, in the worst cases, may destroy the whole colony. Juveniles are significantly smaller in illuminated buildings than in non-illuminated ones. The differences in length of the forearm and in body mass may suggest that the parturition time starts later and/or the growth rate is lower in bats living in illuminated buildings. Thus, the illumination of buildings could have serious implications for the conservation of house-dwelling bat colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 0alight pollution 0abat 0aconservation 0aartificial roost 0aMyotis oxygnathus 0aM. emarginatus1 aDobrosi, Déénes1 aSamu, Pééter0 tActa chiropterologica.g2007 Dec., v. 9, no. 2 p.527-534dMuseum and Institute of Zoology PASx1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F1733-5329%282007%299%5B527%3ATEOTIO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012500162300001800287520115700305592002801462650004401490650001601534650001801550650003301568650001901601700001701620700001301637700001301650700001401663700001701677700002601694773010501720856008601825852000901911655001201920IND60578221520221120071026.0170812e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b011722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wei12aA Multiscale Investigation on the Mechanism of Shape Recovery for IPDI to PPDI Hard Segment Substitution in Polyurethane  ap. 5931-5944.  aShape memory thermoplastic polyurethane (SMTPU) containing isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in hard segment has excellent shape recoverability even after large strain deformation. However, the underlying mechanism of shape recovery remains unclear. In this study, 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate (PPDI) in the polyurethane is gradually substituted by IPDI, and multiscale effects are examined by normal and dichroic Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), and mechanical test. Contradictory to the traditional conclusion, the degree of microphase separation decreases as the content of IPDI increases, while the macroscopic shape recoverability is largely improved. With dichroic FTIR and SAXS, we find that the morphology of hard phases changed from lamellar-like to fibrillar-like, which is more stable under stretching. SMFS experiments discover that IPDI could increase the elasticity of polymer chain and could endow the hard phases with “elastic” under stress. With these two factors, we are able to explain the high recoverability of the SMTPU containing IPDI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adeformation 3apolyurethanes 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3athermoplastics1 aZhang, Ruoyu1 aLiu, Wei1 aZhu, Jin1 aDong, Xia1 aGuo, Hongxia1 aHu, G.-H.q(Guo-Hua),0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 49, no. 16 p.5931-5944dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b011723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009700173300001300270520145900283592002801742650001401770650001301784650000901797650002701806650001101833650001101844650001501855650000901870650001601879700002101895700002101916700002101937773009101958856008402049852000902133655001202142IND60084701520221122110347.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008470152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowell, Tiffani J.10aAuditory stimulus discrimination recorded in dogs, as indicated by mismatch negativity (MMN)  ap. 8-13.  aDog cognition research tends to rely on behavioural response, which can be confounded by obedience or motivation, as the primary means of indexing dog cognitive abilities. A physiological method of measuring dog cognitive processing would be instructive and could complement behavioural response. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used in humans to study stimulus processing, which results in waveforms called event-related potentials (ERPs). One ERP component, mismatch negativity (MMN), is a negative deflection approximately 160–200ms after stimulus onset, which may be related to change detection from echoic sensory memory. We adapted a minimally invasive technique to record MMN in dogs. Dogs were exposed to an auditory oddball paradigm in which deviant tones (10% probability) were pseudo-randomly interspersed throughout an 8min sequence of standard tones (90% probability). A significant difference in MMN ERP amplitude was observed after the deviant tone in comparison to the standard tone, t₅=−2.98, p=0.03. This difference, attributed to discrimination of an unexpected stimulus in a series of expected stimuli, was not observed when both tones occurred 50% of the time, t₁=−0.82, p>0.05. Dogs showed no evidence of pain or distress at any point. We believe this is the first illustration of MMN in a group of dogs and anticipate that this technique may provide valuable insights in cognitive tasks such as object discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3adistress 3adogs 3aelectroencephalography 3ahumans 3amemory 3amotivation 3apain 3aprobability1 aConduit, Russell1 aToukhsati, Samia1 aBennett, Pauleen0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.8-13dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013800176300001800314520113700332592002801469650001501497650002201512650001401534650002101548650001901569650001801588700001901606700001701625700001701642700002401659700001801683773010501701856008601806852000901892655001201901IND60578221620221120071121.0170812e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b011822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakabayashi, Kazuhiro10aPoly(phenylene thioether)s with Fluorene-Based Cardo Structure toward High Transparency, High Refractive Index, and Low Birefringence  ap. 5849-5856.  aTo realize high-performance thermoplastic camera lenses for compensating chromatic aberration in which lenses with large and small Abbe numbers were combined, novel poly(phenylene thioether)s with a fluorene-based cardo structure were developed with the potential for simultaneously realizing high transparency, a high refractive index, low birefringence, and small Abbe number. Excellent transmittance was observed in all polymer films because the interchain packing was effectively suppressed by the cardo structure (e.g., transmittance was as high as 90% at 400 nm), and furthermore, high refractive index values (1.6553–1.6762) were attained. The polymer with the highest content of cardo structure exhibited a low birefringence of 0.0014. The efficient cancellation of polarization anisotropy between the polymer backbone and the fluorene units directed perpendicular to the polymer backbone contributed to the low birefringence. These results indicate that promising materials for high-performance optical applications can be developed based on the well-suited incorporation of the cardo structure into the polymer backbone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3afilms (materials) 3afluorenes 3arefractive index 3athermoplastics 3atransmittance1 aImai, Takayuki1 aFu, Mao-Chun1 aAndo, Shinji1 aHigashihara, Tomoya1 aUeda, Mitsuru0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 49, no. 16 p.5849-5856dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b011823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013900172300001600311520161400327592002801941650003701969650000902006650000902015650002102024650001802045650001802063650001302081650001602094650003702110653003202147653001702179653001302196653001402209653001302223700001902236700002002255700001702275773013402292856008602426852000902512655001202521IND60552791420221122202653.0170607e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055279142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakao, Takahiro10aSynthesis of monodisperse composite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels incorporating dispersive Pt nanoparticles with high contents  ap. 134-138.  aA facile synthesis of monodisperse composite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels incorporating dispersive Pt nanoparticles with high contents was proposed using an in situ method in which platinum ions were reduced in the presence of PNIPAM microgels. The high contents of dispersive Pt nanoparticles were achieved in a reduction process where a concentrated Pt ion solution suspending PNIPAM gels was injected into a diluted solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Cross-sectional TEM image and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for the composite microgels with a high Pt content showed that the major part of Pt nanoparticles formed in the reduction process was localized in the periphery of the PNIPAM microgels. The amount of Pt nanoparticles incorporated into the composite microgels could be enhanced by a decrease in the number of PNIPAM microgels in the in situ reduction method. A highest incorporation at the Pt content of 46wt% much higher than that previously reported was attained with maintaining their Pt particle sizes less than 5nm when the concentration of PNIPAM gels was adjusted to a low concentration of 7.7×10−2wt% in the reduction process. It could also be confirmed with dynamic light scattering that sizes of the Pt-PNIPAM composite microgels were sharply decreased with an increase in temperature from 25°C to 40°C. In principle, the present method is applicable to the incorporation of other metals than Pt. The applicability was confirmed in additional experiments in which hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) was reduced in the presence of PNIPAM microgels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agels 3aions 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 0aNanoparticle 0aPlatinum 0aReduction 0aMicrogel1 aNagao, Daisuke1 aIshii, Haruyuki1 aKonno, Mikio0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Apr. 05, v. 446 p.134-138dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013100168520112100299592002801420650001701448650002501465650001401490650001801504650001901522650001801541650001901559650001501578650001801593650001201611650001401623653002901637653001701666653001201683653001601695653001801711700005401729700002401783700001501807700001601822773009901838856008701937852000902024655001202033IND60717915220221116160131.0220606e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1286492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Linlin10aStable vesicle self-assembled from phospholipid and mannosylerythritol lipid and its application in encapsulating anthocyanins  aStable vesicles were formulated based on the self-assembling of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and mannosylerythritol lipid-A (MEL-A) in a manner of weak or non-cooperative interactions.

Compared with free anthocyanins, the encapsulated anthocyanins displayed higher retention rates when exposed to storage and simulated gastrointestinal fluid conditions, and their antioxidant capacity after simulated intestinal digestion was enhanced by 3–3.5 times because of protection of vesicle encapsulation and possible synergic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3adigestion 3aencapsulation 3afood chemistry 3agastric juice 3ahydrophilicity 3aintestines 3aphospholipids 3astorage 3aturbidity 0aMannosylerythritol lipid 0aPhospholipid 0aVesicle 0aAnthocyanin 0aEncapsulation1 aChen, Qihe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3862-43561 aMairiyangu, Yasheng1 aWang, Ying1 aLiu, Xiaoli0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 15, v. 344 p.128649-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1286493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001800254520106100272592002801333650002401361650001401385650002201399650001701421650001501438650001601453650001501469650000901484653002301493653002601516653002601542653001501568700001601583700001701599773008701616856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60627965820221116170438.0190128s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062796582DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000033752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, S.J.10aMetabolism, personality and pace of life in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata  ap. 1517-1543.  aWhile among-individual variation in behaviour, or personality, is common across taxa, its mechanistic underpinnings are poorly understood. The Pace of Life syndrome (POLS) provides one possible explanation for maintenance of personality differences. POLS predicts that metabolic differences will covary with behavioural variation, with high metabolism associated with risk prone behaviour and ‘faster’ life histories (e.g., high growth, early maturation). We used a repeated measures approach, assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3abody size 3aearly development 3alife history 3ametabolism 3apersonality 3aprediction 3arisk 0aanimal personality 0arisk taking behaviour 0aPace of Life Syndrome 0ametabolism1 aKells, T.J.1 aWilson, A.J.0 tBehaviour.g, v. 153, no. 13-14 p.1517-1543dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000033753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166520153400256592002801790650001901818650001701837650001601854650002501870650001701895650000901912650001501921650002101936650002501957650001801982650001202000650001402012650001302026650002502039651001502064651001002079651001002089651001002099653002102109653002202130653001502152653001502167700001802182700002002200700001602220700001702236700002102253700001802274773011602292856008202408852000902490655001202499IND60685210520221120220008.0200412e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1127182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaz, Muhammad10aTraditional uses, Phyto-chemistry and pharmacological activities of Tagetes Patula L.  aTagetes patula L. an important medicinal plant of Asteraceae family is worldwide distributed and reported for its folkloric use in various disorders like skin, eye problems, injury and stomach issues by different communities of China, Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.The present review has focused the ethnomedicinal and traditional uses of T. patula with special reference to Asian countries.

Karnal bunt (KB, causal agent Tilletia indica Mitra) is an economically important fungal pathogen of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) which has caused economic losses in the USA since it was first reported in 1996. To protect U.S. wheat from this emerging disease and the losses incurred from export quarantines, genetic sources of resistance are needed by breeders to improve U.S. germplasm. Resistance to KB is difficult to score phenotypically, making MAS an ideal choice for deploying this trait into U.S. wheat. Here we describe the conversion of a codominant microsatellite marker, Xgwm538, associated with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for KB resistance into a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based marker. The SNP marker was developed to improve gel-based resolution and amplification consistency. The gwm538 primers amplify three fragments in the KB resistant line HD29: 137-, 147-, and a 152-bp fragment that maps to the long arm of chromosome 4B and is linked to the KB QTL. By cloning and sequencing all three fragments, we were able to exploit a SNP and design a new primer to selectively amplify the 152-bp fragment of interest (gwm538snp). Amplification consistency is improved with gwm538snp since the amplification of competing nontarget fragments is eliminated, and ambiguity is reduced since heterozygous plants are easily identified among backcross progeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aTilletia indica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aemerging diseases 3aquantitative trait loci 3acodominance 3aheterozygosity 3alinkage (genetics)1 aSee, Deven R.1 aBrown-Guedira, Gina0 tCrop science.g2006 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.1467-1470dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/34693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2005.05-00653Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02137naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001400235520125400249592002801503650001101531650002501542650002401567650000901591650001101600700001901611700002001630773009201650856008401742852000901826655001201835IND60084701920221122110410.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008470192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Amy R.10aDomestic hen chicks’ conditioned place preferences for sound  ap. 30-35.  aFood and sounds (white noise, a food call and the sound of other chicks) were used in an attempt to establish conditioned place preferences with domestic hen chicks. Thirty-two chicks were randomly allocated to one of the 4 groups, and exposed to a 3-compartment apparatus to establish a baseline of their movements across 4 15-min sessions. They were then confined to one compartment and provided with free access to food or exposed to one sound for 15min and then they were confined to the alternate compartment with no food or sound for 15min. This process was repeated 3 times. Post-conditioning test sessions showed a conditioned place preference towards the area associated with food and away from the area associated with white noise. After conditioning, chicks showed no preference for spending time in the side associated with the food call or the sounds of other chicks; however, they entered a compartment first more often when it was associated with the food call and less often when it was associated with chick-sounds. Overall, these results showed that it was possible to use the conditioned place preference procedure to assess the effects of sounds and that the procedure has potential use for assessing other environmental stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicks 3aconditioned behavior 3ahabitat preferences 3ahens 3asounds1 aBizo, Lewis A.1 aFoster, T.

Sulphur in soils comes from the sulphur containing minerals present in parent materials from which the soils are derived and from the plants and animals residues or from the external addition of elemental S or its minerals. Sulphur enters the biological systems from soil through microbial activities involving mineralization of organic matter, immobilization, oxidation and reduction. Plants take up sulphur only as SO ₄⁼ and reduce it to form S containing amino acids and other compounds. Amino acid cysteine is the source of sulphur for most other S-compounds in plants. Sulphur containing vitamin thiamine (Vitamin B₁) is also synthesized only in plants and not in humans or other animals. Plants also produce vitamin biotin and a number of S-containing metabolites including glutathione, glucosinolates and alliin/allicin. Sulphur deficiency in wheat can lead to poor baking quality and in oilseeds it can lead to reduced oil content and yield. Sulphur is taken in as sulphur containing amino acids (SAAs) cysteine and methionine by human beings. The recommended dietary allowance for SAAs for humans is 14 mg kg⁻¹ body weight. Lack of sulphur can lead to arthritis, muscle and joint stiffness, spondylitis, etc. Dietary supplements containing (chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate, methylsulfonylmethane etc.) can be beneficial in the treatment of joint diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallicin 3aarthritis 3abaking quality 3abiotin 3abody weight 3achondroitin sulfate 3acysteine 3adietary supplements 3aglucosamine 3aglucosinolates 3aglutathione 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3alipid content 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3aminerals 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3aoilseeds 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3aplants (botany) 3apotassium 3asoil 3asulfates 3asulfur 3athiamin 3awheat1 aShivay, Yashbir Singh0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2018 June, v. 88, no. 2 p.429-434dSpringer IndiawJournal:20704x0369-82117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-016-0769-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013200171300001800303520130600321592002801627650000801655650002001663650001301683650001101696650001301707650001401720650001101734650002101745700002101766773012001787856008901907852000901996655001202005IND60534208620221121160734.0160802e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053420862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b016162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sunyoung10aImpact of Finite Mixing on Gas-Phase Partial Oxidation for Selective Removal of Deposit Precursors from Gasifier Outlet Streams  ap. 6501-6511.  aA coupled computational fluid dynamics and detailed kinetics study was performed to investigate the impact of finite mixing on the gas-phase partial oxidation of a gasifier outlet stream to selectively remove deposit precursors. The results showed that deposit precursors can be selectively removed as previously demonstrated on the basis of homogeneous gas mixture experiments and kinetic modeling. However, the finite mixing causes substantial degradation of the predicted performance. A detailed rate analysis showed that the imperfect mixing changes the kinetics of the gas-phase reactions. The reaction rates are much faster in the highly localized regions, where the O₂ concentration is high, and thus H₂ consumption by oxidation reactions become more competitive than H₂ regeneration. As a result, the imperfect mixing leads to a significantly less desirable outcome than the ideal mixing case. The performance can be improved by increasing the number air inlets to enhance the degree of mixing. The relative removal amount of deposit precursors can be increased if the initial O₂ concentration is increased, but it can cause substantial dilution by N₂ from air at the same time. Therefore, one should adjust the initial O₂ concentration depending upon the needs of a target system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afluid mechanics 3ahydrogen 3amixing 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asuperoxide anion1 aDean, Anthony M.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 29, no. 10 p.6501-6511dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b016163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001800190245007800208500002200286520174300308592002802051653001002079653001002089653001802099653002602117653001702143653001402160653001302174653001402187700001702201700005502218700001902273700002002292700001902312700001902331700002102350700003102371700002102402700001802423700005802441700002102499773006502520856008302585852000902668655001202677IND60557826420221119203911.0161103s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055782642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.10.0012doi7 aPMC52474242pmcid7 a281747572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, Yuan-Hung10aTranscriptional regulation by ATOH1 and its target SPDEF in the intestine  aPre-press version  aThe transcription factor ATOH1 controls the fate of intestinal progenitors downstream of the Notch signaling pathway. Intestinal progenitors that escape Notch activation express high levels of ATOH1 and commit to a secretory lineage fate, implicating ATOH1 as a gatekeeper for differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Although some transcription factors downstream of ATOH1, such as SPDEF, have been identified to specify differentiation and maturation of specific cell types, the bona fide transcriptional targets of ATOH1 are still largely unknown. Here we aimed to identify ATOH1 targets and to identify transcription factors that are likely to co-regulate gene expression with ATOH1.We used a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and mRNA-based high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq), together with cell sorting and transgenic mice, to identify direct targets of ATOH1, and establish the epistatic relationship between ATOH1 and SPDEF.Using unbiased genome-wide approaches, we identified more than 700 genes as ATOH1 transcriptional targets in adult small intestine and colon. Ontology analysis indicated that ATOH1 directly regulates genes involved in specification and function of secretory cells. De novo motif analysis of ATOH1 targets identified SPDEF as a putative transcriptional co-regulator of ATOH1. Functional epistasis experiments in transgenic mice demonstrate that SPDEF amplifies ATOH1-dependent transcription but cannot independently initiate transcription of ATOH1 target genes.This study, for the first time, unveils the direct targets of ATOH1 in the adult intestines and illuminates the transcriptional events that initiate the specification and function of intestinal secretory lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 0aATOH1 0aSPDEF 0atranscription 0aintestinal epithelium 0aVillin-creER 0aTRE-Spdef 0aAtoh1GFP 0aAtoh1Flag1 aChung, Eunah1 aLi, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6076-83671 aWan, Ying-Wooi1 aMahe, Maxime M.1 aChen, Min-Shan1 aNoah, Taeko K.1 aBell, Kristin N.1 aYalamanchili, Hari Krishna1 aKlisch, Tiemo J.1 aLiu, Zhandong1 aPark, Joo-Seop1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4190-43861 aShroyer, Noah F.0 tCMGH.g2016, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23408x2352-345X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009800175300001600273520186300289592002802152650002702180650001702207650002102224650002102245650002802266650002402294650001202318650001202330650002802342650001702370653002802387653002102415653002102436653002602457653001802483700002802501700002602529773011302555856008602668852000902754655001202763IND60591210220221119100901.0210603e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059121022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDagiliūtė, Renata10aSustainability at universities: Students’ perceptions from Green and Non-Green universities  ap. 473-482.  aAs institutions of higher education, universities have a significant impact on society and can play a key role in sustainability provision. Particularly, it is expected that green universities, because they are becoming more widespread, would contribute to the sustainability performance the most. However, none of the case studies have analysed the differences in sustainability performance between the “green” and the “non-green” universities from the perspective of the students. Therefore, the objective of this study was to contribute to this topic and compare students' attitudes towards sustainability in Vytautas Magnus University (a non-green university) and Kaunas University of Technology (a green university). According to a survey conducted in 2015, the differences in campus sustainability, environmental information, the university's role in sustainable development, students' attitudes to the university's self-presentation as green, and students' involvement in sustainability in these two universities were analysed. Results indicate that there were no significant differences regarding sustainability aspects in general, but green university students more often agree that their university presents itself as environmentally friendly. They get more environmental information and more often participate in sustainability activities compared with students from the non-green university. After applying the regression analysis, it was found that only campus sustainability and environmental information determined students' involvement in sustainability significantly. This suggests that official declarations and commitments should be realised in particular activities on campus and via information campaigns to contribute to sustainability provisions in a more holistic manner. Otherwise, commitments will remain as statements only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3acollege students 3ahigher education 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3aregression analysis 3asociety 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3auniversities 0aSustainable development 0aGreen university 0aHigher education 0aAttitudes of students 0aParticipation1 aLiobikienė, Genovaitė1 aMinelgaitė, Audronė0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.473-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245010000184520200300284592002802287650001802315650002202333650001602355650002002371650001502391650002002406650001302426650002002439650001902459650002002478650001202498650001802510650001102528650001102539650000902550650001802559650002502577650001402602650002002616650001002636651000902646653002402655653001102679653001702690653000902707653000802716653000802724653000702732653000702739700003202746700002402778700002702802700001702829773011502846856008202961852000903043655001203052IND60685210920221121023148.0200318e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1126912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosquera, Dulce María González10aAntiurolithiatic activity of Boldoa purpurascens aqueous extract: An in vitro and in vivo study  aBoldoa purpurascens Cav. (Nyctaginaceae) is a plant species used in traditional medicine in Cuba as antiurolithiatic.The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antiurolothiatic activity of an aqueous extract from the leaves of Boldoa purpurascens.The aqueous extract from leaves of Boldoa purpurascens was evaluated for antiurolithiatic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro crystallization of calcium oxalate (CaOx) was assessed using a nucleation, aggregation and growth assay. The effects of the extract and of Cystone®, used as a positive control, on the slope of nucleation and aggregation, as well as on the growth of CaOx crystals, were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The densities of the formed crystals were compared microscopically. In vivo activity was evaluated in an urolithiasis model in rats, in which kidney stones are induced by ethylene glycol (0.75%) and ammonium chloride (2%) in drinking water for 10 days. Three different experimental doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) of the extract and Cystone® were administered for 10 days. After 10 days, various biochemical parameters were measured in urine and serum, and histopathological analysis of the kidneys was carried out.The aqueous extract of Boldoa purpurascens inhibited the slope of nucleation and aggregation of CaOx crystallization, and decreased the crystal density. It also inhibited the growth and caused the dissolution of CaOx crystals. Cystone® exhibited similar effects. At a dose of 400 mg/kg the extract reduced the concentration of uric acid in urine, as well as the serum concentration of uric acid and creatinine. Histopathologic analysis of the kidneys of the same treatment group revealed reduced tissue damage; the results were almost similar to the untreated healthy control group.This study indicates that an aqueous leaf extract of Boldoa purpurascens may be effective in the prevention of urinary stone formation, and substantiates the traditional claim.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNyctaginaceae 3aammonium chloride 3ablood serum 3acalcium oxalate 3acreatinine 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aethylene glycol 3ahistopathology 3ain vivo studies 3akidneys 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amodels 3arats 3arenal calculi 3atraditional medicine 3auric acid 3aurinary calculi 3aurine 3aCuba 0aBoldoa purpurascens 0aKidney 0aUrolithiasis 0aCaOx 0aCOD 0aCOM 0aOD 0aEG1 aOrtega, Yannarys Hernández1 aQuero, Pedro César1 aMartínez, Rafael Sosa1 aPieters, Luc0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 May 10, v. 253 p.112691-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1126913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017500169300001800344520158000362592002801942650002201970650002001992650001302012650003802025650001802063650001702081650002402098650001902122650002202141650002102163700001802184700001902202700001802221700001702239700001902256773010502275856008602380852000902466655001202475IND60578222120221120173117.0170812e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b013242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shao-Fei10aSynthesis and Crystallization Behavior of Equisequential ADMET Polyethylene Containing Arylene Ether Defects: Remarkable Effects of Substitution Position and Arylene Size  ap. 6001-6011.  aA new series of polyethylene (PE) containing arylene ether units as defects in the main chain, which were precisely separated by 20 CH₂ units, were synthesized via acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization. The thermal stability, crystallization, and melting behaviors, crystal structure, and chain stacking were investigated with TGA, DSC, WAXD, and SAXS. It is found that the substitution position in the arylene units has a remarkable influence on the chain stacking and their location in the solid phase. The ortho-substituted phenylene units are excluded from the crystal phase, leading to a low melting temperature (Tₘ). In contrast, the para-substituted phenylene units can be included into the crystal, leading to a high Tₘ. The meta-substituted phenylene units can be partially included into the crystal, resulting in mixed crystal structures and an intermediate Tₘ. Such an effect of substitution position in precision PEs is different from that in poly(ethylene oxide) reported in the literature, which can be ascribed to the matchable configuration of the defects in the main chain with the conformation of PE in the crystals. When the defects become naphthylene ether units, the crystallization and melting behaviors of the polymers are similar to or different from those of the precision PEs with phenylene ether defects, depending on the substitution position. This shows that both the substitution position in the arylene ether defects and the defect size exert effects on crystallization, melting behaviors, and chain stacking of precision PEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amelting point 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aGuo, Yin-Tian1 aWang, Rui-Yang1 aFu, Zhi-Sheng1 aXu, Jun-Ting1 aFan, Zhi-Qiang0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 49, no. 16 p.6001-6011dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b013243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016500167500001900332520112700351592002801478650001001506650001301516650001601529650001901545650001401564650001601578650001101594650001401605650002301619650000901642650002001651653001201671653001701683653001001700653001601710700001501726700001801741700001701759700001601776700001401792700001601806700001601822773009501838856008601933852000902019655001202028IND60717915720221116160043.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1083712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudge, M.M.10aEating quality of the longissimus thoracis muscle in beef cattle – Contributing factors to the underlying variability and associations with performance traits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective was to determine the factors associated with meat tenderness, juiciness, flavour and chewiness in 4791 growing crossbred cattle. Meat quality of bulls was inferior to that of both steers and heifers with little difference between the latter two genders. Angus, Hereford and Belgian Blues had the most tender meat with the Simmental being the toughest albeit the difference was, on average, only 5%. Moderate to strong correlations (r ≥ |0.43|) existed among tenderness, juiciness and flavour although some of the correlations differed by animal gender. Correlations between chewiness and tenderness in the different genders varied from −0.81 to −0.74 while the correlations between chewiness and the other sensory traits varied from −0.54 to −0.09. The (partial) correlations between each of the four sensory metrics and all of carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass fat score were ≤|0.09| with most not being different from zero. Correlations between the sensory traits with growth rate, muscle depth, feed intake and efficiency were all ≤|0.08| and mostly not different from zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aHereford 3abeef cattle 3acarcass weight 3achewiness 3afeed intake 3aflavor 3ajuiciness 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat tenderness 0aSensory 0aOrganoleptic 0aBreed 0aCorrelation1 aConroy, S.1 aHegarty, P.J.1 aCromie, A.R.1 aFanning, R.1 aKelly, D.1 aCrofton, E.1 aBerry, D.P.0 tMeat science.g2021 Feb., v. 172 p.108371-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1083713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011800177300001800295520139900313592002801712650002601740650001601766650002901782650002001811650001501831650001501846650001001861650001201871650001401883650003301897650001301930650001101943650001201954650001501966650001501981651001101996700002402007700003002031700003202061773012502093856008302218852000902301655001202310IND60742400520221120192122.0220126e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074240052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-020-02425-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Durazo, Ángel10aComparative Assessment of Metal Bioaccumulation in Tilapia and Largemouth Bass from Three Dams of the Yaqui River  ap. 3112-3125.  aIn the present paper, we investigated the accumulation of six metals in tilapia (Oreochromis nilocticus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) as indicators of the environmental pollution present at three constructed dams in the Yaqui River basin in Sonora, Mexico. The La Angostura (ANG), El Cajon de Onapa (ECO), and El Oviachic (OVI) dams are ecosystems under different degrees of anthropogenic stress. The collected fishes were dissected to obtain liver, gonad, stomach, gill, and muscle samples to determine the metal concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cr. The results of a PERMANOVA showed that the concentrations of Fe, Cu, and Zn were significantly higher in tilapia liver, stomach, and gill tissues compared with those of the largemouth bass. Also, differences were detected between seasons, with the metal concentrations during the dry season being significantly higher than those of the rainy season (p < 0.001). The results of a principal component analysis showed an association between metals, tissues, and dams with significantly higher (p < 0.001) concentrations in tilapia from the ECO dam compared with those from the ANG and OVI dams. The general distribution of metals in the tissues was as follows: liver > stomach-gills > gonads > muscle. Variations in metal concentrations may be indicative of the different sources of anthropogenic stress in each ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aOreochromis 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioaccumulation 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aliver 3amuscles 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3arivers 3astomach 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aMexico1 aCruz-Acevedo, Edgar1 aBetancourt-Lozano, Miguel1 aJara-Marini, Martin Enrique0 tBiological trace element research.g2021 Aug., v. 199, no. 8 p.3112-3125dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02425-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012100159520184000280592002802120650003402148650002602182650001802208650002502226650001602251650001202267650001102279650001302290650001802303650001402321650001302335650002102348650001902369650001602388650001702404650001702421650004402438650001102482650001402493650000902507650001302516650001202529650002502541650001202566650001702578653002302595653001702618653000802635653003102643653001502674700001802689700001602707700001802723700002002741700001902761700001802780700001602798700001702814700001402831700001802845700001902863773011502882856008202997852000903079655001203088IND60685211120221121023236.0200907e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068521112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Han10aTherapeutic assessment of fractions of Gastrodiae Rhizoma on chronic atrophic gastritis by 1H NMR-based metabolomics  aGastrodiae Rhizoma (GR), a well-known and commonly-used TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) for treating headache, dizziness, tetanus, epilepsy, and etc., has been proven to relieve chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). Due to its complex ingredients, the active fractions responsible for the treatment of CAG remain largely unknown.To explore the underlying material and interpret its underlying mechanism, the therapeutic effect of extract from different polar parts of Gastrodiae Rhizoma on autoimmune CAG was studied based on the ¹H NMR metabolomics.The rat model of CAG was established by autoimmune method. The modeled CAG rats were then treated with 4 polar parts (T1-4 in descending polarity, corresponding to water, n-butanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts, respectively) of Gastrodiae Rhizoma for 21 consecutive days. The stomach and serum samples were collected and then subjected to histopathology observation, biochemical measurement (MDA, SOD, GSH, NO, XOD and pepsin), ¹H NMR metabolic profiling and multivariate/univariate statistical analysis.The results showed that T1 had the best therapeutic effect, T2 the second, and T3 and T4 the poorest with no obvious therapeutic effect, demonstrating that the effective components of Gastrodiae Rhizoma should be compounds of high polarity. T1 achieved good therapeutic effects due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, and by rectifying the disturbed energy and amino acid metabolism in CAG model.This integrated metabolomics approach proved the validity of the therapeutic effect of extract from different polar parts of Gastrodiae Rhizoma on autoimmune CAG, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms, and demonstrating the feasibility of metabolomics to evaluate efficacy of herbal drug, which is often difficult by traditional means.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abutanol 3aenergy 3aepilepsy 3aethyl acetate 3agastritis 3aheadache 3aherbal medicines 3ahistopathology 3aingredients 3ametabolomics 3anitric oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apepsin 3apetroleum 3arats 3arhizomes 3astomach 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atetanus 3atherapeutics 0aGastrodiae Rhizoma 0aMetabolomics 0aNMR 0aChronic atrophic gastritis 0aOSC- PLSDA1 aRuan, Ling-Yu1 aChen, Cheng1 aFan, Jun-Ting1 aChen, Jian-Feng1 aZhao, Wen-Long1 aMeng, Hui-Hui1 aLiu, Wen-Ya1 aZhao, Wen-Li1 aZheng, Qi1 aLiu, Zhi-Chao1 aWang, Jun-Song0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 May 23, v. 254 p.112403-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012500171300001600296520125000312592002801562650002801590650002701618650001301645650001401658700001901672700002701691700001801718773009401736856008401830852000901914655001201923IND60084702520221122145855.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008470252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChappell, Jackie10aHow to build an information gathering and processing system: Lessons from naturally and artificially intelligent systems  ap. 179-186.  aImagine a situation in which you had to design a physical agent that could collect information from its environment, then store and process that information to help it respond appropriately to novel situations. What kinds of information should it attend to? How should the information be represented so as to allow efficient use and re-use? What kinds of constraints and trade-offs would there be? There are no unique answers. In this paper, we discuss some of the ways in which the need to be able to address problems of varying kinds and complexity can be met by different information processing systems. We also discuss different ways in which relevant information can be obtained, and how different kinds of information can be processed and used, by both biological organisms and artificial agents. We analyse several constraints and design features, and show how they relate both to biological organisms, and to lessons that can be learned from building artificial systems. Our standpoint overlaps with Karmiloff-Smith (1992) in that we assume that a collection of mechanisms geared to learning and developing in biological environments are available in forms that constrain, but do not determine, what can or will be learnt by individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3ainformation management 3alearning 3aorganisms1 aDemery, Zoe P.1 aArriola-Rios, Veronica1 aSloman, Aaron0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.179-186dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006800174520160100242592002801843650002301871650000801894650005201902650002201954650002301976650003501999650002002034650001802054650001802072650001002090650001302100650004302113650001402156700002402170700002002194700002302214700002202237700002802259700002602287700002402313700002102337700002002358773012702378856008502505852000902590655001202599IND60751625320221120142546.0210925e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075162532DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90918202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBortolotti, Daria 10aTLR3 and TLR7 RNA Sensor Activation during SARS-CoV-2 Infection  a(1) Background: Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has led to a pandemic that began in March 2020. The role of the SARS-CoV-2 components on innate and adaptive immunity is still unknown. We investigated the possible implication of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)–pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) interaction. (2) Methods: We infected Calu-3/MRC-5 multicellular spheroids (MTCSs) with a SARS-CoV-2 clinical strain and evaluated the activation of RNA sensors, transcription factors, and cytokines/interferons (IFN) secretion, by quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. (3) Results: Our results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3/MRC-5 multicellular spheroids induced the activation of the TLR3 and TLR7 RNA sensor pathways. In particular, TLR3 might act via IRF3, producing interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-α and IFN-β, during the first 24 h post-infection. Then, TLR3 activates the NFκB transduction pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Conversely, TLR7 seems to mainly act via NFκB, inducing type 1 IFN, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ3, starting from the 48 h post-infection. (4) Conclusion: We showed that both TLR3 and TLR7 are involved in the control of innate immunity during lung SARS-CoV-2 infection. The activation of TLRs induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-6, as well as interferons. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in the early stages of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aadaptive immunity 3aetiological agents 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3alungs 3apandemic 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion1 aGentili, Valentina 1 aRizzo, Sabrina 1 aSchiuma, Giovanna 1 aBeltrami, Silvia 1 aStrazzabosco, Giovanni 1 aFernández, Mercedes,1 aCaccuri, Francesca 1 aCaruso, Arnaldo 1 aRizzo, Roberta 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90918203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001400242520167100256592002801927650001501955650002501970650001501995650001302010650001902023650003002042650001502072650003102087650000902118650001002127650001102137650001602148650001502164650001002179653002402189653001402213653001402227653001602241653001602257653001902273700002002292700001802312773010102330856008602431852000902517655001202526IND60537945420221117192053.0190408e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053794542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomain, Vallée10aWater residence time and pesticide removal in pilot-scale wetlands  ap. 76-84.  aThe use of agricultural pesticides may lead to environmental contamination. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are often recommended for decreasing non-point source pollution by pesticides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of water residence time (WRT) on the effectiveness of two CWs for decreasing pollution in drainage water at the pilot scale. Thus, two successive charge/discharge steps were conducted successively with high and low flows before conducting a step with no flow. For both pilot experiments, the measured effectiveness was between 22 and 100% of the applied quantities of the five pesticides. These results were correlated with the physicochemical properties of the pesticides, particularly their adsorption and desorption capacities. In addition, the pilot scale wetlands were less effective during short WRT (from 15.2 to 100%) than during long WRT (from 17.8 to 100%), despite the greater remobilisation observed during the discharge steps with low flows. After stopping flow, the DT50 values of the pesticides in the aqueous phase were less than 4 days in the two pilot wetlands, likely due to their rapid transfer to the solid phase (soil or straw). In addition, the DT50 values measured in the solid phases ranged from 3.8 days to more than one year. Thus, the WRT must be optimised in the CW by maintaining vegetation or installing weirs, to favour retention processes (sorption, sedimentation) during the drainage periods (October to May). Next, the pesticides stored in the solid phase could be subjected to degradation processes, particularly when moisture, residence times and temperature conditions are favourable (summer).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aconstructed wetlands 3adesorption 3adrainage 3adrainage water 3anonpoint source pollution 3apesticides 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil 3astraw 3asummer 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aweirs 0aConstructed wetland 0aHalf-life 0aPesticide 0aPilot scale 0aRemediation 0aResidence time1 aSylvie, Dousset1 aDavid, Billet0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Dec., v. 85 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245010600200500002000306520155400326592002801880596005201908596005301960596002402013596004102037650002202078650001502100650001402115650001302129650001202142650000902154651001502163700001802178700006002196700002102256700005902277700001802336700005602354700006002410700006002470700001802530700005502548700005802603700005802661773013702719856007702856852000902933655001202942IND60789800220221117155940.0220822e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078980022DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0174912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae‐Wan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5257-725610aInterannual Variation of Modified Circumpolar Deep Water in the Dotson‐Getz Trough, West Antarctica  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWidespread ice shelf thinning has been recorded in the Amundsen Sea in recent decades, driven by basal melting and intrusions of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the continental shelf. The Dotson Ice Shelf (DIS) is located to the south of the Amundsen Sea polynya, and has a high basal melting rate because modified CDW (mCDW) fills the Dotson‐Getz Trough (DGT) and reaches the base of the ice shelf. Here, hydrographic data in the DGT obtained during seven oceanographic surveys from 2007 to 2018 were used to study the interannual variation in mCDW volume and properties and their causes. Although mCDW volume showed relatively weak interannual variations at the continental shelf break, these variations intensified southward and reached a maximum in front of the DIS. There, the mCDW volume was ∼8,000 km³ in 2007, rapidly decreased to 4,700 km³ in 2014 before rebounding to 7,300 km³ in 2018. We find that such interannual variability is coherent with local Ekman pumping integrated along the DGT modulated by the presence of sea ice, and complementing earlier theories involving shelf break winds only. The interannual variability in strength of the dominant south‐southeast coastal wind modulates the amplitude of Ekman upwelling along the eastern boundary of the Amundsen Sea polynya during the austral summers of the surveyed years, apparently leading to change in the volume of mCDW along the DGT. We note a strong correlation between the wind variability and the longitudinal location of the Amundsen Sea Low.  aPublisher supplied data  aPE21110cKorea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI)  aOPP‐1643285cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  a80NSSC20K1158cNASA  cNatural Environment Research Council 3acontinental shelf 3ageophysics 3aice shelf 3aresearch 3asea ice 3awind 3aAntarctica1 aYang, Hee Won1 aDutrieux, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8066-934X1 aWåhlin, Anna K.1 aJenkins, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9117-06161 aKim, Yeong Gi1 aHa, Ho Kyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-92471 aKim, Chang‐Sin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3026-32851 aCho, Kyoung‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5527-58511 aPark, Taewook1 aPark, Jisoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0428-83581 aLee, Sanghoon,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0248-00661 aCho, Yang‐Ki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0026-05500 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Dec., v. 126, no. 12 p.e2021JC017491-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0174913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007900170300001400249520094500263592002801208650001101236650001101247650001401258650001901272650001101291650001001302650001701312650001301329650002401342650001801366650001201384650002301396650001101419650002001430650001101450653001101461653003701472653002401509653001101533653001401544700002001558700001801578700005501596700002301651700001401674773009501688856008501783852000901868655001201877IND60629022620221119050035.0191024e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062902262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiandong10aSupercritical water gasification of phenol over Ni-Ru bimetallic catalysts  ap. 12-20.  aIncorporating Ru in a Ni catalyst for gasification of phenol in supercritical water at 450 °C and 30 min promoted formation of cyclohexanol via hydrogenation, which is a key step toward gasification. Both Ni and Ni-Ru catalysts were effective to reduce the formation of cyclohexanone and oligomerization products, compared with the case with no catalyst. H2 and CH4 yields increased as the Ru/Ni ratio increased, as did the carbon and hydrogen yields in the gas phase products. The Ni80Ru20/Al2O3 catalyst provided good gasification performance and it exhibits Ru (101), Ru (100) and Ni (111) facets and evidence of overlaid bimetallic particles. DFT calculations show that the presence of Ru (either as pure Ru or as a Ni-Ru alloy) reduces the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation by close to 0.2 eV relative to pure Ni, and that the energy barrier is not as largely affected by the amount of Ru present, provided it is non-zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acyclohexanones 3aenergy 3agases 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogenation 3amethane 3amethane production 3anickel 3aoligomerization 3aphenol 0aPhenol 0aSupercritical water gasification 0aBimetallic catalyst 0aNickel 0aRuthenium1 aDasgupta, Anish1 aChen, Zhifeng1 aXu, Donghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0076-30781 aSavage, Phillip E.1 aGuo, Yang0 tWater research.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.12-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018600165300001100351520147500362592002801837596005901865596005901924596008701983650001702070650001202087650001902099650001502118650001402133650001902147650001302166650000902179650001902188650002402207650002802231650002102259650001402280650001002294650001602304650001402320700001902334700005602353773011402409856008202523852000902605655001202614IND60645275620221117213015.0190722e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064527562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-019-0985-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lan-ying,10aPyramiding of rapid germination loci from Oryza Sativa cultivar ‘Xieqingzao B’ and cold tolerance loci from Dongxiang wild rice to increase climate resilience of cultivated rice  ap. 85.  aRapid and uniform germination of seeds and subsequent high survivability of seedlings in low-temperature environments are two key requirements in the direct-seeding agronomic production system in rice. Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR), the northernmost common wild rice, possesses a number of seedling cold-tolerance loci and is an invaluable genetic resource for the molecular breeding of cold-tolerant rice. However, DXWR has a delayed and desynchronized germination trait in low-temperature environments that is favorable for its adaption to cold environments but is a disadvantage for seedling establishment in the direct-seeding system when integrated into elite cultivars. In the present study, we identified five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for low-temperature germination in DXWR. All the DXWR alleles delay the germination of DXWR seeds in low-temperature environments. By the pyramiding of QTLs of rapid germination from cultivated rice and QTLs of seedling cold tolerance from high tolerance wild rice DXWR, we obtained a variety numbered DX71 with rapid and uniform germination of seeds and high cold tolerance of seedlings in low-temperature environments. The results could facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of delayed germination in DXWR, partly explaining how DXWR adapts to low temperatures in its habitat. The identified QTLs provide tightly linked markers for rice breeding in the development of climate-resilient varieties with low input.  aPublisher supplied data  a31101211cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31371603cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018398cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3acold tolerance 3acold zones 3acultivars 3adirect seeding 3ahabitats 3aloci 3aplant breeding 3aplant establishment 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atemperature 3awild rice1 aChen, Hongping1 aMao, Donghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9850-149X0 tMolecular breeding.g2019 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.85-85dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-019-0985-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245008800165300001600253520114900269592002801418650002201446650001501468650002401483650001701507650001301524650001101537650001501548650002001563650001701583650000901600650002401609650004301633650001901676650001101695650001701706700002101723773012601744856007401870852000901944655001201953IND60663129320221118033838.0190909e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066312932DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ib00025k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPretorius, Etheresia10aDiagnostic morphology: biophysical indicators for iron-driven inflammatory diseases  ap. 486-510.  aMost non-communicable diseases involve inflammatory changes in one or more vascular systems, and there is considerable evidence that unliganded iron plays major roles in this. Most studies concentrate on biochemical changes, but there are important biophysical correlates. Here we summarize recent microscopy-based observations to the effect that iron can have major effects on erythrocyte morphology, on erythrocyte deformability and on both fibrinogen polymerization and the consequent structure of the fibrin clots formed, each of which contributes significantly and negatively to such diseases. We highlight in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic thrombotic stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary hemochromatosis and Alzheimer's disease, while recognizing that many other diseases have co-morbidities (and similar causes). Inflammatory biomarkers such as ferritin and fibrinogen are themselves inflammatory, creating a positive feedback that exacerbates disease progression. The biophysical correlates we describe may provide novel, inexpensive and useful biomarkers of the therapeutic benefits of successful treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abiomarkers 3adisease progression 3aerythrocytes 3aferritin 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3ahemochromatosis 3ainflammation 3airon 3alupus erythematosus 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apolymerization 3astroke 3atherapeutics1 aKell, Douglas B.0 tIntegrative biology.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 6, no. 5 p.486-510dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ib00025k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245010200184520148500286592002801771650002701799650001901826650001201845650001001857650002101867650002101888650002901909650002201938650001301960650001901973653001101992653002402003653003902027653001502066653002602081700003402107700003102141700002102172773013702193856008502330961001202415852000902427655001202436IND60721128620221121232133.0210408e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072112862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2020.1037942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGontijo, Marco Túlio Pardini10aBacteriophages that infect Gram-negative bacteria as source of signal-arrest-release motif lysins  aTreatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria is challenging, a potential solution for which is the use of bacteriophage-derived lytic enzymes. However, the exogenous action of bacteriophage lysins against Gram-negative bacteria is hindered due to the presence of an impermeable outer membrane in these bacteria. Nevertheless, recent research has demonstrated that some lysins are capable of permeating the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria with the help of signal peptides. In the present study, we investigated the genomes of 309 bacteriophages that infect Gram-negative pathogens of clinical interest in order to determine the evolutionary markers of signal peptide-containing lysins. Complete genomes displayed 265 putative lysins, of which 17 (6.41%) contained signal-arrest-release motifs and 41 (15.47%) contained cleavable signal peptides. There was no apparent relationship between host specificity and lysin diversity. Nevertheless, the evolution of lysin genes might not be independent of the rest of the bacteriophage genome once pan-genome clustering and lysin diversity appear to be correlated. In addition, signal peptide- and signal-arrest-release-containing lysins were monophyletically distributed in the protein cladogram, suggesting that the natural selection of holin-independent lysins is divergent. Our study screened 58 (21.89%) out of 265 potential candidates for in vitro experimentation against MDR bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abacteriophages 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3ain vitro studies 3amultiple drug resistance 3anatural selection 3aresearch 3asignal peptide 0aESKAPE 0aNosocomial pathogen 0aBacteriophage-derived lytic enzyme 0aEnzybiotic 0aAntibiotic substitute1 aVidigal, Pedro Marcus Pereira1 aLopez, Maryoris Elisa Soto1 aBrocchi, Marcelo0 tResearch in microbiology.g2021 Mar., v. 172, no. 2 p.103794-dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2020.1037943Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245008600179500001400265520106300279592002801342650002401370650001201394650002201406650001401428650002201442650001301464653002101477653001501498653001601513700002301529773009101552856009001643852000901733655001201742IND60706728820221118045603.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070672882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1278152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoria, Halina Binde12aA multigenerational approach can detect early Cd pollution in Chironomus riparius  aNAL-light  aCadmium (Cd) is a non-essential highly toxic metal and its presence in the environment has been a concern over the years. On the present study we adopt the spiked water exposure scenario to study early Cd contamination across five generations of the model organism Chironomus riparius. Animals were, at the beginning of each generation, submitted to 0, 1, 3.2, 10, 32 and 100 μg/L of Cd. Classical endpoints like total emergence, EmT50, fertility and the integrative fitness measure, population growth rate (PGR), were calculated at each generation. Results could demonstrate that exposure to brief and low Cd concentrations can affect all the measured endpoints and, therefore, initial Cd pollution in previously unpolluted sites can be detected after just five consecutive generations. Importantly, at 100 μg/L of Cd fertility was greatly impaired after three generations. Also, PGR calculation is a sensitive tool for monitoring early pollution of Cd. Yet, no adaptation to Cd over five generations could be observed on the present experimental setup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomus riparius 3acadmium 3aexposure scenario 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3atoxicity 0aNon-biting midge 0aLife cycle 0aToxic metal1 aPfenninger, Markus0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 262 p.127815-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1278153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245011600183300001600299520197400315592002802289650001002317650002402327650002602351650002402377650002402401650002202425650002202447650001302469650001702482650002002499650001402519651001102533651001002544651001302554651001602567651001402583651001302597651001602610651001702626651001402643700003002657700003202687700003302719700003502752700002902787773008602816856004802902852000902950655001202959IND50062828520221120095650.0130323e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006282852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-012-9312-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCambrón-Sandoval, Víctor Hugo10aGenetic parameters for seedling growth in Pinus pseudostrobus families under different competitive environments  ap. 219-232.  aPinus pseudostrobus Lindl. is a widely distributed species in Mexico that also occurs in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and has been tested outside its natural range in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, New Zealand, South Africa and Venezuela. Due to its great potential, it is necessary to select genotypes capable of increasing its production in the shortest possible time through genetic improvement strategies, where individuals are subjected to conditions forcing them to express their growth potential in advance. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the genetic variation among half-sib progenies and to estimate heritability (h ² ) of stem height (SH) and diameter (SD) for seedlings grown under different competitive conditions in a common garden trial. A split-plot experimental design with four replications and three competitive environments (treatments) was used: (I) low inter-family competition (0.25 × 0.12 m), (II) high inter-family competition (0.12 × 0.06 m), and (III) high intra-family competition; 13 half-sib families were assessed, carrying out monthly evaluations for 10 months. Estimated h ² at individual and family-means levels for both SH and SD varied among competitive environments. For conditions I and II, a trend towards increasing h ² with age of seedlings was shown, but for condition III, a reverse trend was observed (values close to zero). High genetic stability in SH performance was found in both I and II, and II and III, pairs of environments, as measured by the type-B genetic correlation (0.70 ≤ r B ≤ 1.0), but it tended to decrease after 9 months, when competition increased; genetic stability in SD was lower (0.20 ≤ r B ≤ 0.80) in both pairs of the environments that were sampled. It was concluded that the competition conditions used in field trials for genotype evaluation may significantly affect the variance components, estimation of genetic parameters and genotype stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aColombia 3aEl Salvador 3aGuatemala 3aHonduras 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Africa 3aVenezuela1 aSánchez-Vargas, Nahum M.1 aSáenz Romero, Cuauhtémoc,1 aVargas-Hernández, J.

In this study, pairs of line segments satisfying angle and distance constraints are used as matching primitives. To ensure that each extracted line segment is paired with another line segment, the search region of each line segment is gradually grown until it is paired. Initial pair-to-pair correspondences between two images are established using four pair-wise constraints; next, line-to-line correspondences are obtained. To effectively solve the matching conflict in the results, a method of recording the result of line pair matching based on a double-layer matrix is proposed. Based on the double-layer matrix, an effective checking method for the line matching results based on the collinearity constraint and matching redundancy is presented. It fully utilizes redundancy information and considers the collinearity of fragmented line segments. Further, it can effectively separate correct and incorrect matches from the one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many matching results. The proposed method was tested on 12 image pairs from a benchmark of matched-lines, and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method due to its higher accuracy and greater recall in challenging cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3ajournals 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3atesting 0aLine segment matching 0aLine pair matching 0aPair-wise geometric constraint 0aMatching result checking1 aZhu, Qing1 aLiu, Suyan1 aWang, Weixi0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2021 Feb., v. 172 p.41-58dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, damage functions usually assess risk to species currently occupying conservation areas. Damage functions are not currently used to predict risk to species yet to be reintroduced to conservation areas. While the impacts of several mammalian pest species, such as rats (Rattus spp.), are relatively well-known in urban forest fragments, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are relatively understudied invasive mammals, and their impacts in urban fragments are unknown. Conservation areas within cities provide important habitat for native species and are a focus of current conservation efforts. We developed a damage function describing the relationship between the relative abundance of hedgehogs (determined using a chew card index) and their potential impact (estimated by egg mortality in artificial nests) in a New Zealand urban environment. Egg mortality was positively related to hedgehog abundance, although some egg mortality occurred even at the lowest hedgehog abundances measured. Conservation managers should prioritise hedgehog control at sites of highest hedgehog relative abundances and/or sites containing high value species likely to be at risk. Our results demonstrate the need for conservation managers to proactively assess potential threats to protected areas. Further, we show that damage functions provide an objective means of assessing threats prior to reintroduction of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErinaceus europaeus 3aRattus 3acities 3aconservation areas 3aeggs 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3amortality 3anests 3apest control 3arats 3arisk 3aspecies reintroduction 3aurban areas 3aurban forests 3aNew Zealand 0aArtificial nests 0aDensity-impact function 0aErinaceus europaeus 0aInvasive1 aGlen, A.

A total of 1180 studies were retrieved from PubMed® and Web of Science for 15 pathogens identified as relevant in EFSA’s scientific opinion on the public health hazards related to pork (2011). The study selection focused on controlled studies where a cause–effect could be attributed to the interventions tested, and their effectiveness could be inferred. Altogether, 52 studies published from 1983 to 2020 regarding Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium avium, and Salmonella spp. were retained and analysed. Research was mostly focused on Salmonella (n = 43 studies). In-feed and/or water treatments, and vaccination were the most tested interventions and were, overall, successful. However, the previously agreed criteria for this systematic review excluded other effective interventions to control Salmonella and other pathogens, like Yersinia enterocolitica, which is one of the most relevant biological hazards in pork. Examples of such successful interventions are the Specific Pathogen Free herd principle, stamping out and repopulating with disease-free animals. Research on other pathogens (i.e., Hepatitis E, Trichinella spiralis and Toxoplasma gondii) was scarce, with publications focusing on epidemiology, risk factors and/or observational studies. Overall, high herd health coupled with good management and biosecurity were effective to control or prevent most foodborne pathogens in pork at the pre-harvest level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEuropean Union 3aMycobacterium avium 3aSalmonella 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3abiosecurity 3aepidemiology 3ahepatitis E 3aherd health 3aherds 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apork 3apublic health 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3asystematic review 3avaccination1 aPessoa, Joana 1 aMeemken, Diana 1 aNesbakken, Truls 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Aug. 27, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90918253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245020600165300001600371520114900387592002801536650001401564650002001578650001901598650002101617650001601638650002401654650001301678650002401691650001501715650001401730650000901744650002401753650001701777650001501794650001501809650000901824651001001833653002901843653001401872653002401886653002301910653003101933700001601964700002001980773012802000856008502128852000902213655001202222IND60480188520221117030828.0160126e20160119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048018852DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2015.11096532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShri Ram,10aEffects of 41 Years of Application of Inorganic Fertilizers and Farm Yard Manure on Crop Yields, Soil Quality, and Sustainable Yield Index under a Rice-Wheat Cropping System on Mollisols of North India  ap. 179-193.  aThe present investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of integrated nutrient management (INM) on crop yield sustainability and soil quality in a long-term trial initiated during the wet season of 1971 under a humid subtropical climate. Over 41 years of study, 100% nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) + farm yard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha ⁻¹ recorded the most sustainable grain yields. Optimal and superoptimal NPK fertilizers gave quite similar crop yields to that of 100% NPK + FYM at 15 t ha –¹ up to two decades but thereafter yields declined sharply due to emergence of zinc (Zn) deficiency. The sustainable yield index (SYI) values indicated that wheat yields were more sustainable than rice. Soil organic carbon and available N, P, K, and Zn in the control plot decreased the most, whereas 100% NPK + FYM at 15 t ha –¹ improved available N, P and K, maintained soil organic carbon, and decreased Zn over initial levels. Grain yield and SYI were more significantly correlated with Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). Continuous application of FYM contributed the maximum Soil Quality Index (SQI) (0.94), followed by Zn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollisols 3aNPK fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3acropping systems 3agrain yield 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asubtropics 3awet season 3azinc 3aIndia 0aLong-term fertilizer use 0amollisols 0arice-wheat rotation 0asoil quality index 0asustainability yield index1 aSingh, Veer1 aSirari, Pradeep0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 47, no. 2 p.179-193dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2015.11096533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007500167300001600242520138700258592002801645650001501673650001101688650001301699650001101712650000901723650002101732650001501753650002901768650001601797650001001813650002501823653002701848653001501875653002301890700001301913700001701926700001801943773007701961856008302038852000902121655001202130IND60546140820221119074005.0160903e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054614082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmstrong, P.10aDomestic hot water storage: Balancing thermal and sanitary performance  ap. 334-339.  aThermal stratification within hot water tanks maximises the availability of stored energy and facilitates optimal use of both conventional and renewable energy sources. However, stratified tanks are also associated with the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, such as Legionella, due to the hospitable temperatures that arise during operation. Sanitary measures, aimed at homogenising the temperature distribution throughout the tank, have been proposed; such measures reduce the effective energy storage capability that is otherwise available. Here we quantify the conflict that arises between thermodynamic performance and bacterial sterilisation within 10 real world systems. Whilst perfect stratification enhances the recovery of hot water and reduces heat losses, water samples revealed significant bacterial growth attributable to stratification (P<0.01). Temperature measurements indicated that users were exposed to potentially unsanitary water as a result. De-stratifying a system to sterilise bacteria led to a 19% reduction in effective hot water storage capability. Increasing the tank size to compensate for this loss would lead to an 11% increase in energy consumed through standing heat losses. Policymakers, seeking to utilise hot water tanks as demand response assets, should consider monitoring and control systems that prevent exposures to unsanitary hot water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aassets 3abacteria 3aenergy 3aheat 3amicrobial growth 3amonitoring 3arenewable energy sources 3asterilizing 3atanks 3atemperature profiles 0aThermal energy storage 0aLegionella 0aDomestic hot water1 aAger, D.1 aThompson, I.1 aMcCulloch, M.0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 May, v. 68 p.334-339dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245012700201500002000328520176200348592002802110596003902138650001702177650002002194650001502214650001602229650001502245650001502260650001302275650001302288650002902301650000902330700002502339700006602364700006002430700002202490700002102512773013602533856007702669852000902746655001202755IND60789800920221120030742.0220822e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078980092DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0164992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrekke, Camilla1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6925-312710aIntegrated Analysis of Multisensor Datasets and Oil Drift Simulations—A Free‐Floating Oil Experiment in the Open Ocean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA free‐floating oil spill experiment (two oil types) in the open ocean is described, and the results from slick characterization through integrated analysis of drift simulations with remote sensing and in situ data are discussed. We compare oil drift simulations (OpenOil), applying various configurations of wind, wave, and current information, with the observed slick positions and shape. We describe trajectories and dynamics of the spills, slick extent, and their evolution, and the differences in detection capabilities in optical instruments versus multifrequency PolSAR acquired by Deutsches Zentrum für Luft‐und Raumfahrt F‐SAR. When using the best available forcing from in situ data and forecast models, good agreement with the observed position and extent was found. A fair agreement is obtained using only numerical forecast data as input. This case study reveals that the accuracy when using modeled current is relatively higher after one full local inertial period, as the effect of incorrectly modeled amplitude of the inertial current is then vanishing. This should be a general result applicable to any oceanic drift forecast based on the modeled current. A novelty is the comparison of viscous‐similar soybean and mineral oil. Our findings indicate that biological oil emulsions potentially could replace mineral oil emulsions in contingency and rehearsal campaigns, but this finding is only supported from an oil drift prediction perspective. Differences in mineral oil detection capabilities are found between synthetic aperture radar and optical imagery of thinner sheen regions. F‐SAR appears to be more sensitive to thinner oil and detect a larger extent, and differences between the thinner and thicker parts are observed.  aPublisher supplied data  a237906cResearch Council of Norway 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3amineral oil 3aoil spills 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asoybeans 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awind1 aEspeseth, Martine M.1 aDagestad, Knut‐Frode1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0412-74851 aRöhrs, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8402-29251 aHole, Lars Robert1 aReigber, Andreas0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.e2020JC016499-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0164993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009700172300001800269520141700287592002801704650001901732650003801751650003301789650002201822650003001844650001201874650002501886650001301911650001101924650001101935650002701946650000901973650000901982650001401991650001202005650001302017650001102030650001402041650001102055650003202066650001402098650001102112650001402123650001302137650000902150650000902159651001602168653001902184653001302203653000802216653000802224653002402232700002402256700002102280700002302301700002102324700002402345700002002369773013902389856008502528852000902613655001202622IND60408272820221119153142.0150916e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040827282DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2015.10136312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Busaidi, Moza10aFatty Acid Profile and Selected Chemical Contaminants in Yellowfin Tuna From the Arabian Sea  ap. 2764-2775.  aFresh yellowfin tuna (n = 110) collected for a period of one year was analyzed for chemical composition, fatty acids, nutrients, and toxic metals. The mean values of investigated minerals were 892, 2834, 0.81, 6.61, 0.38, 11.0, 0.94, 0.59, 0.71, 0.53, and 0.29 mg kg –¹ for Na, K, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Sr, and V, respectively. Average Cd, Pb and Hg levels were 0.016, 0.029 and 0.137 mg kg ⁻¹, respectively. The average concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were 196.56, 84.8, and 218 mg 100g –¹, respectively. Yellowfin tuna contained higher DHA (148.2 mg 100g –¹) than EPA (29.3 mg 100 g –¹). A meal with 100 g of this species provides 48.6 and 71.05% of the required daily level of protein and EPA+DHA, respectively. Yellowfin tuna showed low thrombogenic (0.27) and atherogenic (0.43) potential and the value obtained for h/H index (1.97) indicates that regular intake of yellowfin tuna may bring hypocholesterolemic effect. All contaminants in the studied fish were either undetectable or present at very low levels when compared to the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), and European Union regulatory standards and yellowfin tuna would be one of the best options for people who frequently consume tuna fish to get sufficient EPA+DHA and essential elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aThunnus albacares 3aWorld Health Organization 3acadmium 3acholesteremic effect 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afatty acid composition 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3aminerals 3anickel 3anutrients 3apeople 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apotassium 3asodium 3astrontium 3atoxicity 3atuna 3azinc 3aArabian Sea 0aYellowfin tuna 0aMinerals 0aEPA 0aDHA 0aOmega-3 fatty acids1 aYesudhason, Poulose1 aAl-Rabhi, Waleed1 aAl-Harthy, Khadija1 aAl-Waili, Aaliah1 aAl-Mazrooei, Nashwa1 aAl-Habsi, Saoud0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2015 Dec. 2, v. 18, no. 12 p.2764-2775dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2015.10136313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013500160300001400295520206900309592002802378650002302406650001102429650001902440650001502459650002302474650002302497650001402520650001902534650001502553650002702568650001102595650000902606650001102615650001602626651001102642651001102653700002102664700001702685700002102702773011502723856007302838852000902911655001202920IND60081450620221121165931.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008145062DNAL7 a10.1111/boj.121952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovino, Antonio10aGenetic and morphologic diversity of European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis L.) populations from different environments from Sicily  ap. 66-81.  aChamaerops humilis is decreasing in abundance in Mediterranean Europe, which has induced the European community to call for its protection in Special Areas of Conservation. However, information about its genetic and morphological variability, which is crucial to the development of any conservation strategies, is insufficient. The present study aimed to investigate the genetic and morphological variability of C. humilis in Sicily, which was selected as a model because of the high number of dense populations. The relationships between morphological traits and climatic variables were studied to highlight patterns of adaptation to the environment, along with the genetic similarity among the populations. Ten natural populations were sampled, analyzed using 28 specifically designed SSR primers, and evaluated based on 29 morphological traits. The populations were clustered similarly based on genetic and morphological traits. Heterozygosity was high and inbreeding coefficients were low. These results, along with higher intra‐ than inter‐population differentiation, suggest that C. humilis populations in Sicily differentiated from a common ancestor and that inter‐population variation arose from secondary evolution processes induced by ecological adaptation. The correlations between climatic variables and morphological traits suggest that the morphological adaptation to arid environments depends more on summer temperatures than on evapotranspiration or rainfall and that autumn and winter temperatures are determinants of the species establishment at new sites. Considering the response of C. humilis to seasonal temperatures, the present results indicate this species as a candidate for tracking climatic changes in Europe. Further studies are needed to highlight the adaptation of C. humilis to cold environments. Palaeo‐climatological and ‐ecological studies could help clarify its strategies for the colonization of new sites. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 176, 66–81.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaerops humilis 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3acold zones 3aconservation areas 3aevapotranspiration 3aevolution 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3arain 3asummer 3atemperature 3aEurope 3aSicily1 aScibetta, Silvia1 aSaia, Sergio1 aGuarino, Carmine0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2014 Sept., v. 176, no. 1 p.66-81dAcademic Press.x0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/boj.121953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007900167300001600246520128200262592002801544650002101572650001501593650001401608650001401622650001501636650001701651650001301668650001401681650002001695650001901715650002701734650001901761653002101780653001901801653001901820653002001839653001701859700001801876700001201894700001401906773009701920856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60629023120221119045832.0191024e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062902312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yasong10aRapid and efficient activated sludge treatment by electro-Fenton oxidation  ap. 181-190.  aAdvanced oxidation process is one of the important process to improve the efficiency of activated sludge dewatering and digestion. In this study, electro-Fenton (EF) was investigated as a pretreatment method for improving activated sludge dewatering and disintegration in terms of specific resistance to filtration, volatile suspended solids removal and release of soluble organics. The morphology of sludge flocs and properties of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were investigated to understand the involved mechanisms. The results showed that EF could increase the dewaterability of activated sludge effectively in 40–60 min. The size of sludge flocs decreased after EF treatment, but zeta potential was elevated to near zero and floc structure became coarser with bigger holes. EF could enhance the sludge floc disintegration, released protein and polysaccharide to soluble EPS fraction, and promote the humification process. The kinetic analysis further indicated that EF increased the pseudo first-order EPS solubilization rate. EF had high operational stability by retaining over 90% initial activity even after five repeated use of dewatering filtrate. This study provides a rapid and efficient solution for improving sludge dewaterability by electro-Fenton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3adewatering 3adigestion 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3ahumification 3akinetics 3aoxidation 3apolysaccharides 3asolubilization 3atotal suspended solids 3azeta potential 0aActivated sludge 0aElectro-fenton 0aDewaterability 0aFloc properties 0aHumification1 aChen, Huiping1 aLi, Jie1 aXiao, Lin0 tWater research.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.181-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245011700160300001600277520136200293592002801655650001601683650001501699650001501714650001301729650001101742650003101753650001401784650001501798650001901813650001801832773009601850856007101946852000902017655001202026IND60518966320221116182932.0160419e199604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051896632DNAL7 a10.2307/22654962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothhaupt, Karl O.10aLaboratorary Experiments with a Mixotrophic Chrysophyte and Obligately Phagotrophic and Photographic Competitors  ap. 716-724.  aMixotrophic flagellates can compete with obligately heterotrophic flagellates for the uptake of food particles, whereas mixotrophs and obligately phototrophic phytoplankton can compete for soluble nutrients. Competition for soluble nutrients is expected when photosynthesis covers a significant portion of the mixotrophs' carbon metabolism. When heterotrophy predominates, however, mixotrophs may release soluble nutrients and facilitate phototrophs. Mechanistic resource competition theory predicts that, due to their ability to utilize substitutable C and P sources, mixotrophs should be able to coexist with their more specialized competitors under certain conditions of resource supply. In laboratory experiments, the mixotrophic flagellate Ochromonas excluded heterotrophic flagellates when only phototrophic growth was possible. However, Ochromonas was excluded by heterotrophic flagellates when only phagotrophic growth was possible. Both coexisted when food bacteria and light were supplied simultaneously. Ochromonas coexisted with a P—limited phytoplankter, Cryptomonas sp., when soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and bacterial phosphorus were available as alternative P sources. In nature, the mixotrophic strategy may be successful when resources are limiting. This is supported by published data on the occurrence of mixotrophic chrysophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomonas 3aOchromonas 3aautotrophs 3abacteria 3acarbon 3alaboratory experimentation 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoplankton0 tEcology.g1996 Apr., v. 77, no. 3 p.716-724dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/22654963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245008300207300001200290506007600302520121400378592002801592506003701620650000801657650002001665650002401685650001601709650002501725650001601750650002901766700001801795700002001813700001501833700001701848700001601865773011701881856008201998852000902080655001202089IND60660636820221207131636.0190919e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066063682DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1868-42doi7 aPMC67085152pmcid7 a314974602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shufang12aA high storage density strategy for digital information based on synthetic DNA  ap. 342.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA has been recognized as a promising natural medium for information storage. The expensive DNA synthesis process makes it an important challenge to utilize DNA nucleotides optimally and increase the storage density. Thus, a novel scheme is proposed for the storage of digital information in synthetic DNA with high storage density and perfect error correction capability. The proposed strategy introduces quaternary Huffman coding to compress the binary stream of an original file before it is converted into a DNA sequence. The proposed quaternary Huffman coding is based on the statistical properties of the source and can gain a very high compression ratio for files with a non-uniform probability distribution of the source. Consequently, the amount of information that each base can store increases, and the storage density is also improved. In addition, quaternary Hamming code with low redundancy is proposed to correct errors occurring in the synthesis and sequencing. We have successfully converted a total of 5.2 KB of files into 3934 bits in DNA bases. The results of biological experiment indicate that the storage density of the proposed scheme is higher than that of state-of-the-art schemes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3ainformation storage 3anucleobases 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aprobability distribution1 aHuang, Beibei1 aSong, Xiangming1 aZhang, Tao1 aWang, Hanjie1 aLiu, Yuhong0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Sept., v. 9, no. 9 p.342-342dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1868-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03872naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015700182300001600339520173900355592002802094650002302122650000802145650002402153650004302177650002302220650003002243650002102273650001202294650002002306650001002326650002202336650003102358650003302389650002002422650001402442650001002456650001402466650001202480650001402492650001202506650003002518650002102548650002502569650006302594650002402657650003202681650001302713650007302726650003802799650004602837650002202883650002402905651001302929700002202942700002502964773014202989852000903131856008203140655001203222IND4386037720221122160226.0200303e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438603772DNAL7 a163628182pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-005-0218-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Lina P.10aExploiting the genetic diversity of Beauveria bassiana for improving the biological control of the coffee berry borer through the use of strain mixtures  ap. 918-926.  aBeauveria bassiana is an entomopathogen widely used to control the coffee berry borer in Colombia, as part of an Integrated Pest Management strategy. Traditionally, the development of fungal insect pathogens as biocontrol agents in crop pests has been oriented towards the selection and formulation of elite clonal strains. Instead, we explored the potential application of genetic diversity in B. bassiana by determining the effect of strain mixtures on coffee berry borer mortality compared to clonal isolates. Genomic DNA from 11 strains was characterized using internal transcribed spacers and β-tubulin sequences as well as amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Cluster analysis produced three genetic groups and confirmed the low but significant intraspecific genetic diversity present among the strains. Single strain virulence towards the coffee berry borer under laboratory conditions, using 1×10⁶ conidia ml⁻¹, ranged between 89.9 and 57.5%. All the inoculations with mixtures resulted in coinfection events. Combinations of genetically similar strains showed no significant differences when their virulences were compared. However, mixtures of genetically different strains led to both antagonism and synergism. The lowest virulence percentage (57%) was obtained by putting together the most virulent strain of each group, contrary to the highest virulence percentage (93%) that resulted from mixing the three least virulent strains. The results indicate the promising potential of designing strain mixtures as an alternative for the biocontrol of Hypothenemus hampei and other pests and provide tools for the understanding of the ecological dynamics of entomopathogen populations under natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aDNA 3aHypothenemus hampei 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acluster analysis 3aconidia 3aentomopathogens 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3aintegrated pest management 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apests 3asynergism 3atubulin 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxmicrobiology. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCoffeexparasitology 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFruitxparasitology 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aMitosporic Fungixgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aTubulinxanalysis 2aVirulencexgenetics 3aColombia1 aGaitan, Alvaro L.1 aGongora, Carmenza E.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2006 Aug., v. 71, no. 6 p.918-926dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-005-0218-03Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03338naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245006000175300001500235500001900250520206200269592002802331650002002359650001302379650001902392650001402411650001402425650001502439653001602454653001002470653002402480653000902504653003002513700002202543700002202565700001702587700002102604773020602625856008802831852000902919655001202928IND60721129220221121232054.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072112922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Jack G.10aMulti-directional change detection between point clouds  ap. 95-113.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPoint clouds continue to be acquired with greater accuracy and less occlusion over complex scenes, characterised by high roughness and topographic variation in all three dimensions. The most widely adopted approach to change detection, M3C2, measures change along the local surface normal, which varies between points and bypasses the uncertainties involved in mesh or DEM generation. While adaptive, this direction of comparison is nevertheless user-defined and becomes less relevant where the movement direction deviates from the surface normal. Measured change therefore also becomes less meaningful, as it is a projection onto this direction. Sliding of a failing slope, for example, is predominantly surface parallel rather than along the surface normal. We present an approach that derives a dominant movement direction (DMD) at each point based on multi-scale, multi-directional change quantifications. The DMDs differ from the surface normals in three LiDAR-derived test cases; a rockfall, an avalanche, and rock glacier movement, providing more accurate measures of rockfall depth and boulder movement across the rock glacier. When the direction of change detection is orthogonal to local relief (i.e. across the surface), a variable length search cylinder that intersects only a single (corresponding) surface is necessary during change detection. Where movement results in new regions of occlusion in the second point cloud, we show that the proportion of points for which no valid change could be recorded decreases by up to 15% using the DMD rather than the surface normal. We emphasise the importance of examining the direction over which change is measured, and highlight that a comparison direction that adapts to movement rather than to the local surface can provide more relevant and accurate measures of change where the movement is not orthogonal to the surface. Our approach represents a supplementary tool for cloud-to-cloud comparison, where a choice of tool should be made based on the expected DMD deviation from the surface normal.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aglaciers 3aphotogrammetry 3arockfalls 3aroughness 3atopography 0aPoint cloud 0aLiDAR 0a3D change detection 0aM3C2 0aCloud-to-cloud comparison1 aAnders, Katharina1 aWiniwarter, Lukas1 aZahs, Vivien1 aHöfle, Bernhard0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2021 Feb., v. 172 p.95-113dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Operating conditions of septic leach field systems, especially the degree of water saturation, are likely to impact microbial biogeochemical cycling, including carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. To study the impact of flooding on microbial methane (CH4) and nutrient cycling, two leach field soil columns were constructed. One system was operated as designed and the other was operated in both flooded and well-maintained conditions. CH4 emissions were significantly higher in flooded soils (with means between 0.047 and 0.33 g CH4 m−2 d−1) as compared to well-drained soils (means between −0.0025 and 0.004 g CH4 m−2 d−1). Subsurface CH4 profiles were also elevated under flooded conditions and peaked near the wastewater inlet. Gene abundances of mcrA, a biomarker for methanogens, were also greatest near the wastewater inlet. In contrast, gene abundances of pmoA, a biomarker for methanotrophs, were greatest in surface soils at the interface of CH4 produced subsurface and atmospheric oxygen. 16S rRNA, mcrA, and pmoA amplicon library sequencing revealed microbial community structure in the soil columns differed from that of the original soils and was driven largely by CH4 fluxes and soil VWC. Additionally, active microbial populations differed from those present at the gene level. Flooding did not appear to affect N or P removals in the soil columns (between 75 and 99% removal). COD removal was variable throughout the experiment, and was negatively impacted by flooding. Our study shows septic system leach field soils are dynamic environments where CH4 and nutrients are actively cycled by microbial populations. Our results suggest proper siting, installation, and routine maintenance of leach field systems is key to reducing the overall impact of these systems on water and air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3aflooded conditions 3agenes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amethanotrophs 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aribosomal RNA 3aseptic systems 3asewage 3asoil 3awastewater 0aSeptic leach field system 0aWastewater 0aMethane 0aMethanogen 0aMethanotrophs 0aOnsite wastewater treatment (OWTS)1 aOmar, Amir-Eldin H.1 aPollard, Jesse T.1 aRichardson, Ruth E.0 tWater research.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 151 p.456-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012800158300001600286520158100302592002801883650002901911650001501940650002001955650001801975650001001993650001302003650001902016650001502035650001402050650002202064650001102086700001802097700001302115700001602128700001902144700001502163773012602178856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60663130020221118033800.0190909e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066313002DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ib00054d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Xianjie10aPump-free multi-well-based microfluidic system for high-throughput analysis of size-control relative genes in budding yeast  ap. 685-693.  aTime-lapse single cell imaging by microscopy can provide precise cell information such as the cell size, the cell cycle duration, protein localization and protein expression level. Usually, a microfluidic system is needed for these measurements in order to provide a constant culture environment and confine the cells so that they grow in a monolayer. However, complex connections are required between the channels inside the chip and the outside media, and a complex procedure is needed for loading of cells, thereby making this type of system unsuitable for application in high-throughput single cell scanning experiments. Here we provide a novel and easily operated pump-free multi-well-based microfluidic system which enables the high-throughput loading of many different budding yeast strains into monolayer growth conditions just by use of a multi-channel pipette. Wild type budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 62 different budding yeast size control relative gene deletion strains were chosen for scanning. We obtained normalized statistical results for the mother cell doubling time, daughter cell doubling time, mother cell size and daughter cell size of different gene deletion strains relative to the corresponding parameters of the wild type cells. Meanwhile, we compared the typical cell morphology of different strains and analyzed the relationship between the cell genotype and phenotype. This method which can be easily used in a normal biology lab may help researchers who need to carry out the high-throughput scanning of cell morphology and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acell cycle 3acell structures 3agene deletion 3agenes 3agenotype 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3ayeasts1 aJiang, Lingli1 aChen, Xi1 aYuan, Haiyu1 aLuo, Chunxiong1 aOuyang, Qi0 tIntegrative biology.g2014 June 24, v. 6, no. 7 p.685-693dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ib00054d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011200169300001400281500001900295520260900314592002802923650001202951650002202963650001902985650001803004650001603022651001003038653002903048653002703077653001603104700001603120700001303136700001503149773020503164856008803369852000903457655001203466IND60721129320221121232022.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072112932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Linrong12aA novel surface water index using local background information for long term and large-scale Landsat images  ap. 59-78.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface water plays a vital role in natural environment and human development. The research of water extraction method using remote sensing image is a hot topic, which has been widely developed in water index, classification, subpixel, and other aspects. Compared with other methods, a water-index based method has the advantages of fast speed and convenience. The characteristics of surface water, such as wide coverage and instability, make the water index stand out in monitoring large area of surface water. However, land surface in water environment is complex, and the main factors that reduce water extraction accuracy are also different, such as shadow in urban areas and water leakage in unshaded areas. The current index is bound to weaken the information in the water body when suppressing shadows, and vice versa. To address these issues, contrast difference water index (CDWI) and shadow difference water index (SDWI) are proposed in this paper by improving the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). CDWI is used to enhance water information, which is suitable for areas without building shadows. SDWI is used to eliminate the shadow of buildings, which is suitable for urban areas. Moreover, background difference water index (BDWI) was proposed by combining the advantages of CDWI and SDWI through a background regularizer B, which is used to extract surface water under complex background. The regularizer B represents the similarity between local background features of the image and the reference urban area, which is used to locally weight SDWI and CDWI, so that BDWI can automatically enhance the water body in the shadowless area and eliminate the shadow of buildings. The water extraction results of BDWI, MNDWI, the tasseled cap wetness index (TCW), the automatic water extraction index (AWEInsh, AWEIsh), and the water index 2015 (WI2015) were used for comparison. Other methods tend to perform well only in built-up areas or non-built-up areas, while the BDWI can extract surface water under various backgrounds with high accuracy and stability. The overall accuracy produced by the BDWI was 91.58–97.57%, CDWI was 84.85–97.09%, SDWI was 81.63–94.40%, MNDWI was 80.19–95.64%, TCW was 82.33–95.98%, AWEIsh was 87.50–96.37%, AWEInsh was 80.59–98.78%, and WI2015 was 78.24–98.38%. Combining water index with image local information is helpful to improve the accuracy of water extraction in large and complex environment. Finally, surface water in Jiangsu Province, China was extracted through BDWI and the changes in 1985, 2000, and 2015 were analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3ahuman development 3aphotogrammetry 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aSufarce water extraction 0aBackground information 0aWater index1 aSu, Hongjun1 aDu, Qian1 aWu, Taixia0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2021 Feb., v. 172 p.59-78dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Here, we assess the effects of a lifestyle intervention on T2D reversal or remission and the effects on the underlying pathology. In a Dutch primary care setting, 15 adults with an average T2D duration of 13.4 years who were (pharmacologically) treated for T2D received a diabetes subtyping (“diabetyping”) lifestyle intervention (DLI) for six months, aiming for T2D remission. T2D subtype was determined based on an OGTT. Insulin and sulphonylurea (SU) derivative treatment could be terminated for all participants. Body weight, waist/hip ratio, triglyceride levels, HbA1c, fasting, and 2h glucose were significantly improved after three and six months of intervention. Remission and reversal were achieved in two and three participants, respectively. Indices of insulin resistance and beta cell capacity improved, but never reached healthy values, resulting in unchanged T2D subtypes. Our study implies that achieving diabetes remission in individuals with a longer T2D duration is possible, but underlying pathology is only minimally affected, possibly due to an impaired beta cell function. Thus, even when T2D remission is achieved, patients need to continue adhering to lifestyle therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alifestyle 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathophysiology 3aremission 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist1 aOosterman, Johanneke E. 1 aOtten, Wilma 1 aKrijger, Anne-Margreeth 1 aBerbée-Zadelaar, Susanne 1 aPasman, Wilrike J. 1 avan Ommen, Ben 1 aPijl, Hanno 1 aWopereis, Suzan 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 25, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130721933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166300001600290520087400306592002801180650003401208650002101242650001401263650001201277650001801289650001401307653001201321653002201333653001601355653002101371653002301392653002101415700001401436700002001450700002101470700002901491700002001520700002301540700002201563773011601585856008201701852000901783655001201792IND60599127220221118055149.0180702e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059912722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2014.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jingjing10aCorrelating the degree of metal–promoter interaction to ethanol selectivity over MnRh/CNTs CO hydrogenation catalysts  ap. 149-158.  aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) were used as a support for Rh-based catalysts for high pressure (20bar) CO hydrogenation. 3wt% Rh/CNTs catalysts were loaded with 1wt% and 2wt% Mn promoter, respectively, in order to study the effect of metal–promoter interactions for ethanol synthesis.

The enhancement in the degree of metal–promoter interaction leads to an increase in the ethanol selectivity. Moreover, due to the nature of CNTs (low Z number), the Mn–Rh interactions could be observed at atomic resolution during the STEM–EELS characterization, and the promoter phase is confirmed as Mn(II) oxide by XANES and EELS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3aethanol 3ahydrogenation 3amanganese 0aRhodium 0aAlcohol synthesis 0aSTEM–EELS 0aCO hydrogenation 0aManganese promoter 0aCarbon nanotubes1 aGuo, Zhao1 aChilders, David1 aSchweitzer, Neil1 aMarshall, Christopher L.1 aKlie, Robert F.1 aMiller, Jeffrey T.1 aMeyer, Randall J.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2014 May, v. 313 p.149-158dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245012500201520140300326592002801729653002101757653002501778653003201803700002201835700002401857700001901881773013201900856007602032852000902108655001202117IND60562954820221118091025.0170719s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056295482DNAL7 a10.1038/mtna.2013.572doi7 aPMC40274262pmcid7 a241505772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xing-Li10aHIV Tat Domain Improves Cross-correction of Human Galactocerebrosidase in a Gene- and Flanking Sequence-dependent Manner  aKrabbe disease is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic approach for Krabbe disease. As the human brain is large and it is difficult to achieve global gene transduction, the efficacy of cross-correction is a critical determinant of the outcome of gene therapy for this disease. We investigated whether HIV Tat protein transduction domain (PTD) can improve the cross-correction of GALC. Tat-PTD significantly increased (~6-fold) cross-correction of GALC through enhanced secretion and uptake in a cell-culture model system. The effects of Tat-PTD were gene and flanking amino acids dependent. Tat-fusion increased the secretion of α-galactosidase A (α-gal A), but this did not improve its cross-correction. Tat-fusion did not change either secretion or uptake of β-glucocerebrosidase (GC). Tat-PTD increased GALC protein synthesis, abolished reactivity of GC to the 8E4 antibody, and likely reduced mannose phosphorylation in all these lysosomal enzymes. This study demonstrated that Tat-PTD can be useful for increasing cross-correction efficiency of lysosomal enzymes. However, Tat-PTD is not a mere adhesive motif but possesses a variety of biological functions. Therefore, the potential beneficial effect of Tat-PTD should be assessed individually on each lysosomal enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 0acorss-correction 0agalactocerebrosidase 0aprotein transduction domain1 aEtō, Yoshikatsu,1 aSchiffmann, Raphael1 aShen, Jin-Song0 tMolecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids.g2013, v. 2 p.e130-dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Society of Gene & Cell Therapyx2162-25317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mtna.2013.573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006500166300001600231500001100247520106700258592002801325650002501353650001101378650001501389650001801404650001201422650001601434650001301450650004401463650001301507650001101520650001601531700001801547700001801565700001701583700001301600700001301613700001901626773012201645856008201767852000901849655001201858IND60645276520221120041346.0190528e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064527652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-019-09601-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Guohong14aThe overlooked rotational isomerism of C-glycosyl flavonoids  ap. 443-461.  aReview  aC-glycosyl flavonoids are important secondary plant metabolites with a wide range of biological activities. Rotational isomerism, arising from restricted bond rotation, has been observed on a portion of C-glycosyl flavonoids. NMR technique contributes most to the observation and research of this phenomenon. Signal duplication in NMR spectra may be the key characteristic of C-glycosyl flavonoids existing as rotamers. Bulky steric hindrance from the substituents at position 7 and sugar moieties are responsible for the restricted bond rotation. There are other influence factors including temperature, solvents, H-bonds and π-stacking, but these are of lesser importance. Difference exists between 8-C-glycosyl flavonoids and their 6-C-glycosyl isomers despite sharing the same flavonoid aglycone and sugar moiety. 8-C-glycosyl flavonoids are more likely to suffer from restricted rotation. The energy barriers between rotamers of C-glycosyl flavonoids seem not high enough for atropisomerism to be realized and the isolation of rotamers should be difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3aenergy 3aflavonoids 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3ametabolites 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3asugars 3atemperature1 aYan, Renliang1 aWang, Xiaogen1 aHua, Shaozi,1 aLin, Jin1 aLiu, Jia1 aZhao, Zhendong0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2019 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.443-461dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-019-09601-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011100165520128400276592002801560650002401588650002801612650001501640650002401655650001501679650001101694700002201705700002101727700002201748700001901770700001701789700002301806700002001829700002501849700002101874773012201895856007402017852000902091655001202100IND60745551720221119230729.0210723e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074555172DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130721922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsushita, Tatsuya 10aEffect of Improvement in Sarcopenia on Functional and Discharge Outcomes in Stroke Rehabilitation Patients  aThis cross-sectional study investigated the proportion of patients’ recovery from sarcopenia status and the relationship between improvement in sarcopenia (IS) and function and discharge outcome in hospitalized patients with stroke. This study included patients with stroke, aged 65 years or more, with a diagnosis of sarcopenia, who were admitted to a convalescent rehabilitation ward. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Patients were divided according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia at discharge: IS group and non-improvement in sarcopenia (NIS) group. Among the 227 participants (mean age: 80.5 years; 125 females), 30% (69/227) of the patients were in the IS group, while 70% (158/227) were in the NIS group. The IS group showed a higher Functional Independence Measure (FIM) than the NIS group (median 112 vs. 101, p = 0.003). The results demonstrated that IS was independently associated with higher FIM (partial regression coefficient, 5.378; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.709–10.047). The IS group had higher odds of home discharge than the NIS group (odds ratio, 2.560; 95% CI, 0.912–7.170). In conclusion, recovery from sarcopenia may be associated with better function in patients with stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3asarcopenia 3astroke1 aNishioka, Shinta 1 aTaguchi, Shiori 1 aYamanouchi, Anna 1 aOkazaki, Yuka 1 aOishi, Kana 1 aNakashima, Ryusei 1 aFujii, Tatsuya 1 aTokunaga, Yoshiharu 1 aOnizuka, Shinya 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 25, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130721923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04535naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002300125024001700148024002800165024002200193024001900215024001200234040001800246100002200264245009700286300001600383500001900399506007600418506017300494506003100667520233500698596004503033506003703078650002403115650001203139650001903151650002003170650002103190650000903211650001503220650002003235650001603255650002003271650001403291650002103305650001603326650002903342700001703371700002103388700001803409700002103427700001903448773014403467856007503611856007403686956014303760961000903903852000903912655001203921IND60660639420221215142335.0190826e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066063942DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/icz0962chorus7 a10113/66063942hdl7 a3607512aris7 a10.1093/icb/icz0962doi7 aPMC67039982pmcid7 a311730752pmid8 ans17963  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelicher, Dacotah10aImmediate Transcriptional Response to a Temperature Pulse under a Fluctuating Thermal Regime  ap. 320-337.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aCHORUS License Information  aThe response of ectotherms to temperature stress is complex, non-linear, and is influenced by life stage and previous thermal exposure. Mortality is higher under constant low temperatures than under a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) that maintains the same low temperature but adds a brief, daily pulse of increased temperature. Long term exposure to FTR has been shown to increase transcription of genes involved in oxidative stress, immune function, and metabolic pathways, which may aid in recovery from chill injury and oxidative damage. Previous research suggests the transcriptional response that protects against sub-lethal damage occurs rapidly under exposure to fluctuating temperatures. However, existing studies have only examined gene expression after a week or over many months. Here we characterize gene expression during a single temperature cycle under FTR. Development of pupating alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) was interrupted at the red-eye stage and were transferred to 6C with a 1-h pulse to 20C and returned to 6C. RNA was collected before, during, and after the temperature pulse and compared to pupae maintained at a static 6C. The warm pulse is sufficient to cause expression of transcripts that repair cell membrane damage, modify membrane composition, produce antifreeze proteins, restore ion homeostasis, and respond to oxidative stress. This pattern of expression indicates that even brief exposure to warm temperatures has significant protective effects on insects exposed to stressful cold temperatures that persist beyond the warm pulse. Megachile rotundata’s sensitivity to temperature fluctuations indicates that short exposures to temperature changes affect development and physiology. Genes associated with developmental patterning are expressed after the warm pulse, suggesting that 1 h at 20C was enough to resume development in the pupae. The greatest difference in gene expression occurred between pupae collected after the warm pulse and at constant low temperatures. Although both were collected at the same time and temperature, the transcriptional response to one FTR cycle included multiple transcripts previously identified under long-term FTR exposure associated with recovery from chill injury, indicating that the effects of FTR occur rapidly and are persistent.  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMegachile rotundata 3aalfalfa 3acell membranes 3achilling injury 3achronic exposure 3acold 3aectothermy 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics)1 aTorson, Alex1 aAnderson, Tanner1 aYocum, George1 aRinehart, Joseph1 aBowsher, Julia0 tIntegrative and comparative biology.g2019 Aug., v. 59, no. 2 p.320-337dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl4257570x1540-70637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz0963Available from publisher's site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz0963Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2019%20Integrative%20Comparative%20Biology%2059%282%29%20320-337.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010300174300001600277520123900293592002801532650002101560650003601581650001701617650001601634650002001650650002101670650001201691650001701703650002301720650001901743653001701762653003601779653001701815653001701832653002601849700002001875700002101895700002001916700001701936700001901953773008401972856008502056852000902141655001202150IND60554084320221120073216.0161024e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055408432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Gary Ro-Lin10aCharacterization of tubule and monomer derived from VP4 protein of infectious bursal disease virus  ap. 882-889.  aThe VP4 protein of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a serine protease that processes the polyprotein for viral assembly. VP4 has been found to associate primarily with type II IBDV tubules that are 24nm in diameter. In this study, a chimeric VP4, assigned as HS1VP4, was constructed with a VP4-autocleavage site inserted between the N-terminal His-tag and the VP4 sequence. The results showed that the VP4 forms tubules after the self-cleavage of HS1VP4 when expressed in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, a deletion of 28 amino acids at the C-terminus of VP4 resulted in monomers and dimers instead of tubule formation; mutants of S652A and K692A at active site destroyed the activity. The endopeptidase activity of these monomers and dimers was approximately 12.5 times higher than that of VP4 tubules. Additionally, the formation of tubules inhibited VP4 protease activity, as demonstrated through in vitro assays.

The asymmetrical functions could not be explained in terms of mediation of choice responding by magazine head-entry behavior during the retention interval. Unlike within-session changes in retention interval, between-session changes did not result in steeper forgetting functions for food samples. These results in rats are consistent with previous findings reported for the presence and absence of visual samples in pigeons (Wixted, 1993).  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3ahedonic scales 3aoperant conditioning 3apigeons 3arats1 aSimmons, Sabrina1 aMischler, Shannon0 tBehavioural processes.g2011 Oct., v. 88, no. 2 p.121-126dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04042naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013700176520220600313592002802519653000902547653000802556653000902564653000902573653000802582653000802590653000802598653000802606653000902614653001102623653001102634653001002645653001002655653001102665653001102676653001002687653001002697653000902707653000802716653000702724653000702731653000802738653000702746653001202753653001502765653003602780653001702816653002402833700005502857700001602912700001802928700002102946700001702967700002202984700002303006700006303029700002003092700001803112700005903130773008703189856008303276852000903359655001203368IND60685207920221119092625.0200330e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068520792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1445092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Hajj Chehadeh, Sarah10aImplication of genetic variants in overweight and obesity susceptibility among the young Arab population of the United Arab Emirates  aOverweight and obesity are major risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Genetic predisposition has been shown to play a key role in obesity, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci linked with obesity in various ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to validate the reported genetic variants associated with obesity and overweight in a young UAE Arab population.Twenty-two associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 11 loci (FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, KCTD15, MTCH2, SH2B1, TFAP2B, GNPDA2, NEGR1, PCSK1 and BDNF) were studied in 392 controls and 318 overweight/obese young Emiratis (aged 18–35 years).After adjusting for age and smoking, rs3751812 of the FTO gene was associated with overweight/obesity in male participants (p-value < 0.016), while SNPs rs17782313, rs571312 of the MC4R gene and rs12463617 of the TMEM18 gene were significantly associated with overweight/obesity in female participants (p-value = 0.001, 0.028, 0.044, respectively). Follow-up association tests and logistic regression revealed the contribution of the FTO rs3751812 and MC4R rs571213 SNPs to the risk of overweight/obesity after adjusting for age, sex and smoking (p-value = 0.044, 0.049, respectively). In addition, the FTO rs3751812 was associated with the risk of overweight/obesity after adjusting for the effect of other markers (rs17782313, rs571312, rs2867125, rs6548238 and rs12463617) (p-value = 0.035). A significant gene-gene interaction was seen between FTO, MCR4 and TMEM18 (p-value = 0.013).Our data demonstrates that rs3751812 of the FTO gene is the key SNP associated with risk of overweight/obesity among the young UAE Arab population, in alignment with previous findings. Our results also indicate that the identified genes stratify with sex and risk of overweight/obesity. In addition to their direct association with overweight/obesity, rs17782313 and rs571312, as well as rs2867125 and rs6548238, may have a modifying effect on the risk of overweight/obesity caused by the rs3751812. Population-specific, sex-specific genetic profiling is important in understanding the heritability of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aT2DM 0aCVD 0aGWAS 0aSNPs 0aBMI 0aWHO 0aGCC 0aFTO 0aMC4R 0aTMEM18 0aKCTD15 0aMTCH2 0aSH2B1 0aTFAP2B 0aGNPDA2 0aNEGR1 0aPCSK1 0aBDNF 0aMAF 0aWC 0aSD 0aHWE 0aLD 0aObesity 0aOverweight 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms 0aYoung adults 0aUAE Arab population1 aOsman, Wael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1921-80211 aNazar, Suna1 aJerman, Laila1 aAlghafri, Ameera1 aSajwani, Ali1 aAlawlaqi, Mohamed1 aAlObeidli, Mohamed1 aJelinek, Herbert F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5457-61931 aAlAnouti, Fatme1 aKhalaf, Kinda1 aAlsafar, Habiba1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7141-14380 tGene.g2020 May 20, v. 739 p.144509-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1445093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170520147900269592002801748650001501776650001401791650001101805650000901816653002101825653002501846653001901871653001901890700001701909700001801926700002701944700002501971700001801996773011402014856008602128852000902214655001202223IND60769447220221118012841.0220929e20220605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076944722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Pengfei10aEnhanced transformation capability towards benzo(a)pyrene by Fe(III)-modified manganese oxides  aManganese oxides (Mn oxides) are ubiquitous and may coexist with Fe(III) ions in soil environments. In this study, acid birnessite, alkaline birnessite, cryptomelane, pyrolusite, manganite, and their Fe(III)-modified analogues were synthesized and used for benzo(a)pyrene transformation. Fe-modified Mn oxides show a markedly enhanced transformation capability towards benzo(a)pyrene. Specifically, the benzo(a)pyrene transformation rate constants k for Bir-H, Bir-OH, Cry, Pyr, and Man were 0.49, 0.080, 0.0071, 0.0055, and 0.0022 h⁻¹, respectively. After Fe(III) modification, the transformation rate constants were increased to 22, 2.7, 0.25, 0.0072 and 0.0098 h⁻¹, respectively. Fe(III)-modified layered birnessites exhibited better activity than Fe(III)-modified tunnel Mn oxides, which was attributed to their high Fe(III) contents and abundant active free radicals. Fe(III) was found to accept electrons from benzo(a)pyrene, thereby accelerating the benzo(a)pyrene transformation. Moreover, modification with Fe(III) increased the surface adsorbed water and oxygen, and promoted the generation of active free radicals. Finally, the physicochemical and biochemical properties of transformation products showed the environmental benefits of this process. Overall, the results indicate that the occurrence of Fe(III) ions could promote the removal of PAHs in Mn oxides-rich soils, and this study provides a credible understanding of PAH fates in natural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirnessite 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3asoil 0aManganese oxides 0aFe(III) modification 0aBenzo(a)pyrene 0aTransformation1 aLin, Zhipeng1 aZhao, Xuqiang1 aWaigi, Michael Gatheru1 aVasilyeva, Galina K.1 aGao, Yanzheng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 June 05, v. 431 p.128637-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006400174300001800238520110800256592002801364650001201392650002801404650003601432650001301468650001701481650001401498650001901512650001301531650001301544700002001557773010501577856008601682852000901768655001201777IND60578219520221121162744.0170812e20160809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057821952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b014972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Kimberly C.10aMicrogel Surface Modification with Self-Assembling Peptides  ap. 5366-5373.  aWe describe the fabrication of peptide-coated microgels, where a fibrillizing peptide (RADA)4 self-assembles on the surface of hydrogel microparticles. The incorporation of an anionic comonomer into the microgel network is required for a stable colloidal dispersion to be obtained when particles are incubated with (RADA)4, suggesting that the assembly is dependent on Coulombic interactions. We further demonstrate the modification of the (RADA)4 shell by preparing coassemblies of (RADA)4 and a fluorescently labeled (RADA)4 peptide. Additionally, the (RADA)4 shell can be modified through postassembly conjugation of a cysteine residue or a non-natural amino acid bearing an alkyne moiety. Fluorescence and atomic force microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy were employed to characterize the assembly and modification of the peptide shell. Finally, our attempt to utilize a different fibrillizing peptide (Q11) in the formation of peptide-coated microgels was unsuccessful, demonstrating that the identity of the building blocks is important in the fabrication of these composite assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aatomic force microscopy 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acysteine 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3amicroparticles 3amoieties 3apeptides1 aLyon, L.

It has been found to be effective in metal extraction. However, due to the distribution and speciation in soils, most metal(loid)s are present in less mobile forms which limit the washing efficiency. Therefore, methods are studied to enhance the washing performance by increasing the metals solubility and availability. This paper introduces some currently used methods and technologies, including the optimization of washing variables, lowering soil pH, application of assisted amendments and integration of electro-kinetic remediation and ultrasonication to enhance the removal of metals. In addition, it also suggests some further studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014B04814cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2015B05814cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2016B04314cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2017B755X14cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a201301017cSpecial Fund for Hydro-scientific Research in the Public Interest  aSJZZ16_0083cJiangsu Scientifical Research Innovation Program of Ordinary Higher Education Graduate  aSJCX17_0129cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province 3aheavy metals 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3asoil pH 3asoil washing 3asolubility 3aultrasonic treatment 3awashing1 aMao, Xinyu1 aShao, Xiaohou1 aHan, Fengxiang1 aChang, Tingting1 aQin, Hengji1 aLi, Minhui0 tAgricultural research.g2018 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.99-104dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-018-0302-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014800176500001900324520198900343592002802332650001402360650001402374650001902388650001202407650000902419650002402428650001602452650001702468650000902485650001602494653001002510653001002520653001002530700001902540700006202559700006002621700006202681700005802743773010602801856008702907852000902994655001203003IND60717913320221116153430.0210121e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1027902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCormick, James J.10aImpaired autophagy following ex vivo heating at physiologically relevant temperatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from elderly adults  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the increasing threat of climate change and the accompanying rise in the frequency and severity of extreme heat events, there are growing health concerns for heat-vulnerable elderly adults. Elderly adults are at increased risk of developing heat-related injuries, in part due to age-related declines in thermoregulatory and cellular function. Regarding the latter, the process of autophagy is activated as a cellular protective mechanism to counter heat-induced stress, but the extent that heat stress activates autophagy in elderly adults is not known. Further, the interplay between autophagy, the heat shock response (HSR), the acute inflammatory response, and apoptosis remains poorly understood in elderly adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine changes in autophagy, the HSR, inflammation, and apoptosis following increasing levels of ex vivo heat stress representative of physiologically relevant increases in body core temperatures (37-41 °C). Whole blood from 20 elderly adults (72 ± 4 years; 14 men, 6 women) was heated (via water immersion) to temperatures representative of normal resting conditions (normothermia; 37 °C), in addition to moderate and severe heat stress conditions (39, and 41 °C, respectively) for 90 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and protein markers of autophagy, the HSR, acute inflammation, and apoptosis were examined. No significant increases in markers of autophagy or the HSR were observed following any temperature condition. However, an increase in acute inflammation was observed above baseline following moderate heat stress (39 °C), with further increases in inflammation and apoptosis observed during severe heat stress (41 °C). Our findings indicate that PBMCs from elderly adults do not exhibit increases in autophagy or the HSR following severe heat stress, potentially contributing to the elevated risk of cellular dysfunction seen in elderly adults during heat stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3aclimate change 3aelderly 3aheat 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3ainflammation 3arisk 3atemperature 0aHSP70 0aHSP90 0aAging1 aKing, Kelli E.1 aCôté, Melissa D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0939-29711 aMeade, Robert D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5922-40821 aAkerman, Ashley P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9194-21481 aKenny, Glen P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8683-69730 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 Jan., v. 95 p.102790-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1027903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011700172300001800289520204600307592002802353650002202381650000802403650001402411650001502425650001102440650002202451650001502473650000902488650001102497650000902508650001002517650002102527650001602548650001402564700001702578700001702595700001502612700002002627700001802647700001702665773010502682856008902787852000902876655001202885IND60534206220221122024309.0160802e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053420622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b013302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Changjiu10aEnhance Oil Recovery for Steam Flooding: Low-Temperature Oxidative Decomposition of Heavy Oil with Air Injection  ap. 6242-6249.  aWith the increasing demand of energy, technical research of how to enhance oil recovery of steam flooding for heavy oil reservoirs has attracted widespread attention at present. Air-injection is an effective technology that has been used to improve the development effect of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. The low-temperature oxidation (LTO) reaction and the high-temperature combustion reaction are the main mechanisms of air-injection technology. The high-temperature combustion reaction can decompose the heavy component in heavy oil, but it requires a higher-temperature condition, which the steam flooding process cannot offer. In addition, the LTO reaction between air and heavy oil consumes the O₂, so the safety risk of explosion caused by the mixture of O₂ and hydrocarbon gas can be eliminated. Nevertheless, oil viscosity will increase. During the steam flooding process, an aquathermolysis reaction occurs between heavy oil and high-temperature water, which decreases the content of the heavy component in heavy oil. Besides, catalyst MnO₂ promotes the reaction by decreasing the activation energy of the reaction. In this paper, several static oxidative decomposition experiments are conducted to study the change characteristics of pressure, gas composition, oil composition, and oil viscosity after the reactions with different temperatures, pressures, and water saturations. In addition, four dynamic displacement experiments are conducted to compare the displacement effect of different displacement methods, including N₂-injection displacement, air-injection displacement, steam flooding, and air-injection-assisted steam flooding. Experimental results show that air-injection can effectively improve the development effect of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. Upgrading and viscosity reduction for heavy oil by the combination of the LTO reaction and the aquathermolysis reaction can slow down steam channeling and increase production rate, thereby enhancing the ultimate recovery of steam flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aenergy 3amanganese dioxide 3aoil fields 3aoils 3aoxygen 3arisk 3asteam 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aLiu, Huiqing1 aPang, Zhanxi1 aWang, Jing1 aChen, Changyong1 aWang, Chunlei1 aWu, Zhengbin0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 29, no. 10 p.6242-6249dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b013303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010700166506010400273506007600377520231100453592002802764506003702792650002702829650001402856650001602870650001302886650001402899650002102913650001802934650001302952650002002965650001902985650001603004650002003020650001603040650002103056650002203077650001003099650001603109650001303125650002803138653000903166653001203175653001703187653001503204653001203219653001903231700002903250700002903279773010803308856008503416852000903501655001203510IND60769447320221207103724.0220704e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076944732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2022.1096842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOleaga, Ana10aFirst molecular and functional characterisation of ferritin 2 proteins from Ornithodoros argasid ticks  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFerritins are iron-binding proteins that play critical functions in iron metabolism. Tick ferritins are essential in blood feeding, reproduction, iron transport, and protection of ticks from the iron-mediated oxidative stress during blood feeding and digestion. In ixodids, ferritin 2 (Fer2) is responsible for iron transport into peripheral tissues, it is critically involved in tick reproduction and has been identified as a good candidate antigen to be included in anti-tick vaccines. In argasids, information on the molecular and functional characteristics of ferritins is almost nonexistent. Given the potential of ixodid Fer2 as a vaccine target, the aim of the current study was to characterise the Fer2 orthologues in Ornithodoros erraticus (OEFer2) and O. moubata (OMFer2), including functional analyses by RNAi gene knockdown and the assessment of the protective efficacy of recombinant Fer2 protein in an animal vaccination trials. Characterisation and analysis of the OMFer2 and OEFer2 amino acid sequences showed high similarity to each other, and high similarity to the Fer2 sequences of ixodid species as well, confirming that Fer2 is highly conserved between both tick families and suggesting a similar function in the physiology of both argasid and ixodid ticks. Fer2 gene knockdown in O. moubata reduced egg hatchability rate and the subsequent number of emerging nymphs-1 up to 71%. Conversely, Fer2 gene knockdown in O. erraticus did not affect the treated ticks even though the Fer2 mRNA expression level was reduced by 90%. The recombinant form of O. moubata Fer2 (tOMFer2) was highly immunogenic and induced strong humoral responses when administered to rabbits formulated with Montanide adjuvant. The protective effect of the anti-tOMFer2 response was limited. While in O. erraticus, we did not observe any protective effect, in O. moubata it induced a significant reduction in oviposition without affecting the other parameters analysed. Accordingly, Fer2 seems to be involved in O. moubata embryogenesis. This study provides the first data on the molecular and functional characterisation of Fer2 in soft tick species and paves the way for further studies aimed at unveiling the functional aspects of Fer2 in soft ticks and confirming its potential as a vaccine candidate antigen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrnithodoros erraticus 3aadjuvants 3aamino acids 3aantigens 3adigestion 3aegg hatchability 3aembryogenesis 3aferritin 3agene expression 3agene targeting 3ahematophagy 3airon absorption 3aoviposition 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aticks 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aveterinary parasitology 0aTick 0aArgasid 0aOrnithodoros 0aFerritin 2 0aVaccine 0aGene knockdown1 aGonzález-Pérez, Sergio1 aPeréz-Sánchez, Ricardo0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2022 Apr., v. 304 p.109684-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2022.1096843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100003000165245003200195300001600227520077400243592002801017653001501045653001501060653002601075653001901101653001001120653002501130653002901155700001901184700001901203773011501222856011301337852000901450655001201459IND60124209920221121223612.0151025e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012420992DNAL7 a10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[269:GDFBD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuechmaille, Sebastien J.10aGood DNA from bat droppings  ap. 269-276.  aAmplification of a mitochondrial DNA fragment was used to compare the efficiency of five methods for extracting DNA from bat droppings.

Samples, for which mtDNA amplification was successful, were subject to the multiplex amplification of eight microsatellite loci. This resulted in > 95%% amplification success over 12,592 PCRs. Allelic dropout (ADO) and false allele (FA) rates were low, and consequently, sample and locus quality indexes (QI) were high.

The proposed model includes all the generation costs for different technologies, including externalities; the risk derived from them, and a set of constraints on the emission of pollutant gases, such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Our results show that the EU technology portfolio, as proposed by the International Energy Agency for the 2030 horizon, is far from efficient. The joint cost-risk-environmental perspective confirms the need to increase the share of renewable energy technologies in the European energy mix, including photovoltaic energy, and to promote wind power as much as possible, to reduce the environmental impact. It is also necessary to continue to rely on hydro, CCS and nuclear technologies, in order to optimize the cost-risk tradeoff and the security of supply. In addition, it is concluded that restrictions on other pollutant gases should be also imposed, because they would contribute to reducing the environmental impact, with a relatively small increase in terms of cost-risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic theory 3aelectricity generation 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3agases 3amodels 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apower generation 3arisk 3asulfur dioxide 3awind power 0aPortfolio theory 0aEnergy planning 0aEnvironmental impact 0aPower generation 0aPollutant emissions 0aCCS 0aCO2 0aEU 0aEU-ETS 0aGHEH 0aMWh 0aIEA 0aNP 0aCP 0a450 0aIPTS 0aNOx 0aO&M 0aRES-E 0aPV 0aSO2 0aG110 0aO520 0aQ470 0aQ480 0aQ530 0aQ5601 aCalvo-Silvosa, Anxo1 aAntelo, Susana Iglesias1 aSoares, Isabel0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 181 p.123-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005700171300001400228520073700242592002800979650001801007650001801025650001401043650001501057650001001072700001701082700002101099773009201120856008401212961000901296852000901305655001201314IND60084699720221121165948.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008469972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Joseph M.10aTracking of food quantity by coyotes (Canis latrans)  ap. 72-75.  aPrevious studies have demonstrated that Weber's Law mediates quantitative discrimination abilities across various species.

Three different Mexican brine/rock/crude oil systems were used to evaluate the multifunctional properties of the novel supramolecular complex. Results showed a good performance of the capabilities of the supramolecular complex tested to reduce the viscosity, to remediate organic damage, and to enhance the oil recovery factor. In order to explain the results obtained, an interaction mechanism between the new complex and crude oil heavy fractions on the porous medium is suggested and discussed in which phenomena such as oil disaggregation, wettability alteration, and viscosity reduction take place to carry out an increase of the oil recovery factor and efficient removal of organic damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aindustry 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aporous media 3atechnology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awettability1 aZamudio-Rivera, Luis S.1 aBuenrostro-González, Eduardo0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 54, no. 32 p.7766-7776dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b013083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013400164300001400298520182000312592002802132650001902160650002202179650001802201650001202219650001202231650002202243650001302265650001602278650001302294650001502307650002202322650002402344650000902368650003502377651001002412653002602422653002602448653001702474653001102491653000902502700001402511700002002525700002102545700001702566700001802583700001602601700001702617700002002634700002002654700002002674700002002694700001802714700001402732773011302746856008502859852000902944655001202953IND60543860020221119132046.0190412e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Wen10aGenetic variations of IL-28B and PD-1 are in association with the susceptibility and outcomes of HCV infection in Southeast China  ap. 89-96.  aProgrammed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an important co-inhibitory molecule involved in the progression of chronic viral infections. To investigate the associations of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10204525, rs2227982 and rs36084323) in PD-1 and a previously well-inquired SNP rs12979860 in IL-28B with the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Southeast China, a total of 375 healthy controls, 219 spontaneous resolved HCV patients and 600 chronic HCV patients were enrolled in this study. The generation of HCV F protein and PD-1 expression on T cells was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association of rs12979860 CC genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in our subjects. The generation of HCV F protein was significantly related to HCV infection chronicity, but no significant relationship was found between HCV F protein and SNPs in PD-1. The rs10204525 TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCV infection chronicity in age ⩽56years subgroup (adjusted OR=0.390, P=3.8×10−4). The C allele of rs10204525 played protective roles in females infected with HCV (adjusted OR=0.608, P=0.008). A significant higher percentage of PD-1 expression on T cells was observed in rs10204525 TT genotype when compared to CC genotype (P=0.047). Moreover, a significant genotype–genotype interaction between IL-28B rs12979860 CC and PD-1 rs10204525 TC+CC was found to be associated with higher rates of spontaneous clearance (adjusted OR=0.689, P=0.032). The combined effect of rs12979860 and rs10204525 was of great value in predicting the outcomes of HCV infection. These analyses showed the importance of IL-28B and PD-1 polymorphisms and their interactions in the outcomes of HCV infection in Chinese Han population in Southeast China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aHepatitis C virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahepatitis C 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aChina 0aChronic HCV infection 0aSpontaneous clearance 0aPolymorphism 0aIL-28B 0aPD-11 aZhang, Qi1 aDeng, Xiao Zhao1 aJiang, Long Feng1 aZhu, Dan Yan1 aPei, Jia Ping1 aXu, Mao Lei1 aLi, Bing Jun1 aWang, Chang Jun1 aZhang, Jing Hai1 aZhou, Zhen Xian1 aDing, Wei Liang1 aXu, Xiao Dong1 aYue, Ming0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 June, v. 32 p.89-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005700172520088100229592002801110650002901138650002501167650001801192650001801210650001401228650002201242650001901264650001901283650003701302650001601339650001501355650001301370650001601383651001101399653001001410653001401420653001601434653002701450653002701477653002601504700003101530700003001561700002601591700003401617700002201651700002101673773009901694856008701793852000901880655001201889IND60717913620221116153647.0220103e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071791362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1285612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajkut, Michał10aAntimicrobial activity of heat-treated Polish honeys  aBactericidal properties of honey depend on botanical and geographical origin, where thermal treatment can have a significant affect.

The situation and definition of the African species M. minor is particularly confused. This species is known from scattered and discontinuous records on both mainland coasts, Madagascar, São Toméé and Grand Comoro islands. The island forms have been included either within M. minor or considered as endemic species. To clarify their taxonomy, we compare mitochondrial DNA sequences of all the island forms with other related African Miniopterus. The genetic distances found in this study support a taxonomic recognition of the island forms at species level and the phylogenetic reconstructions based on these data suggest that the M. minor, as considered traditionally, is not a monophyletic group. The morphological similarities between the Miniopterus from São Toméé (West Africa) and Grand Comoro (East Africa) may reflect convergent evolution rather than a common ancestry.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChiroptera 0amolecular differentiation 0aphylogeny 0acytochrome b 0aisland evolution 0aAfrica1 aFerráández, Almudena1 aFa, John E.1 aMasefield, Will1 aIbááñez, Carlos0 tActa chiropterologica.g2007 Apr., v. 9, no. 1 p.27-37dMuseum and Institute of Zoology PASx1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F1733-5329%282007%299%5B27%3ATOLBBM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001600259520185300275592002802128650001202156650001202168650001902180650001202199650001202211650002302223650001802246650001202264650002602276650001502302650004302317650001302360650000902373651001002382653005002392653006302442653001102505653002102516653003302537700002302570700001302593700001402606700001402620700001902634700001402653700001502667700002502682773011302707856008602820852000902906655001202915IND60591207620221119102217.0190325e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059120762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunlan10aAssessing vegetation response to multi-time-scale drought across inner Mongolia plateau  ap. 210-216.  aThis study assessed the impacts of climate change in IMP by investigating vegetation responses drought in multiple timescales. Methods used included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), by annual maximum Pearson correlation (Rmax) and the corresponding month (Rmonth) of drought. Results showed that: (1) It is necessary to zone IMP when analyzing the vegetation responses to drought. (2) Rmax is significantly positive correlation in IMP, indicating that vegetation was largely influenced by drought; the most seriously affected areas are in the north-eastern part of typical steppe, south-western parts of steppe desert and southern part of desert steppe, while light seriously are distributed in the south-eastern of typical steppe and forest steppe. (3) Vegetation in typical steppe, steppe desert and desert steppe are sensitive to shorter time-scales of droughts, while in the forest, forest steppe and sand desert, vegetation shows a close relationship with the longer drought time-scales. (4) The effects of drought related climate extremes can also contribute to Rmax and Rmonth between SPEI and NDVI. Vegetation in forest and sand desert areas, have lower sensitivity to drought under the effect of climate extremes. Adaptation measures, such as building drought resilience vegetation types, applying biochar and monitoring and forecasting drought, must be timely and effectively initiated, especially, in the typical steppe, steppe desert and desert steppe in IMP since vegetation in these four areas is affected seriously, once drought occur. The results from this study may provide useful information about appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies against the inverse effects of drought on vegetation, and even alleviate the losses caused by drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adeserts 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3ainosine monophosphate 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aplateaus 3asand 3aChina 0aNormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 0aStandardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) 0aSteppe 0aClimate extremes 0aInner Mongolia plateau (IMP)1 aLeal Filho, Walter1 aYin, Jie1 aHu, Richa1 aWang, Jun1 aYang, Chengshu1 aYin, Shan1 aBao, Yuhai1 aDesalegn Yayeh Ayal,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 179 p.210-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007800169300001600247500001500263520079800278592002801076650001601104650002201120650001001142650000901152650001401161650001001175650001601185650001901201650001101220650001201231650002301243653002401266700002001290773013101310856005501441852000901496655001201505IND4468395120221118193325.0120313e199806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446839512DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2621.1998.00136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jung H.10aModelling the change in colour of potassium sorbate powder during heating  ap. 199-203.  a2019-12-06  aColour change of potassium sorbate caused by heating was statistically modelled to examine its potential as a time–temperature process indicator. A full factorial design with five levels of heating time (t) and temperature (T) was used. L, a and b values were measured by a HunterLab colorimeter, and second‐order polynomial models were developed. Heating significantly reduced L and increased b values, causing the potassium sorbate powder to turn dark yellow, possibly because of non‐enzymatic browning reactions. Statistically significant models with good fit were developed for L and b, and their response surfaces were generated. This potassium sorbate‐based system may be a suitable indicator for high‐temperature heating processes such as dry heat sterilizers or baking ovens.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3apotassium sorbate 3aovens 3aheat 3apotassium 3acolor 3asterilizers 3aheat treatment 3abaking 3apowders 3astatistical models 0amathematical models1 aFloros, John D.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g1998 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.199-203dBlackwell Science Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2621.1998.00136.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001400266520174500280592002802025650003002053650001502083650002502098650001202123650002102135650002802156650003802184650001302222650001602235650001102251650002002262650001402282650001502296650001402311650001202325650001402337650001902351653001402370653001402384653000802398653002402406653002502430653003102455653002302486700002402509700002102533700002102554700002202575700002202597700002202619700001902641700002102660700002302681700002302704700002402727700001802751773011702769856008602886852000902972655001202981IND60567691920221119205832.0180831e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056769192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Otto10aSynergistic effect of low K and D vitamin status on arterial stiffness in a general population  ap. 83-89.  aBoth vitamins K and D are nutrients with pleiotropic functions in human tissues. The metabolic role of these vitamins overlaps considerably in calcium homeostasis. We analyzed their potential synergetic effect on arterial stiffness. In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) in 1023 subjects from the Czech post-MONICA study. Desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix γ-carboxyglutamate protein (dp-ucMGP), a biomarker of vitamin K status, was measured by sandwich ELISA and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) by a commercial immunochemical assay. In a subsample of 431 subjects without chronic disease or pharmacotherapy, we detected rs2228570 polymorphism for the vitamin D receptor. After adjustment for confounders, aPWV was independently associated with both factors: dp-ucMGP [β-coefficient(S.E.M.)=13.91(4.87); P=.004] and 25-OH-D3 [0.624(0.28); P=.027]. In a further analysis, we divided subjects according to dp-ucMGP and 25-OH-D3 quartiles, resulting in 16 subgroups. The highest aPWV had subjects in the top quartile of dp-ucMGP plus bottom quartile of 25-OH-D3 (i.e., in those with insufficient status of both vitamin K and vitamin D), while the lowest aPVW had subjects in the bottom quartile of dp-ucMGP plus top quartile of 25-OH-D3 [9.8 (SD2.6) versus 6.6 (SD1.6) m/s; P<.0001]. When we compared these extreme groups of vitamin K and D status, the adjusted odds ratio for aPWV≥9.3 m/s was 6.83 (95% CI:1.95–20.9). The aPWV was also significantly higher among subjects bearing the GG genotype of rs2228570, but only in those with a concomitantly poor vitamin K status. In conclusion, we confirmed substantial interaction of insufficient K and D vitamin status in terms of increased aortic stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3abiomarkers 3acalcitriol receptors 3acalcium 3achronic diseases 3across-sectional studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotype 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmunochemistry 3anutrients 3aodds ratio 3asynergism 3atissues 3avitamin K 3avitamin status 0aVitamin K 0aVitamin D 0aMGP 0aγ-Carboxyglutamate 0a25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 0aAortic pulse wave velocity 0ars2228570 genotype1 aSeidlerová, Jitka,1 aWohlfahrt, Peter1 aFilipovský, Jan1 aCífková, Renata1 aČerná, Václava1 aKučerová, Alena1 aPešta, Martin1 aFuchsová, Radka1 aTopolčan, Ondřej1 aJardon, Kelly M.C.1 aDrummen, Nadja E.A.1 aVermeer, Cees0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 46 p.83-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011300162300001600275520145300291592002801744596005901772650002801831650001201859650002201871650002101893650001301914650000901927650001501936650002001951650002001971650002801991650001202019650001302031700005302044773010902097856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60596777320221120162243.0180905e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059677732DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-018-0313-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Juan10aRelationship Between Yolk Sac Liquid Crystal Formation and Calcium Transport in Pigeon Egg Yolk Sac Endoderm  ap. 232-238.  aDuring the incubation of pigeon eggs, the yolk is transformed from a disordered to an ordered state before being absorbed, and the liquid crystals formed the ordered structure via self-assembly in the yolk. In this study, the relationship between the enzymes (ACPase and Ca-ATPase) and liquid crystal formation within the pigeon endoderm was determined. The results showed that ACPase is critical for transforming the yolk into liquid crystals, which originate mainly from the endoderm. The formation of lamellar structures in the yolk was closely associated with the hydrolytic activity of the enzymes. Additionally, a large amount of Ca-ATPase was expressed in the lamellar structures, indicating modulatory effects of Ca-ATPase on the precipitation of calcium carbonate and appearance of lamellar spherical structures. The liquid crystals containing transport enzymes, which formed as a result of laminarization, serve as reaction sites as well as a reactive source of calcium. The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V, member 6 (TRPV6) is an epithelial calcium channel. The present study aimed to elucidate the relationship between yolk sac liquid crystals and calcium transport by investigating the regulatory mechanisms underlying TRPV6 gene expression in the pigeon endoderm. The pattern of expression of TRPV6 observed in this study suggests that yolk sac liquid crystals participate in calcium transport in the endoderm.  aPublisher supplied data  a31071265cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium channels 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3aliquid crystals 3aphysiological transport 3apigeons 3ayolk sac1 aTong, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9361-63000 tAgricultural research.g2018 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.232-238dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-018-0313-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100002300165245012700188300001400315520159000329592002801919653001501947653001401962653002801976653002002004653001102024653001902035653001702054653001502071653001002086653001702096700002502113773011302138856011302251852000902364655001202373IND60124210520221122185518.0151025e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012421052DNAL7 a10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[67:BOTSLK]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuyanto, Agustinus10aBats of the Sangkulirang limestone karst formations, East Kalimantan —— a priority region for Bornean bat conservation  ap. 67-95.  aBorneo has a significant role to play in the conservation of bat diversity in Southeast Asia, yet there is little taxonomic and distribution information available for the Indonesian states that represent over two thirds of the island. We report the results of a four week harp-trap and mistnet survey of four limestone karst formations on the Sangkulirang peninsula in East Kalimantan during August 2004. We recorded 36 taxa, including two (a Pipistrellus and Rhinolophus) that may represent new species, and three (Hipposideros bicolor, Myotis horsfieldii and M. montivagus) that are new records for Kalimantan. Several species, including the karst dependent and patchily distributed Hipposideros larvatus, Rhinolophus creaghi and R. pusillus, were highly abundant at the formations. In Borneo, many of the species were previously known from only a few, or scattered, localities including four Red-Listed species (R. creaghi, M. montivagus, Murina rozendaali and Kerivoula minuta). We review the Bornean distributions of individual species given recent surveys in Kalimantan and present taxonomic data from 135 specimens collected during this study. This represents the largest bat collection in Kalimantan so far undertaken and highlights the Sangkulirang peninsula as a key site for bat diversity and conservation in Borneo. Threats to this area include disturbance from bird nest collection in caves, but also mass disturbance from logging and forest fires. We advocate inclusion of the formations and associated forests into a protected area to safeguard this biological resource.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChiroptera 0aIndonesia 0aSangkulirang-Mangkaliat 0aEast Kalimantan 0aBorneo 0aSoutheast Asia 0adistribution 0aharp-traps 0akarst 0aconservation1 aStruebig, Matthew J.0 tActa chiropterologica.g2007 Apr., v. 9, no. 1 p.67-95dMuseum and Institute of Zoology PASx1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F1733-5329%282007%299%5B67%3ABOTSLK%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01523naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245004300172300001800215520071900233592002800952650001700980650001900997650001101016700003001027773010501057856008601162852000901248655001201257IND60578220120180713000000.0170812e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057822012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b008262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegrand, Aurélie10aSilica–Epoxy Vitrimer Nanocomposites  ap. 5893-5902.  aReinforced silica–epoxy vitrimer nanocomposites have been made in a solvent-free, easily processable, and economical way with filler contents up to 40 wt %.

Furthermore, the surface functionalization of particles improves the dispersion of fillers and accelerates the relaxation process.

Among birds, ravens and rooks have been shown to co-orient with conspecifics and with humans by following their gaze direction into distant space and behind visual screens. Both species use screens to cache food in private; also, it had been suggested that they may rely on gaze cues to detect hidden food. However, in an object-choice task, ravens failed to do so, and their competitive lifestyle may have prevented them from relying on these cues. Here we tested closely related and cooperative rooks. Food was hidden in one of two cups and the experimenter gazed at the baited cup. In a second experiment, we aimed to increase the birds’ motivation to choose correctly by increasing the investment needed to obtain the reward. To do so, the birds had to pull on a string to obtain the cup. Here, the birds as a group tended to rely on gaze cues. In addition, individual birds quickly learned to use the cue in both experiments. Although rooks may not use gaze cues to find hidden food spontaneously, they may quickly learn to do so.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCorvus frugilegus 3abirds 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amotivation1 aScheid, Christelle1 aKotrschal, Kurt1 aBugnyar, Thomas1 aSchloegl, Christian0 tBehavioural processes.g2011 Oct., v. 88, no. 2 p.88-93dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169300001600262520154400278592002801822650002001850650001701870650001201887650001501899650001201914650001801926650001001944650001601954650002101970650001801991650001702009650002302026650002202049650001002071650001602081650000902097650002102106650003402127650002002161650002002181650002602201653001202227653001002239653002302249653002302272653002102295653001002316700005902326700001602385700002002401700001902421700002002440700001602460700001902476700001802495700002102513773011902534856008602653852000902739655001202748IND60567692120221119210037.0180831e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056769212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dae Hyun10aEffect of betaine on hepatic insulin resistance through FOXO1-induced NLRP3 inflammasome  ap. 104-114.  aIn the present study, we attempted to elucidate whether molecular modulation of inflammation by betaine through the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome improves insulin resistance. Betaine is a major water-soluble component of Lycium chinense. It mainly functions as an oxidative metabolite of choline by suppressing superoxide-induced free radicals by donating methyl groups. The FOXO1 transcription factor regulates various genes involved in cellular metabolic processes related to cell death as well as oxidative stress responses through binding to the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Betaine is known to inhibit FOXO1 phosphorylation through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) in liver cells exposed to insulin.To elucidate the molecular mechanism of inactivation of insulin-induced FOXO1 by the antioxidant betaine, we used HepG2 cells and the liver of db/db mice treated with betaine at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks.We found that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome genes was reduced by betaine, which resulted in the suppression of reactive species (RS) production in liver cells. In addition, betaine inhibited insulin-induced PI3K/AKT and FOXO1 activation. Therefore, betaine suppressed the cytokine interleukin-1β production by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via interaction of FOXO1 and TXNIP.Our results suggest that betaine inhibits the FOXO1 binding to TXNIP, leading to the suppression of RS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a diabetic liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycium chinense 3aantioxidants 3abetaine 3acell death 3acholine 3afree radicals 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahuman cell lines 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3astress response 3atranscription factors 0aBetaine 0aFOXO1 0aNLRP3 inflammasome 0aInsulin resistance 0aOxidative stress 0aTXNIP1 aKim, Seong-Min,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3359-75041 aLee, Bonggi1 aLee, Eun Kyeong1 aChung, Ki Wung1 aMoon, Kyoung Mi1 aAn, Hye Jin1 aKim, Kyung Mok1 aYu, Byung Pal1 aChung, Hae Young0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2017 July, v. 45 p.104-114dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2017.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245012700164500002200291520097800313592002801291650001401319650002801333650001101361650002301372650001901395650001701414650001901431650001501450650004201465650002001507650001901527650001501546650002001561653004701581653002601628653002201654653003001676653002301706700001901729700002001748700001301768700001501781773009301796856008701889852000901976655001201985IND60634093420221121032905.0190325e20190218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063409342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.02.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Jun10aPreparation and characterization of a substitute for Ruditapes philippinarum conglutination mud as a natural bioflocculant  aPre-press version  aIn this study a preparation strategy was attempted to produce a substitute (BBF) for the Ruditapes philippinarum conglutination mud (RPM), which was newly discovered to be a promising natural bioflocculant resource. A stable yield of 73.77 ± 1.79 g L−1 BBF was established by a sequential batch fermentation under optimized conditions via single factor experiments. BBF attained similar flocculation performance as RPM, showing a maximum flocculation rate of 87.92 ± 0.65%. BBF had significant decolorization efficiency on methylene blue, crystal violet and malachite green by 98.78 ± 0.46%, 89.37 ± 0.35% and 99.11 ± 0.17%, respectively. BBF could harvest microalgae Chlorella salina by 84.38 ± 0.57%. High throughput sequencing revealed that Vibrio and Bacillus might be the extracellular polysaccharides producers.

The majority of cell culture studies and clinico-epidemiological studies demonstrated that MALAT1 acts a tumor promoter in GBMs and inhibition of MALAT1 suppressed tumor growth in various preclinical models of GBM. MALAT1 involves in stemness of GBM cells by regulating SOX2, nestin and members of WNT pathway. MALAT1 induces protective autophagy and suppresses apoptosis in GBM cells via sponging miRNA-101 and increases temozolomide chemoresistance via enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suppressing miR-203 and promoting thymidilate synthase. Moreover, knockdown of MALAT1 expression enhances blood-brain tumor barrier permeability via miR-140, which may provide a double benefit of MALAT1 suppression by increasing the delivery of chemotherapy agents into the GBM tissues. On the other hand, there also exist some cell culture and animal studies showing that MALAT1 acts as a tumor suppressor in GBMs by suppression of ERK/MAPK and MMP2 signaling and by repression of miR-155 with subsequent increase of FBXW7. Whether protective or detrimental, MALAT1 seems to be an important component of GBM pathogenesis and hence; novels studies are needed in versatile models, including many different primary GBM cultures, orthotopic and xenogreft in vivo models and transgenic mice.  aPublisher supplied data 0a3-MA 0aABC-transporter 0aAPC 0aATG4D 0aEMT 0aGBM 0aGSK3β 0aIAP 0aLncRNA 0aLRP1 0aMALAT1 0amascRNA 0aMDR 0aMGMT 0aMMP2 0aMRP 0ancRNA 0aOS 0aRap1 0aSOX-2 0aSTMN1 0aTS 0aUCR 0aWHO 0aWIF1 0aWNT 0aGlioblastoma 0aMALAT1 0alncRNA 0amicroRNA1 aElmaci, Ilhan1 aOzpinar, Aysel1 aAltinoz, Meric A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7804-40870 tGene.g2020 May 20, v. 739 p.144518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1445183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001600262520112500278592002801403650002001431650001201451650001001463650001401473650001401487650001001501650001201511650000901523650001101532650001301543650001401556650001901570650001401589653001401603653001401617653002101631653003001652653004301682653001601725700001801741700006301759773011501822856008501937852000902022655001202031IND60543860620221119131822.0190412e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054386062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2013.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeroy, Thibault10aWhen virulence originates from non-agricultural hosts: New insights into plant breeding  ap. 521-529.  aMonogenic plant resistance breakdown is a model for testing evolution in action in pathogens. As a rule, plant pathologists argue that virulence – the allele that allows pathogens to overcome resistance – is due to a new mutation at the avirulence locus within the native/endemic population that infects susceptible crops. In this article, we develop an alternative and neglected scenario where a given virulence pre-exists in a non-agricultural host and might be accidentally released or introduced on the matching resistant cultivar in the field. The main difference between the two scenarios is the divergence time expected between the avirulent and the virulent populations. As a consequence, population genetic approaches such as genome scans and Approximate Bayesian Computation methods allow explicit testing of the two scenarios by timing the divergence. This review then explores the fundamental implications of this alternative scenario for plant breeding, including the invasion of virulence or the evolution of more aggressive hybrids, and proposes concrete solutions to achieve a sustainable resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalleles 3acrops 3acultivars 3aevolution 3ahosts 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amodels 3amutation 3apathogens 3aplant breeding 3avirulence 0aEmergence 0aVirulence 0aResistance genes 0aGene-for-gene interaction 0aApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) 0aGenome scan1 aLe Cam, Bruno1 aLemaire, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3078-58010 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Oct., v. 27 p.521-529dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002200166245008200188300001600270520062000286592002800906653002200934653001300956653001200969653001300981653001200994653001201006653001301018653002101031700002501052700001801077700001901095700001801114700001901132700001901151700002301170700002301193700002401216700001801240773011501258856011401373852000901487655001201496IND60124210720221122152530.0151025e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012421072DNAL7 a10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[323:ANSOKC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBates, Paul J.

The device measured the rate of evaporation of liquid heptane from a porous stainless steel plate buried in a porous medium. Natural air turbulence as indicated by both mean windspeed and root mean square air pressure fluctuations significantly affected the heptane evaporation rates in straw and coarse gravel, but had a decreased effect in media of smaller pore size. In silt loam, the regression coefficient for evaporation rate on windspeed was 20% of its value for straw. Increasing depth from 1 to 8 cm in coarse sand caused a 91% decrease. Although the heptane flux values are quite scattered, the data indicate that air turbulence can significantly increase the transport of water vapor through coarse mulches or through very shallow depths of soil, but that soil aeration is mostly a diffusive process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3adiffusion 3aevaporation rate 3agas exchange 3agravel 3aheptane 3ameasuring devices 3aporous media 3asand 3asilt 3asoil air 3asoil depth 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3astainless steel 3astraw 3aturbulent flow 3awater vapor1 aLemon, E.

From the 7th day of life, 80 male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly divided into four groups of 20 birds each. The three experimental groups (E1-3) were treated with OTA for 28 days (E1: 50 μg/kg body weight [bw]/day; E2: 20 μg/kg bw/day; E3: 1 μg/kg bw/day) and the fourth group served as control. Histological examination of the intestinal mucosa and immunohistochemical staining for identification of CD4+, CD8+, TCR1 and TCR2 lymphocytes in the duodenum, jejunum and ileocaecal junction were performed, and CD4+/CD8+ and TCR1/TCR2 ratios were calculated. OTA toxicity resulted in decreased body weight gain, poorer feed conversion ratio, lower leukocyte and lymphocyte count, and altered intestinal mucosa architecture. After 14 days of exposure to OTA, immunohistochemistry showed a significant reduction of the lymphocyte population in the intestinal epithelium and the lamina propria. After 28 days of exposure, an increase in the CD4+ and CD8+ values in both the duodenum and jejunum of chickens in Groups E1 and E2 was observed, but the TCR1 and TCR2 lymphocyte counts showed a significant reduction. No significant changes were observed in Group E3. The results indicate that OTA induced a decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and was cytotoxic to the intestinal epithelium and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, altering the intestinal barrier and increasing susceptibility to various associated diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3acytotoxicity 3aduodenum 3afeed conversion 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunotoxicity 3aintestinal mucosa 3ajejunum 3alymphocyte count 3alymphocytes 3amales 3aochratoxin A 3astaining 0aOchratoxin A 0abroiler chickens 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aintestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue1 aPavel, Geta1 aFloristean, Viorel Cezar1 aChiriac, Ioan Sorin Beschea1 aŞlencu, Bogdan Gabriel1 aSolcan, Gheorghe0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 63, no. 1 p.30-48dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-62907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAVet.2015.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520078800298592002801086650001601114650001301130650002101143650002301164650001101187650001701198650001901215650001501234650002401249650002001273650000701293650002001300650001601320700001801336700001701354700001801371700002801389700002801417773010501445856008501550852000901635655001201644IND60085490120221118160533.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008549012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2011.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlibech, Monia10aProduction of manno-oligosaccharides from locust bean gum using immobilized Penicillium occitanis mannanase  ap. 111-115.  aMannanase was immobilized on chitin with glutaraldehyde by cross-linking reaction.

Although using the same basic proposition as before, i.e., a highly pressurized fluidized bed boiler to provide steam above the critical temperature to drive the steam-turbine cycle while the flue-gas is injected into gas turbines, the present configuration is an evolution from a preliminary study because it applies a more elaborate arrangement of equipment. As before, the present round also indicates that an important technical hurdle represented by problems of feeding solid particles to pressurized vessels might be overcome through the application of a slurry injection. Here, the alternative of a thicker slurry, with 40% (wt) solids, is considered. A comprehensive simulator for boilers and gasifiers and a process simulator to predict the main features of the steam and gas turbine branches are applied. Without too much effort, the present process might be applied to other biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aboilers 3aflue gas 3afluidized beds 3apower generation 3aslurries 3asteam 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3aturbines1 aChávez, Juan Villanueva0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 26, no. 3 p.1952-1963dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef20199353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245004000160520207900200592002802279650001702307650002202324650002702346650001902373650002302392650001502415650002002430650001402450650001302464650001702477651001202494651001202506651001602518653002402534653001702558653002502575653002002600653001702620653001502637653002002652700001802672700002102690700001602711700002202727773011502749856007602864852000902940655001202949IND60727286720221120234100.0210210e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072728672DNAL7 a10.3897/rio.6.e577672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillemse, Luc10aDigitisation of private collections  aResults are presented of a study investigating solutions and procedures to incorporate private natural history collections into the international collections data infrastructure. Results are based on pilot projects carried out in three European countries aimed at approaches on how to best motivate and equip citizen collectors for digitisation: 1) In Estonia, the approach was to outline tools for registering, digitising and publishing private collection data in the biodiversity data management system PlutoF. 2) In Finland, the functionality of FinBIF, a portal offering a popular Notebook Service for citizens to store observations has been expanded to include collection specimens related to a field gathering event. 3) In the Netherlands private collection owners were approached directly and asked to start digitising their collection using dedicated software, either by themselves or with the help of volunteers who were recruited specifically for this task. In addition to management tools, pilots also looked at motivation, persons undertaking the work, scope, planning, specific knowledge or skills required and the platform for online publication. Future ownership, legality of specimens residing in private collections and the use of unique identifiers are underexposed aspects effecting digitisation. Besides streamlining the overall process of digitising private collections and dealing with local, national or international challenges, developing a communication strategy is crucial in order to effectively distribute information and keep private collection owners aware of ongoing developments. Besides collection owners other stakeholders were identified and for each of them a roadmap is outlined aimed at further streamlining the data from private collections into the international infrastructure. In conclusion recommendations are presented based on challenges encountered during this task that are considered important to really make significant progress towards the overall accessibility of data stored in privately held natural history collections.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acomputer software 3ainformation management 3ainfrastructure 3amanagement systems 3amotivation 3anatural history 3aownership 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3aEstonia 3aFinland 3aNetherlands 0aprivate collections 0adigitisation 0acollection ownership 0amanagement tool 0alegal issues 0avolunteers 0acitizen science1 aRunnel, Veljo1 aSaarenmaa, Hannu1 aCasino, Ana1 aGödderz, Karsten0 tResearch Ideas and Outcomes.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 6 p.e57767-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27349x2367-71637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e577673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011500160300002000275500001900295520118000314592002801494650002201522650002301544650002201567650002101589650001701610650001101627650001301638700001701651700001701668700001301685700001801698700001801716700001801734700001701752700001801769700001901787773014501806856007401951852000902025655001202034IND60711124720221118063854.0200917e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071112472DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta06330d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chao Yue10aUltrastable lithium–sulfur batteries with outstanding rate capability boosted by NiAs-type vanadium sulfides  ap. 18358-18366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVanadium sulfides, such as VS₂, have been often used as sulfur host materials for lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), however, their high-symmetry and layered crystalline structure often lead to a poor rate-capability and a limited cycling stability of the resultant LSBs. Thus, in this work, a type of distorted NiAs-type structured V₂S₃ phase was designed and attempted to use it as a sulfur host for LSBs. The results showed that the prepared V₂S₃-nanocrystal decorated carbon nanofiber (CNF@V₂S₃) electrode films are freestanding, highly conductive and flexible. And the resultant CNF@V₂S₃/S cathodes show a high specific capacity (1169 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1C), an excellent rate capability (retain 78.9% at 2.0C), an ultra-low delay rate per cycle of 0.0071%, and a low self-discharge rate of 3.65% per month. A series of analyses indicate that these high electrochemical performances are mainly due to the high polarity, high conductivity and high catalytic activity of V₂S₃ nanocrystals, as well as the improved diffusivities of Li ions. This research could provide some new insight into the design of sulfur host materials for high-performance LSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3ananocrystals 3asulfur 3avanadium1 aSun, Guo Wen1 aBai, Yunfei,1 aDai, Zhe1 aZhao, Yi Rong1 aGao, Xiu Ping1 aSun, Geng Zhi1 aPan, Xiao Bo1 aPan, Xiao Jun1 aZhou, Jin Yuan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 35 p.18358-18366dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta06330d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008800162300001400250520127000264592002801534650002001562650001901582650001901601650002301620650002201643650002601665650002101691650001601712650001501728650004301743650001901786650002601805650001301831650001301844650001001857653001501867653000901882653001201891653001501903700002001918700002801938700001801966700001901984773010302003856007902106852000902185655001202194IND60478442020221116140735.0160124e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047844202DNAL7 a10.1556/AVet.2015.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyetvai, Béla10aGentamicin sulphate permeation through porcine intestinal epithelial cell monolayer  ap. 60-68.  aGentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used in combination with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in topical drug formulations. It is not known, however, whether DMSO can enhance the permeation of gentamicin through biological membranes, leading to oto- and nephrotoxic side effects. A simple and reliable high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was applied for the quantitative determination of gentamicin collected from the apical and basolateral compartments of the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 cell monolayer using fluorometric derivatisation of the analyte with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC) prior to chromatographic run in the presence and absence of 1% DMSO. The lack of change in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) demonstrated that gentamicin and 1% DMSO did not affect IPEC-J2 cell monolayer integrity via the disruption of cell membranes. Chromatographic data also ascertained that gentamicin penetration across the cell monolayer even in the presence of 1% DMSO was negligible at 6 h after the beginning of apical gentamicin administration. This study further indicates that the addition of this organic solvent does not increase the incidence of toxic effects related to gentamicin permeation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acell membranes 3aderivatization 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adrug formulations 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelial cells 3afluorometry 3agentamicin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anephrotoxicity 3aquantitative analysis 3asolvents 3asulfates 3aswine 0aGentamicin 0aDMSO 0aIPEC-J2 0apermeation1 aJerzsele, Ákos1 aPászti-Gere, Erzsébet1 aNagy, Gábor,1 aGálfi, Péter0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 63, no. 1 p.60-68dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-62907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAVet.2015.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245007200170520128300242592002801525650002201553650001201575650001301587653003201600653001101632653002601643653001901669653001701688653001901705653001601724653001101740653001701751700002301768700001801791700003001809700001901839700002501858700001801883700002101901700002101922700001801943700002001961700001901981773011602000856007602116852000902192655001202201IND60727286920221120222245.0210210e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072728692DNAL7 a10.3897/rio.6.e581672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyvärinen, Marko-Tapio10aGeneral Collections Policy of the Finnish Museum of Natural History  aAs part of its quality management and goal-driven strategic development, the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus drafts policy documents to guide its operational sectors. The purpose of such policies is to define the content and procedures of the Museum’s activities. They answer the questions “what”, “why”, “who” and “for whom” about the activities they discuss, which is to say that they define and delimit the scope of the operational sector, provide the operations with a purpose and determine their content, describe the allocation of responsibilities in the sector under the Luomus organisation and identify the target groups. The policies provide general objectives and thus form the basis for target programmes and any action plans which in turn answer the question “How can we reach the designated goals?”. Policies are not tied to a schedule, unlike target programmes, even though they must be dynamic and updated periodically to better serve the organisation. The core activities at Luomus are: (1) maintenance of the scientific collections, (2) research and (3) expert services. The General Collections Policy sets guidelines for the maintenance of the scientific collections based on the mission of the University of Helsinki and Luomus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3amuseums 3aresearch 0aNatural history collections 0apolicy 0acollection management 0aimplementation 0aaccessioning 0adeaccessioning 0aregulations 0aethics 0abiodiversity1 aVäinölä, Risto,1 aVäre, Henry,1 aStåhls-Mäkelä, Gunilla1 aSihvonen, Pasi1 aKuusijärvi, Anniina1 aMyllys, Leena1 aKröger, Björn,1 aHeikkinen, Mikko1 aJuslén, Aino1 aOinonen, Markku1 aSchulman, Leif0 tResearch Ideas and Outcomes.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 6 p.e58167-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27349x2367-71637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e581673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01195naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007600160300001800236520022700254592002800481650002300509650002700532650000900559650002200568700001900590700002000609700002300629700001800652773012900670856007300799852000900872655001200881IND60657401020221122033822.0190816e20030630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065740102DNAL7 a10.1039/b303643j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikuma, Toshiyasu10aCoordination complex between haemin and parallel-quadruplexed d(TTAGGG)  ap. 1708-1709.  aHaemin, iron(iii)–protoporphyrin IX complex, and parallel-quadruplexed d(TTAGGG) have been shown to form a stable coordination complex which exhibits spectroscopic properties remarkably similar to those of haemoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acoordination compounds 3airon 3aspectral analysis1 aOhyama, Takako1 aTerui, Norifumi1 aYamamoto, Yasuhiko1 aHori, Hiroshi0 tChemical communications.g2003 June 30, , no. 14 p.1708-1709dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b303643j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245011900206520167500325592002802000650001102028650001102039650002402050650001102074650001902085650001302104651001002117653001702127653001202144653002802156653003402184653002402218653001702242700005402259700001802313700001802331700001602349700001602365773010402381856008602485852000902571655001202580IND60715933620221120094004.0211029e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3260-264210aCan precipitation extremes explain variability in runoff and sediment yield across heterogeneous karst watersheds?  aPrecipitation extremes are recognized as one of the main factors that influence annual runoff and sediment yield in specific watersheds. However, it is not clear whether precipitation extremes account accurately for the variability in runoff and sediment yield for different karst watersheds, especially in climate-sensitive areas, such as the karst critical zone of southwest China. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative importance of the 11 precipitation extremes variables that explain the total variance in annual runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree (BRT) model for 40 typical karst watersheds in southwest China. Results indicated that the most important precipitation extremes for annual runoff and sediment yield were heavy precipitation amount, consecutive dry days, heavy precipitation days, consecutive wet days, and rainstorm amount. The BRT model accounted for 76% of the variation in runoff, which demonstrated that precipitation extremes were crucial factors for generating runoff. Although precipitation extremes had significant effects on sediment yield, the BRT model only explained 32% of the variability in sediment yield. Hydrogeological conditions and dam construction in these karst watersheds may be responsible for the difference in total variance explained by the BRT model between annual runoff and sediment yield. Because of the inherent nonlinearity present in many hydrological systems, the BRT model provided a robust capability to generate data-driven, objective, insight into complex relationships. We recommend this model for the application of non-stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3akarsts 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3avariance 3aChina 0aSoil erosion 0aClimate 0aNon-linear relationship 0aBoosted regression tree model 0aKarst critical zone 0aEcohydrology1 aXu, Xianli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8076-21171 aZhu, Jingxuan1 aZhong, Feixia1 aXu, Chaohao1 aWang, Kelin0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 May, v. 596 p.125698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016300162300001600325520209200341592002802433596006502461650002302526650001602549650002102565650002502586650001802611650002102629650002102650650001302671650001802684650001802702650004102720650001302761650002202774650003602796650004302832650001402875650002402889650001202913650001302925650002702938650001402965650001302979650001202992650001103004650001103015650002503026700001603051700001403067700001503081700001603096773013603112856008303248852000903331655001203340IND60654902720221120130429.0190920e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065490272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01634-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, V.10aSynthesis of nonembryonic synseeds in Hemidesmus indicus R.

Br. in calcium alginate hydrogel comprising of MS basal medium for short-term conservation. A 3% sodium aliginate (SA) with 100 mM CaCl₂ was found most suitable for the preparation of isodiametrical beads. Highest shoot regrowth (84.50 ± 0.35%) was recorded when the gelling matrix, i.e. 3% SA in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium was supplemented with 5.0 µM 6-benzyladenine (BA) + 0.5 µM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and inoculated onto the nutrient medium comprised of MS + 5.0 µM BA gave 5.53 ± 0.096 shoots/encapsulated NS. Rooting in microshoots was obtained on the half strength liquid MS + 0.1 µM IBA. Plantlets achieved from preserved synthetic seeds were acclimatized and relocated in the natural condition successfully with the immortality rate of 89.3%. During the days of acclimatization, the obtained plants were subjected for the assessment of their pigment content and biochemical assay. The results obtained clearly exhibited the enhancement in the pigment content as the acclimatization period increases. A significant rise and fall in Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione reductase (GR) and Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were evident, suggesting their preventive role against the several environmental stresses during the acclimatization of the plant. Further gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of both mother and in vitro raised plants showed the occurrence of more than 60 diverse phyto-chemicals in the methanolic root extract. HPLC analysis of the root extract revealed the presence of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2H4MB), a potential phytoactive compound and flavouring agent. 2H4MB content quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in methanol extract was 17.94 μg/ml. The genetic stability of the regenerated plantlets with mother plant was confirmed by the presence of monomorphic bands generated through inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.6-5-EP/DS/224cDEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, INDIA 3aHemidesmus indicus 3aacclimation 3aartificial seeds 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abenzyladenine 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3acatalase 3aculture media 3aencapsulation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agelation 3agenetic stability 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogels 3aindole butyric acid 3aliquids 3amethanol 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplantlets 3aregrowth 3arooting 3ashoots 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aShahzad, A.1 aAhmad, Z.1 aSharma, S.1 aParveen, S.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Aug., v. 138, no. 2 p.363-376dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01634-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245012200167500001400289520134600303592002801649650001601677650001301693650002001706650001501726650002301741650002301764650001801787650001401805650001201819650002401831650002001855700001301875700003401888700003101922700003601953700002801989700002802017700002902045773012002074856007502194852000902269655001202278IND60731995320221120230006.0210326e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073199532DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110308602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Thais  Correia10aSkeletal Muscle Development in Postnatal Beef Cattle Resulting from Maternal Protein Restriction during Mid-Gestation  aNAL-light  aWe aimed to investigate the effects of maternal protein restriction during mid-gestation on the skeletal muscle composition of the offspring. In the restriction treatment (RES, n = 9), cows were fed a basal diet, while in the control (CON, n = 9) group cows received the same RES diet plus the protein supplement during mid-gestation (100–200d). Samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle were collected from the offspring at 30d and 450d postnatal. Muscle fiber number was found to be decreased as a result of maternal protein restriction and persisted throughout the offspring’s life (p < 0.01). The collagen content was enhanced (p < 0.05) due to maternal protein restriction at 30d. MHC2X mRNA expression tended to be higher (p = 0.08) in RES 30d offspring, however, no difference (p > 0.05) was found among treatments at 450d. Taken together, our results suggest that maternal protein restriction during mid-gestation has major and persistent effects by reducing muscle fiber formation and may slightly increase collagen accumulation in the skeletal muscle of the offspring. Although maternal protein restriction may alter the muscle fiber metabolism by favoring the establishment of a predominant glycolytic metabolism, the postnatal environment may be a determinant factor that establishes the different proportion of muscle fiber types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef cattle 3acollagen 3agene expression 3aglycolysis 3alongissimus muscle 3amuscle development 3amuscle fibers 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aprotein supplements 3askeletal muscle1 aDu, Min 1 aNascimento, Karolina  Batista1 aGalvão, Matheus  Castilho1 aMeneses, Javier  Andrés Moreno1 aSchultz, Erica  Beatriz1 aGionbelli, Mateus  Pies1 aDuarte, Marcio  de Souza0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 18, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013000161520166700291592002801958650002801986650001502014650001302029650001402042650001302056650001602069650002102085650001502106650002502121650001802146650001802164650002402182650002002206650000902226650001702235650001202252650001702264700002002281700002402301773011802325856007702443852000902520655001202529IND60768397220221120165315.0220225e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076839722DNAL7 a10.3390/land110202552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRietra, René 12aA Review of Crop Husbandry and Soil Management Practices Using Meta-Analysis Studies: Towards Soil-Improving Cropping Systems  aCoherent improvements in crop varieties and crop husbandry and soil management practices are needed to increase global crop production in a sustainable manner. However, these practices are often discussed separately, and as a result there is little overview. Here, we present a database and synthesis of 154 meta-analysis studies related to ten main crop husbandry and soil management practices, including crop type and rotations, tillage, drainage, nutrient management, irrigation and fertigation, weed management, pest management, crop residue management, mechanization and technology, and landscape management. Most meta-analysis studies were related to tillage (55), followed by crop type and rotations (32), nutrient management (25), crop residue management (19), and irrigation and fertigation (18). Few studies were related to landscape management (6) and mechanization and technology (2). In terms of outcome, studies focused on crop yield and quality (81), soil quality (73), and environmental impacts (56), and little on economic effects (7) or resource use efficiency (24). Reported effects of alternative practices, relative to conventional practice, were positive in general. Effect sizes were relatively large for environmental effects (nutrient leaching, greenhouse gas emissions), and small for soil quality (except for soil life) and crop yield. Together, meta-analysis studies indicate that there is large scope for increasing cropland productivity and minimizing environmental impacts. A roadmap is provided for integration and optimization of all ten practices, and recommendations are formulated to address the gaps in meta-analysis studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop residue management 3acrop yield 3acropland 3adatabases 3adrainage 3afertigation 3agreenhouse gases 3airrigation 3alandscape management 3amechanization 3ameta-analysis 3anutrient management 3apest management 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atillage 3aweed control1 aHeinen, Marius 1 aOenema, O.q(Oene),0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 08, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010300163520158100266592002801847650001501875650001301890650001701903650002001920650001601940650003001956650002601986650002902012650001902041650002702060650001702087650001902104650001402123650001202137650002402149700002302173700002402196700002502220700002302245700002702268700002002295773013002315856007402445852000902519655001202528IND60750083420221120101322.0210910e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008342DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131734872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvashov, Sergey I.10aDesign and Applications of Multi-Frequency Holographic Subsurface Radar: Review and Case Histories  aHolographic subsurface radar (HSR) is not currently in widespread usage. This is due to a historical perspective in the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) community that the high attenuation of electromagnetic waves in most media of interest and the inability to apply time-varying gain to the continuous-wave (CW) HSR signal preclude sufficient effective penetration depth. While it is true that the fundamental physics of HSR, with its use of a CW signal, does not allow amplification of later (i.e., deeper) arrivals in lossy media (as is possible with impulse subsurface radar (ISR)), HSR has distinct advantages. The most important of these is the ability to do shallow subsurface imaging with a resolution that is not possible with ISR. In addition, the design of an HSR system is simpler than for ISR due to the relatively low-tech transmitting and receiving antennae. This paper provides a review of the main principles of HSR through an optical analogy and describes possible algorithms for radar hologram reconstruction. We also present a review of the history of development of systems and applications of the RASCAN type, which is possibly the only commercially available holographic subsurface radar. Among the subsurface imaging and remote sensing applications considered are humanitarian demining, construction inspection, nondestructive testing of dielectric aerospace materials, surveys of historic architecture and artworks, paleontology, and security screening. Each application is illustrated with relevant data acquired in laboratory and/or field experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aantennae 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adielectrics 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3afield experimentation 3aground-penetrating radar 3aimage analysis 3anondestructive methods 3apaleontology 3aremote sensing 3ascreening 3asurveys 3asystems engineering1 aCapineri, Lorenzo 1 aBechtel, Timothy D.1 aRazevig, Vladimir V.1 aInagaki, Masaharu 1 aGueorguiev, Nikolay L.1 aKizilay, Ahmet 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 13, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131734873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265500001500281520160700296592002801903650001401931650002801945650002101973650002201994650002502016650001602041650001802057650002002075650002502095650001502120650003502135650001602170650001602186650000902202650000902211650001002220650001602230650001702246650001502263650003402278653000902312653003402321653001702355653001702372653003702389700001802426700001202444700001302456700001602469700001702485700001602502700001402518700001602532700001702548700001702565773011102582856008202693852000902775655001202784IND60086550220221116142911.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008655022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yanling10aPaeoniflorin protects against ANIT-induced cholestasis by ameliorating oxidative stress in rats  ap. 242-248.  a2019-12-06  aPaeoniflorin, one of the primary bioactive components in Chi shao, are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. A lot of evidences suggest that Paeoniflorin has potential anti-oxidant effects. However, whether Paeoniflorin plays roles in cholestasis is unclear. In this study, we examined the protective effect of Paeoniforin against alpha-naphthylisothicaynate (ANIT)-induced cholestasis in rats. Our data demonstrated that the high (0.2g/kg body weight) and medium (0.1g/kg body weight) doses of Paeoniflorin significantly prevented ANIT-induced changes in bile flow and the serum levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total bile acid, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate-oxaloacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, we also found that Paeoniflorin significantly inhibited nitric oxide and malondialdehyde production, and restored glutathione decrease induced by ANIT. EPR data further indicated that Paeoniflorin inhibited ANIT-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The overexpression of NADPH oxidase 4 induced by ANIT were significantly reversed when treated with Paeoniflorin, suggesting that Paeoniflorin could scavenge ROS via inhibiting NADPH oxidase 4 expression. Paeoniflorin treatment could also relieve ANIT-induced liver pathological injuries as indicated by histological assay. These findings indicate that Paeoniflorin exerts a dose-dependent protective effect on ANIT-induced cholestatic liver injury in rats, and the mechanism of this activity is related to its attenuation of oxidative stress in liver tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3areactive oxygen species 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aglutathione 3adose response 3amalondialdehyde 3aalanine transaminase 3atoxicology 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abile 3arats 3aliver 3acholestasis 3anitric oxide 3abile acids 3aOriental traditional medicine 0aRats 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aPaeoniflorin 0aantioxidants 0aα-Naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)1 aZhou, Guangde1 aLaokui,1 aJia, Lei1 aZhang, Ping1 aLi, Ruisheng1 aShan, Limei1 aLiu, Bing1 aSong, Xueai1 aLiu, Shijing1 aXiao, Xiaohe0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 58 p.242-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01233naa a2200205 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245003000132300001200162520064600174592002800820650001500848651001800863773012500881852000901006655001201015IND60300798220221120160526.0150703e20121116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030079822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalakoff, David10aChange Versus Experience?  ap. 875.  aThis month, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will choose from among a trio of veteran politicians vying to become the next chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.

Beauv. var. formosensis Ohwi (2n = 6x = 54, AABBCC genomes) and Echinochloa oryzicola (Vasinger) Vasinger (2n = 4x = 36, AABB) are major paddy weeds in East and Southeast Asia. E. oryzicola has been generally considered to be a paternal genome donor of E. crus‐galli s. l., which includes E. crus‐galli var. formosensis based on cpDNA sequences. Thus, molecular characterization using polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of cpDNA has been proposed as a reliable method for discriminating between the two species. In this study, we report that four accessions of E. crus‐galli var. formosensis from Okinawa, Nagasaki, Shizuoka and Tokyo had similar cpDNA sequences to E. oryzicola and had been misidentified as E. oryzicola using molecular methods. In addition, our results demonstrated that these accessions likely inherited their chloroplast genomes from E. oryzicola and not from an anonymous diploid species during polyploidization. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution of E. crus‐galli s. l. and suggest that identification using the cpDNA molecular method alone is not an appropriate approach to differentiate E. crus‐galli var. formosensis and E. oryzicola.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP22580017cGrants‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aEchinochloa oryzoides 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genome 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3ainheritance (genetics) 3anucleotide sequences 3apaddies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aweeds 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aNakayama, Yuichiro0 tWeed biology and management.g2019 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.93-102dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl69850x1444-61627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wbm.121853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245015800163520140100321592002801722650002101750650001001771650002301781650001301804650003801817650001201855650001301867650001201880650002401892650001301916650001801929650000901947650001201956650001601968650001001984650001401994650002102008650001602029651001202045651002302057651001202080651001902092651001902111651001402130651001302144700002302157700002402180700002202204773011702226852000902343856008402352655001202436IND4412257720221118062158.0181130s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441225772DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2008-0718-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnas, Osama14aThe Effect of Warming Winter Temperatures on the Severity of Pierce's Disease in the Appalachian Mountains and Piedmont of the Southeastern United States  aPierce's disease (PD) caused by Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a major threat to the rapidly growing Vitis vinifera/French-American hybrid winegrape industry in the southeastern United States. The bacterium, which is transmitted by xylemfeeding insects, is unable to survive low winter temperatures, and infected vines often recover the next year. Maps available from the 1970s indicate that PD is not a serious threat in the southeastern US, where the average minimum January temperature is ≤ 1.7°C. However PD symptoms developed in many vineyards planted in the late 1990s in areas identified as low risk. Surveys conducted in North Carolina and Georgia confirmed the presence of Xf in symptomatic vines using ELISA kits. Weather data for November to March from 84 weather stations from 1972-2005 for Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia were used to construct new maps using ArcGIS 9.1, and PD survey data from vineyards were superimposed on the maps. Areas for low risk for PD corresponded most closely with a minimum winter temperature of ≤ -12.2°C for 2 to 3 days or ≤ -9.4°C for 4 to 5 days. Warm winter temperatures during the last 8 years have resulted in a significant shift in the isotherms towards the north and west, increasing the risk of PD in the Piedmont region of the Southeast, and have extended the threat into Virginia and Tennessee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPierce's disease 3aVitis 3aXylella fastidiosa 3abacteria 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3ainsects 3ameteorological data 3apiedmont 3aplanting date 3arisk 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avines 3avineyards 3aweather stations 3awine grapes 3aAlabama 3aAppalachian region 3aGeorgia 3aNorth Carolina 3aSouth Carolina 3aTennessee 3aVirginia1 aHarrison, Una Jean1 aBrannen, Phillip M.1 aSutton, Turner B.0 tPlant health progress.g2008, v. 9, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2008-0718-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02998naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013100177300001600308520178100324592002802105650001602133650002102149650001102170650001602181650001302197650001402210650001602224700002502240700002802265700003402293700006502327700002002392773013302412856008202545852000902627655001202636IND60684874120221120191058.0200226e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068487412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-019-02061-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinkalu, Victor Olusegun10aChanges in feed consumption and water intake among broiler chickens subjected to melatonin treatment during the hot-dry season  ap. 717-723.  aThe experiment was conducted to evaluate changes in feed consumption and water intake among broiler chickens subjected to melatonin treatment during the hot-dry season. A total of 300 broiler chicks were selected and assigned into three groups, by simple random sampling, comprising 100 chicks each: group I was exposed to natural photoperiod of about 12-h light and 12-h darkness cycle (12D/12L), without melatonin supplementation; group II was kept under 24-h continuous lighting (CL), without melatonin supplementation; and group III was raised under 24-h CL and administered daily with melatonin orally at 0.5 mg/kg (CL + MEL). Live weight (LW), feed consumption, and water intake for each group were obtained at weekly intervals over a period of 8 weeks. On day 42 of age, the LW of 2420 ± 50 g/bird was obtained in group III administered with melatonin (CL + MEL), while LW values recorded in the 12D/12L and CL groups not administered with melatonin were 1470.00 ± 30.00 and 1907.00 ± 38.00 g/bird, respectively. The mean weight gain in CL + MEL (345.00 ± 21.01 g) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of the 12D/12L (244.99 ± 18.67 g) and CL (307.48 ± 18.14 g) groups. Feed consumptions were significantly (P < 0.05) different in all the groups. Group II, raised on CL without melatonin supplementation, had the highest feed consumption value of 25.14 ± 0.51 g/bird from day 14, and attained the peak value of 206.77 ± 7.82 g/bird at day 56. The highest overall amount of water intake was recorded in the melatonin-treated group. In conclusion, melatonin administration to broiler chickens enhanced water intake but decreased feed consumption with increase in LW during the hot-dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3afeed intake 3alighting 3amelatonin 3aweight gain1 aAyo, Joseph Olusegun1 aHambolu, Joseph Olajide1 aAdelaiye, Alexander Babatunde1 aZakari, Friday Ocheja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1121-11991 aAluwong, Tagang0 tTropical animal health and production.g2020 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.717-723dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02061-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010200174520192000276592002802196650002402224650001002248650002102258650001102279650001802290650000902308650002202317650001202339650002502351650001602376653001002392653001902402653001502421653002202436653002102458653001502479700002202494773010602516856008602622852000902708655001202717IND60674117120221123001639.0200427e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067411712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelnap, Starlie C.10aPrenatal light exposure influences gait performance and body composition in bobwhite quail chicks  aMaternal nesting behavior, which includes periods of patterned inattention, provides key elements essential for avian embryonic development, including regulation of temperature and light. For example, avian research consistently shows the importance of prenatal light exposure for several developmental processes; however, this research has primarily focused on artificial light regimens (i.e. 24 hr, 0 hr light). Comparatively less is known about how exposure to naturally occurring light patterns during incubation influence motor performance, body composition (i.e. body mass, bone length), and developmental age (incubation length). Here we conducted two experiments which investigated the effects of prenatal light exposure on developmental age, body composition, and gait performance in 1-day-old bobwhite quail. Experiment 1 investigated crepuscular light exposure during the last two days of incubation under two light duration treatments (2 hr & 6 hr) compared to a 12 hr continuous light schedule. Results indicated crepuscular prenatal light experience extended the incubation period for 2 hr exposed embryos, but not for 6 hr exposed embryos and negatively influenced postnatal body composition and postnatal gait performance when compared to 12 hr continuous light embryos. Experiment 2 examined the influence of prenatal light duration (2 hr vs 6 hr) and light presentation (crepuscular vs sporadic). Results demonstrated sporadic light presentation improved gait performance in 2 hr exposed hatchlings, but not 6 hr exposed hatchlings, improved body composition in 6 hr exposed hatchlings, but not 2 hr exposed hatchlings, and did not alter incubation length when compared to crepuscular light counterparts. This study provides further evidence for the importance of maternally regulated sensory stimulation during the prenatal period on early postnatal motor development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColinus virginianus 3abirds 3abody composition 3achicks 3aembryogenesis 3agait 3amotor development 3anesting 3aprenatal development 3atemperature 0aAvian 0aPrenatal light 0aKinematics 0aMotor performance 0aBody composition 0aIncubation1 aLickliter, Robert0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.112706-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010800163300001600271520088500287592002801172650002401200650002501224650001701249650001401266650001701280650001401297650002001311650001301331650000901344650001601353650002501369650001801394650002801412650002301440650001801463650001801481650001101499700002501510700003001535700001501565773010401580856008101684852000901765655001201774IND4468974820221118232601.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrigueros, L.10aUse of date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) blanching water for reconstituting milk powder: Yogurt manufacture  ap. 506-514.  aThe processing of dates yields high volumes of blanching water.

P.Beauv.  ap. 85-92.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aButton grass (Dactyloctenium radulans) is a native, widely spread summer grass weed species in Australia. However, limited information is available on the seed germination biology of this species. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on the germination and emergence of two populations of D. radulans. The seeds of these populations were collected separately from Dalby, Queensland and Coleambally, NSW. Seeds were germinated at a range of constant and alternating temperatures (25/15, 30/20, 35/25 and 40/30°C day/night). The greatest seed germination was at a constant temperature of 30°C. Seed germination was reduced at the lowest alternating temperature (25/15°C). Germination of both populations was strongly stimulated by light, suggesting a great amount of emergence of D. radulans on bare ground, such as crop seedbeds. Germination of the D. radulans population collected from a northern cotton farming system (Dalby) was more tolerant to a greater range of salt stress than the population sourced from the south (Coleambally). Seeds of both populations germinated over a wide range of pH, between 4 and 10. However, germination was the greatest in a high pH buffer solution, indicating that the species prefers to germinate in alkaline soil. These results showed that D. radulans seeds possess a wide range of tolerance mechanisms to different environmental stresses. Information obtained in this study will help in developing more sustainable and effective integrated weed management strategies for the control of this weed and weeds with similar responses in summer cropping systems, such as cotton.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSW Department of Primary Industries  cCotton Research Development and Corporation 3aDactyloctenium 3aalkaline soils 3acotton 3acropping systems 3aenvironmental factors 3afarming systems 3agrass weeds 3agrasses 3aintegrated weed management 3apH 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseedbeds 3aseeds 3asummer 3atemperature 3aNew South Wales 3aQueensland1 aKoetz, Eric1 aRahamāna, Ājijura,0 tWeed biology and management.g2019 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.85-92dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl69850x1444-61627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wbm.121833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016100159300001600320500002000336520125500356592002801611596008101639596002701720650004401747650001401791650001201805650001101817650002901828650001001857650002301867650000901890700002101899700002601920700001801946700005601964773015002020856007502170852000902245655001202254IND60786560220221120161736.0220804e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078656022DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.123502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, Alicia10aAnalysis of the Content of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters in Biodiesel by Fourier‐Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: Method and Comparison with Gas Chromatography  ap. 651-661.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe increasing importance of sustainability in energy production has led to a global commitment to the use of fuels derived from renewable biological sources, such as biodiesel produced from plant crops or biomass residues, that do not compete with human food for their production. For a biofuel to be considered biodiesel, it must satisfy the specifications described in the UNE 14214, with the UNE‐EN 14103 referring to the determination of fatty acid methyl ester content. This standard applies gas chromatography as an analytical technique. Gas chromatography is a widely used technique in the analysis of methyl ester although it has a number of drawbacks such as: long analysis times, a high consumption of high‐quality gases and internal standards, does not allow the analysis of different compounds with the same column, etc. From an industrial production point of view, is necessary to know the fatty acid methyl ester content in biodiesel samples quickly. This paper studies the development of an analytical method using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as alternative to gas chromatography (GC), since it is a simple, rapid, and precise analytical technique to quantify fatty acid methyl ester content in biofuel samples.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgencia Canaria de Investigación, Innovación y Sociedad de la Información  cDISA Renovables S.L.U. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afoods 3agas chromatography 3aoils1 aFuentes, Beatriz1 aRodríguez, Karina E.1 aBrito, Andrea1 aLala,cChef,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0310-37290 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2020 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.651-661dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.123503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014000171300001600311500001500327520109600342592002801438650002401466650001801490650001801508650000901526650002401535650001501559650001501574650002501589650002201614650002501636650002601661650001701687650001201704653000801716653000801724653002401732653002501756653000701781653000801788653000701796653000901803653000701812653000901819653003201828653000801860653003301868653003001901653000801931653000801939653002501947653001001972653000901982653000901991653000802000700001502008700005802023700002102081700002202102700005502124700001602179700001602195700001902211773010002230856008702330852000902417655001202426IND60526004220221120212911.0190402e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052600422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolaev, I.V.10aBiocatalytic conversion of poultry processing leftovers: Optimization of hydrolytic conditions and peptide hydrolysate characterization  ap. 611-621.  a2019-12-06  aPeptide hydrolysate (PH) was produced by deep controllable bioconversion of poultry processing leftovers (broiler necks), by means of a multienzyme composition, containing four commercially available enzyme preparations (Alcalase, Neutrase, Flavourzyme, Protamex). The design of multienzyme composition (MEC) was applied to yield a hydrolysate with adjusted properties, including minimized antigenicity and bitterness.The protein recovery was optimized using Box–Behnken response surface design. The individual and interactive effects of hydrolysis conditions (time, hydromodule and MEC dosage) were studied. The experimental data were analyzed by ANOVA method and a well-predictive, second order polynomial model was developed using multiple regression analysis. Optimal hydrolysis conditions were found to be: hydrolysis time 3h, hydromodule 2.25l/kg and dosage of MEC 0.25%. The corresponding predicted value for protein recovery was 75.34%, 2 times higher compared to traditional long-term heating hydrolysis. The PH obtained is a low allergenic product with high antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3aprotein value 3aallergenicity 3aheat 3aregression analysis 3asubtilisin 3ahydrolysis 3aprotein hydrolysates 3abiotransformation 3aantioxidant activity 3aslaughterhouse wastes 3ahydrolysates 3apoultry 0aUAR 0aRSM 0aProtein hydrolysate 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aPR 0aAOC 0aTE 0aTEAC 0aPH 0aORAC 0aRacemization of amino acids 0aMEC 0aPoultry processing leftovers 0aFunctional animal protein 0aSRM 0aAAS 0aanalysis of variance 0aABTS+ 0aABTS 0aAAPH 0aPER1 aSforza, S.1 aLambertini, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4024-35981 aIsmailova, D.Yu.1 aKhotchenkov, V.P.1 aVolik, V.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1798-20931 aDossena, A.1 aPopov, V.O.1 aKoroleva, O.V.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.611-621dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007700160520174400237592002801981650001602009650001102025650001102036650001302047650001602060650001002076650001802086650001102104650001602115700002802131700001902159700002002178700002602198773012902224856007402353852000902427655001202436IND60750083720221120101301.0210910e20210824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075008372DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131733562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsayed, Ahmad 10aDrone-Assisted Confined Space Inspection and Stockpile Volume Estimation  aThe accuracy of stockpile estimations is of immense criticality to process optimisation and overall financial decision making within manufacturing operations. Despite well-established correlations between inventory management and profitability, safe deployment of stockpile measurement and inspection activities remain challenging and labour-intensive. This is perhaps owing to a combination of size, shape irregularity as well as the health hazards of cement manufacturing raw materials and products. Through a combination of simulations and real-life assessment within a fully integrated cement plant, this study explores the potential of drones to safely enhance the accuracy of stockpile volume estimations. Different types of LiDAR sensors in combination with different flight trajectory options were fully assessed through simulation whilst mapping representative stockpiles placed in both open and fully confined areas. During the real-life assessment, a drone was equipped with GPS for localisation, in addition to a 1D LiDAR and a barometer for stockpile height estimation. The usefulness of the proposed approach was established based on mapping of a pile with unknown volume in an open area, as well as a pile with known volume within a semi-confined area. Visual inspection of the generated stockpile surface showed strong correlations with the actual pile within the open area, and the volume of the pile in the semi-confined area was accurately measured. Finally, a comparative analysis of cost and complexity of the proposed solution to several existing initiatives revealed its proficiency as a low-cost robotic system within confined spaces whereby visibility, air quality, humidity, and high temperature are unfavourable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acement 3aflight 3ahumidity 3ainventories 3alidar 3aprofitability 3arobots 3atemperature1 aYunusa-Kaltungo, Akilu 1 aQuinn, Mark K.1 aArvin, Farshad 1 aNabawy, Mostafa R.

A conventionally-made microgel sample was also fabricated by using hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment on 5.8 and subsequent heating at 85 °C. Size approximation of microgel particles from atomic force microscopy images indicated that chemical cross-linking resulted in smaller particles (80–130 nm and 100–150 nm for post- and pre-microgelification cross-linked samples, respectively) compared with conventional counterpart (150–300 nm). Based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, it was concluded that prolonged citric acid cross-linking of whey proteins prior to microgelification caused extensive cross-linking of protein units and preserved proteins α-helical structure. The pre-cross-linked microgels formed firmer (higher fracture stress and complex modulus) calcium-induced cold-set bulk gel with higher water-holding capacity and denser microstructure compared with conventional and post-cross-linked microgels. These superiorities were attributed to existence of higher number of carboxyl residues in the structure of the pre-cross-linked microgels. The alteration in the properties of the final bulk hydrogels via cross-linking of the microgel building-units can be exploited for modulating and controlling the release behavior of loaded cargo within hydrogel, resulting in a more tuned application of gels as edible delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGRAS substances 3aatomic force microscopy 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrocolloids 3amechanical stress 3amicrostructure 3apH 3awater holding capacity 3awhey protein 0aWhey protein microgel 0aHydrogel 0aCross-linker 0aCitric acid1 aMadadlou, Ashkan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4755-06351 aLabbafi, Mohsen0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2015 Aug., v. 50 p.159-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008000171300001400251520237900265592002802644650001002672650001402682650001302696650001102709650000902720650001102729650000902740650001102749700002102760700002402781700002102805700001602826700002002842773008702862856008402949852000903033655001203042IND60097594320221119172157.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDixon, Sherry L.10aWindow replacement and residential lead paint hazard control 12 years later  ap. 14-20.  aWindow replacement is a key method of reducing childhood lead exposure, but the long-term effectiveness has not been previously evaluated. Windows have the highest levels of interior lead paint and dust compared to other building components. Our objective was to conduct a follow-up study of residential window replacement and lead hazard control 12 years after homes were enrolled in an evaluation of the HUD Lead Hazard Control Grant Program, sampling settled lead dust in housing in four cities (n=189 homes). Previous work evaluated lead hazard controls up to 6 years after intervention using dust lead measurements and two years after intervention using both dust and blood lead data. But the earlier work could not examine the effect of window replacement over the longer time period examined here: 12 years. The individual homes were assigned to one of three categories, based on how many windows had been replaced: all replacement, some replacement, or non-replacement. Windows that were not replaced were repaired. We controlled for covariates such as site, housing condition, presence of lead paint, and season using longitudinal regression modeling. Adjusted floor and sill dust lead geometric mean dust lead loadings declined at least 85% from pre-intervention to 12 years after the intervention for homes with all replacement windows, some windows replaced and no windows replaced. Twelve years after intervention, homes with all replacement windows had 41% lower interior floor dust lead, compared to non-replacement homes (1.4 versus 2.4μg/ft², p<0.001), and window sill dust lead was 51% lower (25 versus 52μg/ft², p=0.006) while controlling for covariates. Homes with some windows replaced had interior floor and window sill dust lead loadings that were 28% (1.7 versus 2.4μg/ft², p=0.19) and 37% (33 versus 52μg/ft², p=0.07) lower, respectively, compared to non-replacement homes. The net economic benefit of window replacement compared to window repair (non-replacement) is $1700–$2000 per housing unit. Homes in which all windows were replaced had significantly lower lead dust. New windows are also likely to reduce energy use and improve home value. Lead-safe window replacement is an important element of lead hazard control, weatherization, renovation and housing investment strategies and should be implemented broadly to protect children.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achildhood 3achildren 3acities 3adust 3aenergy 3alead 3amodels1 aJacobs, David E.1 aWilson, Jonathan W.1 aAkoto, Judith Y.1 aNevin, Rick1 aScott Clark, C.0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 Feb., v. 113 p.14-20dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245006600181300001600247500001900263500000900282520140600291592002801697650001301725650001001738650001401748650002301762650001601785650001601801650001601817650001401833650000901847650001701856700001901873773012101892856009702013852000902110655001202119IND60663612520221119022901.0191122e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066361252DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100030035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonkerd, W.

The system consists of four independent glass-bottom root observation boxes, each suspended from a load cell mounted on a support structure. The boxes have a 5° lengthwise downward slope from the plant location and contain a shallow layer of soil about 2 cm deep A plant is supported and weighed by a fifth load cell. Using a voltmeter with a 1-µv resolution, an overall system accuracy of ±2.0 g is possible for observation box weights and ±0.4 g for the plant weight. Root growth is recorded using time-lapse photography. Photographic slides are projected on a screen and root lengths are estimated using a line-intercept method. A sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) plant was used to evaluate the system. A seedling was grown in nutrient solution until eight adventitious roots had lengths at least 25 cm long. Two roots were then planted into each observation box. System performance tests illustrated how hourly, daily, and long-term data can be used to relate plant weight, leaf area, root length, and water uptake. Split root observation systems of this type provide quantitative information on how different root zone conditions of a single plant affect root growth, water uptake, and top growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aglass 3aleaf area 3anutrient solutions 3aphotography 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3asoil 3awater uptake1 aRitchie, J.

Laccase and microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) were successively employed to the SBP/SG dispersion, so as to induce the formation of the covalent cross-links among the SBP and SG molecules. Uniaxial compression measurements indicated that the DN gels exhibited greater mechanical toughness than the gels with corresponding single network which was only cross-linked by mTGase. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation demonstrated that the phase separation behavior of the two biopolymers at different length scales resulted in the formation of a highly heterogeneous and hierarchical microstructure in the DN gel. The higher structural complexity and mechanical integrity derived from this architecture might be mainly responsible for the enhancement of the gel toughness. A significant decrease of the gel toughness and the disappearance of the hierarchical microstructure were observed in the DN gel prepared by SG and the modified SBP which was subjected to an acidic protease treatment to remove the protein components in SBP. This suggested that the amphiphilic property and the structural heterogeneity of SBP might be the dominant factor in the formation of the unique microstructure in the enzymatic cross-linked protein/polysaccharide DN gel system. These results suggested that the DN principle could widen the texture range of gel-like foods and offer food industry an attractive strategy for developing hierarchical gel architectures via manipulating complex phase separation behavior of protein and polysaccharide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acrosslinking 3afood industry 3afoods 3agels 3aglycinin 3ahydrocolloids 3alaccase 3amicrostructure 3apectins 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aproteinases 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseparation 3asoy protein 3asugar beet 3atexture 0aProtein/polysaccharide mixed gel 0aDouble network gel 0aMechanical toughness 0aTexture 0aHierarchical structure1 aGuo, Jian1 aWang, Jin-Mei1 aHe, Xiu-Ting1 aYuan, Yang1 aYin, Shou-Wei1 aYang, Xiao-Quan0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2015 Aug., v. 50 p.94-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008500176300001400261520127100275592002801546650002101574650002001595650002601615650001201641650001901653650001101672650001601683650001001699650001701709650001201726650001901738650001101757650001601768650001501784650001701799650001001816650000901826700002201835700002101857700002501878700002401903700002101927700001801948773008701966856008402053852000902137655001202146IND60097594420221119172450.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009759442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHölzel, Christina S.10aHeavy metals in liquid pig manure in light of bacterial antimicrobial resistance  ap. 21-27.  aHeavy metals are regularly found in liquid pig manure, and might interact with bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Concentrations of heavy metals were determined by atomic spectroscopic methods in 305 pig manure samples and were connected to the phenotypic resistance of Escherichia coli (n=613) against 29 antimicrobial drugs. Concentrations of heavy metals (/kg dry matter) were 0.08–5.30mg cadmium, 1.1–32.0mg chrome, 22.4–3387.6mg copper, <2.0–26.7mg lead, <0.01–0.11mg mercury, 3.1–97.3mg nickel and 93.0–8239.0mg zinc. Associated with the detection of copper and zinc, resistance rates against β-lactams were significantly elevated. By contrast, the presence of mercury was significantly associated with low antimicrobial resistance rates of Escherichia coli against β-lactams, aminoglycosides and other antibiotics. Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of mercury on bacterial resistance against penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and doxycycline were also demonstrated in a laboratory trial. Antimicrobial resistance in the porcine microflora might be increased by copper and zinc. By contrast, the occurrence of mercury in the environment might, due to co-toxicity, act counter-selective against antimicrobial resistant strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3acadmium 3acephalosporins 3acopper 3adoxycycline 3adrugs 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3amicroorganisms 3anickel 3apenicillins 3apig manure 3aspectroscopy 3aswine 3azinc1 aMüller, Christa,1 aHarms, Katrin S.1 aMikolajewski, Sabine1 aSchäfer, Stefanie,1 aSchwaiger, Karin1 aBauer, Johann0 tEnvironmental research.g2012 Feb., v. 113 p.21-27dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011300171300001600284520134400300592002801644596006901672596006801741650002401809650002701833650001101860650001101871650001501882650001401897650002601911650002101937650002901958650004401987700006002031700001702091700002402108773013302132856008202265852000902347655001202356IND60684874420221120191233.0200226e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068487442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-019-02080-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltayban, Abdullah10aCefotaxime pharmacokinetics in Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) calves after single intravenous injection  ap. 887-891.  aCefotaxime is a third-generation broad-spectrum cephalosporin acting on a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this work, the pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime were determined in dromedary camel calves by single intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg b.w. Cefotaxime levels were estimated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Cefotaxime pharmacokinetics in camel calves obeyed three-compartment kinetics model. There was a central compartment and two peripheral, one shallow and one deep compartment. The shallow compartment equilibrates very rapidly with distribution half-life (t₁/₂α) of 0.6 min, while the deep compartment has large distribution half-life (t₁/₂ᵦ) of 42 min indicating slower uptake of cefotaxime. The elimination rate constant (γ = 0.04 h⁻¹) and elimination half-life (t₁/₂ ᵧ) = 15.46 h indicating slow elimination. In comparison with other animals, cefotaxime pharmacokinetics in camel calves showed potential wide distribution in multi-compartment, lower elimination constant, lower clearance and higher volume of distribution at steady state. This indicates substantial differences in cefotaxime pharmacokinetics in camel calves with a very characteristic ultra-rapid distribution into three-compartment and slow elimination.  aPublisher supplied data  a172029cDeanship of Scientific Research (King Faisal University)  a186253cDeanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acalves 3acamels 3acefotaxime 3ahalf life 3aintravenous injection 3apharmacokinetics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aKandeel, Mahmoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3668-51471 aTahoun, Amin1 aAl-Nazawi, Mohammed0 tTropical animal health and production.g2020 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.887-891dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02080-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245013100214506007600345520168500421592002802106506003702134650001602171650001302187650002102200650001802221650002102239650001602260650002002276650001802296650001702314650001402331650002302345650001002368650001802378650001202396650004302408650000902451650001402460650001002474650001102484650002502495653001602520653000902536653001702545653001602562653001202578653002402590700002102614700002202635700002402657700002502681773010602706856008602812852000902898655001202907IND60674117420221207131905.0200427e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067411742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127192doi7 aPMC68973212pmcid7 a316345242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudet, Darryl A.10aExpression of neural markers of gustatory signaling are differentially altered by continuous and intermittent feeding patterns  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFood intake patterns are regulated by signals from the gustatory neural circuit, a complex neural network that begins at the tongue and continues to homeostatic and hedonic brain regions involved in eating behavior. The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of continuous access to a high fat diet (HFD) versus limited access to dietary fat on the gustatory neural circuit. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a chow diet, a HFD (56% kcal from fat), or provided limited, daily (2 h/day) or limited, intermittent (2 h/day, 3 times/week) access to vegetable shortening for 2 weeks. Real time PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of markers of fat sensing/signaling (e.g. CD36) on the circumvallate papillae, markers of homeostatic eating in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and markers of hedonic eating in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Continuous HFD increased mRNA levels of lingual CD36 and serotonin signaling, altered markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access to dietary fat selectively altered the expression of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine signaling. Overall, these data suggest that short-term, continuous access to HFD leads to altered fat taste and decreased expression of markers of homeostatic and hedonic eating. Limited, intermittent access, or binge-like, consumption of dietary fat led to an overall increase in markers of hedonic eating, without altering expression of lingual fat sensors or homeostatic eating. These data suggest that there are differential effects of meal patterns on gustatory neurocircuitry which may regulate the overconsumption of fat and lead to obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adietary fat 3adopamine 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3afeeding patterns 3afood intake 3agene expression 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypothalamus 3aingestion 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3aserotonin 3ataste 3atongue 3avegetable shortening 0aDietary fat 0aCD36 0aMeal pattern 0aHomeostatic 0aHedonic 0aLingual fat sensing1 aEl-Desoky, Dalia1 aPoret, Jonquil M.1 aBraymer, H.

Forty-eight noncastrated male Nellore cattle (15 ± 2 months and 389.5 ± 20 kg of body weight) were used in a completely randomized design to evaluate the following treatments: protein-energy supplement (PES) without rumen-protected oil (control: CO), PES containing palm rumen-protected oil (PRPO), PES containing soybean rumen-protected oil (SRPO), and PES containing a mixture of soybean and palm rumen-protected oil (SPRPO). The study lasted 112 days, and there was a decrease in crude protein intake (P < 0.05) and an increase in ether extract intake (P < 0.05) when rumen-protected oil was included in the supplements. In comparison to the palm rumen-protected oil supplement, the soybean rumen-protected oil supplement promoted a lower average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05); however, regardless of the rumen-protected oil source, an increase in the fat thickness of the subcutaneous tissue was observed. In addition, there was no difference in carcass gain (P > 0.05) regardless of oil source. Rumen-protected oil is a tool to increase the finishing of pasture-finished young beef cattle in the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acarcass characteristics 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adry season 3afat thickness 3afinishing 3agrazing 3amales 3anutrients 3apalm oils 3apastures 3aprotein intake 3asoybeans1 aZervoudakis, Joanis Tilemahos1 ada Silva Cabral, Luciano1 aHatamoto-Zervoudakis, Luciana Keiko1 ada Freiria, Lucien Bissi1 ae Silva, Yasmim Rodrigues Vilas Boas1 aPaulino, Pedro Veiga Rodrigues1 aTsuneda, Pedro Paulo1 aPossamai, Adriano Jorge0 tTropical animal health and production.g2020 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.763-769dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02067-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013900175520095900314592002801273650001201301650001501313650001101328650001201339653002401351653002701375653002801402653001801430653002801448700005701476773011901533856008801652852000901740655001201749IND60727645420221118233002.0211227e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072764542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1054312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStöckli, Sabrina10aAwareness, intention, and behavior: Three empirical perspectives on predicting the purchase of abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables  aThis research addresses psychological determinants of consuming abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables to reduce food waste.

A subsequent analysis on differences between people that do purchase abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables—i.e., Doers—and people that do not purchase abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables—i.e., Non-Doers—reveals by which aspects Doers and Non-Doers are driven during their purchases (e.g., appearance, seasonality, social and ecological sustainability).

The present study examined influences of dietary fat levels (10% vs. 45% fat), presentation order of dried bonito dashi (ascending vs. descending concentrations), and prior experience with dashi on subsequent dashi intake and preference using two-bottle choice tests in two rodent strains, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and C57BL/6 N (B6N) mice. In the ascending concentration tests, SD rats on a low fat diet preferred 10–100% dashi to water, whereas B6N mice showed a blunted preference for dashi. Consumption of a high fat diet reduced dashi preference in SD rats. The B6N mice on the high fat diet never preferred dashi at any concentration. In the descending concentration tests, SD rats on the low fat diet preferred dashi over a wide range (0.03–100% dashi). The B6N mice showed a trend similar to that of SD rats. Ingestion of the high fat diet in both strains reduced dashi preference in the descending concentration tests. However, introduction of the high fat diet to dashi experienced rats maintained on the low fat diet, reduced neither dashi intake nor dashi preference. Dashi intake affected neither high fat diet intake, caloric intake, nor preference for high fat diet. These results suggest that preference for dried bonito dashi is influenced at least by 1) dietary fat levels, 2) presentation order of dashi, and 3) prior experience with dashi.  aPublisher supplied data 3abonito 3abroths 3adietary fat 3aenergy intake 3aflavor 3ahigh fat diet 3aingestion 3alaboratory animals 3alipid content 3alow fat diet 3amales 3amice 3apalatability 3arats 0aIntake and preference 0aTwo-bottle choice test 0aFood experience 0aDried bonito dashi1 aMatsunaga, Tetsuro0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 213 p.112708-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245016000162300001800322500002000340520207900360592002802439596002102467650000802488650001502496650002502511650001302536650002102549650000902570650001602579650002702595650002002622650002002642650001702662650002102679650002002700650002002720650001902740650001602759650002502775650001602800650001402816700006202830700002502892700006402917773013402981856007303115852000903188655001203197IND60744851120221118102854.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485112DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.139442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakouri, Nastaran10aAntioxidant effects of supplementation of 3,4‐dihydroxyphenyl glycol on sperm parameters and oxidative markers following cryopreservation in canine semen  ap. 1004-1014.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSupplementing the extender with antioxidants with low molecular weight can enhance the quality of the post‐thaw sperm during the freezing process. This study was aimed at determining the impacts of 3,4‐dihydroxyphenyl glycol (DHPG) on the spermatozoa of the canine undergoing freeze‐thawing process. In this study, 24 ejaculates were obtained from three mixed‐breed dogs and were diluted in a Tris‐based extender. The diluted semen was divided into aliquots for supplementation of 10, 30, 50 and 70 µg/ml of DHPG, control (without antioxidant) and control sham (DMSO). After being extended, the semen was equilibrated at a temperature of 4°C and then transferred to the straws and kept 4 cm above the liquid nitrogen for 20 min and was finally immersed in the liquid nitrogen. They were cryopreserved for seven days; then, sperm parameters including sperm motility evaluation, motility characteristics, viability, DNA and plasma membrane integrity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione content (GSH), antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT] and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]) activity malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were evaluated. This study showed that spermatozoa cryopreservation with 50, 30 and 70 µg/ml of DHPG concentrations had better progressive motility, Curvilinear Velocity, Linearity, viability, intact plasma membrane and the levels of TAC, GPx and GSH were higher than the control group. The 50, 30 and 70 µg/ml of DHPG concentrations led to the significant decrease of DNA damage compared to the control group. Total motility, average path velocity, straight‐line velocity and CAT activity were significantly improved in 30 and 50 µg/ml of DHPG concentrations, compared to the control group. Also, the 50 and 30 µg/ml of DHPG concentrations, decreased MDA levels compared to the other groups, significantly. In conclusion, our study showed that the addition 50 µg/ml of DHPG to the canine semen extender improved the semen characteristics and oxidative markers in the cryopreservation process.  aPublisher supplied data  cUrmia University 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aliquid nitrogen 3amalondialdehyde 3amixed breeds 3amolecular weight 3aplasma membrane 3asemen extenders 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3aviability1 aSoleimanzadeh, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1591-21981 aRakhshanpour, Alaleh1 aBucak, Mustafa Numan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-85990 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1004-1014dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.139443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005100152245010400203300001600307520104800323592002801371650001401399650001601413650001701429650001401446650001201460650001201472650002601484650001801510650001101528650001001539650001501549650001101564651001301575653000701588653001201595653000801607653001201615653000801627653000801635653002501643653001601668653001501684700001901699773010001718856008701818852000901905655001201914IND60526004420221117192603.0190402e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052600442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7371-647010aRelationship between bran characteristics and bran starch of selected soft wheats grown in Michigan  ap. 427-435.  aThe aims of this study were to investigate differences among chosen wheat varieties in their bran starch (the starch adherent to bran particles after a dry milling process) quantity, bran particle size, and milled bran thickness, and to investigate the relationship between bran characteristics and bran starch content. The neutral saccharide profile of the wheat bran was dominated by arabinose, xylose, and glucose, whereas mannose and galactose were present in small amounts. Bran thickness was found to have a positive correlation with bran starch content. Bound ferulic acid to xylose ratio showed positive correlations with percent large bran particles, and negative correlations with bran starch content. Bran characteristics can explain the variation seen in bran starch content and percent large bran particles of various wheat varieties. Bound ferulic acid to xylose ratio and bran thickness could both play roles in the mechanical properties of bran, and therefore change the percent of large bran particles produced during milling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3adry milling 3aferulic acid 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3amechanical properties 3aparticle size 3astarch 3awheat 3awheat bran 3axylose 3aMichigan 0aAX 0aAra/Xyl 0aBFA 0aGC–MS 0aLBP 0aSEM 0aBran characteristics 0aBran starch 0aSoft wheat1 aNg, Perry K.W.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.427-435dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007600169300001800245500001900263520118900282592002801471650004401499650002201543650001501565650001101580650001701591650002601608650001101634650002101645650002201666700002301688700001701711700001801728700005401746700002101800773012201821856008301943852000902026655001202035IND60696416620221117160443.0200603e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069641662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04749-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolunduţ, Liviu10aSpectroscopic study of some new cobalt-doped tellurite glass–ceramics  ap. 9962-9971.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNew glass–ceramics of the xCo₂O₃(100 − x)[80TeO₂–19Li₂O–1ZrO₂] system (where 0 ≤ x ≤ 20 mol%) were prepared by melt-quenching technique and investigated by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, UV–Vis and EPR spectroscopies. The nature of the samples and the structural changes that take place with increasing the cobalt oxide content were followed by X-ray diffraction. FTIR spectroscopy shows that the network structure of the studied samples consists of TeO₃, TeO₄, LiO₄, CoO₆ and ZrO₄ structural units and the proportion between these units depends on the cobalt content of samples. UV–Vis measurements performed in the 300–1800 nm spectral range show absorption peaks characteristics of transitions belonging to both Co²⁺ and Co³⁺ ions. Based on the UV–Vis data, the optical band gap energy, refractive index, dielectric constant and tendency of metallization of the studied system were determined. The compositional evolution of these parameters was discussed with respect to the cobalt ions content of samples. The EPR spectra show the presence of Co²⁺ ions in both their high- and low-spin states, S = 3/2 and S = 1/2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3adielectric properties 3aenergy 3arefractive index 3aspectral analysis1 aPăşcuţă, Petru1 aCulea, Eugen1 aBoşca, Maria1 aPop, Lidia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3115-58281 aŞtefan, Răzvan0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Aug., v. 55, no. 23 p.9962-9971dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04749-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245013800200300001800338500002000356520199000376592002802366596004602394596013502440650002002575650001002595650001302605650001002618650001302628650000902641650001202650650001502662650001402677650001602691650001802707650001602725650001602741650001002757650002002767650001002787650001602797700005702813700006202870700007302932700006103005773013403066856007303200852000903273655001203282IND60744851320221118102832.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485132DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.139462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarquero, Vinicio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0042-617812aA Bayesian analysis of boar spermatozoa kinematics and head morphometrics and their relationship with litter size fertility variables  ap. 1024-1033.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe semen movement and sperm head size patterns of boar ejaculates were analysed using computer‐assisted semen analysis (CASA)‐Mot and ‐Morph systems. The aim of the present study was to compare morphometric and kinematics variables from boars and to determine the relationship with sow fertility variables related to litter size. The females were from maternal crossing schemes such as the continuous 3‐generation cross between York (Y), Landrace (L), and Pietrain (P) hybrid sows and Pietrain boars. Semen samples were collected from 11 sexually mature boars from two sire lines. Samples were analysed using the ISAS®v1 system to evaluate eight kinematic variables of sperm velocity, progressiveness and undulations. Four morphometric parameters of sperm head size (length, width, area and perimeter) were analysed. Bayesian analysis revealed relevant differences in four kinematic variables (VSL, LIN, STR and WOB) between sire lines, with a probability of relevance (PR) of 0.79–0.91, and Pietrain boars were associated with higher progressive motility compared with Duroc x Pietrain boars. Moreover, there were relevant differences in all morphometric variables (PR = 0.82–0.85) between sire lines. The dam line Y‐L‐50 (½ Y × ½ L) had higher total born per litter and piglets born alive, and YLP‐75 (¹/₈ Y × ¹/₈ L × ³/₄ P) was associated with higher values of litter weight at birth (highest posterior density region at 95% = 9.92, 16.41 kg). There are relevant differences in kinematic variables between the assessed sire lines and the differences in morphometric and litter size variables were also relevant. The York‐Landrace hybrid sows had higher total born per litter and piglets born alive, and there were relevant differences when compared with YLP‐50 (¼ York × ¼ Landrace × ½ Pietrain). Differences in kinematic and morphometric variables between sire and dam lines related to fertility need to be further studied.  aPublisher supplied data  cCosta Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR)  cFundación para el Fomento y Promoción de la Investigación y Transferencia de Tecnología Agropecuaria de Costa Rica (FITTACORI) 3aBayesian theory 3aDuroc 3aPietrain 3aboars 3acrossing 3ahead 3ahybrids 3akinematics 3alandraces 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3amorphometry 3aprobability 3asemen 3asexual maturity 3asires 3aspermatozoa1 aSoler, Carles1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9809-25961 aSevilla, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1480-41411 aCalderón‐Calderón, Josué1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6860-217X1 aValverde, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3191-69650 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1024-1033dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.139463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015900204300001800363500001900381520186300400592002802263596010702291650001702398650001502415650002202430650001402452650002602466650001102492650001702503650001602520650001702536650001302553650001302566650001302579650004402592650001402636700002002650700002702670700001802697700001702715700002902732700002902761700001702790700002502807773012202832856008302954852000903037655001203046IND60696416720221117160342.0200603e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069641672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04793-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusrini, Eny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7919-008310aMonoclinic cerium(III) picrate tetraethylene glycol complex: design, synthesis and biological evaluation as anti-amoebic activity against Acanthamoeba sp.  ap. 9795-9811.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn an effort to develop effective anti-amoebic agent, a salt type complex, namely [Ce(Pic)₂(H₂O)(EO4)](Pic)·H₂O complex, was synthesized and screened for in vitro anti-amoebic activity against Acanthamoeba sp. This Ce(III) complex has been characterized by microelemental analysis, and IR and NMR spectroscopy, and the data suggested the structural formula. Single X-ray crystallography structure showed that the Ce(III) ion is bicapped square antiprismatic with the O₂ and O₅ atoms occupying the top of the capping position forming a 10-coordination number. The cytotoxicity indicated that Ce salt and Ce(III) complex have an excellent anti-amoebic activity with IC₅₀ values as low as 3.75 and 3 µg/mL, respectively, with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in Acanthamoeba sp. viability. The mode of cell death in Acanthamoeba cells upon treated with the Ce(III) complex was in the early apoptosis and necrosis. This is in contrast to the Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O salt which exhibited necrosis. Both Ce(III) complex and Ce salt on the Acanthamoeba cell exhibited the genotoxic effect on the amoeba cells by looking at scoring DNA damage in types 3 and 4. The complexation form of Ce salt, picric acid (HPic) and tetraethylene glycol (EO4) to produce Ce(III) complex is expected to exhibit synergistic effects to show anti-amoebic activity. The molecular formula of Ce(III) complex and crystal packing hydrogen bonding of this compound is responsible for its cytotoxic and genotoxic effects.

Purified recombinant Man5A was acidophilic with a pH optimum of 2.5 and exhibited great pH adaptability and stability (>80% activity over pH 2.0–6.0 and pH 2.0–10.0, respectively). It had a high specific activity (1356U/mg) against locust bean gum, was able to degrade galactomannan and glucomannan in a classical four-site binding mode, and catalyzed the transglycosylation of mannotetrose to mannooligosaccharides with higher degree of polymerization. Besides, it had great resistance to pepsin and trypsin and digested corn–soybean meal based diet in a comparable way with a commercial β-mannanase under the simulated gastrointestinal conditions of pigs. This acidophilic β-mannanase represents a valuable candidate for wide use in various industries, especially in the feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3atrypsin 3aKomagataella pastoris 3agastrointestinal system 3agalactomannans 3apolymerization 3aglucomannans 3abeta-mannosidase 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aswine 3agenes 3apH 3alocust bean gum 3aglycosides 3aindustrial applications 3apepsin 0aPichia pastoris 0aAcidophilic 0aBroad pH adaptability/stability 0aβ-Mannanase 0aTransglycosylation1 aZhang, Jiankang1 aWang, Yuan1 aNiu, Canfang1 aMa, Rui1 aWang, Yaru1 aBai, Yingguo1 aLuo, Huiying1 aYao, Bin0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.474-481dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00702naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245002200133300001200155520010800167592002800275650000800303650001200311651001500323773012500338852000900463655001200472IND60300798820221120140837.0150703e20121116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030079882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, J.q(Jane),10aSlip Sliding Away  ap. 881.  aAntarctica's fate is not as simple as that of an ice cube melting in the sun, scaled up a trillionfold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aice 3amelting 3aAntarctica0 tScience.g2012 Nov. 16, v. 338, no. 6109 p.881-881dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014600176300001800322520150600340592002801846650002501874650002001899650001001919650001301929650001401942650002401956650002001980650001902000650001102019650001302030650002202043650002102065650001002086650001702096650002102113653004402134653001002178653004302188700002202231700002102253700002402274773013702298856008702435852000902522655001202531IND60755818920221122215902.0220404e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075581892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Naby, Doaa H.10aTailoring of chitosan/diacrylated pluronic system as a versatile nanoplatform for the amelioration of radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction  ap. 1507-1521.  aRutin (RUT) is a biologically active flavonoid that is reported to modulate radiation-induced brain dysfunctions. However, RUT's poor water solubility and low brain bioavailability limit its clinical use. To increase its brain bioavailability, RUT was loaded onto nanoplatforms based on chitosan/diacrylated pluronic (CS/DA-PLUR) nanogels synthesized by gamma radiation. The optimized formulation was investigated as a carrier system for RUT. Based on pilot experiments' results, the cranial radiation (CR) dose that induced cognitive dysfunction was selected. In the main experiment, rats were pre-treated orally with either free RUT or RUT-CS/DA-PLUR. Rats' cognitive and motor functions were assessed; 24 h later, rats were sacrificed, and the whole brain was separated for histopathological examination and biochemical estimation of brain content of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), neurotransmitters, oxidative stress markers, and interleukin-1β. CR produced prominent impairment in spatial and non-spatial learning memory, motor coordination, and muscular strength. Moreover, histopathological and biochemical alterations in brain contents of neurotransmitters, oxidative stress, and interleukin-1β were induced by CR. Conversely, RUT-CS/DA-PLUR, but not free RUT, successfully guarded against all the detrimental effects induced by CR. Based on the current findings, loading of RUT enhanced its bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness by restoring the cognitive functions impaired by CR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abioavailability 3abrain 3achitosan 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3agamma radiation 3ahistopathology 3amemory 3ananogels 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidative stress 3arutin 3atherapeutics 3awater solubility 0aRadiation-induced cognitive dysfunction 0aRutin 0aChitosan/diacrylated pluronic nanogels1 aDeghiedy, Noha M.1 aRashed, Rasha R.1 aEl-Ghazaly, Mona A.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 193 p.1507-1521dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01049naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002300147245007400170520023600244592002800480650001400508650001000522650001400532650001200546650001500558773011700573852000900690856008400699655001200783IND4412259120221122055041.0181130s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441225912DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2008-0418-01-RV2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlittich, Carla J.10aMilestones in Fungicide Discovery: Chemistry that Changed Agriculture  aFungicides have repeatedly altered the way crops are grown and farmers' expectations of crop health.

Through a systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the first global assessment of pollinator responses to fire. We hypothesize that pollinators increase after fire and during the early postfire succession stages; however, high fire frequency has the opposite effect, decreasing pollinators. LOCATION: Terrestrial ecosystems, excluding Antarctica. TIME PERIOD: Data collected from 1973 to 2017. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) and a few bird species. METHODS: We first compiled available studies across the globe that assessed fire effects on pollinator communities. Then, by means of hierarchical meta‐analyses, we evaluated how different fire regime parameters (fire frequency, postfire time and fire type) and habitat characteristics affect the abundance and richness of animals that act as pollinators. We also explored to what extent the responses vary among taxa groups and life history traits of pollinators (sociality system, nest location and feeding specialization), and among biomes. RESULTS: The overall effect size of fire on pollinator abundance and richness across all studies was positive. Fire effect was especially clear and significant in early postfire communities, after wildfires, and for Hymenoptera. Taxonomic resolution influenced fire effects, where only studies at the species/genus and family levels showed significant effects. The main exceptions were recurrent fires that showed a negative effect, and especially wildfire effects on Lepidoptera abundance that showed a significant negative response. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Pollinators tend to be promoted after a wildfire event. However, short fire intervals may threat pollinators, and especially lepidopterans. Given the current fire regime changes at the global scale, it is imperative to monitor postfire pollinators across many ecosystems, as our results suggest that fire regime is critical in determining the dynamics of pollinator communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aHymenoptera 3aLepidoptera 3abirds 3adata collection 3afire frequency 3afire regime 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3alife history 3ameta-analysis 3anests 3apollination 3apollinators 3asocial behavior 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awildfires 3aAntarctica1 aTavella, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5793-01911 aPausas, Juli G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3533-57861 aAguilar, Ramiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4741-26110 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2019 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.1487-1498dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.129393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520101900296592002801315650002001343650001401363650001201377653002101389653002001410653002101430653002001451653002701471653002701498700002001525700002001545773010201565856008501667852000901752655001201761IND60674117920221122225617.0200809e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067411792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.09.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chao-Fa10aCapillary bridges between spherical particles under suction control: Rupture distances and capillary forces  ap. 622-634.  aThis study focuses on properties of axisymmetric capillary bridges between spherical particles in the pendular regime under suction control. Using the toroidal approximation in combination with the governing Young-Laplace equation, analytical expressions for the rupture distance (dependent on the suction) and for the capillary force (dependent on the suction and the interparticle separation distance) have been obtained that do not involve any calibrated coefficient. The developed analytical expressions are effective for values of the dimensionless suction larger than 104. To predict capillary forces and rupture distances for a wider range of values of the dimensionless suction, closed-form expressions for rupture distances and capillary forces have been obtained by curve-fitting to a large dataset of numerical solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. It is shown that these expressions can also be employed for capillary bridges between spheres with unequal radii when the Derjaguin radius is employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aequations 3apowders 0aCapillary bridge 0aSuction control 0aRupture distance 0aCapillary force 0aYoung-Laplace equation 0aToroidal approximation1 aKruyt, Niels P.1 aMillet, Olivier0 tPowder technology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 360 p.622-634dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.09.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158300001600282500002000298520183100318592002802149596001202177596003902189596006302228596001902291650001602310650001302326650002002339650002502359650001602384650002402400650002502424650002702449650001902476650002602495650002802521650000902549650001502558650002902573650001902602650002802621650003702649700002202686700002702708700002002735700002502755700006002780700002202840773015002862856007503012852000903087655001203096IND60786560820221120151205.0220804e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078656082DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.123602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofyane, Asma10aProperties of Coated Controlled Release Diammonium Phosphate Fertilizers Prepared with the Use of Bio‐based Amino Oil  ap. 751-763.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn an effort to enhance the efficiency of fertilizer use and minimize their negative impact on the environment, a novel biomass‐based, functional controlled‐release fertilizer was used to improve nutrient use efficiency and increase crop production systems for more sustainable agriculture practices. Here, bio‐based amino‐oil (Priamine) mixtures were proposed as an outer coating with different layers for the control of phosphorus release from diammonium Phosphate (DAP). These hydrophobic coatings conferred excellent barrier properties and flexibility to coatings. The morphological characterization of the coated fertilizer was performed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), electronic diffraction X‐ray (EDX) and mapping, and revealed the formation of a cohesive film and a good adhesion between DAP fertilizer and coating film. The release rate of nutrients (phosphate) in water was investigated by UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The effect of coating thickness was investigated on release time and diffusion coefficient of phosphor release in distilled water. Release time increased with the coating thickness. The diffusion coefficient of nutrient release decreased with the coating thickness. Compared with uncoated granule which is totally solubilized after less than 2 hours, the P release profiles of the coated granules reached the equilibrium stage approximately after 98 and 126 hours when the DAP is coated with only Priamine single‐layer (1L) and double‐layer (2L), respectively. Moreover, the strategy adopted has successfully provided a very slow release and long‐term availability of nutrient sources with bio‐based coating oil compared to uncoated fertilizer (DAP) and therefore exhibited promising application for sustainable development of modern agriculture and circular economic.  aPublisher supplied data  cMESRSFC  cMohammed VI Polytechnic University  cNational Centre of Scientific and technical Research CNRST  cOCP Foundation 3aX-radiation 3aadhesion 3acrop production 3adiammonium phosphate 3adiffusivity 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental impact 3afertilizer application 3ahydrophobicity 3anutrient availability 3anutrient use efficiency 3aoils 3aphosphorus 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asolubilization 3asustainable agriculture 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLahcini, Mohammed1 aEl Meziane, Abdellatif1 aKhouloud, Mehdi1 aDahchour, Abdelmalek1 aCaillol, Sylvain1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3106-55471 aRaihane, Mustapha0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2020 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.751-763dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.123603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012800162500001400290520144500304592002801749650001501777650001601792650002301808650001601831650001901847650001401866650001301880650000901893650001301902650002401915650001501939650001501954700002301969700002401992700002102016773012002037856007502157852000902232655001202241IND60731996420221121001827.0210326e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073199642DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110308692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheil, Meredith 10aTopical Application of Lidocaine and Bupivacaine to Disbudding Wounds in Dairy Calves: Safety, Toxicology and Wound Healing  aNAL-light  aTri-Solfen® is a combination topical anaesthetic and antiseptic solution containing lidocaine, bupivacaine, adrenaline and cetrimide. Applied to wounds, it is reported to reduce the pain experienced by calves following thermocautery disbudding. While lidocaine and bupivacaine are widely used in medicine, conflicting data exist on the impact of these compounds when applied directly to the surgical wound. To investigate the safety of Tri-Solfen® applied to thermocautery disbudding wounds of calves, experiments were performed to measure (i) the safety of Tri-Solfen® (including in overdose situations); and (ii) the impact of Tri-Solfen® application at recommended doses on disbudding wound healing under field conditions. Haematological, biochemical and urinalysis parameters did not show clinically significant differences between placebo and Tri-Solfen® groups (1×, 3× and 5× dose). No adverse health impacts were reported. Histopathological analysis of wounds noted a reduction in bacterial colonies in Tri-Solfen®-treated wounds. Under field conditions, no negative impacts on wound healing were noted. Conversely, there was reduced incidence of abnormal wounds, with an associated trend toward improved average daily gain at days 11–12 in Tri-Solfen®-treated animals. These data are considered to support the safety of topical anaesthesia, as formulated in Tri-Solfen®, to the thermocautery disbudding wound in calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3aantiseptics 3aaverage daily gain 3aepinephrine 3ahistopathology 3alidocaine 3amedicine 3apain 3aplacebos 3atopical application 3atoxicology 3aurinalysis1 aChambers, Michael 1 aPolkinghorne, Adam 1 aSharpe, Brendan 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 18, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110308693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010100173300001400274520099600288592002801284650001601312650001601328650001901344650001201363650001601375650002301391700001901414700001901433700001601452773010001468856008501568852000901653655001201662IND60674118120221122225641.0200809e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067411812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M.

This paper reports on attempts to establish the reliability of a novel thermal-tracing technique to provide useful solid circulation information for industrial-scale systems. A novel butterfly valve technique was developed to test the thermal-tracing technique at high temperatures. Closing the valve causes solids to accumulate in the downcomer of a pilot gasifier. The level of the bed top surface was tracked with high-temperature capacitance sensors. The circulation rates were also estimated using two indirect techniques, the firsts based on a pressure balance between the riser and the bubbling bed, and the second utilizing a balance of all input and output energy streams to and from the bubbling bed reactor. Agreement among the solids circulation rates from these four independent techniques is encouraging, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aenergy flow 3afluidized beds 3apowders 3atemperature 3avalves (equipment)1 aBi, Xiaotao T.1 aGrace, John R.1 aLim, C.

Rates may vary from 160 to over 890 kg N/ha per year. Tissue removed by mowing over a period of time can cause nutrient defiency from any nutrient required for growth and development. This field study was conducted on an established Agrostis tenuis Sibth. ‘Astoria’ bentgrass putting green turf at Washington State University's Western Washington Research and Extension Center at Puyallup, WA, to measure plant uptake of S at various rates of applied N and their effects on growth and color. Rates of 0, 56, and 168 kg of S/ha per year from wettable S, and 293, 586, and 976 kg of N/ha per year from urea were applied to plots. Leaf tissue samples were collected over a 12-month period and analyzed for S by x-ray fluorescence spectrography. Significantly lower S concentrations were found in tissue from high N plots with zero S as compared to all other treatments. Average tissue S concentrations from nonfertilized plots was lower than it was in tissue receiving N plus S, but tissue S concentrations from nonfertilized plots was significantly higher than in tissue from plots receiving N only. There was no significant difference between average tissue S concentrations among high and low S treated plots in the presence of N. The total S removed in clippings from plots receiving high N and zero S was 48% greater than that from the control. The addition of either 56 or 168 kg S/ha to N fertilized plots increased total S removal in excess of 115% over no4 treated plots and the combined addition of N and S increased S removal 219% above the S removed in nonfertilized bentgrass. High N plus S fertilized plots had a yield of 717' more clippings and a 36% increase in average tissue S when compared to plots receiving high N and zero S. These tests revealed that 0.3Y0 S concentration in bentgrass putting green turfgrass appears to be minimal under high N fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis capillaris 3aX-radiation 3aagronomy 3acolor 3afluorescence 3agrowth and development 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3asulfur 3aturf grasses 3auniversities 3aurea1 aBrauen, Stanton E.1 aOrton, S.

When calibrating cohesionless, free-flowing bulk materials, individual simple experiments are commonly used as reference for the calibration, such as the angle of repose in various test methods. Regardless of the experiment, the calibration is regularly performed by trial and error, systematic variation of the parameters, or using optimization algorithms until a suitable combination of parameters is found. This paper deals with the development and test of a highly efficient optimization-based calibration procedure. First, a brief overview of various optimization methods is given and explains why the use of surrogate models seems the best choice for DEM calibration. Subsequently, a new modular algorithm called “generalized surrogate modeling-based calibration” (GSMC) is presented. For testing the new algorithm, a modified draw down test is used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aangle of repose 3acalibration 3amodels 3apowders 3asystem optimization 0aDiscrete element method 0aCalibration 0aOptimization 0aSurrogate model 0aDraw down1 aRößler, Thomas1 aKunze, Günter1 aKatterfeld, Andre1 aWill, Frank0 tPowder technology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 360 p.967-976dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.10.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245007500200300001800275500002000293520147000313592002801783596005901811596001801870596003201888650002201920650001101942650002401953650001501977650001601992650001302008650001502021700002202036700002202058700001602080700002602096773012202122856007202244852000902316655001202325IND60744851920221119182702.0210720e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074485192DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.35462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDajka, Jan‐Claas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0797-922910aWeakening macroalgal feedbacks through shading on degraded coral reefs  ap. 1660-1669.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExtensive and dense macroalgal fields can compromise the ecosystem function of habitat mosaics on reefs owing to their limiting effect on patch connectivity. Macroalgae can maintain and increase their dominance with effective self‐reinforcing feedback mechanisms. For example, macroalgae can form dense beds, supressing coral settlement and grazing by herbivores. This compromised ecosystem function can lead to major socioeconomic and ecological changes. Dense macroalgal beds were shaded with submerged shade sails of two sizes and changes to the underlying benthos and feeding rates of herbivorous fishes were recorded. The shade sails reduced the algae's ability to photosynthesize by 29%. After 6 weeks, macroalgal cover was reduced by 24% under small sails and by 51% under large sails. Small shade sails reduced turf algal growth by 23%, while large sails reduced growth by 82%. Three months after removal of the shade sails, algal beds had almost completely regrown. During this regrowth period, herbivore bites taken from the experiment's substrates were recorded, with grazing impact reducing significantly with time. This study is the first to achieve macroalgal reduction via the alteration of the light regime. While macroalgae regrew in this relatively short‐term experiment, shading may be a viable reef management approach that aims to maximize habitat mosaics on coral reefs, particularly if used in combination with other intervention methods.  aPublisher supplied data  cLancaster University Faculty of Science and Technology  cRoyal Society  cStockholm Resilience Centre 3abenthic organisms 3acorals 3aecological function 3amacroalgae 3aphotoperiod 3aregrowth 3aturf algae1 aBeasley, Victoria1 aGendron, Gilberte1 aBarlow, Jos1 aGraham, Nicholas A.J.0 tAquatic conservation.g2021 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1660-1669dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.35463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245009100180300001600271500001900287500000900306520096100315592002801276650001301304650002501317650001901342650001901361650001001380650001801390700002201408700001601430773012201446856009601568852000901664655001201673IND60663613620221119022909.0191122e196603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066361362DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1966.00021962005800020036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiles, R.

The aim of the study was to evaluate regional differences in the values of cultural ES in relation to natural capital in four small pilot regions of the Slovak Republic using a matrix system. The article is an approximation of the connection of the biophysical method of evaluation (matrix system) of cultural ES of natural capital with geospatial data at the regional level in the Slovak Republic. Within the natural potential of the ES cultural categories, we evaluated recreation and tourism, landscape character and aesthetics, natural and cultural heritage, knowledge base, and regional significance for the given region. The highest values of indices in all categories were found in the Brezno region. The results of the pilot regions of the Slovak Republic indicated that the terrain fragmentation in combination with a higher altitude and a larger area of forests and protected areas may represent significant factors influencing the potential of the area to provide the various benefits resulting from cultural ES. Even though there is significant monetary potential of cultural ES in the region, its intensive utilization is not readily apparent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3acultural heritage 3aecosystems 3aland 3alandscapes 3anatural capital 3arecreation 3aspatial data 3atourism 3aSlovakia1 aKološta, Stanislav,1 aFlaška, Filip 1 aPálka, Boris 0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110202703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012000162300001600282520134400298592002801642650000801670650001401678650001901692650001801711650001501729650001901744650002001763650001301783650001401796650001501810653001201825653000901837653001401846653001501860700001701875700001701892700002001909700001801929773011101947856008202058852000902140655001202149IND60086551720221116142546.0190319e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008655172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Lei10aBrucine, an effective natural compound derived from nux-vomica, induces G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in LoVo cells  ap. 332-339.  aBrucine is an alkaloid from nux vomica, has been shown various pharmacological actions. To study the possible anti-cancer mechanisms on LoVo cells, effects of Brucine on cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated. The results showed that Brucine revealed strong growth inhibitory effect on LoVo cells, and caused LoVo cell shrinkage and membrane blobbing, induced cellular and DNA morphological changes. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis documented that Brucine could change cell cycle and induce cell apoptosis. Brucine-mediated cell cycle arrest in G1 phase was associated with a marked increase of protein levels of CCND1 and decrease in CCNB1, cyclin E and CDC2. In addition, Brucine dose-dependently caused LoVo cells apoptosis evidenced by Annexin V/PI staining Brucine-induced apoptosis was mediated via up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, proteins Erk1/2, p38 and Akt phosphorylation were down regulated by Brucine in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this paper indicates Brucine is effective against LoVo cells proliferation, and promotes LoVo cells death via apoptosis. These results reveal functional interplay among a series of pathway that are deregulated in cancer and suggest that their simultaneous targeting by Brucine could result in efficacious inhibition on cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3adose response 3ainterphase 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3ashrinkage 3atoxicology 0aBrucine 0aLoVo 0aApoptosis 0aCell cycle1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aLuo, Wenjuan1 aZhan, Yingzhuan1 aZhang, Yanmin0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 58 p.332-339dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245010400182300001600286500001900302500000900321520196100330592002802291650001502319650002202334650001302356650002202369650002202391650002002413650002002433650001502453650001802468650001302486650002002499650001802519650001102537650001102548650001602559650000902575650002602584650001002610651001302620700001702633700001602650700002002666773012202686856009702808852000902905655001202914IND60663613820221119022754.0191122e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066361382DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600020022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shyilon L.10aEffect of Etridiazol and Nitrapyrin Treated N Fertilizers on Soil Mineral N Status and Wheat Yields  ap. 265-270.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aEtridiazol[5-ethoxy-3-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole] and nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine] are two nitrification inhibitors that offer potential for reducing N losses in soils from denitrification and leaching, thereby improving N utilization by crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of these two compounds to reduce nitrification of applied N fertilizers in soils and influence wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields. Experiments were conducted in 1977, 1979, and 1980 on Weir (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Ochraqualfs) and Stoy (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs) silt loam soils, typical for wheat production in southern Illinois. Anhydrous ammonia, urea, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions were applied without and with the two inhibitors at 0.56 and 1.12 kg/ha. Nitrogen rates varied incrementally from 0 to 150 kg/ha. Fertilizers with the inhibitors were applied in the fall prior to wheat seeding. Mineral N forms in soils were determined periodically after application. Etridiazol and nitrapyrin were equally effective in reducing nitrification of ammonium N in soils up to 160 days following application when compared to nontreated fertilizers. Above normal precipitation and temperature tended to reduce inhibitor effectiveness. Both inhibitors at the higher rate generally had greater amounts of -N present in soils on any date following application than the lower rate. Treating N fertilizers increased wheat yields from zero up to 32% above nontreated comparisons applied in the fall. Greatest responses were always associated with climatic and soil conditions that favored N losses by denitrification. No yield benefits accrued from the use of inhibitors when the applied N was not subject to loss conditions. Nitrification inhibitors added to fallapplied N resulted in wheat yields that were similar to and occasionally greater than those obtained from spring N topdressings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludalfs 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanhydrous ammonia 3adenitrification 3amontmorillonite 3anitrapyrin 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asilt loam soils 3asoil minerals 3asowing 3aspring 3atemperature 3aurea 3aurea ammonium nitrate 3awheat 3aIllinois1 aVarsa, E.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are of potential interest for control of this fruit fly species as it pupates in the soil. Specifically, the pre-pupal stage of B. tryoni may present a unique window for EPN application, as fully developed larvae drop from infested fruit to the soil for pupation. For the first time, we tested the capacity of three EPN species with different foraging strategies, Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, to cause larval and pupal mortality in B. tryoni across a range of EPN concentrations (50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 infective juveniles IJscm-2), substrate moisture (10, 15, 20 and 25% w/v) and temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30°C). We found that all EPN species tested caused environment and density dependent mortality in the third larval instar while pupae were not affected. Steinernema feltiae caused high mortality across different IJ concentrations and over a wider moisture and temperature range than the other two EPN species. High mortality caused by S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora was more limited to high IJ concentrations and a narrower moisture and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of EPNs for the control of B. tryoni and warrant further laboratory and field experiments to evaluate their efficacy under the wide environmental conditions that B. tryoni can occur in.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera tryoni 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aSteinernema feltiae 3abiological control 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3afruit flies 3ainstars 3amortality 3anematode larvae 3apests 3apupae 3apupation 3asoil 3atemperature 0aBactrocera tryoni 0aEntomopathogenic nematodes 0aFruit flies 0aHeterorhabditis 0aSteinernema 0aTephritidae1 aNielsen, Uffe N.1 aJohnson, Scott N.1 aRiegler, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-431X0 tBiological control.g2014 Feb., v. 69 p.34-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001800188245011000206300001600316506007600332520170000408592002802108506003702136650001302173650001902186650001502205650002002220650001802240650002202258650003102280650001002311650001502321650001702336650004002353650000802393650001602401650001802417650002102435650001902456650002602475650001502501650001602516700001902532700002402551700001502575700001702590700001602607700002302623700002402646773010302670856008102773852000902854655001202863IND50068845620221207081217.0171110e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006884562DNAL7 aPMC37551332pmcid7 a235955242pmid7 a10.1007/s12263-013-0343-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasman, W.

Fifteen lean (age 36 ± 7 years; BMI 23.4 ± 1.7 kg m⁻²) and 17 obese (age 40 ± 6 years; BMI 30.3 ± 2.4 kg m⁻²) men consumed 50- or 200-g vegetables for 4 weeks in a randomized, crossover trial. Afterward, all subjects underwent 4 weeks of energy restriction (60 % of normal energy intake). Despite the limited weight loss of 1.7 ± 2.4 kg for the lean and 2.1 ± 1.9 kg for the obese due to energy restriction, beneficial health effects were found, including lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HbA1c concentrations. The high vegetable intake resulted in increased levels of plasma amino acid metabolites, decreased levels of 9-HODE and prostaglandin D3 and decreased levels of ASAT and ALP compared to low vegetable intake. Adipose tissue gene expression changes in response to vegetable intake were identified, and sets of selected genes were submitted to network analysis. The network of inflammation genes illustrated a central role for NFkB in (adipose tissue) modulation of inflammation by increased vegetable intake, in lean as well as obese subjects. In obese subjects, high vegetable intake also resulted in changes related to energy metabolism, adhesion and inflammation. By inclusion of sensitive omics technologies and comparing the changes induced by high vegetable intake with changes induced by energy restriction, it has been shown that part of vegetables’ health benefits are mediated by changes in energy metabolism, inflammatory processes and oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aadipose tissue 3abiomarkers 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aguidelines 3ainflammation 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amen 3ametabolites 3anutrigenomics 3aoxidative stress 3aprostaglandins 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aweight loss1 avan Erk, M.

This study focuses on assessing, evaluating and managing evapotranspiration in Egyptian Nile Delta over 1997–2017 for thirteen regions. The monthly data of minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation and solar radiation from November to May were derived from open access data for calculation of reference evapotranspiration and rainfall accounts. Wheat crop coefficient (Kc) values were estimated using the air temperature and base temperature of crop. GWET and BWET were calculated and mapped for each region in the ArcGIS environment. Land use land cover (LULC) was analyzed during 1997, 2005, 2011, and 2017 using Landsat images. The main findings of the research are as follows: (1) average values of crop coefficients Kc₋ᵢₙᵢₜ, Kc₋ₘᵢd and Kc₋ₑₙd were 0.72, 1.13, and 0.41 through initial, middle, and end growing seasons, respectively; (2) the best regions for saving green and blue water were Sidi-Salim, Bilqas, Ar-Riyad, Al-Hamul, and Biyala; (3) the total water saved was 4.80% and 53.12% of blue and green water accounts; (4) high coefficients of determination between precipitation, GWET, and BWET proportions were 0.99 for both. Furthermore, relative irrigation supply is a good indicator for predicting GWET and BWET with determination coefficients of 0.99 and 0.76, respectively.

However, both of these vaccines have limitations; specifically, PPV23 produces weak antibody responses in children younger than 2 years and PCVs only partially protect against secondary infection. Previously, we showed serotype-nonspecific protection by Δpep27 vaccine, but the reversion of Δpep27 to the wild type serotype during immunization cannot be excluded. To ensure the safety of the Δpep27 vaccine, comD, an important protein that activates competence, was inactivated, and the transformability of the double mutant (Δpep27ΔcomD) was determined. The transformation ability of this double mutant was successfully abolished. Δpep27ΔcomD immunization significantly increased the survival time after heterologous challenge(s), and diminished colonization levels independent of serotype, including a non-typeable strain (NCC1). Moreover, the double mutant was found to be highly safe in both normal and immunocompromised mice. In conclusion, this pneumococcal Δpep27ΔcomD vaccine appears to be a highly feasible and safe vaccine to prevent various types of pneumococcal infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibodies 3abacterial pneumonia 3achildren 3aimmunization 3amarkets 3amice 3amortality 3amutants 3apolysaccharides 3asecondary infection 3aserotypes 3avaccines 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0apep27 0acomD 0aProtection 0aSafety1 aSeon, Seung Han1 aLuong, Truc Thanh1 aGhosh, Prachetash1 aPyo, Suhkneung1 aRhee, Dong-Kwon0 tVaccine.g2019 Jan. 03, v. 37, no. 1 p.90-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011500154300001800269520140500287592002801692650001401720650001501734650001401749650000901763650001901772650001701791650001401808650001601822700001601838700002201854700001401876700001701890700001901907700001901926773010401945856007502049852000902124655001202133IND60533982020170629000000.0160802e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053398202DNAL7 a10.1021/ef201758g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing10aExperimental Studies on the Adsorption/Occlusion Phenomena Inside the Macromolecular Structures of Asphaltenes  ap. 1746-1755.  aAsphaltenes are the polar macromolecules with complex structures in oils, usually existing as aggregates. Inside the macromolecular structures of asphaltenes, some other fractions can be adsorbed/occluded, and the occluded compounds contain some important geochemical information. However, the adsorption/occlusion phenomena of asphaltenes need verification. Thus, this work was aimed to experimentally study the adsorption/occlusion processes inside the asphaltenes, using the deuterated paraffin n-C₂₀D₄₂ as the target compound under the conditions of high temperature/high pressure, with some chloride salts as additives to probe the mechanism of the adsorption/occlusion inside asphaltenes. The results show that the adsorption/occlusion phenomena take place inside asphaltenes during their thermal evolution. Occlusion inside asphaltenes could occur via two paths, namely, the physical process maybe through the polar interactions among the molecules and the chemical process through condensation or polymerization of the molecules, and then some substantial microporous units could develop to adsorb/occlude other fractions. The temperature and the additives have influences on the occlusion taking place inside asphaltenes. Higher temperatures promoted the pyrolysis of asphaltenes, and the additives play an important role in the properties of adsorption/occlusion inside asphaltenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadsorption 3achlorides 3aoils 3apolymerization 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aLiao, Zewen1 aChrostowska, Anna1 aLiu, Qing1 aZhang, Linye1 aGraciaa, Alain1 aCreux, Patrice0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 26, no. 3 p.1746-1755dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef201758g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014800155300002000303520120600323592002801529650001601557650002101573650002101594650002401615650001701639650001901656650001501675650001901690650001701709650001301726650000901739650001801748650001501766650001101781650001501792700001601807700001301823700001601836700001701852700001501869700001301884700001701897773012301914856007502037852000902112655001202121IND60558302420221118035821.0161115e20121206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830242DNAL7 a10.1021/jp309059u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jiebing10aFolic Acid-Conjugated LaF3:Yb,Tm@SiO2 Nanoprobes for Targeting Dual-Modality Imaging of Upconversion Luminescence and X-ray Computed Tomography  ap. 14062-14070.  aDevelopment of multimodal contrast agents for in vivo simultaneous multimodality imaging is an emerging interdiscipline that is paving the avenue toward the goal of personalized medicine. Herein, folic acid-conjugated silica-modified LaF₃:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@SiO₂-FA) with high La content in a single particle were strategically designed and prepared for simultaneously targeting dual-modality imaging of upconversion luminescence (UCL) and X-ray computed tomography (CT). LaF₃ UCNPs were synthesized by a novel oleic acid (OA)/ionic liquid (IL) two-phase system. Afterward, a folic acid molecule was covalently anchored on the surface of UCNPs with a silane coupling agent. The UCNPs@SiO₂-FA exhibits good stability, water dispersibility and solubility, low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, highly selective targeting, excellent X-ray attenuation, and UCL emission under excitation at 980 nm. In vivo UCL and CT images of mice show the UCNPs@SiO₂-FA can be used in targeting dual-modality imaging. These results suggest that the as-prepared nanoprobe is a good candidate with excellent imaging and targeting ability for targeting dual-modality imaging of UCL and CT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abiocompatibility 3achemical bonding 3acomputed tomography 3acytotoxicity 3adispersibility 3afolic acid 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3amedicine 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3asilane 3asolubility1 aHuang, Peng1 aHe, Meng1 aPan, Liyuan1 aZhou, Zhijun1 aFeng, Lili1 aGao, Guo1 aCui, Daxiang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 06, v. 116, no. 48 p.14062-14070dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp309059u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013400160300002000294520125900314592002801573650001301601650001301614650002301627650001301650650001601663700002001679700001901699700001801718773012301736856007501859852000901934655001201943IND60558302520221118035621.0161115e20121206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830252DNAL7 a10.1021/jp309138w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sun Young,10aDirect Observation of Conformation-Dependent Pathways in the Excited-State Proton Transfer of 7-Hydroxyquinoline in Bulk Alcohols  ap. 14153-14158.  aThe excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) of 7-hydroxyquinoline (7HQ) in bulk alcoholic solvents has been explored with variation of protic hydrogen atoms as well as alcohols. By measuring time-resolved kinetic profiles at two different excitation wavelengths, we have observed conformation-specific pathways in the ESPT of 7HQ. There are two possible rotamers of 7HQ according to the configuration of its hydroxyl group, which are trans and cis. On one hand, trans-7HQ cannot undergo proton transfer within its excited-state lifetime because the internal rotation of the hydroxyl group to form cis-7HQ hardly occurs. On the other hand, some cis-7HQ molecules exist as cyclic complexes of 7HQ·(alcohol)₂ at the moment of excitation, and the cyclic complexes can undergo ESPT rapidly via tunneling. However, the other cis-7HQ molecules should undergo solvent reorganization to form cyclic 7HQ·(alcohol)₂ complexes prior to intrinsic ESPT, and the solvent reorganization becomes the rate-determining step. In contrast to proton transfer, where intrinsic ESPT and solvent reorganization have been observed separately in time-resolved kinetic profiles, intrinsic deuteron transfer is too slow to be distinguished kinetically from solvent reorganization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3ahydrogen 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents 3awavelengths1 aKim, Hyung Bae,1 aYoo, Byung Kuk1 aJang, Du-Jeon0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 06, v. 116, no. 48 p.14153-14158dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp309138w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243500001900263520126000282592002801542650000801570650001101578650001701589650001501606650001301621650001301634700001701647700002001664773014501684856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60711121920221118063722.0200917e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071112192DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta04914j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Dong Kyu10aEffective removal of particulate matter from air by using zeolite-coated filters  ap. 17960-17968.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRemoval of particulate matter (PM) from air is very important for a safe environment and sound health. In this work, we first applied zeolites, after coating onto substrates such as cotton and polyester, in PM removal from air and confirmed that zeolites, especially aluminous ones, could be very effective in the removal of PM. For example, NaX/cotton (NaX: ∼20 wt% of cotton) showed 3.6- and 3.4-times the removal efficiency (RE) of bare cotton for PM2.5 and PM10 elimination, respectively, even though the pressure drop increased only slightly (by 9 Pa). Moreover, NaX was much more effective than the widely applied metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) such as ZIF-8, UiO-66 and MOF-74 (or CPO-27), even though the porosity of NaX was much lower than those of the applied MOFs. Importantly, the quality factor and RE of the filters increased linearly with the increasing Al contents of the applied zeolites (with the same faujasite structure, namely NaY and NaX), suggesting the important role of Al and charge-compensating Na⁺ in PM elimination from air. Finally, it could be suggested that the PM removal is due to electrostatic interactions and aluminous zeolites (with charge-balancing cations) can be effectively used in the PM removal from air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acotton 3aparticulates 3apolyesters 3aporosity 3azeolites1 aWoo, Ho Chul1 aJhung, Sung Hwa0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 35 p.17960-17968dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04914j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01535naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007300169300001800242500002900260520051300289592002800802650002900830650001200859650001000871700002400881700002300905700001500928700006400943773012201007856008301129852000901212655001201221IND60711204920221118141438.0200918e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071120492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c025932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoelke, Andreas10aIodolopyrazolium Salts: Synthesis, Derivatizations, and Applications  ap. 7261-7266.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe synthesis of iodolopyrazolium triflates via an oxidative cyclization of 3-(2-iodophenyl)-1H-pyrazoles is described.

Relative gene expression was moderately increased in placental tissues for IFNγ, IL-4, IL-17a, IL-22, CD3, and FoxP3. To assess the roles of IL-17a and IL-22 in resistance to listeriosis during pregnancy, we compared the severity of maternal and fetal infection in IL-17a⁽⁻/⁻⁾, IL-22⁽⁻/⁻⁾, and IL-17a⁽⁻/⁻⁾/IL-22⁽⁻/⁻⁾ mice with that of wild type C57BL/6 mice. Intragastric infection with modest numbers of bacterial cells (10⁵ CFU) caused reproducible maternal and fetal infection in all four mouse strains. We recovered greater numbers of CFU from the bloodstream of pregnant IL-22⁽⁻/⁻⁾ mice than pregnant wild type mice. Otherwise we found no significant difference in bacterial load in maternal or fetal tissues (spleen, liver, fetoplacental units) from pregnant IL-17a⁽⁻/⁻⁾, IL-22⁽⁻/⁻⁾, or IL-17a⁽⁻/⁻⁾/IL-22⁽⁻/⁻⁾ or wild type mice. Nor did we observe histopathologic differences in severity of inflammation in maternal or fetal tissues from the various groups of mice. Although IL-17a and IL-22 are up-regulated in placental tissue, our study suggests that antibacterial resistance and the host inflammatory response are not dependent on IL-17a or IL-22 during infection of mice with L. monocytogenes at 10–14 days of gestation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal tissues 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3ablood flow 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-4 3alisteriosis 3aliver 3amice 3amicrobial load 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aspleen1 aFaith, Nancy G.1 aSteinberg, Howard1 aCzuprynski, Charles J.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2013 Mar., v. 56 p.47-52dElsevier Ltdx0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012200172300001600294520139600310592002801706650001401734650001401748650002101762650002801783650001101811650001201822650001401834650001801848650001801866650001301884650001301897650000901910650001701919650001001936653003401946653001401980653001301994653001802007653001702025700002002042773011302062856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60610723920221120203939.0180829e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061072392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerent, Giles G.10aMagnetite-platinum nanoparticles-modified glassy carbon electrode as electrochemical detector for nitrophenol isomers  ap. 105-115.  aA glassy carbon electrode was modified with magnetite and platinum nanoparticles stabilized with 3-n-propyl-4-picoline silsesquioxane chloride. This chemically-modified electrode is proposed for the first time for the individual or simultaneous electrochemical detection of nitrophenol isomers. Nanoparticles act as catalysts and also increase the surface area. The polymer stabilizes the particles and provides the electrochemical separation of isomers. Under optimized conditions, the reduction peak currents, obtained by differential-pulse voltammetry, of 2-, 3-, and 4-nitrophenol increased linearly with increases in their concentration in the range of 0.1–1.5μmolL⁻¹. In individual analysis, the detection limits were 33.7nmolL⁻¹, 45.3nmolL⁻¹ and 48.2nmolL⁻¹, respectively. Also, simultaneous analysis was possible for 2-, and 4-nitrophenol. In this case, the separation of the peak potentials was 0.138V and the detection limits were 69.6nmolL⁻¹ and 58.0nmolL⁻¹, respectively. These analytical figures of merit evidence the outstanding performance of the modified electrode, which was also successfully applied to the individual determination of isomers in environmental and biological samples. The magnetite and platinum nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode was able to detect nitrophenol isomers at the ppm level in rain water and human urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3aisomers 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3arain 3asurface area 3aurine 0aChemically-modified electrode 0aMagnetite 0aPlatinum 0aNanoparticles 0aNitrophenols1 aSpinelli, Almir0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 May 15, v. 330 p.105-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010400164300001600268520120600284592002801490650001001518650002501528650001601553650001901569650002301588650001401611650001101625650001201636650001901648650001001667650002001677650000801697650001601705651001601721700001901737700001701756700001701773700002101790700001701811773015501828856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60675833120221119160352.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067583312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12892-019-0215-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Ki Eun10aStrong Solar Irradiance Reduces Growth and Alters Catechins Concentration in Tea Plants over Winter  ap. 475-480.  aAn experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of sunlight and chilling on growth, photosynthesis and chemical composition of tea plants growing in South Korea. The plants were grown in full sun (mid-day photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD of 563 μmol⁻²s⁻¹), slight shade (PPFD of 99 μmol⁻²s⁻¹) or heavy shade (HS, PPFD of 5 μmol⁻²s⁻¹) in a field at the foot of pine forest from October to March, 2012. Mean and minimum daily temperature fell below 0 °C in December and January. Shading had a small or no effect on shoot and leaf growth. Shading increased the concentration of chlorophyll compared with plants in full sun, with relatively stable values within a treatment over time. Shading increased chlorophyll fluorescence, with lower values in all treatments in late January. The concentration of total catechins was lower under shading, and lower in early January. Low temperatures appear to decrease chlorophyll fluorescence independently of light levels. Growth under heavy shade was dependently of stored reserves and would be unsustainable over the long term. Overall quality as reflected by the concentration of catechins was best under full sun conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3achemical composition 3achlorophyll 3acold treatment 3aconiferous forests 3aflavanols 3aleaves 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3ashade 3asolar radiation 3atea 3atemperature 3aSouth Korea1 aJeon, Seung Ho1 aShim, Doo Bo1 aJun, Woo Jin1 aChung, Jin Woong1 aShim, Sangin0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 5 p.475-480dThe Korean Society of Crop SciencewJournal:J000000101x1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-019-0215-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245015400169300001400323520150500337592002801842650001601870650002201886650002301908650003001931650001601961650001201977650000901989650001201998650002102010650001002031650001202041650001102053650001502064650001602079650001402095650001602109651000902125653001602134653001602150653001102166653002202177700001802199700001602217700001302233700001702246700001402263700001802277700001402295700001902309700001702328773010002345856008902445852000902534655001202543IND60532868120221120090640.0190410e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053286812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Yanna10aPerformance of Microplitis tuberculifer (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitizing Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in different larval instars  ap. 18-23.  aThe solitary parasitoid Microplitis tuberculifer (Wesmael) is an important biological control agent of various lepidopteran pests in Asia. We examined the preference of M. tuberculifer for different instars of its common host, Mythimna separata (Walker), host instar effects on parasitoid development, and the consequences of parasitism in different stages for growth and consumption of host larvae. The wasp successfully parasitized the first four larval instars of M. separata, but not the fifth, which appeared to be behaviorally resistant. First and second instars were parasitized at higher rates compared to thirds and fourths in no-choice situations, ostensibly due to longer handling times for the latter, but second instars were most preferred in a choice test that presented all stages simultaneously. Although later instar hosts yielded heavier cocoons, the fastest parasitoid development was obtained in second instars. Lower sex ratios were obtained from first instars as females appeared to lay a smaller proportion of fertilized eggs in small hosts. Both weight gain and food consumption of parasitized larvae were reduced significantly within 24h of parasitism, regardless of the stage parasitized, and final body weights were less than 10% those of unparasitized larvae. Thus, M. tuberculifer has good potential as a biological control agent of M. separata, successfully parasitizing the first four larval instars and dramatically reducing plant consumption by the host in all cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicroplitis 3aMythimna separata 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abody weight 3acocoons 3aeggs 3afemales 3afood consumption 3ahosts 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3asex ratio 3aweight gain 3aAsia 0aConsumption 0aDevelopment 0aGrowth 0aInstar preference1 aMichaud, J.P.1 aZhang, Jing1 aLi, Zhen1 aWang, Yizhuo1 aChen, Han1 aLi, Jiancheng1 aLu, Ziyun1 aZhang, Qingwen1 aLiu, Xiaoxia0 tBiological control.g2014 Feb., v. 69 p.18-23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158520196200279592002802241650002202269650001602291650001702307650001102324650003102335650002902366650002102395650002202416650001902438650001602457650002402473650001602497651001002513700001502523700001402538700001302552700001702565773012702582856007402709852000902783655001202792IND60652310220221119223550.0190712e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065231022DNAL7 a10.3390/su100620332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Xianchun10aScenario Analysis of Urban Road Transportation Energy Demand and GHG Emissions in China—A Case Study for Chongqing  aThis study, using Chongqing City of China as an example, predicts the future motor vehicle population using the Gompertz Model and the motorcycle population using the piecewise regression model, and predicts and analyzes fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of motor vehicles from 2016 to 2035 based on the bottom-up method under different scenarios of improving the fuel economy of conventional vehicles, promoting alternative fuel vehicles, and the mixed policy of the above two policy options. The results indicate that the total population of motor vehicles in Chongqing will increase from 4.61 million in 2015 to 10.15 million in 2035. In the business-as-usual scenario, the road-transportation energy demand in Chongqing will keep increasing from 2015 and will peak in 2030, before it begins to decline by 2035. The trends for the tank to wheel (TTW) and well to wheel (WTW) GHG emissions are similar to that of energy demand. The WTW GHG emissions will increase from 24.9 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>e in 2016 to 50.5 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>e in 2030 and will then gradually decline to 48.9 Mt CO<inf>2</inf>e in 2035. Under the policy scenarios of improving fuel economy of conventional fuel passenger cars, promoting alternative fuel vehicles, and their mixed policy, direct energy consumption and TTW and WTW GHG emissions from 2016 to 2035 will be reduced to different levels. It is also found that the two types of policies have a hedging effect on the direct energy-consumption saving, TTW, and WTW GHG emission reductions. Sensitivity analysis of key parameters and policy settings is conducted to investigate the impact of their changes on the vehicle population projection, direct energy demand, and WTW GHG emissions. Some policy implications are suggested to provide reference for the formulation and adjustment of Chongqing&rsquo;s, or even China&rsquo;s, low-carbon road transportation policies in the future based on the analysis results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3aautomobiles 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3alogit analysis 3amotorcycles 3aroad transportation 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aZeng, Yuan1 aGu, Baihe1 aWang, Yi1 aXu, Baoguang0 tSustainability.g2018 June 15, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100620333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011600153300002000269520146900289592002801758650002401786650002201810650001101832650003301843650002101876650001101897650002301908650001201931650001301943650001101956650001801967650001801985650001402003700002602017700001502043700001402058700002302072700001902095700002202114700002102136773012302157856007502280852000902355655001202364IND60558302720221118035633.0161115e20121206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055830272DNAL7 a10.1021/jp309410w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMula, Sam10aIntroduction of a Hydrogen Bond between Phylloquinone PhQA and a Threonine Side-Chain OH Group in Photosystem I  ap. 14008-14016.  aThe phylloquinone acceptor PhQA in photosystem I binds to the protein through a single H-bond to the backbone nitrogen of PsaA-L722. Here, we investigate the effect of this H-bond on the electron transfer (ET) kinetics by substituting threonine for PsaA-L722. Room temperature spin-polarized transient EPR measurements show that in the PsaA-L722T mutant, the rate of PhQA– to FX ET increases and the hyperfine coupling to the 2-methyl group of PhQA is much larger than in the wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations and ONIOM type electronic structure calculations indicate that it is possible for the OH group of the Thr side chain to form an H-bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom, O₄ of the phylloquinone, and that this results in an increase in the 2-methyl hyperfine couplings as observed in the transient EPR data. The Arrhenius plot of the PhQA– to FX ET in the PsaA-L722T mutant suggests that the increased rate is probably the result of a slight change in the electronic coupling between PhQA– and FX. The strong deviation from Arrhenius behavior observed at ∼200 K can be reproduced using a semiclassical model, which takes the zero-point energy of the mode coupled to the ET into account. However, since the change in slope of the Arrhenius plot occurs at the protein glass transition temperature, it is argued that it could be the result of a change in the protein relaxation dynamics at this temperature rather than quantum mechanical effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotosystem I 3aphylloquinone 3athreonine1 aMcConnell, Michael

The bioelectro-Fenton with microbial iron cycle self-produced cathodic Fenton catalyst, which exhibited superior H₂O₂ production, pollutant removal and iron cycle rate. Compared with the conventional bioelectro-Fenton (the control reactor), the H₂O₂ production was increased by 22.2%, the tetracycline removal (70.3 ± 1.0% of 10 mg L⁻¹, 84.0 ± 0.4% of 20 mg L⁻¹ and 68.4 ± 0.1% of 50 mg L⁻¹) was increased by 23.9%, 22.8% and 32.6%. The Fe²⁺ cycle rate (79.8–84.1%, based on self-produced Fe²⁺) was much higher than that of the control (14.6–16.1%), and the microbial Fe²⁺ cycle provided higher contribution of 78.1–83.0%. The relative abundance of the exoelectrogens and iron-reducing bacteria, and the gene copies of adenosine triphosphate synthase were increased by > 4.0 times, > 5.0 times and 24.3%. These results indicated that the microbial iron cycle improved the system performance by enhancing the microbial anode (electrons factory). The microbial iron cycle provided a new idea and energy-saving mode (produced electricity 0.0712 kW h m⁻³) to improve the efficiency of bioelectro-Fenton due to the self-produced catalyst, excellent Fe²⁺ regeneration and long-acting conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioanodes 3acatalysts 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3agenes 3amicrobial activity 3apollution control 3atetracycline 0aBioelectro-Fenton 0aIron-reducing microorganisms 0aIron cycle 0aElectricity generation 0aTetracycline removal1 aSong, Xiangfu,1 aZhou, Minghua0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245011200161300001600273520057200289592002800861650000800889650001100897650001700908650001000925650000900935650001500944650000900959650002700968650001400995650001301009650003001022650001001052653000801062653002001070653002201090700001401112700001901126700001701145700001501162773012101177856008001298852000901378655001201387IND60478439420221116140902.0220422e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047843942DNAL7 a10.1556/004.49.2001.3.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPádár, Z.10aResolution of parentage in dogs by examination of microsatellites after death of putative sire: Case report  ap. 269-273.  aA case of disputed paternity in dogs is reported.

In particular, electrocatalytic performance can be dramatically enhanced by rationally modulating the surface charge distribution with a well-tuned heterostructure. Herein, a heterostructure is constructed by NiMoO₄ nanosheets grown on an interior hollow NiS@Ni₃S₂ nanorods framework (NiS@Ni₃S₂/NiMoO₄). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the formed heterojunction structure leads to a tailored surface charge state of NiMoO₄, with oxygen as the nucleophilic region and molybdenum as the electrophilic region, which facilitates the decomposition of urea molecules and thus significantly improves hydrogen evolution. As expected, the assembled NiS@Ni₃S₂/NiMoO₄ system substantially expedites urea electrolysis activity with a cell voltage of 1.40 V at 10 mA cm⁻², which is 200 mV less than the voltage of an overall water splitting system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aurea 3awastewater treatment1 aLiu, Tianfu1 aYe, Ke1 aZhu, Kai1 aYan, Jun1 aYin, Jinling1 aWang, Guiling1 aCao, Dianxue0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 8, no. 35 p.18055-18063dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04944a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009600169300001800265520167400283592002801957596004101985650001802026650001202044650001402056650001102070650001502081650000902096650001802105651001102123700006102134700002602195700002802221700001902249773013702268856008302405852000902488655001202497IND60654899820221118235541.0191005e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065489982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-019-01518-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Thaden, Juan12aA regional evaluation of the effectiveness of Mexico’s payments for hydrological services  ap. 1751-1764.  aRecent criticisms of, and financial limits on, payment for hydrologic services (PHS) programs suggest that rigorous, spatially explicit evaluations are urgently needed to improve their effectiveness in conserving forest cover and to justify payments. To evaluate the effectiveness of Mexico’s PHS programs in the Pixquiac and Gavilanes subwatersheds in central Veracruz state, we used a grid-based approach to (1) compare the suitability of national versus regional deforestation risk models in selecting the parcels that should receive payment and (2) evaluate three metrics of program effectiveness in parcels receiving PHS: forest cover loss, additionality associated with deforestation risk, and leakage. Our results suggest that the national deforestation risk model was less effective at predicting actual deforestation patterns and tended to underestimate deforestation risk vs. models run regionally. Regional analysis showed parcels receiving PHS exhibited significantly lower deforestation in plots receiving PHS (0.76% loss) vs. control areas (6.29%) between 2003 and 2013. Furthermore, we found relatively poor additionality with only 38.5% of PHS occurring in zones with high or very high deforestation probability. Finally, we did not detect significant evidence of proximal leakage in our study subwatersheds. Our findings suggest that the PHS programs in central Veracruz have helped to reduce, but not stop forest loss completely. Using increased targeting of areas with higher deforestation risk in selecting PHS areas and updated regional deforestation risk models should be helpful in evaluating and increasing the effectiveness of these programs.  aPublisher supplied data  a1313804cNational Science Foundation 3adeforestation 3aforests 3ahydrology 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3asubwatersheds 3aMexico1 aManson, Robert H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9732-88941 aCongalton, Russell G.1 aLópez-Barrera, Fabiola1 aSalcone, Jacob0 tRegional environmental change.g2019 Aug., v. 19, no. 6 p.1751-1764dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01518-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016000166520134100326592002801667650001201695650001701707650003001724650001101754650004101765650001301806650000901819650002401828653003301852653002001885653002801905653002201933653003601955700001101991700001302002700001902015700002102034773010002055856008202155852000902237655001202246IND60761723020221119155435.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076172302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2021.1791422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Lin-Quan10aThermal hazards and initial decomposition mechanisms study of four tert-butyl organic peroxides combining experiments with density functional theory method  aThermal hazards and initial decomposition mechanisms of di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP), tert-butyl cumyl peroxide (TBCP), tert-butyl peroxy benzoate (TBPB) and tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate (TBPEH) were comprehensively studied.

The energy of each step of the proposed pathways was calculated by density functional theory (DFT) method. The results indicated that all of the four TBOPs were divided into class Ⅲ unacceptable hazard. Acetone was the main decomposition product of the four TBOPs. The most likely decomposition step to generate acetone was that the tert-butane oxygen radical detached a methyl. The main pathway was determined by comparing the energy barrier of rate-determining step. This work provided helpful suggestions for the safe application of the four TBOPs in the practical chemical process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acalorimeters 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3akinetics 3arisk 3athermal degradation 0aTert-butyl organic peroxides 0athermal hazards 0adensity function theory 0aactivation energy 0ainitial decomposition mechanism1 aLi, Li1 aPan, Yue1 aJiang, Jia-Jia1 aJiang, Jun-Cheng0 tThermochimica acta.g2022 Feb., v. 708 p.179142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2021.1791423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007800166520159500244592002801839650001301867650001601880650001301896650001101909650002701920650001701947650001801964650001301982650001701995650001102012650001302023650001102036650001202047650001402059650001402073650002102087650001302108650001902121650001602140650001402156653002102170653001102191653001102202653001802213653002302231700001302254700001202267700001502279700001602294700001802310700005402328773011402382856008602496852000902582655001202591IND60782176920221120205934.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078217692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zheng10aPerformance of soybean protein adhesive cross-linked by lignin and cuprum  aAs a substitute for aldehyde adhesives, soybean protein adhesive has drawn wide interest in addressing formaldehyde pollution in human living rooms. However, during the preparation process, the addition of a cross-linking agent from petroleum resources is necessary to improve the strength and cause the problems of high viscosity and brittleness. Inspired by the adhesion structure of catechol in mussels, lignin with a catechol structure was constructed by one-step demethylation in this study. Lignin, copper ions, and soybean protein isolate were mixed to produce a biobased adhesive exhibiting a triple network structure without adding a petroleum-based epoxy crosslinking agent. The quinone in the lignin and the amino group in the soybean protein underwent a cross-linking reaction to ensure the bond strength and water resistance of the adhesive. The catechol structure built a sacrificial network by forming hydrogen bonds to improve the toughness and coating performance of the adhesive. Multifunctional copper ions formed multiple interface coordination bonds, reducing the viscosity of the adhesive. The wet shear strength of the adhesive with the triple cross-linked network structure reached 1.29 MPa, which was 92.5% higher than that of the pristine adhesive. The viscosity decreased to 24340 mPa s, reflecting a reduction of 84%, and the toughness and coating performance improved. Notably, the prepared adhesive showed mildew resistance (120 h), antibacterial properties (antibacterial zone = 6.8 mm), flame retardancy, and low VOCs release (6.86 × 106 mg/m2·h).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abrittleness 3acatechol 3acopper 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3ademethylation 3aepoxides 3aformaldehyde 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3alignin 3amildews 3apetroleum 3apollution 3aprotein isolates 3aquinones 3ashear strength 3asoy protein 3aviscosity 0aProtein adhesive 0aLignin 0aBionic 0aLow viscosity 0aMultifunctionality1 aLiu, Tao1 aLi, Yue1 aZhang, Xin1 aXu, Yecheng1 aLi, Jianzhang1 aGao, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7571-49030 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132906-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245014600180300001600326520154600342592002801888650003001916650003601946650002301982650002102005650001302026650002202039650001702061650002102078700002002099700002202119700001802141700001802159700001802177773013402195856008102329852000902410655001202419IND50068851320150208000000.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006885132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00003-013-0826-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeller-Péronnet, Véronique10aPotential and limitations of MALDI-TOF MS for discrimination within the species Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides  ap. 205-214.  aThe discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry) was evaluated for differentiation of bacterial strains within Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides species. Protein fingerprints were generated with MALDI-TOF MS for 24 Leuconostoc strains and analyzed with ClinProTools at species level and below. A treatment of bacterial cells prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis was optimized applying different lysozyme concentrations. A pre-treatment with a lysozyme concentration of 12.5 μg ml⁻¹for 30 min exposure time enhanced the reproducibility of the spectra but did not influence the cluster analysis in ClinProTools. The cluster analysis resulted in the identification of seven different peak patterns shared among twelve strains of L. pseudomesenteroides and eight peak patterns shared among twelve strains of L. mesenteroides. The protein fingerprints of 24 Leuconostoc strains were sufficiently diverse for a reliable discrimination of half of the analyzed starter cultures at strain level. The other half of the strains could only be identified at cluster level. The discrimination at subspecies level was not possible on the basis of MALDI-TOF MS profiling. The MALDI-TOF MS methodology delivered interesting information about the diversity of bacterial isolates belonging to the two species L. mesenteroides and L. pseudomesenteroides but had its limitations for subspecies discrimination of unknown isolates as well as strain identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aLeuconostoc pseudomesenteroides 3abacterial proteins 3acluster analysis 3alysozyme 3amass spectrometry 3apretreatment 3astarter cultures1 aBrockmann, Elke1 aPavlovic, Melanie1 aTimke, Markus1 aBusch, Ulrich1 aHuber, Ingrid0 tJournal für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit =.g2013 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.205-214dSpringer-Verlagx1661-57517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00003-013-0826-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245011300207520170000320592002802020650002502048650000902073650001602082650002702098650000902125650001502134650001802149700001802167700002202185700002002207700001702227773010502244856008602349852000902435655001202444IND60715931220221120084523.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, WeiCheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9452-480610aMathematical modeling of consolidation in unsaturated poroelastic soils under fluid flux boundary conditions  aThe spatiotemporal variability in precipitation could have a significant impact on ground subsidence. In this paper, we utilize a previously developed one-dimensional theory of consolidation for a two-fluid system, the generalization of Biot's theory, to investigate the impact of a time-dependent fluid flux across the surface of an unsaturated soil on the solid deformation and pore pressure responses. We consider three prescribed fluid flux patterns and the associated gradient of pore water pressure: constant, periodic, and exponential flux patterns. We employ a Fourier series representation and Laplace transformation in the space and time domains to derive a complete set of closed-form analytical solutions, including the complementary and particular solutions, describing both transient and steady-state excess pore water and pore air pressure responses as well as the total settlement induced by the fluid flux. Using two different types of soil, i.e. clay and sand, we demonstrate the dependence of the solution on the initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity in the saturated and unsaturated regimes. Results of this study reveal that the fluid flux across the surface could have a significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the time evolution of the total settlement of the ground surface. The effect on the pore water pressure is more significant for sand than for clay irrespective of moisture content, mainly because of the much higher hydraulic conductivity of sand. Finally, we show that the hydraulic conductivity has a dominant effect on the consolidation behaviors of saturated and unsaturated soils subjected to surface fluid flux.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3aclay 3adeformation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asand 3asubsidence 3awater content1 aChang, JuiChe1 aBorja, Ronaldo I.1 aDeng, Jiao-Hong1 aLee, Jhe-Wei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Apr., v. 595 p.125671-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009400166300001600260520103100276592002801307650001701335650001601352650000901368650001601377650001201393650002901405650001101434650002301445650002001468650002101488650001901509650000901528650001301537650001601550700002001566700002001586700001901606700002001625773015501645856008101800852000901881655001201890IND60675833320221119160708.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067583332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12892-019-0292-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Woon-Ha10aLeaf Condition of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Response to Cold Stress during Ripening Stage  ap. 489-494.  aCold stress can decrease yield and quality of rice. Although many studies have investigated the impact of cold stress on rice, researches on physiological changes of rice plants under low temperature during ripening stage are insufficient. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze changes of leaf condition in rice plant during ripening stage in response to low temperature. Results showed that photosynthesis activity of flag leaf was decreased continuously after heading and that it was reduced more in cold condition. Chlorophyll content in flag leaf was also reduced in control and cold conditions after heading. In control condition, chlorophyll content showed a significant correlation with nitrogen content in leaf. However, chlorophyll content under cold condition showed a high correlation with Malondialdehyde content. These results strongly suggest that the leaf lipid peroxidation by cold stress can induce the decrease of leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthesis activity during ripening stage in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3achlorophyll 3acold 3acold stress 3aheading 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 3aripening 3atemperature1 aLee, Chung Gun,1 aJeong, Jae-Heok1 aLee, Hyen-Seok1 aChoi, Kyung-Jin0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 22, no. 5 p.489-494dThe Korean Society of Crop SciencewJournal:J000000101x1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-019-0292-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012600160520180400286592002802090650001902118650001802137650001702155650001102172650002502183650002402208650001502232650002202247650002502269650001402294650002202308650001402330650000902344651001102353651001802364700002802382700001802410700002302428700001802451700002202469700002802491773012702519856007402646852000902720655001202729IND60652310420221119223653.0190712e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065231042DNAL7 a10.3390/su100620352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastrica, Marta10aPet Food as the Most Concrete Strategy for Using Food Waste as Feedstuff within the European Context: A Feasibility Study  aFood loss and waste have a negative environmental impact due to the water, land, energy and other natural resources used to produce the wasted food, along with post-consumption disposal costs. Reducing food waste will thus help improve sustainability and decrease the environmental impact of the food system. Using food waste for animal feed is of growing importance in terms of the policies targeted at tackling food waste but the current legal framework in the European Union (EU) strongly restricts the possibility of using food waste for this purpose. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of innovative measures for feed production in the EU and to identify the best strategies to implement them. First, a technical evaluation of a case study is presented, which is a process developed in the United States for urban food waste transformation into animal feed. Second, there is an analysis of the potential application of this process in the European Union within the current legal framework. The results reveal that the feed product derived from food waste is compliant with EU safety requirements and is nutritionally valuable. This work also suggests that the implementation of this kind of process in the European Union has great potential, provided that food surplus is recovered and treated before it turns into waste and that the different types of food surplus identified are used as feed for the right animal type in accordance with European legislation (i.e., livestock, aquarium fish, pets). On these terms, pet food can be the most concrete strategy for using food waste within the European context. In general, the implementation of feed-from-food measures to reduce food waste in Europe is already possible and does not need to wait for further policy interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquarium fish 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afeasibility studies 3afood waste 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock 3anatural resources 3apet foods 3apets 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aTedesco, Doriana  E.

This publication presents a method to display relevant measures of any three adaptation relevant parameters (or optionally their projected future changes) at once on a map by allocating them to multiple transparency levels of the three primary colors of additive color mixing (red, green, and blue). The overlay of information allows the combined assessment of the regional exposures. The method is demonstrated by two examples based on an ensemble of regional climate projections analyzed for 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C global warming periods. The first example shows the increasing number of people at risk for summer climate extremes under 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C global warming by combining projected increases in tropical nights and summer intense precipitation days with today’s population density. Under 3 °C global warming, many heavily populated areas across Europe are affected by both heat stress and summer precipitation extremes, whereas under 1.5 °C global warming, heat stress regions are restricted to southern Europe and the large settlements along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. A second example combines daily mean and minimum and maximum summer temperatures and highlights the regional expansion and the increasing robustness of projected mean summer warming with rising global warming levels, as well as the regional day to night differences of the warming signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3aclimate 3acolor 3aglobal warming 3aheat stress 3amixing 3apopulation density 3asummer 3atemperature 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 3aSouthern European region1 aRechid, Diana1 aReuter, Maximilian1 aViktor, Elisabeth1 aJacob, Daniela0 tRegional environmental change.g2019 Aug., v. 19, no. 6 p.1777-1786dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01496-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011300164300001600277520110900293592002801402650001001430650001201440650000901452650001801461650001001479650001701489650001201506650000901518650001001527650001201537650001301549650001101562650001401573650001901587650001301606650001201619650001001631650000901641650002001650650001101670653001201681653000901693653001201702653002801714653001101742653001301753653001101766653001701777700001801794700001601812700001701828700001401845700001701859773010301876856007901979852000902058655001202067IND60478439920221116140844.0160112e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047843992DNAL7 a10.1556/004.49.2001.3.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFekete, S.

Each particular microelement had a high concentration in both potato and beetroot [cadmium (Cd) 3.7 and 55.4, lead (Pb) 8.1 and 3.0, and mercury (Hg) 5.8 and 6.8 mg/kg dry matter, respectively]. In a metabolic balance trial 16 New Zealand White rabbits were fed 50 grams of basal diet and potato or beetroot ad libitum . The apparent digestibility of major nutrients and the accumulation of the microelements in different organs were investigated. Both potato and beetroot samples of high Pb and Hg content had the significantly (p < 0.05) lowest digestibility of organic matter and nitrogen-free extract. The Cd ingested from both potato and beetroot accumulated in the kidneys and liver (2.85 and 1.48 as well as 0.459 and 0.265 mg/kg, respectively). All the microelements (Cd, Pb and Hg) accumulated in the testicles (0.196, 0.32 and 0.199 mg/kg, respectively), reducing the rate of spermatogenesis. The tissue retention ofheavy metals depends not only on the element itself, but also upon the ‘carrier’ feedstuff.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3acadmium 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeeds 3aheavy metals 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amercury 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apotatoes 3arabbits 3asalts 3asoil 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 0aCadmium 0alead 0amercury 0asoil-plant-animal chain 0apotato 0abeetroot 0arabbit 0aaccumulation1 aBersényi, A.1 aKádár, I.1 aGlávits, R.1 aKoncz, J.1 aZöldág, L.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 3 p.301-310dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-27057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.49.2001.3.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014200178300001400320520134500334592002801679650002801707650001301735650002701748650002001775650002101795650001901816650001901835650001801854650002701872650001701899650001301916650001401929650001701943650003201960700003301992700003302025700003202058700003002090700001902120700003802139700003702177700003402214773008502248856008502333852000902418655001202427IND60083273220221118160922.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008327322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2013.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Assis Souza, Marina10aCytokines and NO in American tegumentary leishmaniasis patients: Profiles in active disease, after therapy and in self-healed individuals  ap. 27-32.  aStudies suggest the influence of immune response on the successful treatment of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), and indicate the existence of protective immunity in self-healed patients. Thus, the aim of this work was to quantify interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-) 10, IL-17, IL-22 and nitric oxide (NO) in culture supernatants of PBMC from patients with active disease (AD), after treatment (AT), and from self-healed (SH) and healthy subjects (CT), in response to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis insoluble antigen (AgIns). All groups of patients produced IFN-γ, indicating a predominant proinflammatory profile. AD and AT patients presented TNF-α levels, with a slight increase after therapy, whereas it was weakly quantified in SH. Interestingly, NO secretion was significant in these individuals, whereas IL-17 appeared in low levels and seems to be regulated by NO. Although IL-22 was detected in AD, its role is still questionable. The presence of IL-10 in all groups of patients suggests that the cytokine plays distinct roles in the disease. These results indicate that specific cellular immunity takes part against Leishmania, but with some similarities between the different clinical states herein described; these mediators seem to be necessary for the cure to occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania braziliensis 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3aleishmaniasis 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anitric oxide 3apatients 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aBrelaz de Castro, Maria C.A.1 ade Oliveira, Andresa Pereira1 ade Almeida, Amanda Ferreira1 ade Almeida, Thays Miranda1 aReis, Luiza C.1 aMedeiros, Ângela Cristina Rapela1 ade Brito, Maria Edileuza Felinto1 aPereira, Valéria Rêgo Alves0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2013 Apr., v. 57 p.27-32dElsevier Ltdx0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011500171520161600286592002801902650001301930650002301943650002401966650001501990650002502005650001602030650001302046650002202059650001402081650000702095650001502102650000902117650001302126651001002139653003802149653003802187653002602225653002102251653002602272700005702298700001602355700001702371700001502388700001502403700001502418700001802433773010502451856008602556852000902642655001202651IND60715931520221120084355.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071593152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mengxiaojun14aThe impact of heavy rain event on groundwater microbial communities in Xikuangshan, Hunan Province, P.R. China  aWith the increase of the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in the context of global warming, the subsequent impact on groundwater ecosystem is urgently needed to be investigated. To understand the impact of heavy rain event (HRE) on groundwater microbial communities, sampling campaigns were conducted at Xikuangshan (XKS), the world largest antimony deposit, in dry period (DP) without precipitation and wet period with an HRE, respectively. Samples were subsequently subjected to high throughput sequencing, function prediction by FAPROTAX and physicochemical properties analysis. Results demonstrated that HRE significantly shifted the bacterial compositions, potential functions and microbial interactions. Betaproteobacteria dominated in DP, whereas Gammaproteobacteria was abundant in HRE. Microbial functions such as aromatic compound degradation, nitrate reduction, sulfate respiration and methanol oxidation were enriched in HRE. Moreover, HRE also disturbed microbial interactions and resulted in a loosely connected and less stable co-occurrence network of bacterial communities. Multiple variables such as pH, Sb, PO₄³⁻, Eh ect. controlled groundwater bacterial communities and predicted functions during HRE and DP, whereas Sb concentration was the most important one. Our results firstly demonstrated that HRE results in significant variations in the composition, potential functions and interactions of bacterial communities in high-Sb groundwater and enhanced our understanding on the response of microbial community to extreme precipitation in the context of global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aaromatic compounds 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3aecosystems 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agroundwater 3amethanol 3anitrate reduction 3aoxidation 3apH 3aprediction 3arain 3asulfates 3aChina 0aXikuangshan antinomy mine deposit 0aGroundwater microbial communities 0aEnvironmental factors 0aHeavy rain event 0aMicrobial interaction1 aWang, Hongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7621-78101 aWang, Weiqi1 aSong, Yuyang1 aMa, Liyuan1 aLu, Xiaolu1 aWang, Nian1 aLiu, Chaoyang0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Apr., v. 595 p.125674-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1256743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166300001600302520126700318592002801585650001401613650001101627650001501638650001901653650002201672650001801694650001201712650001601724650002401740650001501764650003201779650002601811650002301837650002201860700002201882773013401904856008102038852000902119655001202128IND50068851720150602000000.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006885172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00003-013-0831-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrühl, Ludger10aPreparation of doughnuts using partially hydrogenated peanut oil and alternative products with reduced content of trans-fatty acids  ap. 155-163.  aTrans-fatty acids (TFA) should be avoided in the nutrition due to health concerns. Despite that there are several frying fats available on the market with reduced content of TFA this has to be implemented for the production of doughnuts in many bakeries. In this frying experiment the commonly used fat consisting of partially hydrogenated peanut oil (PHPO) and fats with a reduced content of TFA below 2 g/100 g were assessed at the same time for their oxidative stability, technological and sensorial performance for the production of doughnuts. Some of the TFA free products provided even better heat stability compared to PHPO and in addition also technological requirements were covered. However, the sensory assessment of the fats in the frying trial showed significant differences between the products. While a TFA free fat showed best assessment results during the whole course of the frying test others produced significant off-flavours. Surprisingly, for the reduction of TFA these fatty acids were not exchanged by saturated fatty acids. The best product showed a moderate content of 37 g/100 g saturated fatty acids and 55 g/100 g mono unsaturated fatty acids and a low content of about 8 g/100 g poly unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid).  aPublisher supplied data 3adoughnuts 3afrying 3afrying oil 3aheat stability 3ahydrogenated oils 3alinoleic acid 3amarkets 3aoff flavors 3aoxidative stability 3apeanut oil 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asensory evaluation 3atrans fatty acids1 aUnbehend, Günter0 tJournal für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit =.g2013 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.155-163dSpringer-Verlagx1661-57517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00003-013-0831-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009700173300001400270520150300284592002801787650002301815650002101838650001801859650003001877650002101907650001701928650001001945650003001955650001601985650002802001650001602029650000902045650003702054650001202091650001402103650001402117650002202131650002702153650001702180650001602197650002102213650001402234700002002248700001902268700002002287700002502307700002102332773008502353856008502438852000902523655001202532IND60083273420221122230501.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008327342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2012.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeffron, Jared D.10aPhenotypic changes in spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus anthracis associated with BenK  ap. 41-51.  aA transposon insertional mutagenesis spore library of the pathogen Bacillus anthracis was screened to identify mutants altered in germination kinetics. One mutant exhibited an accelerated rate of germination in association with disruption of benK. This gene encodes a putative protein with high homology to membrane transporters that facilitate benzoate transport. We hypothesized that BenK may not be only spore associated, but also have a vegetative cell role. A reporter strain with a translational fusion of benK to green fluorescent protein demonstrated that full-length BenK was present in vegetative cells and that a BenK degradation product was present in spores by detecting the reporter using fluorescence and Western blot analysis. A minimum inhibitory concentration assay indicated that vegetative cells of a benK::Kan mutant were more susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of Na-benzoate. The mutant spores germinated to a greater extent within 1 h than the wild type in an in vitro fluorescence assay. The disruption of benK also resulted in spores that were less readily phagocytosed in a macrophage assay. Despite these altered in vitro phenotypes, no apparent effect of the BenK protein on virulence in the intranasal mouse model or the guinea pig competitive assay was observed. This work shows that, although the BenK protein does not impact fitness or virulence in an infection model, it is involved in other aspects of both the spore and vegetative forms of the organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aanti-infective properties 3abacterial spores 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguinea pigs 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3amacrophages 3amice 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aspore germination 3atranslation (genetics) 3atransporters 3atransposons 3avegetative cells 3avirulence1 aJenkins, Amy L.1 aBozue, Joel A.1 aKaatz, Laura K.1 aCote, Christopher K.1 aWelkos, Susan L.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2013 Apr., v. 57 p.41-51dElsevier Ltdx0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2012.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014200175300001400317520151600331592002801847650002001875650001501895650000901910650001601919650001701935650002301952650001901975650001701994650001002011650001902021650001802040650000902058650001102067650002102078650001602099650001202115650001602127650001102143653002702154653002002181653002002201653001902221700003202240700002502272700005702297700006202354700006602416700002402482700001702506700005902523700004902582700006402631773008802695856008602783852000902869655001202878IND60761723520221119155354.0220110e20220130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076172352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArathisenthil, S.V.10aRapid development of a salivary calculus in submandibular gland and its potential causes in a young victim following Russell's viper bite  ap. 85-89.  aRussell's viper bites are known to cause a range of haemotoxic, neurotoxic, myotoxic, cytotoxic and nephrotoxic complications. However, the impact of Russell's viper bites as well as bites from other venomous snakes on sialolithiasis has not been previously reported. Here, we present an interesting case where a Russell's viper bite induced the rapid development of a calculus in submandibular gland in a 10-year-old boy. Upon admission, the victim did not show any symptoms of swelling and/or pain around his oral cavity. He received antivenom treatment to normalise his coagulation parameters, however, on day three he developed swelling and extreme pain around his right mandibular region. An ultrasound investigation revealed the presence of a calculus in his submandibular gland, which was removed using a minor surgical procedure. The histopathological examination revealed this as a poorly calcified salivary calculus, which is composed of cell debris, mucopolysaccharides and lipids. The mechanisms behind its rapid development following a snakebite are unclear although this could be linked to excessive inflammation or modifications to the composition of saliva induced by venom toxins or other unknown factors. This report reveals an unusual complication induced by a Russell's viper bite and alerts clinicians who treat snakebites to be aware of such envenomation effects. Moreover, this will lead to novel research to explore the relationship between venom toxins and functions of salivary glands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaboia russelii 3aantivenoms 3aboys 3acoagulation 3acytotoxicity 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amouth 3anephrotoxicity 3aneurotoxicity 3apain 3asaliva 3asalivary calculi 3asnake bites 3asurgery 3aultrasonics 3avenoms 0aSnakebite envenomation 0aRussell's viper 0aSalivary glands 0aSialolithiasis1 aSenthilkumaran, Subramanian1 aVijayakumar, Pradeep1 aSavania, Ravi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2664-58141 aWilliams, Harry F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5095-31311 aElangovan, Namasivayam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9113-480X1 aBicknell, Andrew B.1 aPatel, Ketan1 aTrim, Steven A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3524-41151 aThirumalaikolundusubramanian, P.q(Ponniah),1 aVaiyapuri, Sakthivel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6006-65170 tToxicon.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 206 p.85-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001400162245008900176300001800265520137600283592002801659650003501687650002301722650001401745650001801759650002401777650002101801650002401822650001701846650002701863650001101890650001201901650002501913650002101938650002501959650002701984650003302011651002802044700001802072700001602090773009802106856007702204852000902281655001202290IND50089318920221119025759.0151024e199908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008931892DNAL7 a104861162pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500506162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíez, J.10aCharacterization and in vitro translation analysis of pelargonium flower break virus  ap. 1627-1637.  aPelargonium flower break virus (PFBV) is one of the common viruses in the glasshouses of Western Europe and has been assigned to the genus Carmovirus. A Spanish isolate obtained from nursery-grown Pelargonium zonale plants (PFBV-m) has been characterized. The molecular weight of genomic RNA and coat protein of PFBV-m were determined to be 1.36 × 10⁶ (corresponding to approximately 4 kb) and 36,000, respectively. Only genomic-size RNA was encapsidated in PFBV virions; making necessary to purify double-stranded RNA from infected tissue in order to detect putative PFBV subgenomic RNAs. PFBV RNA directed the synthesis of a major polypeptide of 34 kDa and three other relevant polypeptides of estimated sizes 88–90 kDa, 42 kDa and 35–36 kDa. Antisera specific to PFBV immunoprecipitated the in vitro translated 35–36 kDa polypeptide indicating that this polypeptide is the PFBV coat protein. The PFBV in vitro translation pattern was very similar to that of CarMV although the relative levels of translated coat protein differed dramatically between the two viruses, most probably due to the lack of encapsidation of subgenomic PFBV. In vitro translation studies with a different biological clone obtained from the same PFBV-m isolate revealed a prominent additional polypeptide which is postulated to be a truncation of the 5′ proximal ORF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelargonium flower break virus 3aPelargonium zonale 3aantiserum 3acoat proteins 3adouble-stranded RNA 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3apolypeptides 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirion 3aviruses 2aCarmovirusxgenetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Viralxmetabolism 2aViral Proteinsxbiosynthesis 3aWestern European region1 aMarcos, J.

Isolated chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were subjected to hypoxia or normoxia for indicated time points. Cell viability, DNA synthesis, cell cycle profile, and expression of E2F1 were analyzed. The results showed that hypoxia promoted cell proliferation and DNA synthesis which was accompanied by an increased S phase entry and upregulation of E2F1 at mRNA and protein levels. Using siRNA technology, we demonstrated that gene inactivation of endogenous E2F1 abolished hypoxia-induced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and S phase entry compared with negative siRNA transfected cells. These results suggest that hypoxia-induced proliferation is mediated by inducing E2F1 in chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3achickens 3agene expression regulation 3ahypoxia 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3amyocytes 3asmall interfering RNA 3asmooth muscle 3atranscription factors1 aSun, Feng1 aZhang, Chen1 aWang, Hao1 aWu, Guoyao1 aWu, Zhenlong0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2013 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.72-72dSpringer-Verlagx2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2049-1891-4-28  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007300163520098900236592002801225650002301253650001301276650001901289650001801308650001301326653001701339653003001356653003001386653002101416653002001437653002101457653002401478653002601502700001601528773011401544856007601658852000901734655001201743IND60727285420221121002938.0210210e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072728542DNAL7 a10.3897/rio.6.e547702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMietchen, Daniel10aQuantifying the Impact of Data Sharing on Outbreak Dynamics (QIDSOD)  aIn this project, we will explore the range of data-related decisions made during public health emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the flow of information, data, and metadata within networks of such decisions. Data sharing is now considered a key component of addressing present, future, and even past public health emergencies, from local to global levels. Researchers, research institutions, journals and others have taken steps towards increasing the sharing of data around the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future pandemics. We will quantify the effects of data flow modifications to identify parameter sets under which specific modes of sharing or withholding information have the largest effects on outbreak dynamics. For these high-impact parameter sets, we will then assess the current and past availability of corresponding data, metadata, and misinformation, and estimate the effects on outbreak mitigation and preparedness efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3ametadata 3amisinformation 3apublic health 3aresearch 0adata sharing 0apublic health emergencies 0aepidemiological modelling 0anetwork dynamics 0adecision making 0adata integration 0aoutbreak management 0adisaster preparedness1 aLi, Jundong0 tResearch Ideas and Outcomes.g2020 May 27, v. 6 p.e54770-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27349x2367-71637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e547703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01087naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245005700158300001800215520027800233592002800511650001000539650001700549650002300566700002300589773012800612856007200740852000900812655001200821IND60657399520221121101802.0190816e20030530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065739952DNAL7 a10.1039/b303543N2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Alison M.10aNovel soraphens from precursor directed biosynthesis  ap. 1360-1361.  aSix novel halogenated soraphen analogues have been isolated from the wild-type producing organism using precursor directed biosyntheses; the best ‘delivery vehicle’ for the novel starter acids was cinnamate but ortho substituents were not tolerated by the soraphen PKS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abiosynthesis 3achemical reactions1 aThompson, Betty L.0 tChemical communications.g2003 May 30, , no. 12 p.1360-1361dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b303543N3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011900162520132900281592002801610650001201638650002101650650001501671650001301686650002801699650002501727650001601752650001401768650001301782650001801795650001701813650001001830651001001840700003701850700003001887773012701917856007402044852000902118655001202127IND60652311020221119220157.0190712e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065231102DNAL7 a10.3390/su100620402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwagemakers, Paul10aSocially-Inclusive Development and Value Creation: How a Composting Project in Galicia (Spain) ‘Hit the Rocks’  aThis paper introduces the concept of commoning in circular economies, and explores how commons reproduce over time. The starting point is that commoning can have an important role in fostering circular economies and sustainable and socially-inclusive development. By commoning, we refer to local stakeholders working collectively to preserve or restore their natural resource base to generate benefits that are locally shared. Through the analysis of a specific case of a group of commoners&rsquo; associations in Galicia (Spain), the paper describes and discusses the development, and ultimate unravelling, of an innovative and decentralized waste management project to convert waste biomass from the monte (often-neglected upland green spaces, largely consisting of brush and trees) into compost. In order to make this composting project economically viable the possibility of collecting and processing urban green waste was also explored. While the project&rsquo;s application of the principles of a circular economy had the potential to bring locally-shared economic and ecological benefits, and foster territorial prosperity and resilience, it was ultimately frustrated by questions of scale, administrative and regulatory barriers, competing and conflicting land-use claims and financial cutbacks in the public sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acircular economy 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aeconomic sustainability 3agreen infrastructure 3agreen waste 3ahighlands 3aland use 3apublic sector 3astakeholders 3atrees 3aSpain1 aDominguez Garcia, Maria  Dolores1 aWiskerke, Johannes  S.

However, the extent to which improvements can be made is dependent on the decision-making processes of individual producers, so there has been a proliferation of carbon accounting tools seeking to influence those processes. This paper evaluates the suitability of such tools for driving environmental change by influencing on-farm management decisions. Seven tools suitable for the European dairy industry were identified, their characteristics evaluated, and used to process data relating to six scenario farms, emulating processes undertaken in real farm management situations. As a result of the range of approaches taken by the tools, there was limited agreement between them as to GHG emissions magnitude, and no consistent pattern as to which tools resulted in the highest/lowest results. Despite this it is argued, that as there was agreement as to the farm activities responsible for the greatest emissions, the more complex tools were still capable of performing a ‘decision support’ role, and guiding management decisions, whilst others could merely focus attention on key issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3adairy industry 3adecision making 3afarm management 3afarms 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 0aCarbon calculators 0aclimate change mitigation 0alivestock agriculture 0agreenhouse gas emissions 0adecision support1 aLewis, Kathleen A.1 aTzilivakis, J.q(John),1 aWarner, Douglas J.0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 15, no. 6 p.645-661dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2017.13986283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245009400217520106800311592002801379650001401407650001601421650001301437650002501450650001701475653001301492653002501505653001601530653001501546653002801561700006501589700002001654773011401674856008601788852000901874655001201883IND60782178120221120205917.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078217812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasittisopin, Lapyote1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4860-735710aReview of concrete with expanded polystyrene (EPS): Performance and environmental aspects  aLightweight concrete with expanded polystyrene (EPS) has been adopted for several decades. The EPS is to reduce the structural weight of the material for precast and prefabrication construction with enhanced thermal/acoustic insulation. Primarily, the EPS bead was partially replaced with both coarse and fine aggregates. The performance, workability, mechanical properties, and long-term performance were analyzed and briefed. Moreover, the functional uses such as moisture insulation, thermal insulation, and sound insulation of the material were also discussed. Additionally, recent studies focused on cement-based materials with recycled EPS beads. Lastly, the challenges and viable solutions of using the materials against current global environmental concerns on cleaner air quality and sustainability were mentioned. These challenges are seriously problematic for producing the material following the recent global trend; when it cannot be solved, either the lightweight aggregate using mineral ingredients or cellular foamed concrete could be better used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aair quality 3aconcrete 3ainsulating materials 3apolystyrenes 0aConcrete 0aExpanded polystyrene 0aPerformance 0aInsulation 0aEnvironmental challenge1 aTermkhajornkit, Pipat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9415-35151 aKim, Yŏng-hun,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132919-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1329193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015400164300001400318520149200332592002801824650002701852650001601879650002501895650002101920650001801941650001801959650002301977650001602000650001502016650001202031650001402043650001302057650001302070650001302083650001402096650000702110650002202117650000902139650001302148650002002161653001502181653002502196653002702221653002702248653001602275700001202291700001502303700001602318700001802334700001502352700001802367773011102385856008502496852000902581655001202590IND60610724920221120070203.0180829e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061072492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Kai10aOxidative transformation of artificial sweetener acesulfame by permanganate: Reaction kinetics, transformation products and pathways, and ecotoxicity  ap. 52-60.  aAcesulfame has attracted much attention due to its wide application, environmental persistence and potential safety risk of transformation products (TPs). Little information is known on acesulfame transformation in the presence of oxidants/disinfectants. The acesulfame oxidation by permanganate (Mn(VII)) in water under environmentally relevant conditions was systematically evaluated. The pH of water showed negligible influence in acesulfame oxidation. Inorganic ligand (pyrophosphate) exhibited insignificant effect whereas organic ligands (oxalate, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and humic acid) exerted obvious suppression on acesulfame oxidation. Natural organic matter in real water had important influence in acesulfame oxidation by Mn(VII). Acesulfame transformation pathways were initiated by the attack of Mn(VII) on double bond of ring via [3+2] addition electrocyclic reaction and rich electron of N moiety through electrophilic reaction, followed by oxidation and hydrolysis reactions to produce TPs. Among them, five TPs were for the first time identified. The ecotoxicity tests uncover higher toxicity of the TPs than acesulfame itself. The study on oxidative transformation of acesulfame by Mn(VII) would illumine comprehensive evaluation of this emerging contaminant. Water treatment plants need to consider cautiously to protect the safety of downstream system when using Mn(VII) to dispose the water resource containing acesulfame or other artificial sweeteners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLewis acids 3aacesulfame potassium 3achemical bonding 3adisinfectants 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental fate 3ahumic acids 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3amanganese 3amoieties 3aoxalates 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3areaction kinetics 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aAcesulfame 0aPermanganate oxidant 0aTransformation product 0aTransformation pathway 0aEcotoxicity1 aLi, Fei1 aWang, Ying1 aHe, Qunying1 aDeng, Yongxiu1 aChen, Shuo1 aLiu, Chengbin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 May 15, v. 330 p.52-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01512naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008300170300001200253520050500265592002800770650002500798650002700823650001900850650002300869650001300892650001800905650002800923700001900951700002100970773010100991856008501092852000901177655001201186IND60085489020221121124403.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008548902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2011.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwai, Noritaka10aOne-pot three-step continuous enzymatic synthesis of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose  ap. 1-4.  aThe one-pot three-step continuous enzymatic synthesis of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-d-ribose (5-FDR) from ATP and l-methionine using S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthase (MetK), fluorinase and methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MtnN) in the presence of fluoride ion, was described.

These different forms are characterized by various intermolecular bonding schemes. High-pressure experimental results show that the γ phase undergoes phase transition to the β phase at a pressure of about 4 GPa, whereas the other two forms retain their original structures at a high pressure. We propose that the stabilities of the α and δ forms upon compression are due to the special dimer connection that these forms possess. On the other hand, the γ form, which does not have this connection, prefers to transform to the closely related β form when pressure is applied. The detailed mechanism of the phase transition together with the stability of the three polymorphs is discussed by taking molecular stacking into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aphase transition1 aWang, Kai1 aLi, Shourui1 aYuan, Hongsheng1 aYan, Tingting1 aLiu, Jing1 aYang, Ke1 aLiu, Bingbing1 aZou, Guangtian1 aZou, Bo0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Dec. 13, v. 116, no. 49 p.14441-14450dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30392193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245008700160300001600247520129700263592002801560650001501588650001301603650001301616650002001629650002401649650002801673650001601701650001601717650002301733650000901756653002301765653001601788653002101804653003501825653002801860653000801888653002601896653002601922653002301948653004701971653001902018700001702037700001602054700002502070700001702095700001402112700001702126773010302143856007902246852000902325655001202334IND60478440620221116140544.0160112e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047844062DNAL7 a10.1556/004.49.2001.4.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFekete, S.10aAlteration of body composition in rats: Effect of organic chromium and L-carnitine  ap. 385-398.  aA growth trial was carried out to test the effect of organic, trivalent chromium and L-carnitine on the body composition of growing rats. At the same time, an evaluation of different measurement methods (weight of epididymal fat pad, adipocyte morphometry, total body electrical conductivity) was performed. Outbred Wistar rats of 30 days of age were fed diets of different (0, 10 and 20%) protein level. The diets were supplemented with 4 mg/kg Cr as chromium nicotinate, and 100 mg/kg L-carnitine. The experimental feeding lasted 15 days, after a 5-day-long adjustment period. It was found that Cr addition increased feed intake. Both treatments caused changes in body composition, increasing fat and protein deposition. Organic chromium had no effect at either protein level, while L-carnitine improved the protein retention only at an optimum (20%) protein supply. No statistically significant correlation was found between total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) and body composition, which could be attributed to the great individual differences. A close correlation was found among total body fat percentage, weight of epididymal fat pad and the adipocyte surface. The data suggest that there is an interaction between dietary protein supply and the effect of repartitioning agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3abody fat 3achromium 3adietary protein 3adietary supplements 3aelectrical conductivity 3afeed intake 3amorphometry 3aprotein deposition 3arats 0aTrivalent chromium 0aL-carnitine 0abody composition 0aprotein efficiency ratio (PER) 0anet protein ratio (NPR) 0arat 0adietary protein level 0aadipocyte morphometry 0aepididymal fat pad 0atotal body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) 0anutriceuticals1 aSzakáll, I.1 aKósa, Emma1 aAndrásofszky, Emese1 aFodor, Kinga1 aHidas, A.1 aTőzsér, J.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2001 Nov., v. 49, no. 4 p.385-398dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-27057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.49.2001.4.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012900169500001400298520129700312592002801609650001701637650001401654650002101668650001801689650002501707650001801732650002501750650001701775650001701792653000901809653001001818653002101828653001701849653000801866653001901874700002501893700002801918700001901946700002601965700001701991700002102008700001802029700003002047700002002077700002102097700003202118700002802150700002702178773009802205856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60713057820221121030202.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071305782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimifard, Sevda10aCodelivery of BV6 and anti-IL6 siRNA by hyaluronate-conjugated PEG-chitosan-lactate nanoparticles inhibits tumor progression  aNAL-light  aIncreased expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) genes has been associated with progressive cancer and chemoresistance. Accordingly, blockade of IAPs by BV6 has resulted in ameliorative outcomes. Interleukin (IL)-6 is another important mediator involved in the growth and survival of tumor cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that simultaneous inhibition of IAPs and IL-6 could be a new promising anti-tumor treatment strategy.In this study, we generated and characterized hyaluronate-PEG-Chitosan-Lactate (H-PCL) nanoparticles (NPs) to simultaneously deliver IL6-specific siRNA and BV6 to 4T1 (breast cancer) and CT26 (colon cancer) cells, and investigate the anti-tumor properties of this combination therapy both in vitro and in vivo.H-PCL NPs exhibited good physicochemical properties leading to efficient transfection of cancer cells and suppression of target molecules. Moreover, combination therapy synergistically increased apoptosis, as well as decreased cell migration, proliferation, colony formation, and angiogenesis in both 4T1 and CT26 cell lines and suppressed cancer progression in tumor-bearing mice that was associated with enhanced survival time.These findings imply the effectiveness of cancer combination therapy by using H-PCL NPs loaded with anti-IL-6 siRNA and BV6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ainterleukin-6 3aneoplasm progression 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 0aIL-6 0asiRNA 0aChitosan-lactate 0aNanoparticle 0aBV6 0aCancer therapy1 aKaroon Kiani, Fariba1 aSadat Eshaghi, Farzaneh1 aIzadi, Sepideh1 aShahdadnejad, Kolsoom1 aMasjedi, Ali1 aHeydari, Morteza1 aAhmadi, Armin1 aHojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad1 aHassannia, Hadi1 aMohammadi, Hamed1 aBoroumand-Noughabi, Samaneh1 aKeramati, Mohammad Reza1 aJadidi-Niaragh, Farhad0 tLife sciences.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 260 p.118423-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165300001400269506002800283520083200311592002801143506003701171650001801208650002001226650001601246651001601262653001301278653002001291653001501311653002801326653002501354653002301379653001201402653002701414653002101441700001901462773013901481856008201620852000901702655001201711IND60777267320221207095812.0220505e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726732DNAL7 a10.15407/ukrbotj79.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lange P.J.10aNew combinations in Pentapogon for Aotearoa / New Zealand taxa earlier placed in Deyeuxia (Poaceae)  ap. 73-76.  aResource is Open Access  aNew combinations in Pentapogon R.Br.

Taking Wuhan as the case study, this paper developed an index system including rural settlement, land, industry and human settlement environment for evaluating the level of rural development. Then, using the exploratory spatial data analysis, the principal component analysis and the cluster analysis, this paper analyzes the spatial differentiation and correlation and categorizes the types of rural development. The results are as follows. (1) The spatial differentiation of the level of rural development in Wuhan City’s new urban districts is obvious and the areas with a high level of rural development are mainly distributed at the intersection of the new and central urban areas and gradually decrease outward. (2) There is a significant spatial agglomeration of the developed rural areas and the structure of the spatial change in these areas resembles a certain continuity, specifically a circle of “central heat surrounding cold”. (3) Rural development in the new urban areas can be divided into the following five types: the ecological leisure type, the traditional farming type, the balanced development type, the industrial-and-agricultural mixed type and the industrial promotion type. The corresponding development path is proposed in combination with different types of rural development to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference for rural revitalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3acold 3adecision making 3aheat 3ahuman settlements 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3arural areas 3arural development 3asocioeconomic development 3aspatial data 3aspatial variation 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLuo, Jing 1 aZhang, Chunyan 1 aTian, Lingling 1 aLiu, Qingqing 1 aChen, Guolei 1 aTian, Ye 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Mar. 13, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90301723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009100168300001600259520068300275592002800958650001100986650002100997650001201018651001201030653001901042653002101061653002201082700002201104773007701126856008301203852000901286655001201295IND60096922220221120090439.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeepa, Claudia10aEffects of a cut-off in feed-in tariffs on photovoltaic capacity: Evidence fromGermany  ap. 536-542.  aWe analyze the effects of feed-in tariff (FIT) adjustments on installed photovoltaic capacity in Germany.

Simulations of installed capacities indicate that alternative adjustment mechanisms could be more appropriate to meet the government's installation target.

Rain gauge data are considered as one of the best data sources of precipitation but before further use, the data must be spatially interpolated. The process of interpolation is particularly challenging over mountainous areas due to complex orography and a usually sparse network of rain gauges. This paper investigates two deterministic interpolation methods (inverse distance weighting (IDW), and first-degree polynomial) and their impact on the outputs of semi-distributed rainfall-runoff modeling in a mountainous catchment. The performed analysis considers the aspect of interpolation grid size, which is often neglected in other than fully-distributed modeling. The impact of the inverse distance power (IDP) value in the IDW interpolation was also analyzed. It has been found that the best simulation results were obtained using a grid size smaller or equal to 750 m and the first-degree polynomial as an interpolation method. The results indicate that the IDP value in the IDW method has more impact on the simulation results than the grid size. Evaluation of the results was done using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), which is considered to be an alternative to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). It was found that KGE generally tends to provide higher and less varied values than NSE which makes it less useful for the evaluation of the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic cycle 3amountains 3arain 3arain gauges 3arunoff 3awatersheds0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 19, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130202303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245004600180300001600226500000900242520178600251592002802037650002202065650001302087650001302100650002302113650002502136650002502161650001102186650001502197650002102212651001202233700001902245700001602264773012302280852000902403856009702412655001202509IND9303450020221118013716.0191122e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930345002DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestcott, M. P.10aCritical Petiole Nitrate Levels in Potato  ap. 844-850.  aepub  aCritical nutrient concentrations (CNC), below which a yield reduction occurs, for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) petiole nitrate (PN) have been reported for the Pacific Northwest growing region but differences in method of determination or definition of this parameter have resulted in some discrepancies in values. The objectives of this research were to document seasonal PN levels with varying levels of applied N, to determine CNC at three growth dates [tuber initiation, TI; 21 d after TI(TI + 21); and 42 d after TI (TI + 42)], and to establish the relationship between yield responses to midseason N application and CNC. Experiments were conducted at two sites on a Typic Argiboroll and three sites on a Pachic Haploxeroll in western Montana. Treatments included six or eight N rates between 0 and 336 kg N ha⁻¹ applied as NH₄NO₃ before hilling and a topdressing of 67 kg N ha⁻¹ broadcast on subplots at TI + 21. Early season PN depended on applied N, with maximum values of 25 to 30 g NO₃-N kg⁻¹ at TI. Values declined with seasonal progression and became increasingly dependent on fertilizer N rates. The N topdressed at TI + 21 increased PN level 6 g kg⁻¹ at TI + 42 compared to non-topdressed areas. Linear plateau regression of relative yield against PN revealed CNC values of 25 g kg⁻¹ at TI 14 g kg⁻¹ at TI + 21, and 10 g kg⁻¹ at TI + 42. Statistical analysis, could not separate the TI t 21 and TI + 42 regressions, indicating a CNC of 13 g NO₃-N kg⁻¹ throughout the period of tuber bulking. Yield responses to topdressed N, however, were documented only when PN values were below 11 g NO₃-N kg⁻¹ at TI + 21. Conservative interpretation of critical nutrient concentration is justified.

This species has the aedeagus with the long and thin apical process and belongs to the group of yellow species with a black pattern on the elytra and the distinctly punctured pronotum. New records of Lema concinnipennis Baly, 1865, Chaetocnema kimotoi Gruev, 1980, Neocrepidodera ohkawai Takizawa, 2002, Phyllotreta rectilineata Chen, 1939 in Russia are provided. Photographs of spermathecae and a new identification key for females externally similar species Tricholochmaea ussuriensis Romantsov, 2021, T. semifulva (Jacoby, 1885) and Pyrrhalta flavescens (Weise, 1887) are given for the first time; the general view of T. ussuriensis is imaged for the first time. The material on the rare and little-known species Cryptocephalus gussakovskii Lopatin, 1952 was studied and the lectotype (female) of this species is designated; the paralectotype (male) was probably lost. The original description and futher interpretations of this species incompletely correspond to the lectotype. In the majority of keys this species differs from other representatives of the subgenus Burlinius Lopatin, 1965 only in the anterior margin of the prothorax tooth-like bent downwards, and the images of the aedeagus and the description of male protibiae are absent. According to the original description the male has the protibia curved at the base, and there is no mention of the tooth-like anterior margin of the prothorax. In further works, I.K. Lopatin used only the tooth-like anterior margin of the prothorax (a very rare character within the subgenus Burlinius) to distinguish this species from other representatives of the subgenus. However, he didn’t mention curved male protibia anymore. The description and images of males of C. gussakovskii are given for the first time. All males have strongly curved protibiae with the angularly widened inward distal part. This feature allows to attribute this species to the C. populi species-group. Both males and females of C. gussakovskii have tooth on the prothorax, which distinguishes them from C. populi Suffrian, 1848 and from other yellow representatives of the subgenus. Differences between C. gussakovskii and C. sagamensis Tomov, 1982 from Korea are given; the first species has the smooth, almost impunctate pronotum, the pronotal punctation of latter species is distinct and deep. Two taxa, C. pseudopopuli Schöller, 2011 from South Korea and C. gussakovskii are probably conspecific. Figures of the general view and aedeagi are given for Cryptocephalus flavolimbatus, C. gussakovskii, Chaetocnema kimotoi, Neocrepidodera ohkawai and Phyllotreta rectilineata.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChaetocnema 3aLema 3aPhyllotreta 3aPyrrhalta 3aRussia 3aaedeagus 3aconspecificity 3aelytra 3afauna 3afemales 3alectotypes 3amales 3aspermatheca 3ataxonomic keys 3aSouth Korea 0acoleoptera 0achrysomelidae 0afauna 0ataxonomy 0afar east 0arussia0 tKavkazskij èntomologičeskij bûlletenʹ.g2022 Apr., v. 18, no. 1 p.35-42dRussian Academy of Science.

However, the effects of fly ash soil application on plant biomass and the accumulation of both nutrient and toxic elements in plants remain unclear. Based on 85 articles, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate changes in plant biomass and concentrations of 21 elements in plants in response to fly ash application. These elements included macro-nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, and S), micro-nutrients (B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Zn), and metal(loid)s (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Se). Overall, fly ash application decreased plant biomass by 15.2%. However, plant biomass was enhanced by fly ash application by 11.6–29.2% at lower application rates (i.e. <25% of soil mass), and decreased by 45.8% at higher application rates (i.e. 50–100%). Belowground biomass was significantly reduced while yield was enhanced by fly ash application. Most of the element concentrations in plants were enhanced by fly ash application, and followed a descending order with metal(loid)s > micro-nutrients > macro-nutrients. Concentrations of elements tended to increase with an increase in fly ash application rate. Our syntheses indicated that fly ash should be applied at less than 25% in order to enhance plant biomass and yield but avoid high accumulations of metal(loid)s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aapplication rate 3aarsenic 3abelowground biomass 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acoal 3acobalt 3acopper 3afly ash 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3ameta-analysis 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3apollutants 3apotassium 3apower plants 3aselenium 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3atoxic substances 3azinc 0aBiomass 0aFly ash 0aMetal(loid)s 0aNutrients 0aPlant 0aYield1 aDeng, Qi1 aJian, Siyang1 aLi, Jianwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0429-36271 aDzantor, E.

Across the globe there are two main public policy objectives driving the development of biofuels industries—improving energy security and reducing global warming. The US and Canadian governments have respectively fostered biofuels industries for these reasons. As biofuels industries will not be financially viable without government support in the foreseeable future, government policies can be interpreted as taking options on the future. A theoretical model is developed using option value theory to determine whether the same governmental policy (subsidization) can lead to different levels of optimal subsidies in each country, where the subsidy policy is driven by two distinct motivating factors. If the reason subsidy levels differ is structural, the likelihood of a trade dispute arising increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy industry 3abiofuels 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3ainternational policy and programs 3ainternational trade 3amodels 3apublic policy 3asubsidies 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0aBiofuels 0aOption value theory 0aTrade disputes1 aKerr, William A.0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 May, v. 56 p.543-548dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012400206300001800330520125400348592002801602650001101630650001501641650001901656700002101675700006001696700002201756773017101778856008001949852000902029655001202038IND60601967020221123022726.0180709e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060196702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b046312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Diogo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7823-299310aFast Estimation of Plant Steady State for Imperfectly Known Dynamic Systems, with Application to Real-Time Optimization  ap. 3699-3716.  aExperimental assessment or prediction of plant steady state is important for many applications in the area of modeling and operation of continuous processes. For example, the iterative implementation of static real-time optimization requires reaching steady state for each successive operating point, which may be quite time-consuming. This paper presents an approach to speed up the estimation of plant steady state for imperfectly known dynamic systems that are characterized by (i) the presence of fast and slow states, with no effect of the slow states on the fast states, and (ii) the fact that the unknown part of the dynamics depends only on the fast states. The proposed approach takes advantage of measurement-based rate estimation, which consists in estimating rate signals without the knowledge or identification of rate models. Since one can use feedback control to speed up the convergence to steady state of the fast part of the plant, this rate estimation allows estimating the steady state of the slow part during transient operation. It is shown how this approach can be used to speed up the static real-time optimization of continuous processes. A simulated example illustrates its application to a continuous stirred-tank reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprocess design1 aAmrhein, Michael1 aBilleter, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8155-01591 aBonvin, Dominique0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 57, no. 10 p.3699-3716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b046313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245010500178300001400283506002800297520213500325592002802460506003702488650001502525650002302540650000902563650001302572653002302585653002202608653001902630653001002649653001702659653002202676653001902698700002102717700001802738700002402756700002002780773016102800856009102961852000903052655001203061IND60777267820221207095814.0220503e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726782DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2022-16-1-69-772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipkan’, А.

(Research purpose) To improve the methodology for assessing soybean losses during harvesting in the waterlogged soil conditions, using the possibility of sampling them separately behind the header and thresher of the combine. (Materials and methods) The methodological approach was based on: the impact of crop heterogeneity; the principle of adequate accuracy in loss assessment, regardless of soil conditions during harvesting; accessibility, simplicity and minimal labor intensity of the method; the possibility of differentiating grain losses behind the header to identify their main sources. Three main loss zones were identified and the characteristics of their sources were considered. The authors presented a scheme for applying square metal frames with a 1-meter side length on crops and on a harvested field area after the passage of the combine. The authors described the sequence of laboratory and field assessment and formulae for determining natural grain losses, losses behind the header and their types, soybean losses behind the thresher and total losses behind the combine. (Results and discussion) A methodology for soybean loss assessment was developed and tested during the trial of the Case IH AF6140 combine with a New Holland 740CF-30DD(SF) header. It was found out that this combine meets all the norms for soybean grain losses at a combine speed of 6 kilometers per hour. Loose grains were revealed to be the largest share of losses behind the header. To further mitigate losses, it was proposed to control the number of reel revolutions. (Conclusions) We have developed a technical approach and an algorithm for grain loss assessment with the use of rigid metal frames, which ensures high reliability, efficiency and lower labor intensity when considering losses and calculating actual and permissible (from biological yield) values for the specific and relative soybean losses behind a header and combine harvester as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3acombine harvesters 3asoil 3asoybeans 0asoybean harvesting 0acombine harvester 0asoybean header 0ayield 0agrain losses 0asoil waterlogging 0asampling frame1 aKuvshinov, A.

This study aimed to explore the fate of MGEs during chicken manure (CM) and bovine manure (BM) composting to assess horizontal transfer risks of ARGs. The results showed that the removal efficiency of MGEs during CM composting was significantly higher than that during BM composting, because the potential host bacteria of MGEs were eliminated largely during CM composting. Meanwhile, these potential host bacterial communities are significantly influenced by pH, NH4+, NO3− and total N, which can be used to regulate host bacterial communities to remove MGEs during composting. Projection pursuit regression further confirmed that composting can effectively reduce the horizontal transfer risk of ARGs, especially for CM composting. These results identified the critical roles of host bacterial communities in MGEs removal during composting of different animal manures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acattle manure 3acomposting 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3anitrates 3apH 3apoultry manure 3arisk 0aMobile genetic elements 0aHorizontal gene transfer ability 0aComposting 0aHost bacterial community 0aEnvironmental factor1 aZhao, Yue1 aYang, Kangjie1 aChen, Jian1 aZhou, Haixuan1 aChen, Xiaomeng1 aLiu, Qi1 aWei, Zimin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 July, v. 250 p.166-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002500137245013600162300002000298520096300318650002101281650002101302650001501323650003501338650002001373650002001393650001401413650001601427650001801443650001401461650001101475650004301486650001401529650001301543650002401556700001701580773016301597856004001760852000901800655001201809IND4535089920221118005119.0160301e20151105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453508992DNAL7 a10.1021/jf503145t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdemir, Umran Seven10aFractionation Analysis of Manganese in Turkish Hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.) by Inductively Coupled PlasmaâMass Spectrometry  ap. 10792-10799.  aIn this study, an analytical fractionation scheme based on water, diethyl ether, n-hexane, and methanol extractions has been developed to identify manganese-bound fractions.

A combination of ring-opening metathesis polymerization, atom transfer radical polymerization of alkyl methacrylates, and hydrogenation was used to prepare the target materials. Viscometric measurements reveal that larger side chain molar mass provides better thickening efficiency. More importantly, increasing the side chain polarity favorably impacts the performance of these graft copolymers as viscosity modifiers. While competitive modifiers must simultaneously meet several technical requirements, the most promising graft copolymer exhibits similar or larger viscosity index at a lower concentration (treat rate) compared to state-of-the-art polymeric additives. This feature bodes well for future additive design. Dynamic light scattering and pulsed field gradient NMR on dilute solutions of the graft copolymer in dodecane (a model oil) consistently show a significant (∼30 nm) decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of the copolymer upon heating from 40 to 100 °C, in conflict with the prevailing assumed viscosification mechanism of coil expansion upon heating. Small angle neutron scattering experiments suggest that the graft copolymer chains may associate to give clusters containing methacrylate-rich domains at lower temperatures due to the solubility of the hydrocarbon backbone and insolubility of the polymethacrylate side chains. We posit that, at elevated temperatures, deaggregation into single chains occurs due to the increased solubility of the side chains. This declustering process results in an overall increase in the hydrodynamic volume of the dispersed polymers, which presumably leads to an improved viscosity modification behavior in engine oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogenation 3alight scattering 3alubricants 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aneutron diffraction 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolyolefin 3aprocess design 3asolubility 3atemperature 3aviscometry 3aviscosity1 aZhao, Dan1 aMuisener, Richard J.1 aSchimossek, Klaus1 aSchoeller, Katrin1 aLodge, Timothy P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5916-88341 aHillmyer, Marc A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8255-38530 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 57, no. 6 p.1840-1850dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b046343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010900166300001600275520146000291592002801751650001601779650001101795650001801806650002101824650002401845653003701869653001901906653001501925700001901940700002101959773007701980856008302057852000902140655001202149IND60096922720221121164144.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergek, Anna10aWho invests in renewable electricity production? Empirical evidence and suggestions for further research  ap. 568-581.  aTransforming energy systems to fulfill the needs of a low-carbon economy requires large investments in renewable electricity production (RES-E). Recent literature underlines the need to take a closer look at the composition of the RES-E investor group in order to understand the motives and investment processes of different types of investors. However, existing energy policies generally consider RES-E investments made on a regional or national level, and target investors who evaluate their RES-E investments according to least-cost high-profit criteria. We present empirical evidence to show that RES-E investments are made by a heterogeneous group of investors, that a variety of investors exist and that their formation varies among the different types of renewable sources. This has direct implications for our understanding of the investment process in RES-E and for the study of motives and driving forces of RES-E investors. We introduce a multi-dimensional framework for analyzing differences between categories of investors, which not only considers to the standard economic dimension which is predominant in the contemporary energy literature, but also considers the entrepreneurship, innovation-adoption and institutional dimensions. The framework emphasizes the influence of four main investor-related factors on the investment process which should be studied in future research: motives, background, resources and personal characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aentrepreneurship 3ainnovation adoption 0aRenewable electricity production 0aInvestor types 0aInvestment1 aMignon, Ingrid1 aSundberg, Gunnel0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 May, v. 56 p.568-581dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001800257500001500275520099000290592002801280650001601308650003301324650003401357650001601391653001401407700001901421700001501440700002201455773009801477856008101575990002301656852000901679655001201688IND60093897020221119043412.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009389702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2013.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParida, B.N.10aFerroelectric, pyroelectric and electrical properties of new tungsten–bronze tantalate  ap. 1880-1888.  a2019-12-06  aThe polycrystalline sample of Li₂Pb₂Y₂W₂Ti₄Ta₄O₃₀ was prepared by a high-temperature solid-state reaction technique.

The nature of variation of pyroelectric-coefficient and current with temperature suggests that material has good pyroelectric properties useful for fabrication of pyroelectric detector.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aX-radiation 0aimpedance1 aDas, Piyush R.1 aPadhee, R.1 aChoudhary, R.N.P.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Nov., v. 13, no. 9 p.1880-1888dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.07.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013600208300001600344520145900360592002801819596007701847650002101924650001901945650001101964650001201975650001201987650001301999650001202012650001302024650002302037650002302060650001002083650001202093650002502105650001202130650001402142650001402156650002602170650001302196650001802209650001302227650001502240650001202255650002202267650001002289651002802299700002002327773014202347856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60786493020221121035432.0220804e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078649302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-022-01459-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiesebach, Heike1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4155-696410aFlowering behavior of clones in a Norway maple (Acer platanoides) seed orchard and mating system analysis using nuclear SSR markers  ap. 561-569.  aNorway maple (Acer platanoides L.) is a tree species native to Central Europe and occurs in scattered or in small populations mixed with other tree species. Since Norway maple is considered to be adaptable to climate change, it has increasingly become a focus of forestry as one of the so-called alternative tree species to diversify species composition in forests. However, little knowledge exists on the phenotypic variation in the natural range, and no studies on the reproductive behavior of this monoecious and insect-pollinated tree species. The sexual system of Norway maple is known as heterodichogamous, with male-first and female-first flowering individuals mixed in a population. In a first step, we conducted a mating system analysis in a seed orchard. We used a recently developed set of species-specific SSR markers to genotype the parental clones and respective seed samples. The total seed had proportions of 68% outcrossed offspring between clones of the seed orchard, 11% selfing and 20% external pollination. Four flower types were observed, with protogynous and hermaphrodite types contributing more female gametes, while the protandrous type is highly variable in its female or male contributions. The number of ramets per clone in the seed set has a significant impact on the proportion of genetic contribution per clone to total seed yield. Conclusions are drawn for the establishment of new seed orchards and for further research.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 22040618cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft 3aAcer platanoides 3aclimate change 3aclones 3afemales 3aflowers 3aforestry 3aforests 3agenotype 3aindigenous species 3ainsect pollination 3amales 3amonoecy 3aphenotypic variation 3aprogeny 3aprotandry 3aprotogyny 3areproductive behavior 3aresearch 3aseed orchards 3aseed set 3aseed yield 3aselfing 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aCentral European region1 aSchneck, Dagmar0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 Aug., v. 141, no. 4 p.561-569dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-022-01459-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010600158300001800264520156800282592002801850653001501878653001701893653002301910653002001933653001201953653001401965653002101979700002502000700001902025773010602044856007402150852000902224655001202233IND60127156520221120215920.0151110e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012715652DNAL7 a10.1554/05-284.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Sarah A.10aReplicate patterns of species richness, historical biogeography, and phylogeny in holarctic treefrogs  ap. 2433-2450.  aIn recent decades, the field of historical biogeography has become increasingly divorced from evolutionary biology, ecology, and studies of species richness. In this paper, we explore the evolutionary causes of patterns of biogeography and species richness in Northern Hemisphere treefrogs, combining phylogenetics, ancestral area reconstruction, molecular dating methods, and ecological niche modeling. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among 58 hylid taxa using data from two mitochondrial genes (12S, ND1) and two nuclear genes (POMC, c-myc). We find that parallel patterns of species richness have developed in Europe, Asia, and in two separate clades of North American hylids, with the highest richness at midtemperate latitudes (30––35°°) on each continent. This pattern is surprising given that hylids overall show higher species richness in the New World tropics and given many standard ecological explanations for the latitudinal diversity gradient (e.g., energy, productivity, mid-domain effect). The replicate pattern in Holarctic hylids seems to reflect specialized tolerance for temperate climate regimes or possibly the effects of competition. The results also suggest that long-range dispersal between continental regions with similar climatic regimes may be easier than dispersal between geographically adjacent regions with different climatic regimes. Our results show the importance of ecology and evolution to large-scale biogeography and the importance of large-scale biogeography to understanding patterns of species richness.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmphibians 0abiogeography 0acommunity assembly 0adiversification 0aHylidae 0aphylogeny 0aspecies richness1 aStephens, Patrick R.1 aWiens, John J.0 tEvolution.g2005 Nov., v. 59, no. 11 p.2433-2450dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F05-284.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245009800166500001900264520186400283592002802147650001102175650003102186650000802217650001902225650002402244650001402268650001702282650002202299650002502321651001402346700002702360773015902387856007602546852000902622655001202631IND60703094220221118022233.0200720e20200324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070309422DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90301852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvşar, Nevin Betül10aRecent Sea Level Change in the Black Sea from Satellite Altimetry and Tide Gauge Observations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal mean sea level has been rising at an increasing rate, especially since the early 19th century in response to ocean thermal expansion and ice sheet melting. The possible consequences of sea level rise pose a significant threat to coastal cities, inhabitants, infrastructure, wetlands, ecosystems, and beaches. Sea level changes are not geographically uniform. This study focuses on present-day sea level changes in the Black Sea using satellite altimetry and tide gauge data. The multi-mission gridded satellite altimetry data from January 1993 to May 2017 indicated a mean rate of sea level rise of 2.5 ± 0.5 mm/year over the entire Black Sea. However, when considering the dominant cycles of the Black Sea level time series, an apparent (significant) variation was seen until 2014, and the rise in the mean sea level has been estimated at about 3.2 ± 0.6 mm/year. Coastal sea level, which was assessed using the available data from 12 tide gauge stations, has generally risen (except for the Bourgas Station). For instance, from the western coast to the southern coast of the Black Sea, in Constantza, Sevastopol, Tuapse, Batumi, Trabzon, Amasra, Sile, and Igneada, the relative rise was 3.02, 1.56, 2.92, 3.52, 2.33, 3.43, 5.03, and 6.94 mm/year, respectively, for varying periods over 1922–2014. The highest and lowest rises in the mean level of the Black Sea were in Poti (7.01 mm/year) and in Varna (1.53 mm/year), respectively. Measurements from six Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, which are very close to the tide gauges, also suggest that there were significant vertical land movements at some tide gauge locations. This study confirmed that according to the obtained average annual phase value of sea level observations, seasonal sea level variations in the Black Sea reach their maximum annual amplitude in May–June.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aglobal positioning systems 3aice 3ainfrastructure 3asatellite altimetry 3asea level 3aspatial data 3athermal expansion 3atime series analysis 3aBlack Sea1 aKutoğlu, Şenol Hakan0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Mar. 24, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90301853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245009200178300001600270500000900286520182400295592002802119650001602147650001402163650001502177650002602192650002102218650001602239650001602255650001002271650002102281650002002302651000902322700001802331700002002349773012302369852000902492856009702501655001202598IND9303450620221118013630.0191122e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930345062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, R.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the yield potential of a subirrigation/drainage system, when used in combination with a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production system with known high yield potential, on a poorly drained soil at Wooster, OH. The water table was maintained on a Ravenna silt loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aeric Fragiuqualfs) by subirrigation at an average depth of 39 cm. Water table depth ranged from 25 cm over the drain line to 53 cm at the midpoint between drain lines which were spaced 6 m apart. Five cultivars (Sprite, Sprite 87, Hobbit 87, Asgrow 3127, Williams 82) and two row spacings (18 and 76 cm) were compared in 1985 and 1986. In 1987, the five cultivars were all planted in 18-cm rows and compared at two water table levels (the 1985 and 1986 level and a non-irrigated naturally varying depth). Averaged over the five cultivars, the constant water table produced a 3-yr average yield of 5392 kg/ha. In 1987 there was a 2051 kg ha⁻¹ or 58% yield advantage for the subirrigation/drainage system over non-irrigation (5563 vs 3512 kg ha⁻¹). The 1985, 1986 mean yield advantage for 18cm rows compared to 76-m rows was 1010 kg ha⁻¹ or 23%. These results indicate that with a properly managed subirrigation/drainage system, combined with a soybean production system with high yield potential, long-term average soybean yields of 5300 kg ha⁻¹ should be possible in the humid Midwest.

Wilson10aSafety in numbers and the spatial scaling of density‐dependent mortality in a coral reef fish  ap. 3044-3054.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn coral reef fishes, density‐dependent population regulation is commonly mediated via predation on juveniles that have recently settled from the plankton. All else being equal, strong density‐dependent mortality should select against the formation of high‐density aggregations, yet the juveniles of many reef fishes aggregate. In light of this apparent contradiction, we hypothesized that the form and intensity of density dependence vary with the spatial scale of measurement. Individual groups might enjoy safety in numbers, but predators could still produce density‐dependent mortality at larger spatial scales. We investigated this possibility using recently settled juvenile bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a small, aggregating reef fish. An initial caging experiment demonstrated that juvenile bluehead wrasse settlers suffer high predation, and spatial settlement patterns indicated that bluehead wrasse juveniles preferentially settle in groups, although they are also found singly. We then monitored the mortality of recently settled juveniles at two spatial scales: microsites, occupied by individual fish or groups of fish and separated by centimeters, and sites, consisting of ∼2400‐m² areas of reef and separated by kilometers. At the microsite scale, we measured group size and effective population density independently and found that per capita mortality decreased with group size but was not related to density. At the larger spatial scale, however, per capita mortality increased with settler density. This shift in the form of density dependence with spatial scale could reconcile the existence of small‐scale aggregative behavior typical of many reef fishes with the population‐scale density dependence that is essential to population stability and persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3amarine fish 3amortality 3aspatial data 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3apredation 3ayoung animals 3aThalassoma 3afish cages 3aspatial distribution 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aMortality 2aPerciformesxgrowth & development 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 3aVirgin Islands of the United States1 aWarner, Robert R.0 tEcology.g2007 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.3044-3054dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1949.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03121naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245005700177300001600234500000900250520190500259592002802164650001302192650001202205650002002217650001902237650001802256650001102274650001602285650001102301650002002312650001502332650001802347650001502365650004002380651001202420700001902432700001902451773012302470852000902593856009702602655001202699IND9303450820221118013710.0191122e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930345082DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajor, D. J.10aEffect of Maize Maturity on Radiation-Use Efficiency  ap. 895-903.  aepub  aMaize (Zea mays L.) production has expanded into short-season regions but it is not known whether the radiation-use efficiency (RUE, g MJ⁻¹)¹ of new early hybrids differs from those grown in traditional maize-growing regions. In this study, spectral reflectance measurements were used to derive estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed to compare the RUE of 10 maize hybrids that varied in adaptation from Iowa 110-d relative maturity to the earliest 60-d relative maturity hybrids commercially available. Reflectance measurements were made radiometrically in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum at approximately weekly intervals in 1985, 1986, and 1988. The 10 maize hybrids were grown at three densities at Lethbridge, Alberta, on an irrigated silty clay loam soil (Typic Haploboroll). The Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) model of canopy reflectance was inverted to produce daily estimates of the fraction of absorbed PAR, p. Multiplying p by daily PAR irradiance gave daily estimates of absorbed PAR (APAR, MJ m⁻²), which were summed for the season. Radiation use efficiency was obtained by dividing whole-plant yield at harvest by seasonal (emergence to harvest) APAR. Averaged over years, hybrids, and densities, RUE was 2.3 g MJ⁻¹. Radiation-use efficiency increased with population density across hybrids regardless of maturity. Seasonal RUE was lower than reported in the literature but there is evidence that chilling injury due to low night temperatures at the high elevation and semi-arid location of the study reduced photosynthesis. The results suggest that spectral reflectance can be used effectively by breeders to identify hybrids that are more efficient users of PAR and that maize hybrids resistant to chilling injury may be needed at high latitudes.

The voids of PTFE microparticles were filled with supercritical CO₂, causing them to split into multiple granules due to the force of its expansion during the pressure release, resulting in the formation of a large number of nucleation sites. The cell density of this foam reached 10¹⁰–10¹¹ cells/cm³, which was 2–5 orders of magnitude higher than pristine PP foam. We proposed that the nanoscale granules resulting from the splitting of PTFE microparticles, and the growth of nucleated small cells that generated the local strain field variation in the multiple-phase system, were responsible for the considerably increased nucleation number of PP foaming. Additionally, the tensile strength and sound absorption property of PP/PTFE foam were largely enhanced and the preparation of ultrahigh-cell-density PP/PTFE foam was easily controlled over a wider foaming temperature window.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3afoaming 3agranules 3ainsulating materials 3amicroparticles 3apolypropylenes 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3atensile strength1 aXing, Zhe1 aWang, Mouhua1 aZhao, Quan1 aWu, Guozhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3814-20740 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Feb. 07, v. 57, no. 5 p.1498-1505dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b046443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011000153500002900263520115900292592002801451650003101479650002801510650001101538650001601549650001001565700001601575700001501591700001601606773011901622856007301741852000901814655001201823IND60724616920221123030507.0210122e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072461692DNAL7 a10.3390/w130201222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Juan 12aA Multivariate Balanced Initial Ensemble Generation Approach for an Atmospheric General Circulation Model  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aBased on the multivariate empirical orthogonal function (MEOF) method, a multivariate balanced initial ensemble generation method was applied to the ensemble data assimilation scheme. The initial ensembles were generated with a reasonable consideration of the physical relationships between different model variables. The spatial distribution derived from the MEOF analysis is combined with the 3-D random perturbation to generate a balanced initial perturbation field. The Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) data assimilation scheme was established for an atmospheric general circulation model. Ensemble data assimilation experiments using different initial ensemble generation methods, spatially random and MEOF-based balanced, are performed using realistic atmospheric observations. It is shown that the ensembles integrated from the balanced initial ensembles maintain a much more reasonable spread and a more reliable horizontal correlation compared with the historical model results than those from the randomly perturbed initial ensembles. The model predictions were also improved by adopting the MEOF-based balanced initial ensembles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aatmospheric circulation 3afields 3amethodology 3awater1 aZheng, Fei 1 aZhang, He 1 aZhu, Jiang 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130201223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006700169300001400236520142700250592002801677650001301705650002001718650002901738650001501767650001601782650002901798650002201827650002001849650000901869650001601878653001901894653002001913653002901933700001501962700002101977773007501998856008302073852000902156655001202165IND60096923320221122032726.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitcover, Julie10aPolicy options to address global land use change from biofuels  ap. 63-74.  aThe use of biofuels can increase land competition, leading to global land use change (LUC). LUC poses risks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and food prices. The magnitude of the risk is uncertain, but could be significant. Given these uncertainties and risks, we suggest that policymakers pursue a mix of the following three strategies: (1) promote feedstocks that rely less on land; (2) reduce LUC risk for land-using feedstocks; and (3) stimulate investments that increase land productivity and environmental protection. To realize these three strategies, we recommend that policymakers distinguish among feedstocks based on LUC risk; explore certifying production that avoids land competition; and adopt policy mechanisms that encourage investments in LUC-prone areas. We favor including feedstock-specific LUC emissions estimates in policies despite relatively large scientific uncertainty. While misleadingly precise, point estimates can be selected from science-based ranges to directly link LUC policy to emissions and provide strong transparent signals to biofuel investors. LUC emissions estimates can be updated regularly (∼3–5 years) to reflect improvements in scientific understanding, and global changes in policy and economic environments. With or without LUC emissions point estimates, additional policies, some outside the biofuel sector, will be needed to pursue the three strategies above.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aeconomic policy 3aenvironmental protection 3afeedstocks 3afood prices 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland productivity 3aland use change 3arisk 3auncertainty 0aBiofuel policy 0aLand use change 0aGreenhouse gas emissions1 aYeh, Sonia1 aSperling, Daniel0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 May, v. 56 p.63-74dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012500208300001400333520218400347592002802531650002102559650000902580650003102589650001602620650001102636650001702647650001702664650002102681650002602702650001402728650001002742650001802752650001602770653003202786653001702818653001902835653001602854653002002870700005402890700001602944700001702960773008802977856008503065852000903150655001203159IND60629147820221120133107.0190502e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062914782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Jinghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2172-950910aPerformance study of supplying cooling load and output power combined cycle using the cold energy of the small scale LNG  ap. 36-44.  aThe gasification process of small flows of liquefied natural gas also releases large amounts of cold energy and pressure energy. In order to effectively utilize the cold energy and the pressure energy, a combined cycle for supplying cooling load and output power was proposed. In the combined cycle，one refrigeration cycle for food frozen storage, two refrigeration cycles for food cooling storage, two chilled water cycles for air conditioning, R717 is used as working substance of refrigeration cycles. The exergy efficiency and performance coefficient of the combined cycle were analyzed. The exergy efficiency of evaporator is the lowest, the exergy efficiency of each expander and condenser is higher than that of the pump in refrigeration cycles. The exergy efficiency of evaporator, expander, pump and condenser increases with the increase of evaporation temperature of R717 refrigerant. The power consumption of the each chilled water pump for air conditioning is higher than that of the R717 pumps in refrigeration cycles. LNG pump power consumption is lower than that of two chilled water pumps. As the outlet pressure of the NG expander decreases, and the pressure at the inlet of the NG expander increases, the total pump power consumption and the system total expansion output power increases. Among the system total expansion output power, NG expander accounts for more than 2/3. With the increase of the outlet pressure of the NG expander, the system exergy efficiency and the performance coefficient of combined cycle decreases. With the increase of the inlet pressure of the NG expander, the exergy efficiency of the system increases. However the inlet pressure of NG expander rises resulting in reduction in the performance coefficient of the system. And at the same inlet and outlet pressure of NG expander, the mass flow rate of NG increases, the exergy efficiency and the performance coefficient of the system hardly changes. When the mass flow rate of NG is 1 kg/s, and the inlet and outlet pressures of NG expander are 10000 kPa and 600 kPa, the exergy efficiency and the performance coefficient of the system reaches 85.19% and 6.525 respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acold 3aenergy use and consumption 3aevaporation 3aexergy 3afrozen foods 3agasification 3ahydrologic cycle 3aliquefied natural gas 3amass flow 3apumps 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 0aR717 supplying cooling load 0aOutput power 0aCombined cycle 0aCold energy 0aSmall scale LNG1 aSun, Zhili1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3067-63111 aDong, Qiang1 aLiu, Xinghua0 tEnergy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 172 p.36-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014200212300001600354520133700370592002801707650001201735650001401747650002201761650001001783650002401793650001301817650001501830650001001845700005701855700001801912700005801930700006101988700006402049773014202113856008302255852000902338655001202347IND60786493420221121035339.0220804e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078649342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-022-01464-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasternak, Katarzyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6883-752610aMorphological and genetic variation of Melolontha spp. from pine stands with different composition and proportion of admixed tree species  ap. 617-628.  aIncreasing areas of gradation, making it difficult or impossible to perform restorations and forestations, and as causing tree crown damage, result in the need to intensify monitoring of beetle populations. In order to support control activities, the study assessed the species structure, morphological traits and genetic variation in Melolontha spp. from five pine stands with different composition and proportion of admixed tree species. The study applied ISSR and COI methods and identified minor variabilities between the analyzed populations, which may be the effect of high gene flow and absence of complete geographic isolation. Our research indicated high population dynamics and the degree of its migration, as evidenced by the gene flow rate. Given the rapid spreading potential, current methods of countering pest expansion are rather ineffective. The species, morphological and genetic structures were found to be associated with the area of beetles’ occurrence, which may depend on the proportion and composition of admixed tree species, which beetles use for supplementary and reference feeding. This species showed higher values of the genetic variation parameter in areas dominated by M. hippocastani compared to M. melolontha. However, the opposite situation was observed in the area with M. melolontha dominance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3apests 3apopulation dynamics 3aresearch 3atree crown 3atrees1 aOkoń, Sylwia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5906-20171 aKamola, Marek1 aOciepa, Tomasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2540-75631 aNucia, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8480-15581 aKowalczyk, Krzysztof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9334-099X0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 Aug., v. 141, no. 4 p.617-628dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-022-01464-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245015200176300001600328520139900344592002801743650002401771650002001795650001601815650003101831650002501862650001501887650002201902650001801924650001101942650002101953650001601974650001601990650000902006650002302015650001402038650001402052650001802066650003202084650001402116650001402130653001402144653001602158653001502174653003202189653001502221653001602236700006102252700002202313700001702335700001902352700002002371700006002391700001502451700006402466773013302530856009002663852000902753655001202762IND60628534020221120095142.0190815e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062853402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashif, Mohammad10aIn silico studies and evaluation of antiparasitic role of a novel pyruvate phosphate dikinase inhibitor in Leishmania donovani infected macrophages  ap. 508-514.  aThe present work deals with the identification and characterization of a novel inhibitor Z220582104, specific to pyruvate phosphate dikinase, for leishmanicidal activities against free promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. We have used structure-based drug designing approaches and performed homology modelling, virtual screening and molecular dynamics studies. Primary mouse macrophages and macrophage cell line J774A1 were infected with promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. Both promastigotes and infected macrophages were subjected to treatment with the varying concentrations of Z220582104 or miltefosine for assessment of leishmanicidal activity. The novel inhibitor Z220582104 demonstrated growth inhibitory potential and reduced the viability of the free promastigotes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Z220582104 was also effective against the intracellular form of the parasites and reduced the number of amastigotes in macrophages and also lowered the parasite index, compared with the untreated infected macrophages. Although less effective compared with the miltefosine, Z220582104 is well tolerated by the dividing cells and normal human lymphocytes and monocytes with no adverse effects on the growth kinetics or viability. Our in silico and in vitro studies suggested that Leishmania donovani pyruvate phosphate dikinase could be a potential new drug target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania donovani 3aadverse effects 3aamastigotes 3aantileishmanial properties 3aantiparasitic agents 3acell lines 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agrowth models 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amice 3amolecular dynamics 3amonocytes 3aparasites 3apromastigotes 3apyruvate phosphate dikinase 3ascreening 3aviability 0aIn silico 0aDrug design 0aLeishmania 0aPyruvate phosphate dikinase 0aZ220582104 0aMiltefosine1 aHira, Sumit Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6113-47211 aUpadhyaya, Anurag1 aGupta, Uttam1 aSingh, Ranjeet1 aPaladhi, Ankush1 aKhan, Faez Iqbal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9088-07231 aRub, Abdur1 aManna, Partha Pratim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2939-08180 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.508-514dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014200157500001900299520216800318592002802486650001202514650001902526650001502545650002902560650002502589650001902614650003102633650001102664650001002675650001302685650001402698650000902712650002402721650001902745650001002764651001002774700001802784700001702802700001502819700001602834700001902850773011902869856007302988852000903061655001203070IND60724617220221121171105.0210122e20210119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072461722DNAL7 a10.3390/w130202352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yi-fan 13aAn Assessment of Lake Ecology on the Basis of the Macrobenthos Multi-Metric Index (MMI) in 11 Lakes in the Western Region of Jilin, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe western region of Jilin Province is located at the northeastern part of China. A large number of lakes are distributed in this region, where is one of five large lake regions within China, supporting both drinking water and agricultural water. The frequent human activities and scarce rainfall in this region have resulted in weaker lake connectivity and enrichment of the pollutants within the lakes. The lake ecosystems in the region have been degraded to varying degrees, and thus it is necessary to assess its ecological health. Macrobenthos multi-metric index (MMI) is a mature ecological health assessment method that has been widely used in the lake ecosystem assessment all over the world. However, it has not been well developed for assessing the lake water ecosystem in China. In this study, 11 lakes affected by human activities to different degrees were selected as the research objects. They were categorized into three types on the basis of trophic level. Through the comparison and screening of different biological indicators among different lake types, we selected appropriate indicators to construct the MMI. Four core indicators were selected from 58 candidate indicators to construct the MMI: the total number of taxa, Simpson index, percentage of Diptera + Mesogastropod, and percentage of pollution-intolerant species. MMI could distinguish lakes that are seriously and slightly disturbed by humans. The results of regression analysis also showed that the degree of lake eutrophication caused by human activities had a significant correlation with MMI, effectively explaining its changes. MMI can characterize the disturbance and influence of eutrophication on macrobenthos. The results of MMI can also be affected by the land use type and the coverage of aquatic vegetation around the lake, which are important factors affecting the ecological health of the lake. Research on the application of MMI method to assessment of the ecological health of lakes is very rare in Northeast China. This research can provide supplementary information beyond the traditional water environment assessment for the formulation of management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aaquatic plants 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3aeutrophication 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahumans 3alakes 3aland use 3alimnology 3arain 3aregression analysis 3atrophic levels 3awater 3aChina1 aSun, Shi-jun 1 aFeng, Jiang 1 aCui, Peng 1 aZhang, Dan 1 aLong, Zhen-yu 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 19, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130202353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245009900177300001600276500000900292500001500301520188900316592002802205650002302233650002302256650002502279650002502304650002502329650001202354650002502366651001702391653002602408700001402434773012302448852000902571856009702580655001202677IND9303451020221118013704.0191122e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930345102DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, A.

Link) Schult] and western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii Rybd, (Löve)] are important cool-season forage species that have contrasting growth patterns. Knowledge of relationships among plant development stage, water use, and rooting activity would aid in understanding the responses of these species to stresses and defoliation. Our objectives were to compare evapotranspiration (ET), rooting activity, and plant water status in relation to Haun development stage of ‘Nordan’ crested wheatgrass and ‘Rodan’ western wheatgrass. These species were grown at three water treatments (50, 100, and 150% of 1 April to 31 October monthly rainfall) and two N fertilizer (11 and 110 kg N ha⁻¹) rates in a rain-out shelter at Mandan, ND for a 3-yr period. The soil was a Parshall fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed Pachic Haploborolls). Cumulative ET through early boot stage averaged 133 and 170 mm for crested and western wheatgrass, respectively. Maximum ET rate occurred at Haun stage 5 to 6 for both species. Crested wheatgrass rooting activity averaged over three water treatments increased about 4.4 cm d⁻¹ compared to 3.7 cm d⁻¹ for western wheatgrass. Both species exhibited rooting activity to 1.2 m by mid-May when western wheatgrass had developed to Haun stage 4.9 and crested wheatgrass to 5.7. Water use-efficiency of crested wheatgrass decreased as water treatment and Haun stage increased, but western wheatgrass did not change with either. Water use-efficiency of crested wheatgrass, but not of western wheatgrass, was greater at 110 than at 11 kg fertilizer N ha⁻¹. Information on the simultaneous development of plant aerial parts and rooting activity contributes to an understanding of the water-use relations of these species and has application in development of growth and yield simulation models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3aPascopyrum smithii 3awater use efficiency 3adevelopmental stages 3aAgropyron desertorum 3arooting 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNorth Dakota 0aplant-water relations1 aBauer, A.0 tAgronomy journal.g1991 Sept., v. 83, no. 5 p.906-910dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050025x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02877naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011000166300001600276520156500292592002801857650005001885650003001935650001801965650002001983650001402003650000902017650000902026650001502035653002502050653003102075653002202106653001102128653001502139700001602154700002002170700001502190700001702205700002002222773010702242856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60636661920221118051443.0200523e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063666192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaohui12aA systematic assessment of carcinogenicity of chemicals in hydraulic-fracturing fluids and flowback water  ap. 128-136.  aThousands of chemicals exist in hydraulic-fracturing (HF) fluids and wastewater from unconventional oil gas development. The carcinogenicity of these chemicals in HF fluids and wastewater has never been systematically evaluated.In this study, we assessed the carcinogenicity of 1,173 HF-related chemicals in the HF chemical data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).We linked the HF chemical data with the agent classification data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) at the World Health Organization (WHO) (N = 998 chemicals) to evaluate human carcinogenic risk of the chemicals and with the Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) from Toxnet (N = 1,534 chemicals) to evaluate potential carcinogenicity of the chemicals.The Chemical Abstract Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) for chemicals were used for data linkage. Among 1,173 chemicals, 1,039 were identified only in HF fluids, 97 only in wastewater, and 37 in both. Compared with IARC, we found information of 104 chemicals, and 48 of them may have potentially carcinogenic risk to human, among which 14 are definitely carcinogenic, 7 probably carcinogenic, and 27 possibly carcinogenic. Using the CPDB data, it suggests that 66 chemicals are potentially carcinogenic based on rats and mouse models.Conclusions Our evaluation suggests that exposure to some chemicals in HF fluids and wastewater may increase cancer risk, and the identified chemicals could be selected as the priority list for drinking water exposure assessment or cancer-related health studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenicity 3adatabases 3arats 3arisk 3awastewater 0aHydraulic fracturing 0aUnconventional natural gas 0aFracturing fluids 0aCancer 0aCarcinogen1 aZhang, Xiao1 aCarrillo, Genny1 aZhong, Yan1 aKan, Haidong1 aZhang, Bangning0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Aug., v. 251 p.128-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001900158245009700177300001600274506002800290520182600318592002802144506003702172650000802209650002402217650002002241650001302261650000902274650000902283650002202292650002202314650001902336650001202355650002702367650000902394650001902403650001802422650002602440650001302466653002702479653000802506653000802514653003002522653002202552700002602574700001902600773018502619856009302804852000902897655001202906IND60777269620221207083457.0220420e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726962DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2022.23.2.184-1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuchetl, S.

The restricted genetic diversity of Linum usitatissimum L. due to selfpollination and of initial forms used by developing the new linseed flax varieties limits the efficiency of the breeding work. The purpose of the research was to determine the genetic structure of linseed flax varieties using a system of 10 microsatellite loci. Four varieties bred by the V. S. Pustovoit All-Russian Research Institute of Oil Crops were used as the research material. DNA was isolated by the CTAB method. Electrophoretic separation of amplicons was performed in 8 % polyacrylamide gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. The determination of the main indicators of genetic variability, analyzed molecular variance (AMOVA), the Wright F-statistics indicators, and the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was carried out using the GenAlEx 6.5 program. A total of 53 alleles have been identified. The main indicators of genetic diversity were calculated for each variety. According to statistical characteristics (Na, Ne, I, F), the variety Nilin is the source of the greatest genetic diversity. For all varieties, the ratio of expected heterozygosity (He) and observed heterozygosity (Ho) corresponds to inbred populations with a minimum proportion of random crossing. By the allelic state of the 10 SSR loci, the variety Snegurok belongs to the linear type, which corresponds to its origin. The genetic passport of this variety has been compiled according to these loci. According to the results of the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), 71 % of the total dispersion is due to genetic differences between the varieties, and 29 % is due to intra-varietal differences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aelectrophoresis 3aethidium 3aflax 3agels 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3alinseed 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoils 3apolyacrylamide 3aprofitability 3aresearch institutions 3avariance 0alinum usitatissimum l. 0adna 0assr 0apolymerase chain reaction 0agenetic diversity1 aChelyustnikova, T.

In Ukraine, this species is at the southern limit of its range in Eastern Europe. Locations in the Ukrainian Carpathians and the Polissya Lowland are a part of a large Euro-Asiatic geographical population. A separate exclave of its range is located in the Crimean Mountains. The habitats of M. uniflora in Ukraine are associated with green moss coniferous forests. The species grows in spruce forests in the Ukrainian Carpathians, in pine forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris in the Polissya Lowland, and in pine forests dominated by Pinus nigra subsp. pallasiana in the Crimean Mountains. Local populations of M. uniflora in Ukraine are characterized by low numbers (up to one hundred shoots with a predominance of vegetative shoots) and small areas (1–2 m2). Anthropogenic pressure on the habitats of M. uniflora resulted in range decline and determined its current southern limit that coincides with the border between the Forest (Polissya) and the Forest-Steppe zones. In the past, during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, M. uniflora occurred in the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. Uncontrolled deforestation and amber mining have led to intense habitat destruction and decline of species populations. Each local population of this species in Ukraine needs to be protected. Moneses uniflora is to be included to the next edition of the Red Data Book of Ukraine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEricaceae 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus sylvestris 3aamber 3aanthropogenic activities 3adecline 3adeforestation 3aflora 3aforest steppe 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3amosses and liverworts 3arare species 3aEastern European region 3aUkraine 0ahabitat 0amoneses uniflora 0apopulation 0aprotection 0aukraine1 aBaransky, A.R.1 aLevon, A.F.0 tUkrai̤nskyĭ botanychnyĭ zhurnal.g2022 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.91-102dM.G.Kholodny Institute of BotanywJournal:20721x2415-88607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15407/ukrbotj79.02.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010300168300001600271520135100287592002801638650001801666650003101684650001001715650001101725650001401736650001101750650002501761651001201786651001101798651001901809653003301828653002001861653002901881700002901910700001801939773007701957856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60096923720221122041132.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJennings, Mark10aIrish passenger transport: Data refinements, international comparisons, and decomposition analysis  ap. 151-164.  aOne of the most notable outcomes of Ireland's recent spectacular rise in income was an apparent 140% increase in domestic passenger transport fuel use from 1990 to 2008, at the same time as the car stock has more than doubled in magnitude. However, there have been very few comparisons and decomposition analyses of the data underlying this increase in travel. This paper addresses this gap by (i) refining passenger transport data estimates, in particular improving existing estimates of passenger-kilometre data, (ii) comparing trends in Irish private car ownership, usage, and activity to international historical trajectories, and (iii) performing a decomposition analysis of Irish passenger transport using the Refined Laspeyres Method. The international comparison indicates that Ireland's per capita private car usage and car activity have followed intermediate trajectories relative to the historical paths of Sweden and the UK. These trajectories of car usage and activity have contributed to the growth in fuel use, and the Refined Laspeyres decomposition formally decomposes the factors accounting for this growth. Activity was the main driver of the increase in fuel use, although intensity also contributed significantly. Despite decreasing load factors and average annual distances in cars, activity has continued to rise each year.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3aincome 3aownership 3atravel 3avehicles (equipment) 3aIreland 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom 0aPassenger transport fuel use 0aData refinement 0aRefined Laspeyres Method1 aÓ Gallachóir, Brian P.1 aSchipper, Lee0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 May, v. 56 p.151-164dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015200173300001600325520170500341592002802046650002702074650000902101650002602110650001302136650002102149650001202170650003902182650001702221650001302238650001202251650001902263650001302282650001302295650001502308653002702323653001202350653001902362653004102381653001502422700002402437700002102461700002502482700002302507700001602530700002502546700001702571773013202588856009002720852000902810655001202819IND60628534420221121065621.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062853442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHøiby, Niels10aFormation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibition zone during tobramycin disk diffusion is due to transition from planktonic to biofilm mode of growth  ap. 564-573.  aPseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (tobramycin MIC = 0.064 µg/mL) was used to perform agar diffusion tests employing tobramycin-containing tablets. Bacterial growth and formation of inhibition zones were studied by stereomicroscopy and by blotting with microscope slides and staining with methylene blue, Alcian blue and a fluorescent lectin for the P. aeruginosa PSL, which was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Diffusion of tobramycin from the deposit was modelled using a 3D geometric version of Fick's second law of diffusion. The time-dependent gradual increase in the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was studied using a Calgary Biofilm Device. The early inhibition zone was visible after 5 h of incubation. The corresponding calculated tobramycin concentration at the border was 1.9 µg/mL, which increased to 3.2 µg/mL and 6.3 µg/mL after 7 h and 24 h, respectively. The inhibition zone increased to the stable final zone after 7 h of incubation. Bacterial growth and small aggregate formation (young biofilms) took place inside the inhibition zone until the small aggregates contained less than ca. 64 cells and production of polysaccharide matrix including PSL had begun; thereafter, the small bacterial aggregates were killed by tobramycin. Bacteria at the border of the stable inhibition zone and beyond continued to grow to a mature biofilm and produced large amount of polysaccharide-containing matrix. Formation of the inhibition zone during agar diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing is due to a switch from a planktonic to biofilm mode of growth and gives clinically important information about the increased antimicrobial tolerance of biofilms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aagar 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abiofilm 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3alectins 3amethylene blue 3aplankton 3astaining 3atobramycin 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aBiofilm 0aAgar diffusion 0aAntimicrobial susceptibility testing 0aTobramycin1 aHenneberg, Kaj-Åge1 aWang, Hengshuang1 aStavnsbjerg, Camilla1 aBjarnsholt, Thomas1 aCiofu, Oana1 aJohansen, Ulla Rydal1 aSams, Thomas0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.564-573dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245006900178300001600247500000900263520133600272592002801608650001601636650001501652650002401667650001001691650002001701650002601721650002201747700001701769773012301786852000901909856009701918655001202015IND9303451320221118013555.0191122e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930345132DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300050028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenner, K.

Merr.] production. SOYHERB is a computer program developed to assist Cooperative Extension Service personnel, agribusiness, farmers, and teachers in determining herbicide options for soybean production. Tillage practices, atrazine (6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) or simazine (6-chloro-N,N'diethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) use in a previous corn crop, soil type and percentage of organic matter, soil pH, projected crop rotation plans, method of herbicide application, and weed species and weed pressure are entered by the user. SOYHERB generates herbicide programs and their cost per acre that provide excellent control of all weed species at the weed pressures indicated. Fair (80–90%) weed control options may also be generated. Additional screens describe control of perennial weeds, a summary of herbicide premixes, and a table listing the maximum height of broadleaf weeds controlled by postemergence herbicides. Data can be saved for future reference. A computer capable of running MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 2.1 or greater with a minimum of 512K bytes of RAM is required.

This work aimed to evaluate the journey of antimicrobial–enzyme combination research and to gain insights into its current status and most promising leads. Expert curators annotated and analysed all published experimental data on enzyme-containing combinations for two major biofilm-forming pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. This entailed the construction of the first publicly accessible online database on antimicrobial–enzyme combinations, the Antimicrobial Enzyme Combinations Database (https://www.ceb.uminho.pt/aecd). Gathered data were also reconstructed as knowledge networks to help analyse and visualise annotated entities (e.g. enzymes, methods, strains, combination outputs). The database currently holds 122 and 206 annotated combinations for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively, and their analysis allowed a systematic review of the available evidence on enzyme combinations, reliably illustrating the studies being performed. The most tested enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, DNase, lysostaphin) were scrutinised and the rationale behind each combination was explained. This research area is still growing although current research gaps/opportunities were identified, such as lack of biofilm testing and studies on polymicrobial scenarios. Hopefully, this work will shed light on the synergistic potential of enzyme combinations and alleviate some of the time- and resource-consuming tasks related to enzyme combination research by helping the selection and design of new enzyme-related therapeutic options for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3adatabases 3adeoxyribonucleases 3alysostaphin 3alysozyme 3apathogens 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 0aAntimicrobial combinations 0aEnzymes 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aDatabase1 aAlves, Diana1 aPereira, Maria Olívia0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.598-605dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001800282520106200300536022501362592002801587596009801615650001601713650001601729650001801745650001201763650001601775650002101791650001001812650001901822650001201841650001801853653002501871653001901896653002001915653001701935653002301952700001501975700001601990773011302006856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60608783520221120153032.0180809e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060878352DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2017.14212202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhenshan10aEffects of different drying methods on the extraction rate and qualities of oils from demucilaged flaxseed  ap. 1642-1652.  aEffects of different drying methods, i.e., oven drying, freeze drying, vacuum drying, and microwave drying, on the extraction rate and qualities of oil extracted from demucilaged flaxseed were investigated. The results show that microwave drying and freeze drying have higher extraction rate and yield (46.36 and 46.16% vs. 33.90%) of oil compared with native flaxseed. The oil extracted from dried flaxseed, especially the one freeze dried, had higher peroxide value (21.63 vs. 6.15 meq/kg) and specific ultraviolet extinction at 232 nm (4.56 vs. 3.67) and 268 nm (1.23 vs. 1.12), as well as a shorter induction time (1.8 vs. 3.3 h) than the one from native sample. Demucilaging and drying have no significant effect on fatty acid composition of flaxseed oil. However, these processes increased the content of total phenols and total sterols while reduced the content of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment. In addition, the oil extracted from vacuum dried flaxseed contained more tocols when compared with native sample (447.29 vs. 370.99 mg/kg).  aResearch support was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31101367), high-level talent fund of Henan University of Technology (No. 2011BS012), China agriculture research system (CARS14-1-29).  aPublisher supplied data  a31101367cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3afreeze drying 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3amicrowave drying 3aovens 3aperoxide value 3asterols 3avacuum drying 0aDemucilaged flaxseed 0adrying methods 0aextraction rate 0aflaxseed oil 0aquality properties1 aLiu, Yulan1 aChe, Liming0 tDrying technology.g2018 Oct. 3, v. 36, no. 13 p.1642-1652dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2017.14212203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002400153245010700177300001400284520156100298592002801859650002601887650002101913650003001934650001101964650002701975650001302002650001502015650001302030650001002043650001202053650002602065650001402091650001302105650002102118651001002139700001802149700001902167700002402186700001902210773008402229856008902313852000902402655001202411IND4492506820221119142117.0150808e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449250682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Saurabh10aRetrospective analysis of vivax malaria patients presenting to tertiary referral centre of Uttarakhand  ap. 82-85.  aINTRODUCTION: Despite the high prevalence of Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) malaria, research into its complications has lagged disproportionately as compared to Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum) malaria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted on cases with P vivax mono-infection presenting with severe malaria on the basis of one or more criteria as per the World Health Organization guidelines being used for severe falciparum malaria in children, as well as other manifestations been classified as complicated malaria, during an outbreak of malaria in a single tertiary referral hospital of north India. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients of acute malaria presented during the outbreak, of which 50 cases with P vivax mono-infection were included for the study. Complicated malaria was diagnosed in 41/50 cases, with thrombocytopenia being the commonest manifestation. Other presentations of severe malaria in our patients were liver dysfunction (with or without jaundice) 31/50 cases, respiratory involvement 14/50 cases, renal impairment 11/50 cases, circulatory collapse (Shock) 8/50 cases, severe anaemia 3/50 cases and central nervous system (CNS) involvement 2/50 cases. CONCLUSION: The term “benign tertian malaria” no longer holds true for P vivax mono-infection. The authors wish to open a new front for researches on the possible genotypic abnormalities that the parasite or its carrier might have acquired over decades and has transformed into a species with the malignant potential of P falciparum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanemia 3acentral nervous system 3achildren 3aguidelines 3ajaundice 3aliver 3amalaria 3aobservational studies 3aparasites 3apatients 3athrombocytopenia 3aIndia1 aAhmad, Sohaib1 aShirazi, Nadia1 aKumar Verma, Sanjiv1 aPuri, Prashant0 tActa tropica.g2011 Feb., v. 117, no. 2 p.82-85dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245018400162300001600346520187900362592002802241650001002269650003102279650001902310650002802329650002602357650001402383650001402397650001402411650001502425650002302440650001802463650001102481650002002492650002002512650004902532650002002581650001402601650002102615650001302636653001402649653001702663653002802680653000902708653000802717700001902725700001802744700001702762700001902779773014502798856008302943852000903026655001203035IND60592536120221120044345.0190725e20180505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059253612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bei10aBigelovin, a sesquiterpene lactone, suppresses tumor growth through inducing apoptosis and autophagy via the inhibition of mTOR pathway regulated by ROS generation in liver cancer  ap. 156-163.  aBigelovin (BigV) is a sesquiterpene lactone, isolated from Inula helianthus aquatica, which has been reported to induce apoptosis and show anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities. Nevertheless, the effects of BigV on liver cancer and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. In the study, we found that BigV exhibited potential anti-tumor activities against human liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. BigV reduced the cell proliferation and colony formation. BigV induced apoptosis through improving the cleavage of Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). The process was along with the activation of autophagy, as proved by the enhanced accumulation of autophagosomes, the microtubule-associated light chain 3B-II (LC3B-II) and Beclin-1, and p62 decrease. Further, the autophagy blockage markedly sensitized BigV-induced cell death, indicating the cytoprotective function of autophagy in liver cancer cell lines. In addition, BigV treatment inactivated the pathway of protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). Of note, BigV-induced cell death was abolished by over-expressing the phosphorylation of mTOR. Intriguingly, the induction of apoptosis and autophagy were eliminated by the pretreatment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), suggesting that ROS played an important role in the regulation of BigV-induced cell death. Finally, in vivo studies demonstrated that BigV significantly suppressed the growth of HepG2 cancer xenograft tumors through the activation of apoptosis and autophagy in a dose-dependent manner with low systemic toxicity. In conclusion, the results revealed that BigV had significant antitumor effects against human liver cancer and it may potentially be used as a novel antitumor agent for the prevention of liver cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInula 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3aacetylcysteine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acaspase-3 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3adose response 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3aliver neoplasms 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3arapamycin 3asesquiterpenoids 3atoxicity 0aBigelovin 0aLiver cancer 0aApoptosis and autophagy 0amTOR 0aROS1 aZhou, Tan-Yang1 aNie, Chun-Hui1 aWan, Da-Long1 aZheng, Shu-Sen0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 05, v. 499, no. 2 p.156-163dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010400176300001600280520081400296592002801110650003001138650001901168650001601187650002001203650002101223650002401244650001001268650001601278650001301294650002901307651001301336653003001349653001601379653001501395653001701410653002101427653001801448700002401466700006201490700002601552700002601578700002101604700002601625773013201651856009001783852000901873655001201882IND60628534720221121044103.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062853472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirakul, Sunisa10aBurkholderia pseudomallei acquired ceftazidime resistance due to gene duplication and amplification  ap. 582-588.  aCeftazidime (CAZ) is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection (melioidosis). The chromosomally-encoded PenA β-lactamase possesses weak cephalosporinase activity. The wild-type penA gene confers clinically significant CAZ resistance only when overexpressed due to a promoter mutation, transcriptional antitermination or by gene duplication and amplification (GDA). Here we characterise a reversible 33-kb GDA event involving wild-type penA in a CAZ-resistant B. pseudomallei clinical isolate from Thailand. We show that duplication arises from exchanges between short (<10 bp) chromosomal sequences, which in this example consist of 4-bp repeats flanked by 3-bp inverted repeats. GDA involving β-lactamases may be a common CAZ resistance mechanism in B. pseudomallei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3abeta-lactamase 3aceftazidime 3aenzyme activity 3agene duplication 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amelioidosis 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aThailand 0aBurkholderia pseudomallei 0aCeftazidime 0aResistance 0aβ-Lactamase 0aGene duplication 0aAmplification1 aSomprasong, Nawarat1 aNorris, Michael H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5285-04321 aWuthiekanun, Vanaporn1 aChantratita, Narisara1 aTuanyok, Apichai1 aSchweizer, Herbert P.0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.582-588dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013800159300001800297520128300315592002801598650000801626650001101634650002001645650001701665650001101682650001401693650000901707650004301716650001001759650001101769653001201780653001901792653001101811653001101822700001901833700002001852700001401872700001901886700001901905700001101924773015401935856007902089852000902168655001202177IND60609487120221120133741.0200427e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060948712DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-144082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Liang10aSimultaneous identification of bovine and equine DNA in milks and dairy products inferred from triplex TaqMan real-time PCR technique  ap. 6776-6786.  aKoumiss is a popular dairy product in many lands, traditionally prepared from mare milk with spontaneous fermentation. Mare milk and its fermented derivates are more expensive than cow milk and its fermented derivates, and the possibility exists for producers and dealers to adulterate equine products with bovine items. In this work, we described the development of a triplex real-time PCR based on species-specific TaqMan probes for identification of bovine and equine DNA in milks and dairy products. In addition, a novel designed endogenous control was simultaneously amplified to eliminate possible false negatives. With this methodology, bovine and equine DNA were specifically identified by employing developed primers and probes. The limits of detection of this method were 0.001 ng for cow milk, yogurt, and mare milk, and 0.005 ng for sour soup and koumiss, respectively. In addition, the triplex real-time PCR assay for authentication of animal-derived products was effectively validated using binary DNA and milk mixtures, exhibiting well in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. In short, the triplex PCR assay was verified to be a time-saving and money-saving technique for the identification of bovine and equine DNA in milks and dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acattle 3adetection limit 3afermentation 3ahorses 3amare milk 3amilk 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoups 3ayogurt 0atriplex 0aidentification 0abovine 0aequine1 aQian, Jun-Ping1 aGuo, Yuan-Sheng1 aHai, Xiao1 aLiu, Guo-Qiang1 aLuo, Jian-Xing1 aYamei,0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.6776-6786dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-144083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013900174300001600313520166500329592002801994650001802022650001502040650001502055650001202070650001302082650001802095650001202113650001302125650002002138650001002158650001902168650001302187650001002200650000902210653003602219653002102255653002102276653001902297653002402316700002702340700002002367700001902387700002002406700002302426773012302449856008802572852000902660655001202669IND60611502220221121051533.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061150222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrara, Roberto13aAn automated approach for wood-leaf separation from terrestrial LIDAR point clouds using the density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN  ap. 434-444.  aThe terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technique has been recently used to provide 3D structural information of forest canopy at the individual tree level. However, the operational use of Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for canopy characterization of broadleaf non-deciduous forests needs further investigations. The estimation of wood volume, above-ground woody biomass, tree canopy characteristics and leaf area index often requires separation of photosynthetically active material and non-photosynthetically active material. This article describes an automated wood-leaves separation method, based on spatial geometric information of TLS point clouds, for broad leaved non-deciduous trees. Scans of seven individuals of Quercus suber L. trees were acquired by using the TLS phase-based Leica HDS6100. Point clouds were partitioned in cubic volumes (voxels) that were used as input to generate clusters through the point density algorithm DBSCAN. The clustering process led to the identification of wood and non-wood voxels. A specific automatic routine was written to process data from the point clouds to the visualization of clustering results. The analysis of results showed good performance for this approach, with the overall accuracy in classifying wood components of trees ranging from 95% to 97%. The largest accuracies were observed for branches larger than 5 cm in diameter whereas the accuracy of classification dropped, as expected, for branches with diameter lower than 3 cm.The results suggest that the proposed method can be conveniently used to extract woody components from point clouds of broad leaved non-deciduous trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus suber 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3abiomass 3abranches 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3ageometry 3aleaf area index 3alidar 3aphotosynthesis 3ascanners 3atrees 3awood 0aTerrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) 0aQuercus suber L. 0aBroadleaf forest 0aTree structure 0aAboveground biomass1 aVirdis, Salvatore G.P.1 aVentura, Andrea1 aGhisu, Tiziano1 aDuce, Pierpaolo1 aPellizzaro, Grazia0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 262 p.434-444dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010100155300001600256500002000272520153400292592002801826596003001854650001801884650002001902650002501922650002401947650001001971650002101981650002502002650001602027650001402043650001602057650001902073650001102092650002002103650002102123700001502144700001402159700001402173773012202187856007402309852000902383655001202392IND60786983920221120033620.0220807e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698392DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, M.10aComparison of nine different methods to assess fish communities in lentic flood‐plain habitats  ap. 144-174.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study compares the effectiveness and representativeness of electrofishing, snorkelling, seining, baited lift netting, multi‐mesh gillnetting, baited fish traps, fyke netting, angling and longline fishing, considering three typical lentic flood‐plain habitats at different times of day. Electrofishing was by far the most effective method yielding highest species richness, species trait representation and catch per unit of effort (CPUE), followed by seining. For single species like dace Leuciscus leuciscus, European ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua, common bream Abramis brama and silver bream Blicca bjoerkna, seining was more effective than electrofishing. With both methods, some species were more consistently caught during night, dusk or dawn than during daylight. All other methods tested cannot be generally recommended for fish community assessments in shallow backwaters due to their low representativeness of species inventory and generally low CPUE. Based on these results, electrofishing of 30 m transect replicates at different times of day for monitoring the fish community in shallow backwaters, can be recommended, enabling the maximum possible comparability to adjacent river habitats. Seining should be considered as an alternative if accessibility of habitats is restricted or electrofishing is prohibited. The 25 species detected in the backwaters also suggest that these habitats contribute a large proportion of fish diversity and should be included in standard assessments of river ecological status.  aPublisher supplied data  cVerbund Innkraftweke GmbH 3aAbramis brama 3aBlicca bjoerkna 3aGymnocephalus cernua 3aLeuciscus leuciscus 3abream 3afish communities 3afisheries statistics 3afloodplains 3afyke nets 3ainventories 3alentic systems 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3aspecies richness1 aPander, J.1 aKnott, J.1 aGeist, J.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2017 July, v. 91, no. 1 p.144-174dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.133333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245017000184300001400354520134700368592002801715650001301743650001401756650001501770650001801785650001501803650001501818650001401833650002001847650001101867650001301878650002101891650002801912650002601940650003201966650003501998650001902033650004102052700002602093700002102119700002702140700002802167700002602195773012302221856008102344852000902425655001202434IND50090086620221119031904.0151123e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008662DNAL7 a248454242pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1292-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidal, Tânia10aToxicity Testing with the Benthic Diatom Navicula libonensis (Schoeman 1970): Procedure Optimisation and Assessment of the Species Sensitivity to Reference Chemicals  ap. 71-77.  aPeriphytic communities are good indicators of river quality due to their general sensitivity to several pollutants. The primary objective of this study was to develop and optimize an ecotoxicological testing methodology using the freshwater benthic diatom Navicula libonensis. This species was selected due to its ubiquity and suitability for use under laboratory conditions. In the most suitable test medium (Chu10) the diatom demonstrated comparable sensitivity to potassium dichromate and 3,5-dichlorophenol using growth rate as the reference parameter, with median effect concentrations (EᵣC₅₀) in the same order of magnitude (0.119 and 0.799 mg L⁻¹) respectively. Yield-based estimates did not confirm this pattern and potassium dichromate was one order of magnitude more toxic than 3,5-dichlorophenol. The sensitivity of N. libonensis to the reference chemicals was higher than that published in the literature for several standard planktonic microalgae. This advantage, as well as the ability to grow the species in the laboratory, supports further efforts towards the standardisation of a toxicity testing protocol. In addition, the functional role of benthic diatoms in lotic ecosystems justifies their inclusion in risk assessment test batteries to better cover an environmental compartment that has so far been neglected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNavicula 3abatteries 3afreshwater 3alotic systems 3amicroalgae 3apollutants 3apotassium 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 2aChlorophenolsxtoxicity 2aDiatomsxdrug effects 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aPotassium Dichromatextoxicity 2aToxicity Tests 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aPereira, Joana Luísa1 aAbrantes, Nelson1 aAlmeida, Salomé F.

However, there exist a few drawbacks for this type of gels, including significant syneresis and inferior gel strength, etc. In this study, due to relatively strong alkali resistance, xanthan was selected to be incorporated into KGM sol systems, and the composite KGM/xanthan systems were then allowed to gel by subjecting to a protocol consisting of incubating at 90 °C for 2 h and then cooling to room temperature. It was found that the gelation process consisted of two steps: during incubation at 90 °C, KGM gel network was predominantly formed, and the incorporation of xanthan caused a slower gelling rate of the KGM gel network. In the subsequent cooling process, xanthan synergistically bound with the KGM network, thereby strengthening the composite gels, with the binding process beginning at ~60 °C. When the KGM/xanthan ratio was 7:3, the highest gel strength (~1200 g) of the composite gel was obtained, which is much higher than the pure KGM gel (KGM/xanthan ratio 10:0, and the gel strength was ~44 g). Moreover, xanthan addition also decreased the syneresis rate of the composite gels during freeze-thaw treatment. Overall, the present study highlighted an applicable way to tailor the physical properties of KGM gels by co-incubating a composite KGM/xanthan system in the presence of alkali.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3akonjac mannan 3axanthan gum 0aComposite gels 0aGel properties 0aPolysaccharide 0aSyneresis1 aLi, Anqi1 aLi, Dan1 aLi, Xiaofei1 aLi, Peiyuan1 aSun, Lijun1 aGuo, Yurong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Sept., v. 106 p.105870-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010000175300001800275520071500293592002801008650001301036650002501049650001301074650001301087650001901100650001201119650001901131650001901150650002301169651001001192653003001202653001801232653001501250653001801265653002601283700001901309700001901328700001901347700002501366700002201391700002601413700002201439700002001461700002701481773010601508856008401614852000901698655001201707IND60122269420221120235838.0150325e20141018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226942DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9403492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenditti, Alessandro10aVolatile compounds from Achillea tenorii (Grande) growing in the Majella National Park (Italy).  ap. 1699-1704.  aThis work presents the first reported phytochemical study on the hydro-distilled essential oil from Achillea tenorii (Grande), collected in the protected area of Majella National Park (Italy).

They produce a great amount of biomass, and also are of great interest because of the ecosystem services they provide from which carbon storage stands out. This work aims to study the energy and mass exchanged by a salt marsh located in southeastern Buenos Aires province (Argentina) and to characterize its net ecosystem production. A field campaign was carried out from February 2014 to March 2015. Sensible heat, water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with eddy covariance technique at 6 m height over a Spartina densiflora canopy. Fifty five percent of the data were lost and 15% more were discarded due to low turbulence conditions. This gaps were filled with a combination of techniques (look-up tables and mean diurnal variations), which allowed the estimation of monthly mean net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. As in other marshes, the latent heat flux consumed more than 55% of the available energy of the system, reaching up to 85% after a large flood event. This flux systematically exceeds the values of sensible heat measured throughout the study period. Unlike other environments, this southern salt marsh behaved as a CO2 sink throughout the year. The net ecosystem production from March 2014 to February 2015 was approximately −10.5 t of CO2 ha−1 yr−1 which is greater than reported results for other wetlands. These preliminary results for a southern S. densiflora salt marsh are encouraging, although new field studies are under way to confirm their accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina densiflora 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anet ecosystem production 3aprimary productivity 3asalt marshes 3aturbulent flow 3aurban development 3awater vapor 3aArgentina 0aSalt marsh 0aEddy covariance 0aEnergy and mass fluxes 0aNet ecosystem exchange 0aArgentina1 aGassmann, María I.1 aPérez, Claudio F.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 263 p.59-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170520142900269592002801698650002501726650002401751650001601775650001201791650001001803650001201813650002201825650001701847650001901864650001901883650002401902650000901926650001401935650002201949650001901971650003801990650003202028700001702060700001202077700001802089700001402107700001902121700005402140700001802194700001402212773010302226856008602329852000902415655001202424IND60696297420221117190220.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069629742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1042632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Wenxiao10aExposure time determines the protective effect of Trichinella spiralis on experimental colitis  aSeveral studies demonstrate the protective effect of Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) on autoimmune diseases, however the optimal exposure time remains unexplored. This study aimed to determine whether pre-exposure of mice to T. spiralis conferred greater protection than introduction of the parasite in the acute phase of experimental colitis. We compared the effect of T. spiralis on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis using two exposure paradigms: introduction three weeks prior to, or immediately after the induction period. Inflammation scores, morphological changes and cytokine profiles in serum and colonic tissue were assessed. At a parasite dose of 300 cysts, post exposure had a more pronounced effect on cytokine profiles, improved gross appearance of colon tissue, and reduced inflammatory symptoms. In addition, we demonstrate that regardless of cyst number, pre-exposure to T. spiralis did not confer protective benefits when compared to parasite introduction in the acute phase of DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, our data indicates that the underlying mechanisms of action involve an IL-17/TNF-alpha synergistic reaction, suppression of Th1 and Th2 responses, and an upregulation of the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta 1. Our results demonstrate that moderate exposure to T. spiralis in the acute phase of DSS-induced colitis improves disease associated inflammation and tissue disruption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aautoimmune diseases 3ablood serum 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3aexposure duration 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aparasites 3aprotective effect 3asodium sulfate 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMa, Zhenrong1 aSun, Xi1 aHuang, Yehong1 aLü, Bin,1 aChen, Xiaogang1 aXue, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4704-18141 aYang, Xuexian1 aWu, Xiang0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Oct., v. 147 p.104263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1042633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04307naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245015100178300001800329520244200347592002802789650001302817650002702830650001802857650002202875650001502897650001802912650001302930650001102943650001402954650001202968650001302980650002302993650001903016650002203035650003803057650007403095650001203169650002803181650003603209650003503245650004903280650001103329650004103340650002003381650004503401700001603446700001603462700001703478700001803495700001803513773010003531856007703631852000903708655001203717IND60083427420221123043209.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008342742DNAL7 a228843422pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-52302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaque, M.N.10aMilk protein synthesis in response to the provision of an “ideal” amino acid profile at 2 levels of metabolizable protein supply in dairy cows  ap. 5876-5887.  aProviding a well-balanced supply of essential AA (EAA) can serve as an opportunity to reduce the protein intake for dairy cows by increasing the efficiency of metabolizable protein (or PDIE, its equivalent in the INRA feeding system) utilization for milk protein yield. Our objectives were to compare the effect of supplying an “ideal” EAA profile (EAA+) with an imbalanced AA profile (control) at 2 levels of PDIE/NEL (net energy for lactation) supplies to study the interaction between PDIE and AA profiles, and to compare this ideal profile with a simple mixture of the 4most deficient EAA (4EAA) in the diets of dairy cows. Six lactating multiparous Holstein cows received 6 treatments with 2 different levels of PDIE supplied by diets and AA infusions in the duodenum according to a changeover design with 3-wk periods. Within each PDIE supply level, the cows received 3 different AA infusions in the duodenum according to a 3×3 Latin square design with 1-wk subperiods, which corresponded to the following treatment groups: control (Glu), 4EAA (Lys, Met, His, Leu), and EAA+ (4EAA plus Ile, Val, Phe, Trp, and Tyr). In the low and high PDIE treatments, diets and infusions provided 54.7 and 64.0g/Mcal of PDIE/NEL, respectively, which corresponded to crude protein levels of 13.6 and 15.2%, respectively. High-PDIE supplies increased the milk protein yield by 163g/d, the milk protein content by 1.4g/kg, the milk yield by 4.1kg/d, and the lactose yield by 178g/d and decreased the PDIE efficiency of utilization by 12.4%, whereas the N efficiency of utilization remained unaffected. Supplying the 2 EAA profiles (4EAA and EAA+) increased the milk protein yield by 67g/d, the milk protein content by 1.3g/kg, and the milk yield by 0.9kg/d, whereas the milk fat and milk lactose contents were decreased by 2.4 and 1.6g/kg, respectively. The responses regarding milk yield and its composition were similar whether the cows received the 4EAA or the EAA+ treatment. The responses were similar for the milk yield and composition whether the EAA were supplied by low- or high-PDIE supplies. In conclusion, the efficiency of PDIE utilization was improved by 6.6% and the N efficiency was improved by 7.0% by correcting the EAA profiles, independent of the level of PDIE supplied. In addition, the increased efficiency observed, associated with provision of the 4EAA, was similar to the provision of all EAA (EAA+) in this experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aamino acid composition 3acrude protein 3adairy consumption 3adairy cows 3adairy protein 3aduodenum 3aenergy 3alactation 3alactose 3amilk fat 3amilk protein yield 3aprotein intake 3aprotein synthesis 2aAmino Acidsxbloodxpharmacology. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism.1 aRulquin, H.1 aAndrade, A.1 aFaverdin, P.1 aPeyraud, J.L.1 aLemosquet, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.5876-5887dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-52303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245014100213300001400354520162600368592002801994650000902022650001502031650002102046650001002067650002302077650002702100650002602127650001302153650001302166650001302179650002502192650001402217650002202231650002502253650001202278650001102290651001002301653003202311653001902343653001902362653001502381653002202396653003402418700001602452700005702468700005302525700001802578700002302596773012102619856008802740852000902828655001202837IND60611502620221121034615.0190606e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061150262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabloun, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1199-131610aSensitivity of simulated crop yield and nitrate leaching of the wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain to model parameters  ap. 25-40.  aProcess-based crop simulation models are often over-parameterised and are therefore difficult to calibrate properly. Following this rationale, the Morris screening sensitivity method was carried out on the DAISY model to identify the most influential input parameters operating on selected model outputs, i.e. crop yield, grain nitrogen (N), evapotranspiration and N leaching. The results obtained refer to the winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. In this study, four different N fertiliser treatments over six years were considered based on a randomised field experiment at Luancheng Experimental Station to elucidate the impact of weather and nitrogen inputs on model sensitivity. A total of 128 parameters were considered for the sensitivity analysis. The ratios [output changes/parameter increments] demonstrated high standard deviations for the most relevant parameters, indicating high parameter non-linearity/interactions. In general, about 34 parameters influenced the outputs of the DAISY model for both crops. The most influential parameters depended on the output considered with sensitivity patterns consistent with the expected dominant processes. Interestingly, some parameters related to the previous crop were found to affect output variables of the following crop, illustrating the importance of considering crop sequences for model calibration. The developed RDAISY toolbox used in this study can serve as a basis for following sensitivity analysis of the DAISY model, thus enabling the selection of the most influential parameters to be considered with model calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aevapotranspiration 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aleaching 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ascreening 3asimulation models 3astatistical analysis 3aweather 3awinter 3aChina 0aMorris sensitivity analysis 0aCrop modelling 0aRDAISY toolbox 0aCrop yield 0aNitrogen leaching 0aWheat - maize cropping system1 aLi, Xiaoxin1 aZhang, Xiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2850-502X1 aTao, Fulu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8576-40121 aHu, Chunsheng1 aOlesen, Jørgen E.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 263 p.25-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013500164300001600299520184000315592002802155650004402183650002202227650001302249650002102262650001702283650001402300650001302314650001702327650001702344650001202361650001302373650002302386650001402409650002202423650001702445650002602462650000902488650001502497650001402512650001302526650001202539650002002551650002102571650002302592653001702615653002702632653001302659653002302672700001802695700001902713700001402732700001502746700001902761700001802780700001802798700001402816700001602830773013602846856008702982852000903069655001203078IND60649472920221119063649.0190822e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.2452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao10aSilk fibroin/carboxymethyl chitosan hydrogel with tunable biomechanical properties has application potential as cartilage scaffold  ap. 382-391.  aTissue engineering is a promising strategy for cartilage repair and regeneration. However, an ideal scaffolding material that not only mimics the biomechanical properties of the native cartilage, but also supports the chondrogenic phenotype of the seeding cells is in need. In this study, we developed a silk fibroin (SF) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) composite hydrogel with enzymatic cross-links (horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide) and β-sheet cross-links (ethanol treatment). Results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified that SF/CMCS composite hydrogels had a tunable β-sheet structure. Therefore, by increasing the time of ethanol treatment from 0 h to 8 h, a series of parameters including pore size (from 50 to 300 μm), equilibrium swelling (from 78.1 ± 2.6% to 91.9 ± 0.9%), degradation (from 100% to 9% reduction in mass over 56 days), rheological properties (storage modulus from 177 Pa to 88,904 Pa), and mechanical properties (compressive modulus from 13 to 829 kPa) of the hydrogels were adjusted. In particular, the material parameters of the hydrogels with 2 h ethanol treatment appeared most suitable for engineered cartilage. Furthermore, the in vitro cellular experiments showed that the hydrogels supported the adhesion, proliferation, glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and chondrogenic phenotype of rabbit articular chondrocytes. Finally, subcutaneous implantation of the hydrogels in mice showed no infections or local inflammatory responses, indicating a good biocompatibility in vivo. In conclusion, the chemical-physical cross-linking SF/CMCS composite hydrogels, with tunable material properties and degradation rate, good biocompatibility, are promising scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiomechanics 3acartilage 3achitosan 3achondrocytes 3acrosslinking 3aethanol 3afibroins 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainflammation 3amechanical properties 3amice 3aperoxidase 3aphenotype 3aporosity 3arabbits 3astorage modulus 3athermogravimetry 3atissue engineering 0aSilk fibroin 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan 0aHydrogel 0aCartilage scaffold1 aSong, Xiongbo1 aWeng, Changmei1 aWang, Xin1 aGu, Liling1 aGong, Xiaoyuan1 aWei, Quanfang1 aDuan, Xiaojun1 aYang, Liu1 aChen, Cheng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 137 p.382-391dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.2453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169520105600272592002801328650002101356650002601377650002601403650002901429650002101458650001901479650002501498650001801523650002601541650001801567650000901585650001201594650001401606650002101620653002301641653001101664653001701675653001601692700001701708700002201725700001601747700001901763700002001782773010301802856008601905852000901991655001202000IND60686879920221119234302.0200515e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068687992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorcino, L.B.10aPectin films loaded with copaiba oil nanoemulsions for potential use as bio-based active packaging  aThe objective of this study was to prepare pectin films (PEC) activated by copaiba oil (CP) nanoemulsions (NE). CP-NE were added to film-forming formulations based on pectin and then dried into films by continuous casting. Chemical, morphological, thermal, mechanical and antimicrobial properties were studied in addition to biodegradability by the respirometer test. In general, the nanoemulsions were suitably dispersed in the PEC matrix, both phases showing good interaction and compatibility. The nanoemulsions caused large changes in PEC, such as increased roughness with oil concentration, gradual reduction of the elastic modulus and tensile strength, increased elongation at break, and antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Another important observation was the maintenance of the biodegradation profile of the films after the addition of CP-NE. In conclusion, the active pectin film manufactured with CP emulsions showed great potential for active food packaging and is a promising alternative to reduce environmental impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aactive food packaging 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrocolloids 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3apectins 3aroughness 3atensile strength 0aBiodegradable film 0aPectin 0aNanoemulsion 0aCopaiba oil1 aMendes, J.F.1 aNatarelli, C.V.L.1 aManrich, A.1 aOliveira, Jé,1 aMattoso, L.H.C.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Sept., v. 106 p.105862-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006700171300001700238520224400255592002802499650001602527650001202543650001102555650001702566650001102583650002902594650001902623650002502642650001602667653001802683653001602701653002702717700002102744700002002765700002202785773009002807856008502897852000902982655001202991IND60629977120221117234516.0200607e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062997712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjørndal, Endre10aStochastic electricity dispatch: A challenge for market design  ap. 992-1005.  aWe consider an energy-only electricity market where some generation and/or load is uncertain, and where there are flexibility costs, i.e. some conventional power plants have to be scheduled well before real time in order to participate in the dispatch, while for others, additional cost incurs if generation plans have to be adjusted close to real time.In practice, electricity markets are often organized with sequential market clearing, and in this paper, we consider two sequential markets, for instance representing a day-ahead and a real-time market. We compare the outcomes of 1) a stochastic market clearing model, i.e. an integrated model that takes into account both markets and the uncertainty, to 2) a myopic market clearing model, where the first market is cleared based only on given bids, and not taking into account neither the uncertainty nor the bids to the second market.Compared to previous literature, our main contribution is that we compare the two different market models with respect to both efficiency and allocation of surplus, and thus the incentives they imply for the market participants. We discuss what information is needed in market agent bids and how that information can be manipulated.While the stochastic market clearing gives a solution with a higher expected social welfare, it poses several challenges for market design. The stochastic dispatch may lead to a dispatch where the day-ahead prices deviate from the bid curves to the first market. This can lead to incentives for self-scheduling, in that it may require market participants to accept prices that deviate from the marginal costs or benefits corresponding to the scheduled quantities. Our analysis shows that the intermittent producer has an incentive to deviate from the system optimal plan in both the myopic and stochastic model, and this incentive is particularly strong under the myopic model. We also discuss how the expected social welfare of the market outcome under stochastic market clearing depends on the quality of the information that the system operator will base the market clearing on. In particular, we show that an intermittent producer may have an incentive to misreport the probability distribution for its generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprices 3aprobability distribution 3asocial welfare 3astochastic processes 3auncertainty 0aMarket design 0aElectricity 0aStochastic programming1 aBjørndal, Mette1 aMidthun, Kjetil1 aTomasgard, Asgeir0 tEnergy.g2018 May 01, v. 150 p.992-1005dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245010900151300001600260500002000276520041900296592002800715596006200743596009700805650003100902650000800933650000900941650001200950700001300962700001300975700001400988700001501002700001201017700001201029700001201041773012201053856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60786984320221120023134.0220807e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698432DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, X.10aComparison of vertical and horizontal swimming behaviour of the weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus  ap. 368-374.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExperiments on the swimming kinetics and behaviour of weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus showed that horizontal swim speed was significantly greater than swim speeds when ascending to or descending from the water surface to gulp air.

The results revealed 6 high‐indicator congener (∑₆PCBIND) levels in 45% of the loggerhead turtles examined, with mean values of 980.39 ± 2508.39 ng/g wet weight in adipose tissue and 102.53 ± 238.58 ng/g wet weight in muscle tissue. The hexachloro and heptachloro PCB congeners were the most abundant in both the sample types. The highest NDL‐PCB levels were reached in an adipose tissue sample of a loggerhead turtle of 80 kg stranded along the coasts of Termini Imerese (14 183.85 ng/g wet wt). No significant correlation was found between modified Fulton's K values of the loggerhead turtles and PCB contents (S = 47 151, p > 0.05). Furthermore, no significant differences were found between sexes (W = 365, p > 0.05). The PCB levels found in the present study were much higher than those found in the literature. The present study is the first report on the existence of NDL‐PCBs in loggerhead turtles stranded in Sicilian coasts confirming C. caretta as a valuable indicator of contaminant exposure in the marine environment because of their specific biological and ecological characteristics.

However, they usually suffer from complicated preparation process and fussy performance regulation, which severely limit their applications in many fields. Herein, we fabricated a physically cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol)-(2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan) (PVA-HACC) DN hydrogels without organic solvents or toxic cross-linking agents via a simple two-step method of freezing/thawing and immersion processing. The effects of immersion time and concentration of Na3Cit solution on the structures and mechanical properties of the hydrogels were investigated. The obtained hydrogels exhibited excellent mechanical properties including high elastic modulus (1.44 MPa), high strength (a maximal tensile fracture stresses of 4.14 MPa and a maximal compressive stresses of over 70 MPa at 98% strain), and superior fracture toughness (17.09 MJ/m3). In addition, good self-recovered property and anti-fatigue performance were realized for the hydrogels owing to the reversible HACC ionic networks. The preparation of PVA-HACC DN hydrogels offers a new guidance for the design and synthesis of environmentally friendly DN hydrogels with outstanding mechanical properties and broad application prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asolvents 3athawing 3atoxicity 0aPhysically cross-linked hydrogel 0aDouble network hydrogel 0aHigh fracture toughness 0aSelf-recovery 0aCytocompatibility1 aXu, Bo1 aZhang, Xiong1 aZhao, Jianhao1 aRong, Jianhua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 137 p.495-503dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015400158300002000312520114900332592002801481650002201509650001201531650001701543650002101560650004401581650001701625650001801642650002501660650001201685650001601697700002101713700001801734700001701752700002001769700001201789700001601801700001401817773012401831856007401955852000902029655001202038IND60667593520221122012151.0190919e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066759352DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06886j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yunxiang10aHigh performance polydimethylsiloxane pervaporative membranes with hyperbranched polysiloxane as a crosslinker for separation of n-butanol from water  ap. 52759-52768.  aHyperbranched polysiloxane (HPSiO) was successfully synthesized by a three-step process. The result of ²⁹Si Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurement indicates that the degree of branching (DB) of HPSiO is 0.73. Then, novel polysiloxane membranes, HPSiO-c-PDMS, were prepared by the cross-linking reaction between HPSiO and α,ω-dihydroxypolydimethylsiloxane (H-PDMS) with different molecular weights. HPSiO-c-PDMS membranes were first used as membrane materials for recovering n-butanol from an aqueous solution by pervaporation (PV). The HPSiO-c-PDMS membranes demonstrated high n-butanol/water selectivity as well as high permeability. As the molecular weight of H-PDMS increased, the selectivity increased and the n-butanol permeability of HPSiO-c-PDMS-2 (with moderate H-PDMS molecular weight) membrane showed the highest value. The effects of temperature and feed concentration on the PV performances were also investigated. The PV performance, n-butanol permeability and n-butanol/water selectivity of the HPSiO-c-PDMS-2 membrane, reached 4.3 × 10⁵ Barrer and 8.75, respectively, with a feed concentration of 1.0 wt% at 30 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abutanol 3acrosslinking 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apermeability 3apervaporation 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aDong, Liangliang1 aLin, Jiaqiang1 aZhu, Yuanhua1 aZhang, Chunfang1 aGu, Jin1 aSun, Yuping1 aXu, Youyi0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 16, v. 5, no. 65 p.52759-52768dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06886j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245010100134300001400235520150700249592002801756650001601784650000801800650001701808650001201825650001101837650000901848650001401857650001901871650002501890650001401915650001901929650001001948653001201958653001701970653001401987653001202001653002902013700002002042700001902062773012902081852000902210655001202219IND60594708120221119105633.0180522e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonnell, Angela10aMultilocus Phylogenetics of New World Milkweed Vines (Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae, Gonolobinae)  ap. 77-96.  aSubtribe Gonolobinae of the cosmopolitan family Apocynaceae is diverse and represents the largest radiation of milkweeds in the New World (∼500 species). The largest genus, Matelea, is an amalgam that was united largely by a perceived lack of discrete morphological variation, particularly in floral structures. Using plastid and nuclear DNA sequences, we estimate a phylogeny of Gonolobinae using four chloroplast loci and three cloned nuclear regions. We investigate themonophyly of Matelea and other established and provisional genera via a series of hypothesis tests. We find variable support and considerable conflict among the gene trees. Despite this, our data confirm the paraphyly of Matelea, while Gonolobus and other segregate genera receive some support as monophyletic assemblages. We attribute conflicting signal in our data primarily to incomplete lineage sorting, a likely result of rapid radiation. Ancestral character reconstructions of growth form, fruit, and corolla morphology reveal a woody twining growth form to be plesiomorphic with one to two transitions to an herbaceous, non-twining growth form followed by one putative reversal to the woody twining growth form in the subtribe. Plesiomorphic states for fruit ornamentation and corolla shape are less clear, and these characters exhibit high levels of homoplasy. This study is one of the most comprehensive phylogenies of gonoloboid milkweeds to date and the first to sample multiple nuclear loci and include allelic data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApocynaceae 3aDNA 3achloroplasts 3acorolla 3afruits 3aloci 3amonophyly 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aparaphyly 3aplant taxonomy 3avines 0aAU test 0aincongruence 0aGonolobus 0aMatelea 0asingle copy nuclear loci1 aParks, Margaret1 aFishbein, Mark0 tSystematic botany.g2018 Apr., v. 43, no. 1 p.77-96dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245010100141300001600242520073200258592002800990650001201018650001501030650002001045650001501065650001601080650001901096650003301115651001801148653001701166653001701183653002601200653002501226653001801251700002801269700002201297700003201319700002901351700002701380773013101407852000901538655001201547IND60594708220221119105612.0180522e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Rayane de T.

Sixty-six morphological characters were examined from Terminalia reitzii, T. triflora, and T. uleana, of which only 12 were considered informative for morphometric evaluation and analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and principal components analysis. As a result, T. reitzii and T. uleana are synonymized under T. triflora, and we propose a new circumscription for T. sect. Diptera. In addition, morphological, distribution and conservation aspects of T. triflora are discussed. A key to the South American species of T. sect.

We are then able to go beyond fossil fuels technologies and estimate the hazard rate (ratio of casualties to energy) of wind power, the electricity network and the nuclear sector (for latent victims). Technologies are ranked, separately in the developed and developing worlds. In a second part, we compute the risk rate (ratio of casualties to population) for a variety of countries, accounting for the energy mix and imports; differences are found to be less glaring than for hazard rates. Lastly, we compare this risk of energy supply with the negative health impacts of energy consumption such as atmospheric pollution and road accidents. We find that for every casualty within the energy supply chain, there is a hundred more casualties among end-users in the developed countries and a thousand more in the developing ones. These stark differences call for giving priority to policies aimed at reducing the negative externalities of energy production and consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aair pollution 3adeveloped countries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3asupply chain 3awind power 0aEnergy 0aWind power 0aAccident 0aHazard rate 0aComparative risk 0aHealth 0aPollution 0aD81 0aL51 0aD61 0aQ20 tEnergy.g2018 May 01, v. 150 p.1018-1030dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015500169520143100324592002801755650002601783650002101809650002401830650001401854650001201868650002101880650001801901650002801919650001301947650002001960653001201980653001301992653001202005653002302017653001602040700001702056700002602073700002102099700002002120773010602140856008802246852000902334655001202343IND60782706020221119192937.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078270602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1139332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yoseop10aOxidative stress–mediated synergistic deleterious effects of nano- and microplastics in the hypoxia-conditioned marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis  aWhile pollution due to nano- and micro-sized plastics (NMPs) and hypoxic conditions both occur in coastal areas, the deleterious potential of co-exposure to hypoxia and NMPs (hypoxia and micro-sized plastics, HMPs; hypoxia and nano-sized plastics, HNPs) is largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence for multigenerational effects of HMP and HNP in the marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis by investigating changes in its life traits, antioxidant system, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway using an orthogonal experimental design, with nanoscale and microscale particles measuring 0.05 μm and 6.0 μm in diameter, respectively, and hypoxic conditions of 0.5 mg/L for six generations. Combined exposure to NMPs and hypoxia caused a significant decrease in fecundity and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The HIF pathway and circadian clock genes were also significantly upregulated in response to HMP and HNP exposure. In particular, synergistic deleterious effects of HNP were evident, suggesting that size-dependent toxicity can be a major driver of the effects of hypoxia and NMP co-exposure. After several generations of exposure, ROS levels returned to basal levels and transcriptomic resilience was observed, although rotifer reproduction remained suppressed. These findings help eluciating the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in responses to plastic pollution in hypoxic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus plicatilis 3acircadian clocks 3aexperimental design 3afecundity 3ahypoxia 3amarine pollution 3amicroplastics 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 0aHypoxia 0aPlastics 0aRotifer 0aAntioxidant system 0aHIF pathway1 aKim, Min-Sub1 aPark, Jordan Jun Chul1 aLee, Young-Hwan,1 aLee, Jae-seong,0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Aug., v. 181 p.113933-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1139333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008800166520116500254592002801419650001801447650004401465650003001509650001601539650001201555650001401567650001301581650001801594650001301612650002301625650001401648650002401662650001701686650003301703650002101736650002201757650001601779653001701795653003101812653002101843653001001864700001801874773010301892856008601995852000902081655001202090IND60686880120221121040602.0200515e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068688012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSogut, Ece10aUtilization of carrot (Daucus carota L.) fiber as a filler for chitosan based films  aAgricultural by-products, employed as bio-based fillers, provide opportunities to develop new packaging alternatives based on biopolymers.

The obtained films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, water vapor permeability (WVP), mechanical, thermal, and optical properties. The tensile properties and thermal stability of CH films were improved with the increasing amounts of the fillers. Besides, the higher concentrations of CF reduced the WVP of CH films, whereas 5% MCC addition increased WVP (p < 0.05). The inclusion of both filler type significantly affected the optical properties of CH films. SEM results presented that the fillers were well dispersed throughout the film. Furthermore, the possible interactions between amino groups of CH and functional groups of cellulosic fillers were evaluated by FTIR results. In this study, the potential of CF as filler in producing biopolymer-based packaging materials was investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagroindustrial byproducts 3abiopolymers 3acarrots 3acellulose 3achitosan 3ahydrocolloids 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3awater vapor 0aCarrot fiber 0aMicrocrystalline cellulose 0aBio-based filler 0aWaste1 aCakmak, Hulya0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Sept., v. 106 p.105861-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012700181300001800308500001500326520176700341592002802108650002002136650001902156650001702175650001802192650001002210650001002220650003302230650003502263650002402298650000902322650002902331650002602360650001902386650001302405650002302418650001202441650002202453650001402475650002902489650003902518650005702557650003502614650002202649651001702671651001002688653002302698700001302721700001702734700001702751700001402768700001102782700001302793773011702806856008102923852000903004655001203013IND50090087820221119032112.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008782DNAL7 a245266172pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3676-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong10aNatural and anthropogenic influences on a red-crowned crane habitat in the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve, 1992–2008  ap. 4013-4028.  a2019-12-05  aThis study aims to assess the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic variables on the change of the red-crowned crane habitat in the Yellow River Nature Reserve, East China using multitempopral remote sensing and geographic information system. Satellite images were used to detect the change in potential crane habitat, from which suitable crane habitat was determined by excluding fragmented habitat. In this study, a principal component analysis (PCA) with seven variables (channel flow, rainfall, temperature, sediment discharge, number of oil wells, total length of roads, and area of settlements) and linear regression analyses of potential and suitable habitat against the retained principal components were applied to explore the influences of natural and anthropogenic factors on the change of the red-crowned crane habitat. The experimental results indicate that suitable habitat decreased by 5,935 ha despite an increase of 1,409 ha in potential habitat from 1992 to 2008. The area of crane habitat changed caused by natural drivers such as progressive succession, retrogressive succession, and physical fragmentation is almost the same as that caused by anthropogenic forces such as land use change and behavioral fragmentation. The PCA and regression analyses revealed that natural factors (e.g., channel flow, rainfall, temperature, and sediment discharge) play an important role in the crane potential habitat change and human disturbances (e.g., oil wells, roads, and settlements) jointly explain 51.8 % of the variations in suitable habitat area, higher than 48.2 % contributed by natural factors. Thus, it is vital to reduce anthropogenic influences within the reserve in order to reverse the decline in the suitable crane habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3asediment yield 3ariver deltas 3alinear models 3awells 3aroads 3aprincipal component analysis 3ageographic information systems 3aregression analysis 3arain 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aremote sensing 3ahabitats 3aconservation areas 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aRiversxchemistry 3aYellow River 0aChina 0adeltas (landforms)1 aGao, Jay1 aPu, Ruiliang1 aRen, Liliang1 aKong, Yan1 aLi, He1 aLi, Ling0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 July, v. 186, no. 7 p.4013-4028dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3676-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013700157300001400294500002000308520144600328592002801774596006201802650002401864650001201888650000901900650001701909650002401926650001601950651001901966700002101985773012002006856007402126852000902200655001202209IND60786984720221120033704.0220807e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698472DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbers, J.

Only sicklefin chub Macrhybopsis meeki spawned successfully although sturgeon chub Macrhybopsis gelida released unfertilized eggs. All temperature and hormone treatments produced M. meeki spawns, but two treatments had similar success rates at 44 and 43%, consisting of a constant daily temperature with no hormone added, or daily temperature fluctuations with hormone added to the water. Spawns consisted of multiple successful demersal circular swimming spawning embraces interspersed with circular swims without embraces. The most spawns observed for one female was four and on average, 327 eggs were collected after each spawn. The water‐hardened eggs were semi‐buoyant and non‐adhesive, the first confirmation of this type of reproductive guild in the Missouri River Macrhybopsis sp. From spawn, larvae swam vertically until 123 accumulated degree days (° D) and 167° D for consumption of first food. Using average water speed and laboratory development time, the predicted drift distance for eggs and larvae could be 468–592 km in the lower Missouri River. Results from this study determined the reproductive biology and early life history of Macrhybopsis spp. and provided insight into their population dynamics in the Missouri River.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey Science Support and Quick Response 3aMacrhybopsis gelida 3afemales 3afish 3alife history 3apopulation dynamics 3atemperature 3aMissouri River1 aWildhaber, M.

On the one hand, they are required to ensure that each building (no matter the distance to the heat source) has warm water within an acceptable time. On the other hand, they form a short-circuit between the warm supply and cold return line and their use can increase the return temperature substantially. Therefore, a good control of these bypass valves is critical to limit the drawback of their use. In this context, this paper compares two commonly used control strategies (manual control and thermostat control) to a new theoretical benchmark that provides an upper boundary for the performance of bypass controllers. This theoretical benchmark ensures a just-in-time delivery of warm water by taking into account time delays in the network. In a simulation case study of a small neighbourhood in Genk, Belgium, the benchmark shows that substantial improvement regarding bypass control is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acold 3acontrollers 3aheat 3atemperature 3aBelgium 0aDistrict heating 0aThermal networks 0aControl 0aTime delays 0aBypass valves1 avan der Heijde, Bram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1389-13621 aPatteeuw, Dieter1 aVanhoudt, Dirk1 aHelsen, Lieve0 tEnergy.g2018 May 15, v. 151 p.45-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009500179300001600274520154400290592002801834650002601862650001101888650002601899650004001925650002501965650001301990650002302003650002002026650001902046650002502065650001502090651002302105653001102128653002202139653002502161653003102186653001302217653001402230700002002244700002002264773012702284856008702411852000902498655001202507IND50069678420221120044945.0190318e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006967842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanniah, Kasturi Devi10aExploring the link between clouds, radiation, and canopy productivity of tropical savannas  ap. 304-313.  aThe control of clouds on the canopy gross primary productivity (GPP) was examined at Howard Springs, a tropical savanna site in the Northern Territory, Australia. It was demonstrated in this study that cloudiness can increase the initial canopy quantum efficiency (α), midday light use efficiency (LUE) and water use efficiency (WUE), but decrease GPP in savannas. Thick clouds (clearness index of 0–0.3 in the wet season produced much more diffuse fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fDPAR>80%), which caused increases in α by 24% and 62% compared to thin clouds (fDPAR between 30% and 80%) and clear sky (fDPAR<30%) conditions respectively. The influence of environmental conditions shows that under similar vapour pressure deficit, temperature and soil water content classes, α values were significantly higher under thick clouds compared to thin clouds or clear skies. This indicates the importance of diffuse radiation in enhancing LUE even within similar environmental conditions. However, the enhanced LUE under cloudy skies is insufficient to increase GPP due to the dramatic decline in total radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the quantity of solar radiation is more critical than the quality of radiation in savannas. However, savanna ecosystems appear to be well adapted to the environment where a 63% decrease in PAR only reduced GPP by 26%. These findings highlight the importance of clouds as a critical factor in determining savanna productivity that has implications for savannas carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acanopy 3aenvironmental factors 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aprimary productivity 3asavannas 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3avapor pressure 3awater use efficiency 3awet season 3aNorthern Territory 0aClouds 0aDiffuse radiation 0aLight use efficiency 0aGross primary productivity 0aSavannas 0aAustralia1 aBeringer, Jason1 aHutley, Lindsay0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 182-183 p.304-313dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168300001800256520071300274592002800987650001401015650001701029650002001046650001801066650001501084650001501099650001201114650001701126650001001143650002001153650001701173653002601190653001801216653002001234653003201254653001701286653000801303700001701311700002301328700002401351700002401375773010601399856008401505852000901589655001201598IND60122270020221122233306.0150325e20141018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012227002DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9426622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanem, Hasna10aMicrophynolides A and B, new spiro-γ-lactone glycosides from Thymelaea microphylla  ap. 1732-1738.  aTwo new spiro-γ-lactone glycosides named microphynolide A (1) and microphynolide B (2), together with twelve known compounds including five biflavonoids namely neochamaejasmin A, neochamaejasmin B, daphnodorin B, genkwanol A and stelleranol, one bis-coumarin daphnoretin, two lignans called pinoresinol and matairesinol, one flavonoid glucoside, tiliroside, a sinapyl alcohol glucoside, syringin, and two phytosterols, β-sitosterol and β-sitosterol-3- O -glucoside, were isolated from ethyl acetate extracts of the aerial parts and roots of the plant Thymelaea microphylla Coss. and Dur.

The method relied on the combination of the “drug-initiated” method to obtain α-functional polymer prodrugs by nitroxide-mediated polymerization, followed by the nitroxide exchange reaction from a functional nitroxide to install another molecule of interest at the ω chain-end. To validate the proof of concept, two different combinations have been synthesized using polyisoprene (PI) as the polymer building block: one based on gemcitabine and rhodamine (Gem-PI-Rho) for drug delivery and imaging purposes, and one with aminoglutethimide and doxorubicin (Agm-PI-Dox) for combination therapy purposes. Fluorescent polymer prodrug nanoparticles (Dz = 161 nm) were easily obtained by co-nanoprecipitation of Gem-PI and 5 wt% of Gem-PI-Rho. They were observed by confocal microscopy and they also induced significant cytotoxicity on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. As for combination therapy purposes, Agm-PI-Dox nanoparticles (Dz = 63–122 nm) led to enhanced cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells compared to both monofunctional polymer prodrug nanoparticles (ca. 50% decrease in IC₅₀ vs. Agm-PI and 65% decrease in IC₅₀ vs. PI-Dox) or their equimolar co-nanoprecipitation. This simple and general methodology may pave the way to the design of a broad range of different heterotelechelic polymer prodrug nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arhodamines 3atherapeutics 0aPolymer 0aNanoparticles 0aProdrug 0aCancer 0aCombination therapy 0aDrug delivery1 aDenis, Stéphanie,1 aMougin, Julie1 aJacobs, Merel1 aGuillaneuf, Yohann1 aMura, Simona1 aCouvreur, Patrick1 aNicolas, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1597-08730 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 286 p.425-438dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245012700196300001800323520155700341592002801898650002601926650001301952650001501965650001001980650002201990650001802012650001902030650001402049650001802063650001702081650001502098650003502113650005502148650006202203650002902265650003202294650003002326650002002356650002202376651001002398651001002408700001702418700001702435700002402452700001702476773011702493856004802610852000902658655001202667IND50090088020221119032136.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008802DNAL7 a245540212pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3678-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubrahmanyam, Gangavarapu10aResponse of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria to long-term industrial effluent-polluted soils, Gujarat, Western India  ap. 4037-4050.  aSoil nitrifiers have been showing an important role in assessing environmental pollution as sensitive biomarkers. In this study, the abundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were investigated in long-term industrial waste effluent (IWE) polluted soils. Three different IWE polluted soils characterized as uncontaminated (R1), moderately contaminated (R2), and highly contaminated (R3) were collected in triplicate along Mahi River basin, Gujarat, Western India. Quantitative numbers of ammonia monooxygenase α-subunit (amoA) genes as well as 16S rRNA genes indicated apparent deleterious effect of IWE on abundance of soil AOA, AOB, bacteria, and archaeal populations. Relatively, AOB was more abundant than AOA in the highly contaminated soil R3, while predominance of AOA was noticed in uncontaminated (R1) and moderately contaminated (R2) soils. Soil potential nitrification rate (PNR) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in polluted soils R2 and R3. Reduced diversity accompanied by apparent community shifts of both AOB and AOA populations was detected in R2 and R3 soils. AOB were dominated with Nitrosospira-like sequences, whereas AOA were dominated by Thaumarchaeal “group 1.1b (Nitrososphaera clusters).” We suggest that the significant reduction in abundance and diversity AOA and AOB could serve as relevant bioindicators for soil quality monitoring of polluted sites. These results could be further useful for better understanding of AOB and AOA communities in polluted soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia monooxygenase 3abacteria 3abiomarkers 3agenes 3aindicator species 3anitrification 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil quality 3awatersheds 2aAmmoniaxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aArchaeaxclassificationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aNitrificationxdrug effects 2aOxidoreductasesxanalysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aShen, Ju-Pei1 aLiu, Yu-Rong1 aArchana, Gattupalli1 aHe, Ji-Zheng0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 July, v. 186, no. 7 p.4037-4050dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3678-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245016000166300001600326520122200342592002801564650002101592650002101613650003101634650001701665650003901682650001001721650001301731650001901744650000701763650001601770650001601786650002201802653002701824653001901851653001301870653003001883653002301913700001801936700001201954773013601966856008702102852000902189655001202198IND60649473720221119063710.0190822e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Cong10aBinding interaction between β-conglycinin/glycinin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in acidic media assessed by multi-spectroscopic and thermodynamic techniques  ap. 366-373.  aThe noncovalent binding mechanisms between cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and two main soy protein fractions: β-conglycinin (7S) and glycinin (11S) at pH 3.0 were investigated and compared. C3G modified the secondary structure of two fractions by increasing α-helix and random coil content while decreasing β-sheet content. The binding of C3G also altered the tertiary structure and microenvironment of two fractions, demonstrated by synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. Additionally, C3G binding reduced the surface hydrophobicity and thermostability of both 7S and 11S. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching results showed that the binding of C3G to two fractions were spontaneous complexation processes driven by electrostatic forces. The number of C3G bound per protein molecule (n) was near 1. The binding constant (Ka) was 2.41 (±0.42) × 104 M−1 for 11S and 0.81 (±0.01) × 104 M−1 for 7S at 298 K. 11S showed a stronger binding ability for C3G than 7S. These findings contribute to the knowledge of interactions between soy protein fractions and dietary polyphenols under acidic condition, and are beneficial for the application of soy protein-based products in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-conglycinin 3abinding capacity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afoods 3aglycinin 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3apolyphenols 3asoy protein 3athermal stability 0aCyanidin-3-O-glucoside 0aβ-Conglycinin 0aGlycinin 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aCircular dichroism1 aXiong, Wenfei1 aLi, Bin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 137 p.366-373dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012300181300001800304520130600322592002801628650001401656650001501670650002301685650001201708650001101720650001001731650001101741650001601752650003401768650001201802650003501814650003801849650002901887650003901916650001601955650004001971650002002011650004302031700001302074700001502087700002002102700001602122773011702138856008102255852000902336655001202345IND50090088120221119032018.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008812DNAL7 a245196382pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3679-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Lijin10aCadmium accumulation characteristics of the winter farmland weeds Cardamine hirsuta Linn. and Gnaphalium affine D.

Don exceeded the critical value of a Cd-hyperaccumulator (100 mg kg⁻¹), indicating that these two farmland weeds might be Cd-hyperaccumulators. In this study, we grew these species in soil containing various concentrations of Cd to further evaluate their Cd accumulation characteristics. The biomasses of C. hirsuta and G. affine decreased with increasing Cd concentrations in the soil, while the root/shoot ratio and the Cd concentrations in shoot tissues increased. The Cd concentrations in shoots of C. hirsuta and G. affine reached 121.96 and 143.91 mg kg⁻¹, respectively, at the soil Cd concentration of 50 mg kg⁻¹. Both of these concentrations exceeded the critical value of a Cd-hyperaccumulator (100 mg kg⁻¹). The shoot bioconcentration factors of C. hirsuta and G. affine were greater than 1. The translocation factor of C. hirsuta was less than 1 and that of G. affine was greater than 1. These findings indicated that C. hirsuta is a Cd-accumulator and G. affine is Cd-hyperaccumulator. Both plants are distributed widely in the field, and they could be used to remediate Cd-contaminated farmland soil in winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardamine 3aGnaphalium 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3ashoots 3aweeds 3awinter 2aAgriculture 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCadmiumxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCardaminexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGnaphaliumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Roots 2aPlant Weedsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aShi, Jun1 aLiu, Qihua1 aLiao, Ming’an1 aMei, Luoyin0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 July, v. 186, no. 7 p.4051-4056dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3679-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014200168300001600310520105400326592002801380650001901408650001201427650001101439650001501450650001801465650001801483650002401501650001601525653004201541653003101583653003301614653003101647653003601678700001601714700001601730700001801746773008901764856008501853852000901938655001201947IND60629977920221117234517.0190207e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062997792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fuzhen10aThermodynamic optimization of heat transfer process in thermal systems using CO2 as the working fluid based on temperature glide matching  ap. 376-386.  aFor thermal systems using CO2 as a working fluid, an isobaric heat transfer in the supercritical region is a variable temperature process. When CO2 is near the pseudo-critical point, its specific heat changes clearly with temperature, which results in an increase in the average temperature difference and thus, an increase in entropy generation. A thermodynamic optimization method for a heat transfer process based on temperature glide matching is proposed in this paper. This method can allow the temperature difference to be uniform and near the minimum value. The heat transfer process in the gas cooler of a CO2 heat pump water heater and the recuperator of the supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) Brayton cycle are optimized based on this method. Using this concept, a CO2 heat pump water heater can simultaneously obtain a certain amount of warm water without simultaneously reducing the hot water output; in addition, for S-CO2 cycle, the exergy efficiency of the regenerator is improved, and the thermal efficiency of the system is thereby improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aentropy 3aexergy 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer 3aspecific heat 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 0aOptimization of heat transfer process 0aTemperature glide matching 0aTemperature-enthalpy diagram 0aCO2 heat pump water heater 0aSupercritical-CO2 brayton cycle1 aZhu, Yinhai1 aLi, Conghui1 aJiang, Peixue0 tEnergy.g2018 May 15, v. 151 p.376-386dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010100187300001800288520153200306592002801838650002001866650002001886650001201906650001201918650001101930650001101941650002601952650001201978650000901990650000901999650001102008650001402019650001402033650001102047650001402058650001102072650001402083650000902097650002902106650002802135650003202163650002302195650002202218650002902240650004102269700002502310700002502335700002702360773011702387856004802504852000902552655001202561IND50090088220221119032021.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008822DNAL7 a245499432pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3680-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlink, Agnieszka10aMacro- and microelement distribution in organs of Glyceria maxima and biomonitoring applications  ap. 4057-4065.  aThe content of nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and of trace metals (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cd, Co and Ni) in water, bottom sediments and various organs of Glyceria maxima from 19 study sites selected in the Jeziorka River was determined. In general, the concentrations of nutrients recorded in the plant material decreased in the following order: leaf>root>rhizome>stem, while the concentrations of the trace elements showed the following accumulation scheme: root>rhizome>leaf>stem. The bioaccumulation and transfer factors for nutrients were significantly higher than for trace metals. G. maxima from agricultural fields was characterised by the highest P and K concentrations in leaves, and plants from forested land contained high Zn and Ni amounts. However, the manna grass from small localities showed high accumulation of Ca, Mg and Mn. Positive significant correlations between Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Co and Ni concentrations in water or sediments and their concentrations in plant indicate that G. maxima may be employed as a biomonitor of trace element contamination. Moreover, a high degree of similarity was noted between self-organizing feature map (SOFM)-grouped sites of comparable quantities of elements in the water and sediments and sites where G. maxima had a corresponding content of the same elements in its leaves. Therefore, SOFM could be recommended in analysing ecological conditions of the environment from the perspective of nutrients and trace element content in different plant species and their surroundings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlyceria maxima 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3anutrients 3arivers 3asediments 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Structuresxchemistry 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aRiversxchemistry 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis1 aStankiewicz, Andrzej1 aWisłocka, Magdalena1 aPolechońska, Ludmiła0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 July, v. 186, no. 7 p.4057-4065dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3680-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010000207300001800307520030300325592002800628650002300656650001300679650001400692700005600706700005900762700002300821700005800844700005800902700005700960773012001017856008301137852000901220655001201229IND60646416220190815000000.0190610e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064641622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b014752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbelen, Bram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1865-372610aFrom One-Pot NH-Sulfoximidations of Thiophene Derivatives to Dithienylethene-Type Photoswitches  ap. 4293-4297.  aThiophene NH-sulfoximines have been synthesized using a one-pot NH-sulfoximidation reaction of thiophenes.

Membrane aerators were integrated into an AFMBR to form an aeration membrane fluidized bed membrane bioreactor (AeMFMBR) capable of simultaneous removal of organic matter and ammonia without production of dissolved methane. Good effluent quality was obtained with no detectable suspended solids, 93±5% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal to 14±11mg/L, and 74±8% of total ammonia (TA) removal to 12±3mg-N/L for domestic wastewater (COD of 193±23mg/L and TA of 49±5mg-N/L) treatment. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were always low (<1mg-N/L) during continuous flow treatment. Membrane fouling was well controlled by fluidization of the granular activated carbon (GAC) particles (transmembrane pressures maintained <3kPa). Analysis of the microbial communities suggested that nitrogen removal was due to nitrification and denitrification based on the presence of microorganisms associated with these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaeration 3aaerators 3aammonia 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3afluidized beds 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aultrafiltration 0aMembrane aerator 0aNitrogen nutrient removal 0aAnaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor1 aSaikaly, Pascal E.1 aLogan, B.E.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.456-462dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04524naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245014600177300001800323520252000341592002802861650001302889650002002902650001502922650001202937650002602949650001602975650001102991650000903002650001703011650001203028650001203040650001903052650001403071650000903085650001403094650001603108650002103124650002303145650001103168650001003179650003603189650001603225650005903241650001203300650001803312650004103330650001103371650004003382650001103422650004203433650003503475650002003510650004703530650001403577650003903591650001303630700002103643773010003664856007703764852000903841655001203850IND60083428120221122165337.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008342812DNAL7 a229216302pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-54582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, M.10aEffects of glucogenic and ketogenic feeding strategies on splanchnic glucose and amino acid metabolism in postpartum transition Holstein cows  ap. 5946-5960.  aNine periparturient Holstein cows catheterized in major splanchnic vessels were used in a complete randomized design with repeated measurements to investigate effects of glucogenic and ketogenic feeding strategies on splanchnic metabolism of glucose and amino acids. At parturition, cows were assigned to 1 of 3 feeding strategies: a glucogenic diet (GLCG) based on sodium hydroxide treated wheat grain (56.5% of diet dry matter); a ketogenic diet (KETO) based on fodder beets (40.5% of diet dry matter); or an alfalfa-glucogenic strategy (ALF-GLCG) supplying 100% alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) haylage at the day of parturition, followed by a 6-d linear shift to the GLCG diet. Samples were obtained 14d before expected parturition as well as at 4, 15, and 29d in milk (DIM). The net portal release of glucose was greatest with GLCG, reflecting the higher intake of ruminal escape starch with GLCG, as compared with a lower starch intake with KETO. Postpartum, the portal recovery of feed starch was greater (28±3%, mean ± SEM) with KETO as compared with GLCG (15±4%). At 4 DIM, the net hepatic release of glucose was greatest with KETO and least with ALF-GLCG, whereafter it increased as lactation progressed with ALF-GLCG and GLCG, but not with KETO. The high alfalfa haylage allowance at 4 DIM with the ALF-GLCG treatment induced the lowest net release of nutrients from the splanchnic tissues at 4 DIM. The hepatic removal of lactate as percent of total influx (mean ± SEM) increased from 27±3% prepartum to 56±3% at 4 DIM. The hepatic removal of lactate as percent of net portal release increased from 144±10% prepartum to 329±17% at 4 DIM with ALF-GLCG and KETO as compared with 242±20% in GLCG. No clear evidence for an amino acid sparing effect in splanchnic tissues from increasing small intestinal glucose absorption was observed. In conclusion, the glucogenic feeding strategy induced the highest glucogenic status among the tested feeding strategies due to greater release of glucose from splanchnic tissues. In contrast, the immediate postpartum high allowance of alfalfa haylage provided the lowest amount of nutrients from the splanchnic tissues, inducing low glucogenic status, pointing to the importance of allocating highly digestible diets to postpartum transition cows. Salvaging glucogenic carbon via interorgan transfer of lactate from peripheral tissues supported the immediate postpartum incremental increase in hepatic glucose release rather than hepatic catabolism of amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aMedicago sativa 3aabsorption 3aalfalfa 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3acows 3aforage beets 3aglucose 3ahaylage 3aketogenic diet 3alactation 3amilk 3anutrients 3aparturition 3asodium hydroxide 3asplanchnic tissues 3astarch 3awheat 2aAmino Acidsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBeta vulgaris 2aBlood Glucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aDiet, Ketogenicxmethodsxveterinary. 2aLiverxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMedicago sativa 2aPostpartum Periodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aSplanchnic Circulationxphysiology 2aTriticum1 aKristensen, N.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.5946-5960dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-54583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006200167300001800229520055800247592002800805650001200833650002300845650002300868650001300891650001300904650002800917650002100945700001200966700005800978700005301036700005001089700005101139773012001190856008301310852000901393655001201402IND60646416320221118000758.0190610e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064641632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b014812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao-Xu10aVicinal Diboration of Alkyl Bromides via Tandem Catalysis  ap. 4298-4302.  aVicinal diboration of alkyl bromides via tandem catalysis is reported.

Moreover, it shows good practicality due to the easy accessibility of alkyl bromides in combination with diverse transformations of diboronates. Mechanism study indicates that terminal alkenes are generated selectively through nickel-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation of alkyl bromides followed by base/MeOH promoted diboration process to provide 1,2-diboration products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3amethanol 3amoieties 3aorganobromine compounds 3aregioselectivity1 aLi, Lei1 aGong, Tian-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-85311 aXiao, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1200-68191 aLu, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9338-07801 aFu, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2282-48390 tOrganic letters.g2019 May 23, v. 21, no. 11 p.4298-4302dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b014813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012000158300001800278500002000296520148300316592002801799650002301827650005201850650002501902650002501927650002001952650001201972650001101984650001901995650001702014650001302031700006202044700002102106773012402127856007202251852000902323655001202332IND60741783620221121112807.0210618e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074178362DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.70412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSisakht, Mohsen10aPlant‐derived chemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (6LU7), a virtual screening study  ap. 3262-3274.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSARS‐CoV‐2 has caused millions of infections and more than 700,000 deaths. Taking the urgent need to find new therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), a dataset of plant‐based natural compounds was selected for the screening of antiviral activity. The viral 3‐chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) was selected as the target. Molecular docking was performed on 2,845 phytochemicals to estimate the spatial affinity for the active sites of the enzyme. The ADMET screening was used for the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the hit compounds. Nelfinavir and Lopinavir were used as control for binding energy comparison. The top 10 hits, based on the binding energy (Kcal/mol), were Ginkgolide M (−11.2), Mezerein (−11), Tubocurarine (−10.9), Gnidicin (−10.4), Glycobismine A (−10.4), Sciadopitysin Z‐10.2), Gnididin (−9.2), Glycobismine A (−10.4), Sciadopitysin (−10.2), Gnididin (−9.20, Emetine (−8.7), Vitexin (−8.3), Calophyllolide (−8.3), and 6‐(3,3‐Dimethylallyl)galangin (−7.9). The binding energy for nelfinavir and lopinavir were − 9.1 and − 8.4, respectively. Interestingly, some of these natural products were previously shown to possess antiviral properties against various viruses, such as HIV, Zika, and Ebola viruses. Herein, we suggest several phytochemicals as the inhibitors of the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2 that could be used in the fight against COVID‐19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral properties 3acysteine proteinases 3adata collection 3aemetine 3aenergy 3aphytochemicals 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch1 aMahmoodzadeh, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0523-81521 aDarabian, Maryam0 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.3262-3274dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.70413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245011200172300002000284520151300304592002801817650004401845650001301889650002401902650001601926650002101942650001701963650001801980650003801998650001302036650002002049650001302069650001102082650002102093650002302114700002102137700002202158773012402180856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60667594520221121235359.0190919e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066759452DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06908d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirmohseni-Namin, Abdolreza10aIncreasing toughness and tensile strength of an epoxy–diamine system using an inorganic ultra-accelerator  ap. 53025-53035.  aEpoxy resins are a class of thermoset materials with extensive structural and composite applications. A wide range of chemical species, of which room temperature curing agents are most favourable, due to their widespread applications, can easily cure these resins. The major drawback of low temperature curing agents is their relatively high curing time. To overcome this issue, accelerators are usually added to decrease curing time and temperature. In this study, we present a unique type of inorganic accelerator that has immensely reduced curing time and temperature as well as imparting major improvements in mechanical properties including tensile strength, izod impact strength and adhesion strength. The epoxy resins used in the following study were diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and Epikure F 205 (modified isophorone diamine). The curing kinetics of epoxy resin was determined in the presence of inorganic accelerator using FT-IR spectroscopy. Resins were cured with and without inorganic accelerator and the thermal properties were investigated using DSC (differential scanning calorimetry). FT-IR spectroscopy results showed that using 5% inorganic accelerator, forced 99.68% of the epoxy groups to open, while crosslinks were observed after 18 minutes at 25 °C. Results from DSC analysis showed that using 5% inorganic accelerator reduced the initial onset curing temperature from 68.3 °C to −2.4 °C, while significantly improved its mechanical properties in the polymer backbone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aambient temperature 3abisphenol A 3achemical species 3acrosslinking 3acuring agents 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aepoxides 3aimpact strength 3apolymers 3aresins 3atensile strength 3athermal properties1 aNikafshar, Saeid1 aMirmohseni, Farid0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 16, v. 5, no. 65 p.53025-53035dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06908d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010500167300001600272520166600288592002801954650002501982650001902007650003102026650003002057650001002087650003002097651001002127653003102137653002802168653001302196653003202209700005502241700005602296700001702352700001702369773008902386856008502475852000902560655001202569IND60629978220221117234438.0200607e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062997822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Kaifang10aExploring spatiotemporal patterns of electric power consumption in countries along the Belt and Road  ap. 847-859.  aFully understanding spatiotemporal patterns of electric power consumption (EPC) is one of the key questions related to sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development in countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (hereinafter referred to as the Belt and Road countries). However, studies about spatiotemporal patterns of EPC in the Belt and Road countries are still scarce due to the lack of reliable data. This study attempted to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of EPC in the Belt and Road countries from multiple perspectives. Firstly, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light data were used to estimate EPC from 1992 to 2013. Subsequently, the mathematical statistic method, standard deviational ellipse, rank size rule, and correlation analysis were employed to evaluate the EPC change in detail. The results reveal that the EPC growth mainly occurs in the developing countries, especially in China. The geographical distribution of EPC in the Belt and Road countries is oriented in the Northwest-Southeast direction between 1992 and 2013. Based on the rank size rule analysis, the slope values of q are −2.392 and −2.175 between 1992 and 2013, with an average R² value of 0.664, indicating a clear clustering pattern of EPC. It is also proved that GDP is a more important impact factor to EPC than the population. Our findings can offer an effective way to understand spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of EPC in the Belt and Road countries, and provide references for regional socioeconomic development and cooperation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectric power 3aenergy use and consumption 3ageographical distribution 3alight 3asocioeconomic development 3aChina 0aElectric power consumption 0aSpatiotemporal patterns 0aDMSP-OLS 0aThe belt and road countries1 aYu, Bailang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5628-00031 aHuang, Chang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8621-45811 aWu, Jianping1 aSun, Xiufeng0 tEnergy.g2018 May 01, v. 150 p.847-859dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014000182300001800322520068000340592002801020650002101048650001401069650001701083650000901100650001201109650001401121650002601135650003701161650001801198650001501216650001501231650003001246650002801276650002001304650005001324650000901374650001501383650002801398650003701426650002701463700001601490700001601506700001801522700001301540700001301553700001501566700001401581773009801595856004801693852000901741655001201750IND4479349920221122055626.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447934992DNAL7 a213805262pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0577-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xinghui10aOverexpression of survivin and cyclin D1 in CHO cells confers apoptosis resistance and enhances growth in serum-free suspension culture  ap. 1293-1300.  aTo optimize Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture to recombinant protein therapeutic production, we stably overexpressed survivin and cyclin D1 in three CHO DG44-derived cell lines.

Nude mice inoculated with the modified cells showed no tumorigenesis suggesting that the CHO DG44-derived cell lines are viable candidates for biopharmaceutical production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3amice 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCHO Cellsxphysiology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCell Survival 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aCulture Media, Serum-Free 2aCyclin D1xbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression 2aInhibitor of Apoptosis Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aGuo, Junwei1 aYu, Yingqun1 aYi, Shaoqiong1 aYu, Ting1 aFu, Ling1 aHou, Lihua1 aChen, Wei0 tBiotechnology letters.g2011 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1293-1300dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0577-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245012000150300001800270500002000288520189000308592002802198596007002226596005902296596005902355596005902414650001102473650001402484650001402498650001502512650001402527650001402541650001302555650001902568650003502587650002302622650001702645650001102662650002502673650001702698650001002715650001602725650000902741650001702750650001702767650001402784650002202798650002302820650001302843700001502856700001502871700001302886700001402899700002102913700001602934700005402950700001203004773012403016856007203140852000903212655001203221IND60741783720221122100118.0210618e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074178372DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.70622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Cui10aEvodiamine alleviates lipopolysaccharide‐induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by activating apelin pathway  ap. 3406-3417.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInflammation can cause a series of inflammatory lung disease, which seriously endangers human health. Pulmonary fibrosis is a kind of inflammatory disease with end‐stage lung pathological changes. It has complicated and unknown pathogenesis and is still lack of effective therapeutic drugs. LPS‐induced inflammation is a common feature of many infectious inflammations such as pneumonia, bacteremia, glomerulonephritis, etc. Evodiamine, one of the main components of Evodia rutaecarpa, is an alkaloid with excellent antiinflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the protective capacities of evodiamine on LPS‐induced inflammatory damages in vitro and in vivo. MTT method, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and other methods were used for in vitro study to determine the protective capacities of evodiamine. The results suggest that evodiamine can protect murine macrophages from the LPS‐nigericin‐induced damages by (a) inhibiting cellular apoptosis, (b) inhibiting inflammatory cytokines releasing, and (c) activating the apelin pathway. We also used the exogenous apelin‐13 peptide co‐cultured with LPS–nigericin in RAW264.7 cells and found that apelin‐13 contributes to protecting the effects of evodiamine. In vivo, the ELISA method and immunohistochemistry were used to examine inflammatory cytokines, apelin, and histological changes. BALB/c mice were exposed to LPS and subsequent administration of evodiamine （p.o.）for some time, the results of the alveolar lavage fluid and the tissue slices showed that evodiamine treatment alleviated the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, stimulated apelin expression and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines. These results provide a basis for the protective effect and mechanism of evodiamine in LPS‐induced inflammation and suggest that it might be potential therapeutics in human pulmonary infections.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019ZX09721001‐008cMinistry of Science and Technology of China  a81773890cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a82073997cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81891012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEuodia 3aalkaloids 3aapoptosis 3abacteremia 3acoculture 3acytokines 3afibrosis 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglomerulonephritis 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aphytotherapy 3apneumonia 3aprotective effect 3apulmonary fibrosis 3aresearch1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhao, Qian1 aXie, Xin1 aLi, Xiang1 aZhu, Hong‐Ping1 aPeng, Cheng1 aHuang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0832-18641 aHan, Bo0 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 6 p.3406-3417dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.70623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012900169300001600298520145700314592002801771650001501799650001601814650002501830650001101855650003601866650001001902650002001912650001701932650002101949650002401970650001301994650001902007650001402026650002302040650001502063650001602078653002102094653001802115653001702133700001502150700002502165700002402190700001802214700002802232700001702260773013602277856008702413852000902500655001202509IND60649474120221119064031.0190822e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaity, Arnab10aPreferential photochemical interaction of Ru (III) doped carbon nano dots with bovine serum albumin over human serum albumin  ap. 483-494.  aThe excitation wavelength dependent emission of carbon nano dots (CNDs) restricts their use in photophysical studies. However, instead of bare CNDs, the amine coated Ru (III) doped CNDs (Ru:CNDEDAs) are quite eligible to generate excitation wavelength independent fluorescence with high quantum yield. Herein, we report a detailed study on the photochemical interaction between two different serum albumins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA), with Ru:CNDEDAs synthesized in our laboratory, using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Absorption study reveals the formation of ground state complex between Ru:CNDEDAs and BSA/HSA while the circular dichroism study implies that Ru:CNDEDAs perturbs the secondary structure of the albumin proteins. Steady-state fluorescence study helps in understanding energy transfer from tryptophan, the fluorophore moiety of BSA and HSA, to Ru:CNDEDAs. Time-resolved studies within nanosecond time domain clarify the phenomenon of energy transfer from BSA/HSA to Ru:CNDEDAs with varied efficiency. Molecular dynamic simulation ascertains that the efficiency of energy transfer is highly dependent on the stability of protein-nanoparticle complex. This study provides a qualitative description regarding the structural rigidity of transport protein, BSA compared to HSA, which determines the transport ability of CNDs to deliver the desired drug molecule to the targeted cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adrugs 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman serum albumin 3amoieties 3aphotochemistry 3aruthenium 3atransport proteins 3atryptophan 3awavelengths 0aCarbon nano dots 0aSerum albumin 0aFluorescence1 aPal, Uttam1 aChakraborty, Brotati1 aSengupta, Chaitrali1 aSau, Abhishek1 aChakraborty, Swatadipta1 aBasu, Samita0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 137 p.483-494dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009900161300001600260520094800276592002801224650001601252650000801268650001301276650002101289650001201310650001201322650004101334650001001375650000901385650001201394650000901406650001901415650001901434650001701453650001201470650001301482653001101495653000801506653000901514700001701523773012301540856008101663852000901744655001201753IND60786489620221120185532.0220803e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648962DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkyüz, B.10aDetection of Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (BLAD) in Turkish native and Holstein cattle  ap. 173-178.  aThe purpose of this work was to study whether the bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) allele is present in native cattle breeds and the Holstein breed in Turkey. Blood samples were obtained from 120 Holstein, 20 Brown Swiss, 20 Anatolian Black, 20 Turkish Grey, 20 South Anatolian Red and 20 East Anatolian Red cattle. The isolated DNA materials were multiplied in PCR using the primer developed by Kriegesmann et al. (1997). In order to determine the area of mutation in PCR products, the PCR products were digested with TaqI endonuclease enzyme. The resulting fragments were analysed on 2% agarose gel for the absence of a TaqI restriction site. It was found that two of the Holstein cattle (a bull and a cow) were heterozygote BLAD carriers. There was no homozygote BLAD animal. The BLAD allele was not found in the other breeds used in the study. The mutant BLAD allele frequency in the 120 Holstein cattle calculations was 0.0084.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrown Swiss 3aDNA 3aHolstein 3aTurkey (country) 3aagarose 3aalleles 3abovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency 3abulls 3acows 3aenzymes 3agels 3agene frequency 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amutants 3amutation 0aTurkey 0aPCR 0aBLAD1 aErtu?rul, O.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2006 June 1, v. 54, no. 2 p.173-178dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010700157500001900264520129300283592002801576650001201604650001901616650001101635650001301646650002001659650001801679650001801697650001501715651001601730700001901746700001801765773011901783856007301902852000901975655001201984IND60724614020221118230014.0210122e20210117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072461402DNAL7 a10.3390/w130202132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Jiwook 10aCharacteristics of Hydrochemistry and Stable Isotopes in a Karst Region in Samcheok, Republic of Korea  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKarst regions cover approximately 10% of the Korean Peninsula and are highly vulnerable to contamination. In this study, five field surveys were conducted between 2017 and 2019 to examine the monthly and seasonal changes in the hydro-environment of a characteristic karst region in Samchoek, South Korea. During the surveys, a total of 24 surface water samples were collected and analyzed for field water quality parameters, major and minor ions, and stable isotopes. The results indicate that the water quality in the study area is significantly affected by precipitation. Overall, the water was classified as a Ca-Mg-HCO₃ type, and correlation analysis of the major ions detected in the water samples indicates that the inflow of nitrate to the surface water originated from agricultural activities in the region. Furthermore, variations caused by climate were verified using the relationships between the various ions. In addition, high precipitation rates during the rainy season cause the active exchange of surface material, which was verified using stable isotope outliers. The results provide a scientific basis for studying the connectivity of water systems in complex karst hydrogeological regions and can aid future sustainable management of water resources in these regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3ahydrochemistry 3akarsts 3anitrates 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awet season 3aSouth Korea1 aLee, Jin-Yong 1 aKim, Heejung 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 17, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130202133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004400113040001800157100001700175245014000192300001600332520157300348592002801921650002301949650002001972650002201992650002502014650001402039650002102053650002702074650004702101650000902148651001102157700002502168700001802193773013502211852000902346856011202355856009002467961001302557655001202570IND4372990220221119123429.0200207e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437299022DNAL7 a10113/206372hdl7 a10.1023/B:GRES.0000024655.48989.ab2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreene, S.L.10aRelating Morphologic and RAPD Marker Varlation to Collection Site Environment in wild Populations of Red Clover (Trifolium Pratense L.)  ap. 643-653.  aAlthough genotypic and phenotypic markers are used to describe genetic diversity, describing patterns of variationattributable to geographic differentiation is complex.We examined concordance between morphologic and RAPDmarker classification of 33 wild red clover populations collected from the Caucasus Mountains, Russia andcompared how morphologic and RAPD markers differed in their correspondence to collection site attributes.Wealso examined if wild red clover populations collected from sites located in areas more conducive to gene flow (i.e.adjacent to roads, or drainage systems) had the same concordance between morphologic and RAPD markers aspopulations collected from sites less conducive to gene flow.We measured 15 morphologic traits in a commongarden and carried out a Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. There was a significantdifference among the 33 populations for 14 out of 15 morphological traits. Morphology clustered the populationsinto classes that corresponded to three climate regimes. Classification schemes generated by morphologic andRAPD data did not coincide. Morphologic data corresponded with site data for populations collected at all sites.RAPD data corresponded to site data for only those populations collected at sites not conducive to gene flow. Apopulation's adaptation to collection site needs to be considered in using neutral markers to effectivelydiscriminating geographic differentiation.We discuss the practical lessons of this study on the effective collection,conservation and use of plant genetic resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium pratense 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic variation 3aphylogeny 3aplant morphology 3ageographical variation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arain 3aRussia1 aGrit︠s︡enko, M.,1 aVandemark, G.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2004 Sept., v. 51, no. 6 p.643-653dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/206373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:GRES.0000024655.48989.ab3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03341naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520189800311592002802209650001402237650001902251650002702270650001202297650001102309650001602320650001902336650001002355650001402365650001102379650001102390650001202401650001202413650001602425650001302441651002202454653003102476653001102507653001702518653001002535653001802545653003402563700002502597700002302622773009502645856008602740852000902826655001202835IND60688575420200616000000.0200429e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068857542DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2019.15986522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, Ashleigh K.10aSurveying Attitudes toward Reptiles on Roads: Questionnaire Responses Do Not Directly Translate to Behavioral Action  ap. 333-346.  aRoads pose significant threats to reptiles, and understanding the varying perceptual biases of motorists to different taxa may help determine management strategies for urban roads around important refuges such as wetlands. We surveyed Western Australian motorists online, asking them to rank their degree of concern for animal welfare, vehicle damage, and personal safety when hypothetically involved in a vehicle collision with 10 different animal taxa, including reptiles. Respondents also ranked their rescue likelihood for these taxa. We then observed motorist responses to snakes and lizards in the field, where we placed rubber models and controls on the shoulder of an urban road bordering a wetland in Perth, Western Australia. We also estimated the probability of a reptile being struck while crossing the study road at two different road vehicle densities. The online survey respondents claimed high mean concern for the welfare of animals on roads (M = 8.02 ± 2.73 SD out of 10) and low concern for vehicle damage (M = 2.87 ± 2.75) and personal safety (M = 2.91 ± 2.88). Respondents also claimed high mean rescue likelihood (M = 7.06 ± 3.40). In contrast, motorists observed in the field generally ignored objects, including reptiles, on the roadside (79% of n = 1,500). There were no observed intentional strikes on reptiles, one motorist made a rescue attempt (bobtail lizard), and all other responses were to slow down or move away from the treatment. Estimates of strike probability for a reptile crossing the study road at a low traffic volume (2.23 vehicles·min⁻¹) was > 75% for slow-moving (1 m·min⁻¹) reptiles, but reduced to ≤ 16% if they were moving quickly (60 m·min⁻¹). Although motorists did not intentionally strike model reptiles, surveyed attitudes did not directly translate to behavioral action, and crossing a road is risky for an urban reptile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3alizards 3amodels 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3aroads 3aroadsides 3arubber 3asnakes 3asurveys 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awetlands 3aWestern Australia 0ahuman–animal interaction 0alizard 0aroad ecology 0asnake 0aurban ecology 0avehicle– wildlife collision1 aFleming, Patricia A.1 aBateman, Philip W.0 tAnthrozoös.g2019 May 4, v. 32, no. 3 p.333-346dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2019.15986523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011000161300001600271520118500287592002801472650002901500650002401529650001301553650001601566650001601582650001701598650000901615650001501624650002801639650001201667650001501679650001001694650001801704650002001722650002101742653001801763653000901781653001401790653001601804653001701820653001801837653001201855700001401867773012301881856008102004852000902085655001202094IND60786489720221120185419.0220803e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648972DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildiz, H.10aPathological effects of Arcobacter cryaerophilus infection in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum)  ap. 191-199.  aArcobacter cryaerophilus was isolated from naturally infected rainbow trout(Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), and its pathogenicity was tested by intramuscular injection into 40 healthy 1-year-old rainbow trout at 16°C. The lethal dosage of 50% end point (LD₅₀) for A. cryaerophilus was calculated 2.25 × 10⁴ viable cells.Experimental infection caused deaths with gross clinical abnormalities such as degenerated opercula and gills, liver damage, haemorrhagic kidney and serous fluid in swollen intestines. The counts of A. cryaerophilus in kidney, liver and gills of experimentally infected fish ranged from 1.59 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units (cfu)/g to 7.41 × 10¹² cfu/g. The means of erythrocyte (RBC) count, haematocrit level, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin and total protein concentrations in the blood of the experimentally infected rainbow trout group were significantly lower than in the healthy fish. Leukocyte (WBC) counts of the experimentally infected rainbow trout were significantly higher than those of healthy fish. The present work shows that the selected blood characteristics may be good indicators of response to infections in rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArcobacter cryaerophilus 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalbumins 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3ahematocrit 3aintramuscular injection 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3aliver 3apathogenicity 3aprotein content 3atriacylglycerols 0arainbow trout 0aLD50 0aleukocyte 0ahaematocrit 0atriglyceride 0atotal protein 0aalbumin1 aAydin, S.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2006 June 1, v. 54, no. 2 p.191-199dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010100169300001600270520103500286592002801321650002201349650001501371650001301386650001901399650001201418650001201430650001901442650001401461650002301475650001301498650002001511650001901531650001201550650001301562650001901575650001401594650001201608650002001620651001101640700002601651700002501677700001401702700002601716700002301742700006201765700002501827773016801852856008002020852000902100655001202109IND60601965120180822000000.0180709e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060196512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b045712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatveyeva, Anna N.10aFluidized-Bed Isobutane Dehydrogenation over Alumina-Supported Ga2O3 and Ga2O3–Cr2O3 Catalysts  ap. 927-938.  aDehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene over supported gallium oxide microspherical catalysts was investigated in a fluidized-bed reactor. A partially crystallized nanostructured aluminum hydroxide-oxide, which is a product of gibbsite centrifugal thermal activation (CTA) obtained using a CEFLAR technology, was used as a catalyst support. The structural and textural properties of Ga₂O₃/Al₂O₃ catalysts were characterized by a range of techniques including XRD, N₂-physisorption, TPD of NH₃ and CO₂, IRS of adsorbed pyridine, and selective adsorption of a series of acid–base indicators. A Ga–Al oxide catalyst exhibited a stable performance close to activity of Cr–Al oxide catalysts not containing soluble hexavalent chromium. Upon addition of Cr₂O₃ (6 wt % of Cr), in amounts lower than in an industrial chromia/alumina catalyst (10.9% Cr), and 1% ZrO₂ to 6%Ga/Al₂O₃ catalytic activity in isobutane dehydrogenation reaches the performance of the industrial KDM catalyst (“Sintez”, Russia).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aammonia 3abutanes 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3adehydrogenation 3afluidized beds 3agallium 3agibbsite 3aprocess design 3apyridines 3atexture 3azirconium oxide 3aRussia1 aZaitseva, Nadezhda A.1 aMäki-Arvela, Päivi1 aAho, Atte1 aBachina, Anastasia K.1 aFedorov, Sergey P.1 aMurzin, Dmitry Yu.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0788-26431 aPakhomov, Nikolai A.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 57, no. 3 p.927-938dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b045713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245010100159300001600260520137600276592002801652650001701680650001001697650001301707650001201720650001901732650002001751650001101771650001301782650001401795650001601809650001901825653001901844653001201863653001601875653003901891700001601930700001501946773012301961856008102084852000902165655001202174IND60786489820221120185436.0220803e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078648982DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcal, N.10aProliferative response by the ostrich proventriculus in idiopathic gastric stasis: A case report  ap. 213-220.  aIn this report, the late clinical, necropsy, and histopathological findings of idiopathic gastric stasis in an ostrich are described, with special attention to the proventriculus. An ostrich with clinical signs of gastric stasis was brought to our clinic in a state of impending death that could not be reversed with emergency medical care. At necropsy, the koilin layer of the gizzard was uneven without ulcerations. The proventriculus was distended with food items without impaction and mucosal lesions. None of the most typical aetiological factors including foreign objects, Macrorhabdus ornithogaster and parasitic infection with Libyo­stron­gylus douglassii was present. Histologically, the proventriculus was characterised by hyperplastic mucosa with luminal buds and necrotic cells in the lumen. Immunochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed a high rate of proliferation in epithelial cells of the glandular and mucosal lining in the proventriculus neighbouring the affected gizzard: approximately 88.6% of the cells were immunoreactive as compared to 34.4% of the cells in control ostriches used for comparison. In conclusion, in the absence of gizzard contraction, the mucosal lining of the proventriculus is hyperplastic with a high rate of proliferation that may help compensate the distension due to the accumulation of food items.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeath 3aetiology 3agizzard 3ahistopathology 3aimmunochemistry 3amucosa 3anecropsy 3aostriches 3aparasitoses 3aproventriculus 0agastric stasis 0aostrich 0ahyperplasia 0aproliferating cell nuclear antigen1 aKarahan, S.1 aAtmaca, T.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2006 June 1, v. 54, no. 2 p.213-220dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.54.2006.2.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011500166300001600281520164000297592002801937650002401965650002001989650001702009650001402026650001502040650001802055650002302073650001902096650002102115650001402136650001902150650000902169650000702178650002402185650002702209650001602236650002402252653001202276653002902288653004302317653001902360653002502379653003202404700001702436700001502453700002002468773010202488856008602590852000902676655001202685IND60636659520221120135920.0190509e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063665952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zihao10aGenipin-crosslinked ovotransferrin particle-stabilized Pickering emulsions as delivery vehicles for hesperidin  ap. 561-573.  aThe present work aimed to fabricate genipin-crosslinked ovotransferrin (OVT) particle-stabilized Pickering emulsions as delivery vehicles for hesperidin. Nearly monodisperse ovotransferrin colloidal particles were prepared by employing genipin crosslinking, and reaction mechanism for the crosslinking of ovotransferrin with genipin was proposed. Genipin-crosslinked OVT particles were found to be efficient Pickering stabilizers at different oil fractions, and high internal phase Pickering emulsions (oil fraction φ = 0.75) with emulsified phase volume fraction of 100% could be solely stabilized by these particles. Visual observation and microscopic image indicated that genipin-crosslinked OVT particle-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsion (particle concentration c = 2.0 wt%, oil fraction φ = 0.75) was stable during one-month storage at room temperature. Optical microscopy and rheological measurements revealed that microstructures and rheological properties of genipin-crosslinked OVT particle-stabilized Pickering emulsions were dependent on both protein particle concentration and internal oil phase volume fraction. Genipin-crosslinked OVT particle-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsions were also stable at various pHs (2.0–4.0) and ionic strengths (0–200 mM). Optical microscopy showed that increase of pH or ionic strength resulted in a slight decrease in emulsion droplet sizes. In vitro digestion study showed that these OVT particles-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsions could improve both extent of lipolysis and hesperidin bioaccessibility significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abioavailability 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3ahesperidin 3ahydrocolloids 3ain vitro digestion 3aionic strength 3alight microscopy 3alipolysis 3amicrostructure 3aoils 3apH 3areaction mechanisms 3arheological properties 3astabilizers 3astorage temperature 0aGenipin 0aOvotransferrin particles 0aHigh internal phase pickering emulsion 0aMicrostructure 0aRheological property 0aHesperidin bioaccessibility1 aCheng, Yujia1 aZhu, Jieyu1 aHuang, Qingrong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Sept., v. 94 p.561-573dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012100176300001600297506002800313520204800341592002802389506003702417650002502454650001102479650001102490650001402501650001602515650001402531650002402545650001602569650001402585650001402599653001602613653001402629653001502643653001302658653002202671653001902693653001402712653001702726700002102743700002002764700002102784700002102805773018602826856009003012852000903102655001203111IND60777264520221207112916.0211220e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726452DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2021-3-174-1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaydayuk, E.

Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis West.) is a harmful disease of cereal crops. Significant yellow rust in cidence has systematically been registered on VIR’s experimental fields in Derbent (Dagestan) and Pushkin (North western Russia). Resistance assessment and subsequent selection of resistance sources for breeding require proper monitoring of the virulence in the pathogen’s local populations. The purpose of this work was to characterize the virulence of P. striiformis on VIR’s experimental fields in Derbent and Pushkin, and use molecular markers to find out whether the studied P. striiformis isolates belong to any of the most dangerous invasive groups PstS1 and PstS2.Materials and methods. In Derbent, leaves with uredinio pustules were collected from bread and durum wheat accessions; in Pushkin, from bread wheat and triticale plants. The pathogen’s virulence was analyzed in the laboratory using the world and European sets of differential cultivars, and isogenic Avocet Yr lines. In 2020, the resistance of differential sets was tested in the field in Derbent under a high natural infection pressure. SCAR markers were used to identify the invasive PstS1 and PstS2 isolates. Results and conclusion. A total of 18 phenotypes (races) of striiformis were identified (4 in Derbent, and 14 in Pushkin). The Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr17, Yr24 and Yr26 genes manifested high effectiveness in both locations. In the field, immune responses were observed in the Avocet lines with the Yr5, Yr7, Yr8, Yr10, Yr15, Yr24 and YrAR genes, and in the differential cvs. ‘Vilmorin 23’, ‘Moro’, ‘Reichersberg 42’, ‘Heines Peko’, ‘Nord Desprez’, ‘Compare’, ‘Carstens V’, ‘Spaldings Prolific’ and ‘Heines VII’. Moderate resistance was recorded for the line Jupateco 73R (damage up to 5%), and cvs. ‘Heines Kolben’ and ‘Strubes Dickkopf’ (5–10%). Using molecular markers, 2 isolates from the invasive group PstS2 were identified in the Pushkin collection of P. striiformis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aRussia 3abreads 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3apathogens 3apopulation genetics 3astripe rust 3atriticale 3avirulence 0ayellow rust 0avirulence 0aresistance 0ayr genes 0atriticum aestivum 0atriticum durum 0atriticale 0ascar markers1 aYakovleva, D.

Seventy-five patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer-related lymphedema were divided into two groups in accordance with the patients’ treatment choices: the treatment group (n = 50) underwent bloodletting puncture and cupping every 5 days for 15 min/session (one session per day) combined with exercise training once a day for 30 minutes; the control group (n = 25) underwent the same exercise training alone. Evaluation indexes were measured before and after treatment; these included arm circumference (at the wrist crease, 10 cm distal to the wrist crease, the elbow crease, and 10 cm distal to the elbow crease) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain. The safety of the treatment was also evaluated.The treatment period was 50 days for all 75 patients. At the end of the treatment period, the mean reduction in arm circumference was 1.21 (0.65) cm the treatment group, and 0.58 (0.78) cm in the control group. Compared with the control group, the treatment group had a significantly greater reduction in arm circumference (P = .03) and a significantly lower VAS score for pain (P = .01). No patient in either group experienced any adverse events.Bloodletting puncture and cupping effectively reduces arm circumference and relieves upper limb pain in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Our results provide sufficient basis for exploring cupping as long-term therapy for managing breast cancer-related lymphedema.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aadjuvants 3aarm circumference 3abreasts 3aexercise 3afemales 3ahospitals 3apain 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3aChina 0aBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) 0aBloodletting puncture and cupping 0aEffect observation1 aZhang, Yanran1 aYang, Ming1 aLiu, Yufei1 aZhu, Yutian1 aFan, Yingyi1 aLi, Qian1 aPei, Xiaohua0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2018 July, v. 5, no. 3 p.255-263dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001600273520141500289592002801704650002001732650001201752650001301764650001001777650001401787650000901801650002501810650001001835650002301845650000901868650001101877650001101888653001301899653002201912653002201934653001401956653002301970653002201993700002002015700006802035773012002103856008302223852000902306655001202315IND60743010220221122225043.0210729e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074301022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAditya, Sanprit10aUtilization of eggshell waste in calcium-fortified foods and other industrial applications: A review  ap. 422-432.  aGreater consumption and utilization of chicken eggs worldwide prompts an expanded amount disposed of egg waste, mainly eggshell and eggshell membrane. The significant challenge with the generation of these massive waste products is the environmental impact. From an industrial point of view, when the production of chicken eggs tempts to rise, the quantity of eggshell residue is also increased. Being rich in organic and inorganic compounds, the eggshell wastes, which are primarily considered waste and of no value, could be utilized in various forms.In this review, information about the potential of eggshell waste to be converted into a bioavailable source of calcium for food fortification is reviewed. Its potential applications in other fields such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture were discussed. In addition to this, several eggshell calcium-based novel fortified products were also reviewed.Key findings and conclusions: Bioavailable salts can be used to fortify food products like cakes, yogurt, sausages, biscuits, and coffee. Besides, eggshells can be used as soil enhancers and also as animal feed. Based on this literature review, cheaply available and easier to extract eggshell calcium can provide an ideal alternative source of natural calcium in an environmentally safe way. All the products and processes suggested in this paper present high economic, health, and environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3achickens 3adrugs 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aenvironmental impact 3afeeds 3afood fortification 3asoil 3awastes 3ayogurt 0aEggshell 0aEggshell membrane 0aCalcium carbonate 0aReactions 0aFortified products 0aWaste utilization1 aStephen, Jaspin1 aRadhakrishnan, Mahendran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8819-10130 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Sept., v. 115 p.422-432dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.06.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245013300161300001800294520107500312592002801387650002201415650002201437650001201459650001901471650001201490650001901502650002601521700005501547700001501602700001901617700001201636700001801648773017001666856008001836852000901916655001201925IND60601965220221122234558.0180709e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060196522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b045722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wenhua10aProcess Analysis on Preparation of Cyclobutanetetracarboxylic Dianhydride in a Photomicroreactor within Gas–Liquid Taylor Flow  ap. 2476-2485.  aCyclobutanetetracarboxylic dianhydride (CBDA) was prepared by photodimerization of maleic anhydride in capillary microreactors within Taylor flow under UV irradiation. Both inert gas and ultrasound were introduced into this photochemical process to avoid the potential channel clogging resulting from the CBDA deposition. Higher input power of the Hg lamp, lower reactant concentration, longer residence time, and smaller inner diameter of the capillary were found to result in higher CBDA yield. The yield of CBDA could reach as high as 66.3% at an actual residence time of 30 min in the capillary microreactor with 0.5 mm inner diameter. According to the analysis of energy conversion, only low effective photoelectric transformation efficiencies could be achieved in this photochemical process. However, the photonic efficiency for this photodimerization carried out in capillary photomicroreactors was much higher compared to batch photoreactors and was comparable with that for other photochemical transformations using similar photomicroreactors and light sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3amaleic anhydrides 3amercury 3aphotochemistry 3aphotons 3aprocess design 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSu, Yuanhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0718-301X1 aSong, Yang1 aShang, Minjing1 aZha, Li1 aLü, Qinghua,0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 57, no. 7 p.2476-2485dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b045723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011700176300001600293506002800309520200500337592002802342506003702370650002502407650002202432650001002454650001102464650002202475650002702497653001402524653001402538653001702552653001702569700001802586700001802604700001902622700002402641773018602665856009002851852000902941655001202950IND60777264620221207104843.0220419e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726462DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2022-1-188-1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavrilova, O.

Comparative palynomorphological studies of naturally occurring and introduced Pterocarya Kunth representatives reveal the taxonomic significance of pollen morphological features and pollen characters of cultivated plants. The quality of pollen material and the potential of the plants from the Botanical Garden of BIN RAS for introduction are characterized.Materials and methods. Pollen grains were investigated using light, confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopes. Fertility was assessed using the standard acetocarmine method.Results. Comparison of pollen morphology in cultivated and naturally growing plants of this genus was made for the first time. Pollen fertility of two cultivated species (Pterocarya rhoifolia Siebold et Zucc., and P. stenoptera DC.) was very high, generally over 90%. Fertility of P. fraxinifolia (Lam.) Spach grains varied from 28 to 73% in different years, which is a low or medium level of pollen quality. Morphologically, pollen grains of all 12 specimens from five taxa are flattened, medium sized, 21–45 μm in diameter, with 4–8 pores; pores are located mainly at or near the equator. The pores are round or oval, with a limbus. Exine is three-layered, thickened near the pore. The sculpture is microechinate. The low-fertile P. fraxinifolia specimen contains small pollen grains, as well as grains in tetrads and dyads. The data on the introduction of the genus in St. Petersburg are presented.Conclusion. The palynonomophological description is diagnostic for the genus Pterocarya. The Pterocarya pollen is well distinguishable from other wind-pollinated taxa; however, species identification by pollen for spore-pollen analysis is not practicable. Morphologically, the most diverse are the grains of the low fertile specimen P. fraxinifolia. The limited possibility of seed propagation of P. fraxinifolia is probably explained by low pollen fertility. The pollen quality of the introduced P. rhoifolia and P. stenoptera is high.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPterocarya rhoifolia 3abotanical gardens 3aexine 3apollen 3apollen morphology 3aspecies identification 0asporoderm 0afertility 0areproduction 0aintroduction1 aFirsov, G.

For arthropod weed biocontrol agents established in New Zealand between 1929 and 2010, the probability of host use was positively correlated with relative performance for both no-choice starvation tests and no-choice oviposition tests. Moreover, multiplying together the relative performance scores for no-choice starvation and oviposition tests to create a combined risk score for no-choice tests resulted in a clear-cut threshold indicating that for scores between 0.21 and 0.33 the probability of host use (including minor spillover attack) occurring rose from close to zero to a virtual certainty. Choice oviposition test data showed a similar pattern to no-choice data, except there were two cases where host use occurred in the field on plant species that had very low relative performance scores in the choice tests. Both of these cases were associated with asynchrony between seed-feeding biocontrol agent activity and the reproductive phenology of the target plant, indicating that choice tests may be inappropriate for certain guilds of biocontrol agent that attack ephemeral plant structures.We conclude that quantitative laboratory testing data can help predict risk of non-target attack. The ability to refer to threshold relative performance scores when deciding whether an agent is safe to release has the potential to ensure fewer environmentally safe candidate biocontrol agents are erroneously rejected, thereby enhancing efficiency in the selection and approval of new agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acorrelation 3ahost range 3alaboratory experimentation 3aoviposition 3aphenology 3arisk 3astarvation 3aweeds 3aNew Zealand 0aNon-target attack 0aHost-range testing 0aSpecificity 0aRisk assessment 0aHost selection1 aFowler, Simon V.1 aGourlay, A.

Root Extract in Rats  ap. 3975-3982.  aSimultaneous detection of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in rat blood by in vivo microdialysis can provide important pharmacokinetics information. Microwave-assisted derivatization coupled with magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction was established for the determination of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 2′-Carbonyl-piperazine rhodamine B was first designed and synthesized as the derivatization reagent, which was easily adsorbed onto the surface of Fe₃O₄/graphene oxide. Simultaneous derivatization and extraction of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were performed on Fe₃O₄/graphene oxide. The permanent positive charge of the derivatization reagent significantly improved the ionization efficiencies. The limits of detection were 0.025 and 0.020 ng/mL for oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, respectively. The validated method was shown to be promising for sensitive, accurate, and simultaneous determination of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid.

The assessment utilised an integrated system dynamics model (86 equations) to examine the broad and long-term group decision outcomes. This model considers aspects usually neglected in related studies, such as the dynamics of the main local prices, the dynamics of the number of active farmers, the supplementary feeding of livestock, and certain behavioural traits of farmers and traders. The assessment procedure was based on an analysis of the outcomes of the model under 330,000 simulation scenarios.The results indicated that only if all the farmers in an area are either opportunistic or conservative that is, are either responsive or unresponsive to expected profits, the exploitation of the grazing resources were optimal in some senses. A widespread opportunism proved optimal only from an economic viewpoint. However, it is very unlikely that most of the farmers would agree to be opportunistic in practice. By contrast, a widespread conservatism, which in principle is perfectly feasible, proved optimal from economic, social, and ecological perspectives. Notably, it was found that the presence of a relatively small number of opportunistic farmers would suffice to considerably reduce the economic results of widespread conservatism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercial farms 3adecision making 3adietary supplements 3adynamic models 3aequations 3afarmers 3aforage 3aforage production 3agrazing 3alivestock 3aprices 3aprofits and margins 3arangelands 3atemporal variation 0aRangeland management 0aGroup decision-making strategies 0aRangeland modelling 0aIntegrated model1 aValderrama, J.

We investigated the presence and distribution of Anaplasma spp. in cattle from 6 provinces in Turkey. For amplification of the segment spanning the V1 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of Anaplasma species, a reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay was performed on 389 blood samples. RLB identified Anaplasma infections in 9.0% (35/389) of the samples. The most frequently found species was A. marginale (11/389, 2.8%), followed by A. centrale (4/389, 1.0%) and A. phagocytophilum (4/389, 1.0%). Eighteen of 35 PCR-positive samples gave positive signals to the catch-all probes, but did not show any response to the species-specific probes tested. Sequencing results of 5 representative amplicons randomly selected from these specimens indicated that 3 were 100% identical to the sequence of A. ovis, and the other 2 sequences were 99.5% identical to the sequence of Ehrlichia sp. Omatjenne strain. The results further confirmed that A. ovis and Ehrlichia sp.

The owners of the horses were asked to answer an online questionnaire about the horses' environment and the management practices of the stable. The results of fecal examination and the survey were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different risk factors as ascertained by the survey on parasite prevalence. The prevalence of Parascaris spp. infections at 11.5% was lower than expected based on previous research and the strongyle prevalence of 57.6% was found in young Finnish horses. Strongyloides westeri and Eimeria leuckarti infections were also found. Pasture hygiene had a stronger influence on the prevalence of strongyle infections than on Parascaris spp. infections, whereas the hygiene routine of the horses' housing was found to be more important in the prevention of Parascaris spp. infections.

However, device integration remains a large challenge, and the structure-dependent performance of the device has been seldom studied. Here, we report the in situ integration of 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl]squaraine (SQ)-nanowire (NW)-array-based photodetectors by growing the organic NW arrays on prefabricated electrodes through an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. In contrast with ohmic-contact devices, asymmetric electrode pairs of Au–Ti were utilized to achieve the construction of Schottky-type photodetectors on the basis of organic NW arrays. Significantly, the Schottky-type photodetectors exhibited a significantly enhanced performance as compared to the ohmic-type devices in terms of their higher photosensitivity and switching speed. The presence of a strong built-in electric field at the junction interface, which greatly facilitated the separation/transportation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, was suggested to be responsible for the superior performance of the Schottky-type photodetectors. More importantly, the organic NW-array-based devices also showed a higher sensitivity and reproducibility than that of the single NW-based devices, and they were capable of low-light detection. The investigation of the photodetector circuitry also disclosed a very low pixel-to-pixel variation owing to the average effect of the NW-array-based devices. It is expected that organic NW-array-based Schottky-type photodetectors will have important applications in future organic nano-optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3aphotosensitivity 3atransportation 0aSQ nanowires 0aorganic nanowire arrays 0aself-assembly 0aSchottky diodes 0aphotodetectors1 aDeng, Wei1 aZhang, Xiujuan1 aZhang, Xiwei1 aZhang, Xiaohong1 aXing, Yuliang1 aJie, Jiansheng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 5, no. 23 p.12288-12294dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam402087v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001600256520172200272592002801994650002502022650001802047650001302065650001502078650001302093650001802106650001102124650002202135650001302157650001002170650001002180650001302190650001902203650001902222700002402241700001702265700001802282700001902300700002002319700002002339700001702359773010802376856008102484852000902565655001202574IND60520148620221119233937.0160514e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052014862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-016-0474-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Zuben, L. G.10aInterspecific chemical communication in raids of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao  ap. 339-347.  aMost social bees collect floral resources to obtain proteins and carbohydrates. However, the obligate cleptoparasite stingless bee Lestrimelitta limao, the so-called robber bee, is a rare exception as it collects resources by raiding other stingless bee nests. The mechanisms these bees use to overcome host colony defenses are poorly understood. Many host species retreat inside the nest during L. limao attacks and the signals triggering this behavior require a better understanding. While some researchers have proposed that robber bees release chemical compounds that are responsible for host retreat, others have hypothesized that the observed behavior results from communication among host workers. In order to investigate the role of interspecific signals in raids, we tested the effects of robber bees’ mandibular and labial gland secretions on the behavior of Frieseomelitta varia workers. We combined behavioral assays with chemical and electrophysiological analyses. We found that citral and 9-nonacosene are major mandibular gland compounds and two esters, hexadecyl acetate and 9-hexadecenyl acetate, are major labial gland compounds. These three major compounds elicited electro-physiological responses on host worker antennae. Robber bee labial gland extracts repelled both foragers and guards, while mandibular gland content increased aggression. Our results suggest that interspecific communication plays a role during natural raids and that esters from L. limao labial glands, rather than citral, are more likely to trigger the host retreat. The results add to our knowledge about L. limao chemical communication and help to elucidate the mechanisms involved in their intriguing foraging strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrieseomelitta varia 3aLestrimelitta 3aacetates 3aaggression 3aantennae 3acarbohydrates 3acitral 3aelectrophysiology 3aforaging 3ahosts 3anests 3aproteins 3asocial insects 3astingless bees1 aSchorkopf, D.

Multiple interventions during intensive care increases potential for drug interactions. In this setting, high-dose caffeine used for apnea in premature infants may increase acetaminophen toxicity by inhibiting ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene activity during DNA damage response. To define caffeine and acetaminophen interaction, we modeled infantile prematurity in late-gestation fetal stage through human immortalized hepatocytes and liver organoids. The acute toxicity studies included assays for cell viability, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATM pathway-related DNA damage. Fetal cells expressed hepatobiliary properties, albeit with lower metabolic, synthetic and antioxidant functions than more mature hepatocytes. Acetaminophen in IC50 amount of 7.5 millimolar caused significant oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential impairments, and DNA breaks requiring ATM-dependent repair. Caffeine markedly exacerbated acetaminophen toxicity by suppressing ATM activity in otherwise nontoxic 2.5 millimolar amount. Similarly, the specific ATM kinase antagonist, KU-60019, reproduced this deleterious interaction in 5 micromolar amount. Replicative stress from combined acetaminophen and caffeine toxicity depleted cells undergoing DNA synthesis in S phase and activated checkpoints for G0/G1 or G2/M restrictions. Synergistic caffeine and acetaminophen toxicity in liver organoids indicated these consequences should apply in vivo. The antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, decreased oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATM pathway disruption to mitigate caffeine and acetaminophen toxicity. We concluded that hepatic DNA damage, mitochondrial impairment and growth-arrest after combined caffeine and acetaminophen toxicity will be harmful for premature infants. Whether caffeine and acetaminophen toxicity may alter outcomes in subsequently encountered hepatic disease needs consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA replication 3aacetaminophen 3aacetylcysteine 3aacute toxicity 3aantagonists 3aantioxidants 3aapnea 3acaffeine 3acell viability 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterphase 3aliver 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aorganoids 3aoxidative stress 3apremature birth 3arisk 0aALF 0aAPAP 0aATM 0aCx 0aCYP 0aDDR 0aDHR 0aDILI 0aDPPIV 0aEp-CAM 0aG6P 0aGGT 0ahTERT 0aMMP 0aNAC 0aROS 0aSOD 0aDNA damage response 0aHepatotoxicity 0aLiver growth 0aPremature infants 0aStem cells1 aGupta, Priya1 aSharma, Yogeshwar1 aMaisuradze, Luka1 aBandi, Sriram1 aGupta, Sanjeev1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5818-72800 tToxicology.g2021 June 15, v. 457 p.152811-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011200169300001400281520188300295592002802178650002502206650002202231650001402253650001402267650001102281650001602292650001002308650003002318650001002348650003002358650001202388650001302400650001402413650001602427650001102443650001502454650002002469650002902489650001302518653002202531653002502553653001402578653001402592653002202606653000902628700002202637700002302659700002102682773009102703856008102794852000902875655001202884IND60543542820221120052041.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054354282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2015.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, Margaret E.10aDistinct roles for the p53-like transcription factor XprG and autophagy genes in the response to starvation  ap. 10-18.  aAutophagy and autolysis are two cannibalistic pathways which allow filamentous fungi to obtain nutrients once environmental nutrient sources are exhausted. In Aspergillus nidulans, the effects of mutations in two key autophagy genes, atgA, the ATG1 ortholog, and atgH, the ATG8 ortholog, were compared with mutations in xprG, which encodes a transcriptional activator that plays a key role in autolysis. The anti-fungal drug rapamycin induces autophagy in a range of organisms. Mutations in atgA and atgH did not alter sensitivity to rapamycin, which inhibits growth and asexual spore production (conidiation), indicating that autophagy is not required for rapamycin sensitivity in A. nidulans. In contrast, inhibition of conidiation by rapamcyin was partially suppressed by the xprG1 gain-of-function mutation, indicating that XprG acts in the pathway(s) affected by rapamycin. It was anticipated that the absence of an intact autophagy pathway would accelerate the response to starvation. However, extracellular and intracellular protease production in response to carbon or nitrogen starvation was not increased in the atgAΔ and atgHΔ mutants, and the onset of autolysis was not accelerated. Compared to wild-type strains and the xprGΔ and xprG1 mutants, conidiation of the autophagy mutants was reduced in carbon- or nitrogen-limiting conditions but not during growth on nutrient-sufficient medium. Nuclear localization of the global nitrogen regulator AreA in response to nitrogen starvation was blocked in the xprG2 loss-of-function mutant, but not in the atgHΔ mutant. Conversely, the atgAΔ mutation but not the xprGΔ mutation prevented vacuolar accumulation of GFP-AtgH, a hallmark of autophagy. These results indicate that in A. nidulans there is little interaction between autophagy and autolysis and the two pathways are activated in parallel during starvation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aantifungal agents 3aautolysis 3aautophagy 3acarbon 3aconidiation 3afungi 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aproteinases 3aspores 3astarvation 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3avacuoles 0aAreA localization 0aAspergillus nidulans 0aAutophagy 0aAutolysis 0aCarbon starvation 0aXprG1 aBuckland, Rebecca1 aHunter, Cameron C.1 aTodd, Richard B.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2015 Oct., v. 83 p.10-18dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2015.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013700168300001200305520218900317592002802506596005502534596005302589650002502642650002602667650001502693650001202708650002002720650001602740650001202756650001202768650001402780650001602794650002902810650001802839650001102857650001902868700001602887700004102903700003102944700002402975700001702999700002203016700001803038700001903056700002503075700002003100700002103120700002603141700002903167700002303196700002703219773011303246856008303359852000903442655001203451IND60695990020221120104748.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069599002DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04135-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuissou, Edwige10aEffect of irradiation on the survival and susceptibility of female Anopheles arabiensis to natural isolates of Plasmodium falciparum  ap. 266.  aBACKGROUND: The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a vector control strategy relying on the mass release of sterile males into wild vector populations. Current sex separation techniques are not fully efficient and could lead to the release of a small proportion of females. It is therefore important to evaluate the effect of irradiation on the ability of released females to transmit pathogens. This study aimed to assess the effect of irradiation on the survival and competence of Anopheles arabiensis females for Plasmodium falciparum in laboratory conditions. METHODS: Pupae were irradiated at 95 Gy of gamma-rays, and emerging females were challenged with one of 14 natural isolates of P. falciparum. Seven days post-blood meal (dpbm), irradiated and unirradiated-control females were dissected to assess the presence of oocysts, using 8 parasite isolates. On 14 dpbm, sporozoite dissemination in the head/thorax was also examined, using 10 parasites isolates including 4 in common with the 7 dpbm dissection (oocyst data). The survivorship of irradiated and unirradiated-control mosquitoes was monitored. RESULTS: Overall, irradiation reduced the proportion of mosquitoes infected with the oocyst stages by 17% but this effect was highly inconsistent among parasite isolates. Secondly, there was no significant effect of irradiation on the number of developing oocysts. Thirdly, there was no significant difference in both the sporozoite infection rate and load between the irradiated and unirradiated-control mosquitoes. Fourthly, irradiation had varying effects on female survival with either a negative effect or no effect. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of irradiation on mosquito competence strongly varied among parasite isolates. Because of such isolate variability and, the fact that different parasite isolates were used to collect oocyst and sporozoite data, the irradiation-mediated reduction of oocyst prevalence was not confirmed for the sporozoite stages. Our data indicate that irradiated female An. arabiensis could contribute to malaria transmission, and highlight the need for perfect sexing tools, which would prevent the release of females as part of SIT programmes.  aPublisher supplied data  a11-PDOC-006-01cAgence Nationale pour la Recherche  a16-CE35-0007cAgence Nationale pour la Recherche 3aAnopheles arabiensis 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3adissection 3afemales 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3amalaria 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3asporozoites 3asterile insect technique 3asurvival rate 3athorax 3avector control1 aPoda, Serge1 ade Sales Hien, Domombabele François1 aYerbanga, Serge Rakiswende1 aDa, Dari Frédéric1 aCohuet, Anna1 aFournet, Florence1 aRoux, Olivier1 aMaiga, Hamidou1 aDiabaté, Abdoulaye,1 aGilles, Jeremie1 aBouyer, Jérémy1 aOuédraogo, Anicet G.1 aRayaissé, Jean-Baptiste1 aLefèvre, Thierry,1 aDabiré, Kounbobr Roch0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.266-266dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04135-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001400161245008000175300001600255500000900271520166700280592002801947650002301975650001301998650001902011650001202030650002202042650002802064650002602092650002002118650003102138650001602169650000902185650000902194650003102203650001302234650001402247650001302261650001302274650001702287650001402304650001102318650002402329650001602353650001202369650001702381650002402398651001502422700001802437700001602455773014702471856009602618852000902714655001202723IND60668760620221119175150.0191125e197405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066876062DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1974.03615995003800030025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelez, J.10aLime Induced Plant Growth Depression in an Alluvial Entisol from Costa Rica  ap. 460-464.  aepub  aPoor plant growth in field experiments following clearing of a forested virgin Entisol in eastern Costa Rica and the subsequent detrimental effect of lime on growth of warm-season grasses were studied in greenhouse and laboratory experiments. Greenhouse experiments were carried out with pangolagrass (Digitaria decumbens Stent) by sterilizing a virgin surface soil, limed with 0, 4, and 8 meq/100 g of CaCO₃, with heat and gamma radiation. Incubation experiments in the laboratory were conducted with a differentially limed surface soil that had been in pasture for 8 years and its subsoil. Every 2 weeks, for 10 weeks, samples from the incubating soils were extracted with water. Calcium, Mg, K, Na, NO₃, SO₄, P, and Cl were determined in the water extracts. Electrical conductivity in the soil was measured before and after water extractions. After 10 weeks of incubation, electrical conductivity was measured in saturated soil extracts. Soil organic matter was determined before and after incubation. The negative effect of lime persisted in the sterilized soils; however, water leaching of unlimed and limed virgin soils markedly improved pangolagrass growth. Laboratory studies showed considerable increases in water-extractable Ca, NO₃, and SO₄ ions with increasing lime rates and incubation time in the pasture surface soil and its subsoil. Electrolytes reached a maximum at 2 weeks of incubation. Conductivity measurements higher than 4 mmhos/cm in saturated soil extracts after 10 weeks of incubation indicated harmful concentrations of electrolytes which were apparently derived from lime and biological decomposition of soil organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDigitaria eriantha 3aEntisols 3abiodegradation 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield experimentation 3agamma radiation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3aions 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3apastures 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil organic matter 3asterilizing 3asubsoil 3avirgin soils 3awarm season grasses 3aCosta Rica1 aZantua, M.

Nevertheless, reports are limited on the occurrence and time-course of PFASs in breast milk, and most studies have focused on the analysis of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). In this study, 16 PFASs were analyzed in breast milk samples (n=293) collected from 128 mothers in Korea during various lactation periods to assess maternal exposure levels, contamination profiles, time-course variations, and infant health risks. The total concentrations of PFASs (ΣPFAS) ranged from 31.7 to 1004 (median: 188) ng/L, which was within the ranges recently reported for Asian and European populations. After a month of nursing, the concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and ΣPFAS significantly increased. This could be due to changes in the dietary and behavior patterns of the mothers after the first month of lactation. The concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were significantly correlated with maternal age, body mass index, and parity. Certain types of diet (e.g. consuming snacks and milk) and eating-out frequency were significantly associated with increasing levels of PFAS. Significant correlations and similar time-course trends were found between PFASs and PCBs/DDTs, implying similar exposure sources and biokinetics for these contaminants. The estimated daily intakes of PFOS and PFOA via the consumption of breast milk were below the tolerable daily intakes for infants suggested by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aaverage daily intake 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3adiet 3aeating out 3aexposure pathways 3afood safety 3alactation 3amaternal exposure 3amilk 3amothers 3aneonates 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 3asnacks 3aKorean Peninsula 0aPFOS 0aPFOA 0aPFNA 0aLactation 0aTolerable daily intake1 aKim, Sunmi1 aPark, Jeongim1 aKim, Hai-Joong1 aChoi, Gyuyeon1 aChoi, Sooran1 aKim, Sungjoo1 aKim, Su Young1 aKim, Sungkyoon1 aChoi, Kyungho1 aMoon, Hyo-Bang0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 612 p.286-292dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245011800209300001600327520128200343592002801625650002401653650002001677650001101697650002401708650001401732650001101746650001501757650002301772650002201795650001001817650002501827650001601852650001401868650004301882650001001925651000901935653001801944653001101962653001701973653001701990653002202007653002302029700002202052700002502074700006702099700002902166700002602195700001902221700002202240700002002262700002702282700002602309773013402335856008402469852000902553655001202562IND60616812020221120101419.0201206e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObregón, Dasiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5786-111410aMolecular evidence of the reservoir competence of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) for Anaplasma marginale in Cuba  ap. 180-187.  aWater buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a potential reservoir for Anaplasma marginale in livestock ecosystems of tropical countries. However, their participation in the epidemiological process of bovine anaplasmosis in endemic areas remains unclear. In the present study, the reservoir competence of water buffalo for A. marginale was explored by focusing on the analysis of rickettsemia levels in carrier animals, and the genetic characterization of A. marginale strains from cattle and buffalo. Eight groups of cattle and water buffaloes were randomly selected from cohabiting herds in four livestock ecosystems of Cuba, together with two control groups from unrelated cattle and buffalo herds. A total of 180 adult animals (88 water buffalo and 92 cattle) were sampled. Rickettsemia in carrier animals was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The rickettsemia (parasitemia) levels in cattle were higher than in buffaloes, however the rickettsemia in buffalo may be enough to infect R. microplus ticks. The genetic diversity of A. marginale was assessed by strain characterization and phylogenetic analysis of 27 msp1α gene sequences. The results showed genetic similarity among strains from cattle and water buffalo, suggesting the occurrence of cross-species transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aBubalus bubalis 3aadults 3abovine anaplasmosis 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3aecosystems 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3aherds 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasitemia 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aticks 3aCuba 0aWater buffalo 0aCattle 0aA. marginale 0aRickettsemia 0aGenetic diversity 0aCross-transmission1 aCorona, Belkis G.1 aFuente, José de la,1 aCabezas-Cruz, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8660-730X1 aGonçalves, Luiz Ricardo1 aMatos, Carlos Antonio1 aArmas, Yasmani1 aHinojosa, Yoandri1 aAlfonso, Pastor1 aOliveira, Márcia C.S.1 aMachado, Rosangela Z.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2018 Aug., v. 13 p.180-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010700169300001600276500001500292520214200307592002802449650001302477650001702490650001102507650001302518650001102531650001302542650001302555650002602568650002502594650001502619650001102634650001602645650001202661650000902673650001302682650002402695650001602719650001402735651001502749653002602764700002902790700001902819700002202838700002702860700002102887773009602908856008203004990002303086852000903109655001203118IND60094496220221122192925.0141104e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009449622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2012.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmart, Tracey I.10aInfluence of environment on walleye pollock eggs, larvae, and juveniles in the southeastern Bering Sea  ap. 196-207.  a2019-12-06  aWe examined the influence of environmental conditions on walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) early life history in discrete stages at two ecological scales using a 17-year time series from the southeastern Bering Sea. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to quantify relationships between walleye pollock stages (eggs, yolksac larvae, preflexion larvae, late larvae, and juveniles), the fine-resolution environment (temperature, wind speed, salinity, and copepod concentration), and the broad-resolution environment (annual spawning stock biomass, temperature, zooplankton biomass, and wind mixing). Early stages (eggs, yolksac larvae, and preflexion larvae) were associated with high spawning stock biomass, while late stages (late larvae and juveniles) were not associated with spawning stock biomass. The influence of temperature increased with ontogeny: high egg abundance was associated with temperatures from −2 to 7°C and negative annual temperature anomalies and high juvenile abundance was associated with temperatures from 4 to 12°C and positive temperature anomalies. Winds enhanced the transport of early stages from spawning locations to shallower sampling depths, but did not affect feeding stages (preflexion larvae, late larvae, and juveniles) in a manner consistent with the encounter-turbulence hypothesis. Feeding stages were positively associated with localized copepod concentrations but not zooplankton biomass anomaly, suggesting that the localized measurements of potential prey is a better indicator compared to broad-scale conditions measured in areas where these stages do not necessarily occur. Broad-resolution covariates, however, explained a greater portion of the overall variation than did fine-resolution models. Of the environmental conditions examined, temperature explained more variation in abundance of walleye pollock early life stages than any other covariate. Temperature is likely a major driving force structuring variability in populations of walleye pollock in their first year of life, acting directly upon them and indirectly upon their physical habitat and prey community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3alife history 3amixing 3asalinity 3amodels 3aontogeny 3aspawning 3aenvironmental factors 3atime series analysis 3awind speed 3alarvae 3atemperature 3abiomass 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3azooplankton 3ajuveniles 3aBering Sea 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aDuffy-Anderson, Janet T.1 aHorne, John K.1 aFarley, Edward V.1 aWilson, Christopher D.1 aNapp, Jeffrey M.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2012 June 15, v. 65-70 p.196-207dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2012.02.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015600167300001800323520133200341592002801673650001501701650001701716650001501733650001501748650001401763650001601777650001501793650001101808650002901819650004401848653001101892653001801903653001401921653001001935653001001945653001501955653001601970653001601986653001302002653002402015700001902039700006202058700006302120773014702183856008002330852000902410655001202419IND60604257120221120082315.0180716e20180209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060425712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b060252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Rebecca10aQuantitation of Oleuropein and Related Phenolics in Cured Spanish-Style Green, California-Style Black Ripe, and Greek-Style Natural Fermentation Olives  ap. 2121-2128.  aOleuropein, ligstroside, and related hydrolysis products are key contributors to olive bitterness, and several of these phenolics are implicated in the prevention of lifestyle age-related diseases. While table olive processing methods are designed to reduce oleuropein, the impact of processing on ligstroside and related hydrolysis products (e.g., oleacein, oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol glucoside, ligstroside aglycone, and oleuropein aglycone) is relatively unknown. Herein, levels of these compounds were measured in Spanish-style green (SP), Californian-style black ripe (CA), and Greek-style natural fermentation (GK) olives using rapid ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). GK olives had the highest concentration of all compounds measured, with the exception of oleocanthal, which was highest in SP olives (0.081 mg kg–¹ wet weight (w.wt)). CA olives had the lowest levels of most compounds measured, including ligstroside (0.115 mg kg–¹ w.wt) and oleuropein (0.974 mg kg–¹ w.wt). Hydroxytyrosol was the predominate compound in all three styles of commercial olives, with similar concentrations observed for GK and SP olives (134.329 and 133.685 mg kg–¹ w.wt, respectively) and significantly lower concentrations observed for CA olives (19.981 mg kg–¹ w.wt).  aPublisher supplied data 3abitterness 3afermentation 3aglucosides 3ahydrolysis 3alifestyle 3aoleocanthal 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aolives 0aOlea europaea 0aphenolics 0aUHPLC 0aMS/MS 0aoleuropein 0aoleocanthal 0aligstroside 0aoleacein 0aoleuropein aglycone1 aMelliou, Eleni1 aZweigenbaum, Jerry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3844-737X1 aMitchell, Alyson E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0286-52380 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Feb. 09, v. 66, no. 9 p.2121-2128dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b060253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002100186245015900207300001200366506007600378520138900454592002801843506003701871650002501908650001201933650002201945650001501967650001401982650002201996650001202018650001902030650001202049650002102061700002302082700002302105700002002128700002302148700002502171700002002196773010002216856007902316852000902395655001202404IND50070984820221207130222.0150211e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007098482DNAL7 a242457042pmid7 aPMC38435822pmcid7 a10.1186/1754-6834-6-1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancocci, Fedra10aAnalysis of pectin mutants and natural accessions of Arabidopsis highlights the impact of de-methyl-esterified homogalacturonan on tissue saccharification  ap. 382.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Plant biomass is a potentially important renewable source of energy and industrial products. The natural recalcitrance of the cell walls to enzymatic degradation (saccharification), which plants have evolved to defend themselves from biotic stresses, represents a major bottleneck for the industrial bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomasses. The identification of factors that influence the cell wall recalcitrance to saccharification may help to overcome the existing limitations that hamper the utilization of biomass. RESULTS: Here we have investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana the impact of homogalacturonan (HG) content and structure on tissue saccharification. We characterized mutants affected in genes encoding proteins involved in HG biosynthesis (quasimodo2-1; qua2-1) and methylesterification (pectin methylesterase 3; pme3). We also analyzed the natural variation of Arabidopsis through the characterization of a nested core collection of 24 accessions generated to maximize genetic variability. We found a negative correlation between the level of de-methyl-esterified HG (HGA) and cellulose degradability. CONCLUSIONS: We propose to use the level of HGA domains as a biochemical marker of the cell wall recalcitrance to saccharification. This may be utilized for selecting, on a large scale, natural variants or mutants with improved bioconversion features.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acell walls 3acellulose 3agenetic variation 3amutants 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3asaccharification1 aBastianelli, Elisa1 aLionetti, Vincenzo1 aFerrari, Simone1 aDe Lorenzo, Giulia1 aBellincampi, Daniela1 aCervone, Felice0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.382-382dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245008900170300001800259520125600277592002801533650004401561650002801605650002301633650002301656650001501679650001401694650004101708650000901749650001901758650001801777650004401795650002401839700002601863700002801889700002501917700003101942700002401973700002601997773013702023856008002160852000902240655001202249IND60580253120221120225934.0170914e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058025312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b067592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiganshin, Marat A.10aThermally Induced Self-Assembly and Cyclization of l-Leucyl-l-Leucine in Solid State  ap. 8603-8610.  aThermal treatment of oligopeptides is one of the methods for synthesis of organic nanostructures. However, heating may lead not only to self-assembly of the initial molecules, but also to chemical reactions resulting in the formation of new unexpected nanostructures or change in the properties of the existing ones. In the present work, the reaction of cyclization of dipeptide l-leucyl-l-leucine in solid state under heating was studied. The change in morphology of dipeptide thin film and formation of nanostructures after heating was visualized using atomic force microscopy. This method also was used for demonstration of differences in self-assembly of linear and cyclic dipeptides. The chemical structure of reaction product was characterized by NMR spectrometry, FTIR spectroscopy and GC–MS analysis. Kinetic parameters of cyclization were estimated within the approaches of the nonisothermal kinetics (“model-free” kinetics and linear regression methods for detection of topochemical equation). The results of present work are useful for explanation the changes in the properties of nanostructures based on short-chain oligopeptides, notably leucyl-leucine, after thermal treatment, as well as for the synthesis of cyclic oligopeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adipeptides 3aequations 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ananomaterials 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aregression analysis1 aSafiullina, Aisylu S.1 aGerasimov, Alexander V.1 aZiganshina, Sufia A.1 aKlimovitskii, Alexander E.1 aKhayarov, Khasan R.1 aGorbatchuk, Valery V.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 121, no. 36 p.8603-8610dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-61067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b067593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013400170300001400304520093700318592002801255650002501283650000801308650002201316650001701338650002601355650001101381650001001392651002601402651001101428700002401439700002001463700002201483773009901505856008401604852000901688655001201697IND60087113920221119221956.0141102e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008711392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouck, Julie A.10aLow-density microarrays for the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s.

In the hyperendemic Lyme disease regions of the eastern United States, nymphal Ixodes scapularis are the principal ticks transmitting the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). Approximately 25% of questing nymphs in endemic regions are infected with spirochetes. High throughput-sensitive and specific methods for testing nymphal I. scapularis for infection with B. burgdorferi are clearly needed. In the current study, we evaluated whether low-density microarrays could be adapted for the rapid and accurate detection and characterization of spirochetes in nymphal I. scapularis. Three different microarray platforms were developed and tested for the detection of spirochetes in ticks. They could both detect and differentiate different Borrelia genospecies, in one case detecting as few as a single copy of Borrelia DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aDNA 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3amicroarray technology 3anymphs 3aticks 3aEastern United States 3aEurope1 aHøjgaard, Andrias,1 aPiesman, Joseph1 aKuchta, Robert D.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2011 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.27-36dElsevier GmbHx1877-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245010200184300001400286520109500300592002801395650001601423650001101439650000901450650003501459650001001494650001601504650001901520650001601539650002701555650001301582651001101595653000901606653001701615653002701632700004101659700002101700700002501721700003601746700002801782773013101810856008401941852000902025655001202034IND60616812220221120131944.0200607e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2017.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelin, Aparecida de Fátima10aFactors associated with positivity for canine visceral leishmaniosis in an endemic area in Brazil  ap. 13-16.  aVisceral leishmaniosis (VL) is a public health problem and its occurrence depends primarily on the presence of the vector and susceptible hosts; in the urban environment, the dog is the main reservoir. This study aimed to analyze the distribution of canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) and factors associated with it in an urban area endemic for VL. Analysis of the variables was based on 2755 epidemiological records of dogs positive and negative for CVL over a three-year period (2009, 2010 and 2011). A dog was considered positive when it presented amastigotes in the cytological examination of lymph node biopsy and/or was seropositive by immunoenzymatic and indirect immunofluorescence assays. CVL positive dogs were observed throughout the town, but significant differences were observed between the sectors analyzed (P<0.0001), with two sectors showing higher positivity. CVL prevalence was 35.9% and was significantly associated with age and breed (P<0.0001). Concerning symptoms, 44.3% of symptomatic dogs were positive for LV (P<0.0001) in an urban area endemic for this zoonosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamastigotes 3abiopsy 3adogs 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahosts 3alymph nodes 3aseroprevalence 3aurban areas 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3azoonoses 3aBrazil 0aDogs 0aRisk factors 0aVisceral leishmaniosis1 aMaciel, Marilene Oliveira dos Santos1 aOkajima, Mashami1 aNunes, Cáris Maroni1 aPerri, Sílvia Helena Venturoli1 aBonfietti, Lucas Xavier0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2018 May, v. 12 p.13-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2017.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012800206300001800334520112400352592002801476650001901504650002201523650004101545650001001586650000801596650003101604650001001635650002601645650001401671650001101685650001601696650001101712650002801723650001001751650002901761650000801790650002501798650001301823653002801836653001901864653000801883653001001891653001401901653002301915653001201938653002101950653001301971653001901984653005302003653001302056653001602069700001902085700002002104700002602124773014802150856008002298852000902378655001202387IND60604257320221122233737.0180716e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060425732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b060362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaltner, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2697-746110aInfluence of Storage on the Stability of Toxic Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids and Their N-Oxides in Peppermint Tea, Hay, and Honey  ap. 5221-5228.  a1,2-Dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) and PA-N-oxides (PANO) are phytotoxins, which presumably occur in more than 6,000 plant species worldwide. Plants containing PA/PANO are responsible for various food and feed poisonings recorded for decades. Main reasons of exposition of consumers and livestock are contaminations of food and animal feed with parts, seeds, pollen, or nectar of PA-containing plants. Concerning stability, effects of processing on PA were mainly investigated in the past. The current study examined the behavior of PA/PANO in unprocessed matrices peppermint tea, hay, and honey during storage. Blank samples were fortified with PA/PANO or contaminated with blueweed (Echium vulgare) and ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and stored for 182 d. The time-series analysis using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) confirmed that all 25 analyzed PA/PANO compounds remained stable in herbal samples. However, the results showed a very fast decrease of PANO in honey samples within hours. These results were discussed with respect to potential consequences for health risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchium vulgare 3aJacobaea vulgaris 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3afeeds 3ahay 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahoney 3aliquid chromatography 3alivestock 3anectar 3aphytotoxins 3apollen 3apyrrolizidine alkaloids 3aseeds 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atea 3atime series analysis 3atoxicity 0apyrrolizidine alkaloids 0apeppermint tea 0ahay 0ahoney 0astability 0aMentha × piperita 0aragwort 0aSenecio jacobaea 0ablueweed 0aEchium vulgare 0aliquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry 0adecrease 0adegradation1 aRychlik, Mike,1 aGareis, Manfred1 aGottschalk, Christoph0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 66, no. 20 p.5221-5228dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b060363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010600168300001800274520124700292592002801539650001701567650003801584650001201622650002001634650001301654650001201667650001601679650001401695700001901709700002301728773013701751856008001888852000901968655001201977IND60580253320181116000000.0170914e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058025332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b074282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTermühlen, Frank10aIsothermal Titration Calorimetry to Probe the Coil-to-Globule Transition of Thermoresponsive Polymers  ap. 8611-8618.  aIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is introduced as a new way to study the effect of cosolutes on the coil-to-globule transition of thermoresponsive polymers. From isothermal titrations, critical cosolute concentrations can be identified, at which a coil-to-globule transition occurs. The concept of a temperature-dependent critical cosolute concentration is proven employing different isomers of dihydroxybenzene (DHB) and one isomer of hydroxy benzaldehyde (mHBA) in solutions of two thermoreversible polymer, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) and poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEAM). It is shown that the temperature-dependent critical cosolute concentration, determined by ITC, and the cosolute concentration-dependent critical temperature, probed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), yield the same phase diagram. The advantage of employing ITC is the ability to probe even critical concentrations at very low temperatures, whereas the corresponding critical temperatures are not easily accessible in DSC. In addition, kinetic information about the coil-to-globule transition in different systems is obtained, and the effect of the DHB isomers on the transition temperature is found to scale as ortho > para > meta.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aisomers 3aphysical phases 3apolymers 3asolutes 3atemperature 3atitration1 aKuckling, Dirk1 aSchönhoff, Monika0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 121, no. 36 p.8611-8618dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-61067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b074283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013800160300002000298520061100318592002800929650001100957650002100968650001900989650002201008650001801030650001401048650001201062650001101074650001201085650001301097653001701110653001401127653001201141653001401153653002101167653002001188700001201208700002301220700001801243700001901261773012601280856007501406852000901481655001201490IND60527549020221120163723.0160715e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052754902DNAL7 a10.1021/am402930b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chuanjian10aPreparation of Silicon@Silicon Oxide Core–Shell Nanowires from a Silica Precursor toward a High Energy Density Li-Ion Battery Anode  ap. 12340-12345.  aBulk-quantity silicon@silicon oxide nanowires have been successfully synthesized via a facile high-temperature approach using environment-friendly silica mixed with titanium powders.

The AESP biosorbent was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and pHZPC analyses. The average size of the biosorbent according to particle size distribution analysis was found to be ∼132 μm. The batch adsorption experiments were conducted by altering the parameters such as contact time, solution pH, biosorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, stirring speed and temperature. Sorption of cationic AO dye onto AESP was found to be rapid, and the equilibrium condition reached within 30 min. The isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Sips), kinetic models (pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, intra-particle diffusion, Bangham and modified-Freundlich models) and thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated. High values of determination coefficients (R2) and minimal values of non-linear error functions (i.e. HYBRD, RMSE, MPSD, ARE, APE and χ2) indicated that experimental data were best fitted with Sips isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic model. Accordingly, the maximum loading capacity of AESP was found to be 259.4, 284.3 and 346.5 mg/g for the temperatures of 15, 30 and 45 °C, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of AO onto the AESP surface was an endothermic and spontaneous process. Besides these, the central composite experimental design (CCD) superimposed with response surface methodology (RSM) modeling was also employed to investigate the effect of four significant parameters (solution pH, contact time, initial AO concentration and AESP dosage) and their interaction-term effects on the adsorption capacity of AESP and to formulate the mathematical model for the experimental data using multi-variate statistical analysis. Maximum dye uptake capacity under the optimum conditions of variables (pH 8.96, contact time 32.06 min, initial dye concentration 867.71 mg/L and AESP dosage 1.89 g/L) was 312.1 mg/g at temperature 30 °C, and it was found to be very close to the experimentally determined values (313.4 ± 0.057 mg/g). The promising reusability potential of AESP using 0.1 M HCl, implied that, the lignocellulosic biosorbent AESP might be helpful for the appropriate designing of the environmental-friendly purification systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacridine orange 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3abyproducts 3adyes 3aendothermy 3aexperimental design 3ahydrochloric acid 3akinetics 3alignocellulose 3amathematical models 3amixing 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aAdsorption 0aAcridine orange 0aAbelmoschus esculentus 0aSips isotherm 0aCentral composite design 0aResponse surface methodology1 aPal, Anjali0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 July 01, v. 217 p.573-591dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.03.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010100163300002000264520108000284592002801364650001501392650000901407650002201416650002301438650001601461700002501477700002001502700002301522773013001545856008201675852000901757655001201766IND60580253420180712000000.0170914e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058025342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b025962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreuer, Lars10aReducing the Matrix Effect in Molecular Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry by Laser Post-Ionization  ap. 19705-19715.  aStrategies to reduce and overcome matrix effects in molecular secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are investigated using laser-based post-ionization of sputtered neutral organic molecules released under C₆₀⁺ bombardment. Using a two-component multilayer film similar to that employed in a recent VAMAS interlaboratory study, SIMS depth profiles of the protonated and deprotonated quasi-molecular ions of two well-studied organic molecules, Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1098, were measured along with that of the corresponding neutral precursor molecules. When compared to composition-dependent ionization probability changes of the secondary ions, the resulting profiles are much improved. We demonstrate that detection of neutral molecules via laser post-ionization yields significantly reduced matrix effects when compared to SIMS depth profiles in both positive and negative secondary ion mode. These results suggest that this approach may provide a useful pathway for acquiring depth profiles from complex organic samples with improved capabilities for quantitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3aphysical chemistry 3aprobability1 aPopczun, Nicholas J.1 aWucher, Andreas1 aWinograd, Nicholas0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 121, no. 36 p.19705-19715dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b025963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016700161300001400328520143400342592002801776650001501804650001601819650000801835650002801843650003401871650001201905650002101917650002701938650002001965650003101985650001002016650000902026650001902035650001002054650000702064650001702071650001902088650001102107650002002118650002102138650002602159653002802185653001502213653001802228653002002246653001702266700001302283700003802296700001602334773009102350856008102441852000902522655001202531IND60543543220221123044151.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054354322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2015.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qinsi13aAn ENA ATPase, MaENA1, of Metarhizium acridum influences the Na+-, thermo- and UV-tolerances of conidia and is involved in multiple mechanisms of stress tolerance  ap. 68-77.  aIn fungi, ENA ATPases play key roles in osmotic and alkaline pH tolerance, although their functions in thermo- and UV-tolerances have not been explored. Entomopathogenic fungi are naturally widespread and have considerable potential in pest control. An ENA ATPase gene, MaENA1, from the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum was functionally analyzed by deletion. MaENA1-disruption strain (ΔMaENA1) was less tolerant to NaCl, heat, and UV radiation than a wild-type strain (WT). Digital Gene Expression profiling of conidial RNAs resulted in 281 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the WT and ΔMaENA1 strains. Eighty-five DEGs, 56 of which were down-regulated in the ΔMaENA1 strain, were shown to be associated with heat/UV tolerance, including six cytochrome P450 superfamily genes, 35 oxidoreductase genes, 24 ion-binding genes, seven DNA repair genes, and five other genes. In addition, eight genes were components of stress responsive pathways, including the Ras-cAMP PKA pathway, the RIM101 pathway, the Ca2+/calmodulin pathway, the TOR pathway, and the HOG/Spc1/Sty1/JNK pathway. These results demonstrated that MaENA1 influences fungal tolerances to Na+, heat, and UV radiation in M. acridum, and is involved in multiple mechanisms of stress tolerance.

Its surface chemistry seems to be a key factor in the preparation of heterogeneous catalyst where γ-Al₂O₃ is used as a support. The modification and description of its surface are necessary to understand the role of the support on the catalyst preparation and on its performance. In this work, the modification of the surface is performed with a carboxylic diacid, malonic acid, which specifically adsorbs at the γ-Al₂O₃ surface and modifies the surface chemistry (surface sites density and global surface charge). The impact of the impregnation pH, malonic acid content, and drying are studied. By using a multi-technique approach, both the solid/liquid interface and the dried surface were characterized. The infrared spectroscopic information coupled with zetametry measurements indicate the formation of an inner sphere complex adsorbed via both side-on ester linkage and bridging bidentate mode involving the two carboxylic groups. A surface complexation model was built to support the experimental results and obtain complementary information. It underlines the different reactivity of the γ-Al₂O₃ facets and of the surface sites responsible for the adsorption. The whole (100) facet is involved in the adsorption while only the µ₁-AlVI-OH and µ₁-AlIV-OH sites of the (110) facet participate in the malonic acid adsorption. The model also confirms the consumption of 3–4 surface hydroxyls per adsorbed molecule, in accordance with ester linkage and bridging bidentate structure. This molecular level description of the surface chemistry is of interest in different environmental fields such as wastewater treatment and pollutant removal. In the catalysis field, the detailed surface chemistry will be very useful to understand the impact of this modified support on the catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aliquids 3amalonic acid 3amodels 3apH 3apollution control 3aspectroscopy 3awastewater treatment 0aGamma-alumina 0aSurface complexation models 0aSolid/solution interface 0aPhreeqC1 aCorral-Valero, Manuel1 aCorre, Thibaut1 aDelpoux, Olivier1 aPirngruber, Gerhard1 aLefèvre, Grégory0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Feb. 05, v. 634 p.127923-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1279233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245021100165300001500376520134800391592002801739650002901767650003101796650002601827650002501853650002401878650001701902650001001919650001301929650001301942650001101955650001001966650001201976650001701988650001302005650001202018650001402030650001402044653001602058653000902074653002002083653001402103653001502117653002402132700001602156700001702172700001802189700001802207700001602225700001802241700002002259700001502279700002002294700001902314700001702333700001602350700001602366773013302382856008402515852000902599655001202608IND60616812520221120101528.0201206e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons, E.T.10aPostmortem examination (2016–2017) of weanling and older horses for the presence of select species of endoparasites: Gasterophilus spp., Anoplocephala spp. and Strongylus spp. in specific anatomical sites  ap. 98-104.  aParasite infections are more quantifiable postmortem than antemortem in horses. Thus a study was carried out examining dead horses for specific parasite species. Most of the weanling and older horses submitted to the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) for postmortem examination between November 22, 2016 and March 23, 2017 were examined for certain species of internal parasites. The stomach and duodenum from 69 horses were examined for bots (Gasterophilus spp.). Combined data for both Thoroughbred and non-Thoroughbred (16 other than Thoroughbred breeds/mixed breeds) horses revealed that the prevalence of Gasterophilus intestinalis was 19% (n=12) with 2nd instars (x̄ 8.5) and 39% (n=27) with 3rd instars (x̄ 90). The prevalence of Gasterophilus nasalis was 1.5% (n=1) for 2nd instars (x̄ 1) and 7% (n=5) for 3rd instars (x̄ 25). A few third instar G. intestinalis placed in 10% formalin showed slight movement at over two hundred hours later. The cecum and about 25cm of the terminal part of the ileum were examined from 139 horses for tapeworms (Anoplocephala spp.) and large strongyles (Strongylus spp.). The prevalence of A. perfoliata was 44% (n=62) and the average number of specimens per infected horse was 92.5. Strongylus vulgaris and Strongylus edentatus were not found in the gut of any horse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplocephala perfoliata 3aGasterophilus intestinalis 3aGasterophilus nasalis 3aStrongylus edentatus 3aStrongylus vulgaris 3aThoroughbred 3acecum 3aduodenum 3aformalin 3ahorses 3aileum 3ainstars 3amixed breeds 3anecropsy 3astomach 3atapeworms 3aweanlings 0aDead horses 0aBots 0aStrongylus spp. 0aTapeworms 0aPrevalence 0aNumber of specimens1 aBolin, D.C.1 aBryant, U.K.1 aCassone, L.M.1 aJackson, C.B.1 aJanes, J.G.1 aKennedy, L.A.1 aLoynachan, A.T.1 aBoll, K.R.1 aBurkhardt, A.S.1 aLanglois, E.L.1 aMinnis, S.M.1 aWelsh, S.C.1 aScare, J.A.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2018 Aug., v. 13 p.98-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002400159245010300183300001600286520192700302592002802229650002302257650002102280650002202301650001002323650001902333650001302352650001902365650002802384650001902412650001402431651001702445651001502462653001302477653001702490653002202507653002402529653001302553653002002566700002402586700001802610700002302628700002602651773012902677856007502806852000902881655001202890IND60615284320221119082401.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061528432DNAL7 a10.7589/2017-10-2522doi4 ajwdi-54-04-05  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahnson, Charlie S.10aNeutralizing antibodies to type a influenza viruses in shorebirds at delaware bay, new jersey, usa  ap. 708-715.  aInfluenza A virus (IAV) infections in shorebirds at Delaware Bay, New Jersey, US, have historically included avian hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes H1–13 and H16. In a given year, infections are characterized by a limited number of HA and neuraminidase subtypes and a dominant HA subtype that often represents >50% of all isolates. Predominant HA subtypes shift between consecutive years. In addition, infection prevalence is consistently higher in Ruddy Turnstones (RUTU; Arenaria interpres morinella) compared to Red Knots (REKN; Calidris canutus rufa), despite comparable rates of exposure. To investigate a potential immunological basis for this phenomenon, a virus microneutralization assay was used to detect subtype-specific, neutralizing antibodies to H1–H12 in sera collected from RUTUs from 2012–16 and REKNs in 2012, 2013, and 2016. Neutralizing antibodies to one or more subtypes were detected in 36% (222/611) of RUTUs. Prevalence of antibodies to subtypes H6 and H11 remained high throughout the study, and these virus subtypes were isolated every year, suggesting a continual source of exposure. Antibody prevalence was intermediate for most IAV subtypes that were isolated in 2–3 of 5 yr (H1, H3, H5, H9, H10, and H12) but was low for H7 viruses, despite the isolation of this virus subtype in 3 of 5 yr. This suggests a reduced antigenicity of H7 IAVs compared to other subtypes. Antibody prevalence was low for H4 virus that was isolated once, and H2 and H8 viruses that were never isolated. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 66% (169/257) of REKNs and subtype-specific antibody prevalences were higher in REKNs than RUTUs with few exceptions. The results suggest that population immunity influences which species is infected at Delaware Bay, indicate that IAV dynamics are subtype-dependent, and demonstrate the utility of the microneutralization assay as a supportive tool for field research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenaria interpres 3aCalidris canutus 3aInfluenza A virus 3abirds 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunity 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aseroprevalence 3asialidase 3aDelaware Bay 3aNew Jersey 0aAntibody 0aDelaware Bay 0ainfluenza A virus 0amicroneutralization 0aRed knot 0aRuddy Turnstone1 aPoulson, Rebecca L.1 aKrauss, Scott1 aWebster, Robert G.1 aStallknecht, David E.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2018 Oct., v. 54, no. 4 p.708-715dWildife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2017-10-2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167300001400282520201900296592002802315650001102343650001502354650000902369650001402378650002002392650001002412650001102422650001302433650001502446650001402461650002402475650002302499650002002522650001102542653002002553653002002573653002002593653001502613700001402628700001702642700002102659700002102680700001802701773010602719856008402825852000902909655001202918IND60123057820221123042906.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012305782DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2013.8326202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeyinka, FD10aAssociation between placentome size, measured using transrectal ultrasonography, and gestational age in cattle  ap. 51-56.  aAIM: The aim of this study was to estimate whether fetal age could be accurately estimated using placentome size. METHODS: Fifty-eight cows with confirmed conception dates in two herds were used for the study. The length of the long axis and cross-sectional area of placentomes close to the cervix were measured once every 10 days between approximately 60–130 days of gestation and once every 15 days between 130–160 days of gestation. Four to six placentomes were measured using transrectal ultrasonography in each uterine horn. A linear mixed model was used to establish the factors that were significantly associated with log mean placentome length and to create an equation to predict gestational age from mean placentome length. Limits of agreement analysis was then used to evaluate whether the predictions were sufficiently accurate for mean placentome length to be used, in practice, as a method of determining gestational age. RESULTS: Only age of gestation (p<0.001) and uterine horn (p=0.048) were found to have a significant effect on log mean placentome length. From the three models used to predict gestational age the one that used log mean placentome length of all placentomes, adjusting for the effect of horn, had the smallest 95% limits of agreement; ±33 days. That is, predicted gestational age had a 95% chance of being between 33 days greater and 33.7 days less than actual age. This is approximately twice that reported in studies using measurement of fetal size. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of placentomes near to the cervix using transrectal ultrasonography was easily achieved. There was a significant association between placentome size and gestational age, but between-cow variation in placentome size and growth resulted in poor agreement between placentome size and gestational age. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although placentomes can be easily visualised during diagnosis of pregnancy using transrectal ultrasonography, mean placentome size should not be used to estimate gestational age.  aPublisher supplied data 3acervix 3aconception 3acows 3aequations 3agestational age 3aherds 3alength 3aplacenta 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3apregnancy diagnosis 3astatistical models 3aultrasonography 3auterus 0aPlacentome size 0aultrasonography 0agestational age 0aprediction1 aLaven, RA1 aLawrence, KE1 avan Den Bosch, M1 aBlankenvoorde, G1 aParkinson, TJ0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 62, no. 2 p.51-56dTaylor & Francisx1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2013.8326203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003800135040001800173100001700191245015000208300001400358506007600372520178600448592002802234506003702262650001502299650002802314650000902342650002402351650002002375650001102395650001402406650001402420650001802434650001902452650002402471650001702495650001302512650002402525650001902549650001502568650001002583650002702593651001302620653001302633653001002646653002502656653001702681653002002698653002702718653001202745700002002757700002302777700002102800700005902821700002002880700001802900700002202918700002202940700002002962700002002982773011703002856008503119852000903204655001203213IND60585982220221207134035.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058598222DNAL7 aPMC59526762pmcid7 a297742952pmid7 a10.1016/j.parepi.2017.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBsrat, Abrha10aSerological investigation of visceral Leishmania infection in human and its associated risk factors in Welkait District, Western Tigray, Ethiopia  ap. 13-20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is major neglected public health problem in terms of geographical spread and incidence in Ethiopia. Magnitude, public health impact and dynamics of VL were not well studied in Welkait District, Western Tigray, though the area is known for VL. Hence, this study aimed to determine sero-prevalence of human VL and associated risk factors in Welkait as new foci. A cross sectional study design was employed in this study. Two stage stratified random sampling method was used to select study participants. Hence, a total of 329 human study participants were included for serological survey using ITleish and leishmanin skin tests. Semi structured questionnaire was also used to identify VL associated risk factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression statistical methods were used to determine the degree of association. The overall sero-prevalence of human VL in the study area was found to be 8.81%. Statistical significant difference in the prevalence of the disease was found among Sub-districts, sex, re-settlement, sleeping outdoor and dog ownership (P<0.05). Participants who resettled from their original place were found 2 times (AOR=2.143; 95% CI=1.02, 14.20) more vulnerable to VL infection. Those who had an experience of sleeping outdoor were found almost 4 times (AOR=4.29; 95% CI=1.58, 11.69) more likely to be at risk of acquiring VL infection than those sleep indoor. Furthermore, individuals who owned dogs were 3 times more prone to the VL infection than their counterparts (AOR=3.37; 95% CI=1.29, 8.76). Alarming sero-positivity of human VL was recorded from new foci. Hence, it is recommended to improve the VL health services in the study area. The investigation also invites further study on VL dynamics in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania 3across-sectional studies 3adogs 3aexperimental design 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aownership 3aparasites 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asampling 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3askin tests 3asleep 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aEthiopia 0aEthiopia 0aHuman 0aLeishmanin skin test 0aRisk factors 0aSero-prevalence 0aVisceral leishmaniasis 0aWelkait1 aBerhe, Mebrahtu1 aGadissa, Endalemaw1 aTaddele, Habtamu1 aTekle, Yohannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9707-38871 aHagos, Yohannes1 aAbera, Adugna1 aG/micael, Messele1 aAlemayhu, Tehetna1 aGugsa, Getachew1 aAseffa, Abraham0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2018 Feb., v. 3, no. 1 p.13-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2017.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013500168300001400303520191000317592002802227650001902255650001502274650001002289650001602299650002402315650002802339650002302367650002102390650002202411650003802433650002502471650002002496650001102516650001102527650001502538650001002553650001702563650001902580650001002599651001002609653001902619653002002638653001002658653001002668653001702678700003102695700002602726700002002752700001902772700001402791700001802805773013102823856008402954852000903038655001203047IND60616812720221120142607.0200607e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahiya, Rajesh10aRisk factor analysis associated with Theileria equi infected equines in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological enzootic zones of India  ap. 17-21.  aEquine piroplasmosis is a haemoprtozoan disease of equines and enzootic in tropical and subtropical countries. A cross-sectional study on sero-prevalence of Theileria equi, the causative agent of EP, was performed in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological endemic zones of India including Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat states, in order to evaluate the enzootic status/level of exposure to equine population due to this infection and addressed associated risk factors. Serum samples were collected from a total of 1021 equids that comprised of 792 horses, 168 donkeys and 61 mules and evaluated for T. equi specific antibodies in equine merozoite antigen-2 (EMA-2) based on indirect ELISA. The state with high sero-prevalence rate was Rajasthan (71.40%), followed by Haryana (60.39%) and Gujarat (48.92%). Overall T. equi sero-positivity in equines was 64.44%. Species-wise T. equi sero-prevalence was 66.29%, 51.19% and 91.80% in horses, donkeys and mules respectively. The association and risk factor among age, gender and species in relation with T. equi infection was statistically analyzed at 95% level of significance (p<0.05). A very high T. equi sero-positivity was recorded in 0–1year age group of equines (60%), indicating that this naïve age group contacts with T. equi infected ticks and remains infected throughout its lifetime. The sero-prevalence rate was significantly associated with the species of animal (p<0.05). The risk factor analysis kept mules at higher risk (Odd's ratio; 5.696; 95% confidence interval: 2.25–14.38) of getting infection as compared to horses and donkeys. This study has demonstrated high enzootic nature of T. equi infection in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological zones of India. Mules, in comparison to horses and donkeys were found at higher risk of getting T. equi infection, indicating that disease prevalence is associated with species of the infected host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheileria equi 3aantibodies 3aasses 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adisease prevalence 3aecological zones 3aenzootic diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequine piroplasmosis 3afactor analysis 3agender 3ahorses 3amerozoites 3amules 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aticks 3aIndia 0aTheileria equi 0aSero-prevalence 0aIndia 0aELISA 0aRisk factors1 aSalar, R.

Circadian variation in expression of pharmacokinetics- and pharmacodynamics-related genes was shown to contribute to dosing time-dependent differences in therapeutic effects of small molecule drugs. However, influence of dosing time of day on effects of high molecular weight formulations, such as drugs encapsulated in liposomes, has not been studied in detail. This study demonstrates that blood pressure rhythm affects dosing time-dependent variation in effects of high molecular weight formulations. Systolic blood pressure in sarcoma 180-bearing mice showed significant 24-h oscillation. Intratumoral accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA), an indicator of tumor vascular permeability, varied with dosing time of day, matching phases of blood pressure circadian rhythm. Furthermore, intratumoral accumulation of liposome-encapsulated oxaliplatin (Lipo-L-OHP) increased with increases in systolic blood pressure. Our findings suggest that circadian blood pressure oscillations may be an important factor to consider in dosing strategies for macromolecular drugs and liposomes in cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3abovine serum albumin 3acircadian rhythm 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3afluorescein 3agenes 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apermeability 3asarcoma 3asystolic blood pressure 3atherapeutics 0aBlood pressure 0aCircadian rhythm 0aEPR effect 0aIntratumoral accumulation 0aLiposome1 aMatsunaga, Naoya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0004-45351 aKusunose, Naoki1 aIkeda, Eriko1 aOkazaki, Hiroyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4509-02281 aKakimoto, Keisuke1 aHamamura, Kengo1 aKoyanagi, Satoru1 aOhdo, Shigehiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 25, v. 498, no. 1 p.86-91dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013300167300001400300520142700314592002801741650003001769650000801799650002101807650001101828650001401839650000901853650001101862650001301873650001901886650001601905650001801921650000901939650002501948650001401973650003001987650001002017651001602027653001902043653002402062653000902086653000902095653001602104700001502120700001602135773010602151856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60123057920221123041825.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012305792DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2013.8409432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaatstra, BL10aPigmented chin papillomas in red (Cervus elaphus) × wapiti (Cervus canadensis) stags associated with a novel papillomavirus  ap. 96-99.  aCASE HISTORY: Lesions were observed on the chins of two 2- to 3-year-old red (Cervus elaphus) × wapiti (Cervus canadensis) stags from the lower North Island of New Zealand during velvet removal. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Both stags had numerous, coalescing, darkly pigmented plaques and nodules on the skin of the chin and lower lips that were 3–10 mm in diameter. Re-examination after 12 months of initial detection revealed no appreciable change in the lesions. A biopsy sample from one lesion was submitted for histopathological examination. HISTOPATHOLOGY: Sections revealed lesions consistent with pigmented viral papillomas, characterised by marked epidermal hyperplasia forming papillary fronds, prominent clumping of keratohyalin granules, keratinocytes with dilated grey-blue cytoplasm, shrunken nuclei surrounded by a clear halo (koilocytes), and presumptive viral intranuclear inclusions. Papillomavirus DNA was amplified by PCR from a fresh tissue sample from the same papilloma. Comparison of the partial nucleotide sequence amplified to previously reported papillomaviruses suggested the presence of a novel papillomavirus type. DIAGNOSIS: A presumptive diagnosis of pigmented viral papilloma was made. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While the papillomas described in these two cases do not appear to cause major clinical disease, they are visually unappealing and have the potential to spread to other valuable deer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus canadensis 3aDNA 3aPapillomaviridae 3abiopsy 3acytoplasm 3adeer 3afronds 3agranules 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3akeratinocytes 3alips 3anucleotide sequences 3apapilloma 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astags 3aNew Zealand 0aPapillomavirus 0apigmented papilloma 0adeer 0askin 0aNew Zealand1 aMunday, JS1 aMorriss, PW0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 62, no. 2 p.96-99dTaylor & Francisx1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2013.8409433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009100167300001400258520236800272592002802640650001302668650001702681650001802698650001402716650001002730650001002740650001402750650001702764650001102781650001302792650001502805650001302820650001102833650001202844650001702856650001802873651001402891653001802905653001102923653002102934653001402955653002302969653001802992700001603010700001903026700001603045700002003061700002403081773013203105856008403237852000903321655001203330IND60616812820221120172539.0201206e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosinno, S.J.12aA survey on parasite control in sport horses of Argentina and other regional countries  ap. 74-78.  aStrategies for parasite control have undergone major changes in recent years, especially in Europe and the United States, replacing traditional approaches by schemes based on surveillance and selective therapy. A first step in helminth control planning is to understand and demonstrate how horse owners or trainers currently control nematodes. The aim of this study was to collect information, through a survey, about important aspects of routine anthelmintic strategies in sport horses in Argentina and other regional countries. A total of 100 surveys were sent. Sixty nine were responded, 53% of the surveys were answered by veterinarians and 47% by managers. The majority of the respondents (58%) worked in Thoroughbred studs, followed by Throroughbred farms (23%), Horse Riding Centers (10%) and other types of centers (9%). Most respondents treated horses at fixed time every 3 months (48%). Twenty-two percent of them did it at fixed time every 6 months, 16% at fixed time every 4 months and 6% at fixed time every 12 months; 6% dewormed on individual basis while 4% did not treat at all; 2% dewormed every two months. When asked about the rationale for deworming, the majority (41%) did so based on the time elapsed since the last treatment, followed by the time of the year (22%), according to the age of the animals (15%), according to previous diagnosis (12%), 9% treated for no particular reason and 1% when the horses reached the stud. Almost half of respondents (48%) did not rotate anthelmintic drug on. In a smaller proportion, others did it every 3 months (26%), every 12 months (11%), every 6 months (9%) and finally every 4 months (6%). Half of the respondents (50%) treated horses 4 times a year, 32% did 2 times a year, 15% 3 times and 3% did not deworm at all. Regarding making a diagnosis prior to treatment, 76% of the respondents answered negatively, while 24% did so. Only 20% of respondents performed the anthelmintic efficacy test. It can be concluded that there is little participation and planning of the veterinary professional regarding the control of internal parasites in horses of Argentina. Performing coprologic tests are practices not usual in our region. Practices of parasite management seem to be reduced almost exclusively to the administration of anthelmintic drugs at fixed times, often indiscriminately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aThoroughbred 3aanthelmintics 3adeworming 3adrugs 3afarms 3ahelminths 3ahorse riding 3ahorses 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3asports 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3aveterinarians 3aArgentina 0aAnthelminthic 0aEquine 0aParasite control 0aArgentina 0aRegional countries 0aSouth America1 aAguilar, J.1 aCarbonetti, L.1 aFerniot, E.1 aSan Esteban, F.1 aFlores Suares, C.M.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2018 Aug., v. 13 p.74-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011000156300002000266520102300286592002801309650001301337650002901350650001301379650001701392653002901409653001901438653000801457653001601465653000701481653000901488653001101497700001901508700001601527700001801543700001801561773012901579856007301708852000901781655001201790IND60527549420221121031158.0160715e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052754942DNAL7 a10.1021/am403173n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, My Duyen10aPolymer and Small Molecule Mixture for Organic Hole Transport Layers in Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 12369-12374.  aThe performance of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) was investigated for different hole transport layers with small molecules and polymers: poly(4-butyl-phenyl-diphenyl-amine), poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1′-diphenyl-4,4′-diamine, 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenyl-amine (TCTA), and 4,4′-bis(carbazole-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP). The electroluminescence performance of QD-LEDs was considerably improved by adding small molecules (TCTA or CBP) having high hole mobilily to the polymer hole transport material (PVK). The maximal current efficiency of QD-LED-based PVK was improved by 27% upon addition of 20 wt % TCTA due to the hole injection improvement. The lower turn-on voltage, the higher current density, and the higher luminance were achieved by addition of TCTA. The maximal luminance of 40900 cd/m² and the highest current efficiency of 14.0 cd/A with the narrow full width at half-maximum (<35 nm) were achieved by the best hole transport layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiphenyl 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 0ahole transport materials 0ahole transport 0aHTL 0aquantum dot 0aQD 0aQLED 0aQD-LED1 aKim, Daekyoung1 aKim, Namhun1 aCho, Sung Min1 aChae, Heeyeop0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Dec. 11, v. 5, no. 23 p.12369-12374dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am403173n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245009800180300001600278500000900294520048500303592002800788650001200816650001400828650001500842650002700857650001800884650001300902650001400915650002000929700001500949773014800964856009601112852000901208655001201217IND60668761420221119175607.0191125e198003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066876142DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400020009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillman, G.

Increasing evidence suggested various kinds of RNAs are involved in this process. Especially the nascent RNAs retained at their site of transcription can serve as a scaffold for organizing transcriptionally either favorable or unfavorable chromatin structures. An emerging concept of phase separation explains how these chromatin structures can be maintained as physically discrete subcompartments within membrane-less nucleoplasm. Evidences that support the crucial role of nascent RNAs in the formation of phase-separated condensates are now rapidly growing.  aPublisher supplied data  a201604271104cUniversity of Seoul 3aRNA 3achromatin 3acondensates 3agenes 3aseparation 3atranscription (genetics)1 aChung, Yun Doo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6041-14720 tGenes & genomics.g2020 June, v. 42, no. 6 p.609-617dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-020-00929-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008000170300001600250520123600266592002801502650003001530650001701560650001501577650001601592650002301608650001701631650001001648650001501658650001901673650001401692650001201706650001001718651001901728651001201747700002301759700001601782700001501798773010101813856008401914852000901998655001202007IND60087114620221119221949.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008711462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2011.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraskova, Ivana10aSeroprevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in horses in the Czech Republic  ap. 111-115.  aAnaplasma phagocytophilum is the aetiological agent of equine granulocytic anaplasmosis (EGA). The aim of this survey was to assess the prevalence of anti-A. phagocytophilum antibodies in the horse population of the Czech Republic (CZ) and to investigate possible links between seropositivity and the geographic origin, age, and/or sex of the tested horses. Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were screened using an indirect fluorescent antibody method (IFA). Serum samples from 96 healthy horses from 8 localities (7 within the CZ and one control upland/tick-free locality in Ukraine) were examined. While the controls tested negative, the seroprevalence in the Czech localities was estimated at 73%, which suggests that subclinical EGA is common among horses in the CZ. Significant differences between seropositivity rates in individual stables were demonstrated (explicable by the different environment and/or management styles of the horses stabled therein). Horses in stables from which previous manifest cases had been reported tended to have higher average titres. Mares displayed a somewhat higher seropositivity rate than did stallions; age had no demonstrable effect upon the serological status of the examined horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aanaplasmosis 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aetiological agents 3afluorescence 3amares 3aprovenance 3aseroprevalence 3astallions 3asurveys 3aticks 3aCzech Republic 3aUkraine1 aBezdekova, Barbora1 aZeman, Petr1 aJahn, Petr0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.111-115dElsevier GmbHx1877-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2011.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009300164500001900257520141600276592002801692650001301720650001101733650001801744650001701762650001201779650001101791651001201802653001401814653001901828653001801847653002001865653000801885653000801893653000801901653000801909653000801917700001801925773009401943856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60736912920221121063449.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073691292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1123082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeim, Sven10aDo Pay-As-Bid Auctions Favor Collusion? Evidence from Germany's market for reserve power  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe analyze a drastic price increase in the German auction market for reserve power that did not appear to be driven by increased costs. Studying the market structure and bidding strategies using micro-level bidding data, we find a concentrated market with highly pivotal suppliers in an environment with completely inelastic demand and high entry barriers. We provide descriptive evidence that the price increase was triggered by an abuse of the “guess the clearing price” principle of discriminatory auctions via repeated pretended “bad guessing” of the marginal bid by the most dominant supplier. As intentional “bad guessing” of marginal bids is hard to prove, this suggests that the auction design is crucial for the competition authority's monitoring power – an issue that is often neglected in the discussion on the properties of auction designs. In fact, given regulatory threats, the deemed main advantage of pay-as-bid auctions over uniform price auctions and the popular belief that they reduce dominant suppliers' withholding incentives and diminish their ability to tacitly collude may be questioned in non-static settings. This suggests that pay-as-bid auctions may not necessarily reduce incentives for strategic capacity withholding and collusive behavior, but can even increase them when market power is high and demand inelastic, which is the case in virtually all energy markets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3amarket power 3amarkets 3aprices 3aGermany 0aCollusion 0aEnergy markets 0aReserve power 0aBalancing power 0aD43 0aD44 0aD47 0aL11 0aL131 aGötz, Georg,0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Aug., v. 155 p.112308-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1123083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012100170300001800291520159600309592002801905650001101933650001501944650001901959650001201978650002001990650001002010650001502020650001202035650001202047650001302059650001902072650001302091650001402104650001202118650002502130653002502155653001402180653002302194653001902217700002002236700002102256700001802277773012202295856008502417852000902502655001202511IND60570284720221116211949.0180829e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057028472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorais, Mariana10aMicroRNAs and altered metabolism of clear cell renal cell carcinoma: Potential role as aerobic glycolysis biomarkers  ap. 2175-2185.  aWarburg Effect is a metabolic switch that occurs in most of cancer cells but its advantages are not fully understood. This switch is known to happen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which is the most common solid cancer of the adult kidney. RCC carcinogenesis is related to pVHL loss and Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) activation, ultimately leading to the activation of several genes related to glycolysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level and are also deregulated in several cancers, including RCC.This review focuses in the miRNAs that direct target enzymes involved in glycolysis and that are deregulated in several cancers. It also reviews the possible application of miRNAs in the improvement of clinical patients' management.Several miRNAs that direct target enzymes involved in glycolysis are downregulated in cancer, strongly influencing the Warburg Effect. Due to this strong influence, FDG-PET can possibly benefit from measurement of these miRNAs. Restoring their levels can also bring an improvement to the current therapies.Despite being known for almost a hundred years, the Warburg Effect is not fully understood. MiRNAs are now known to be intrinsically connected with this effect and present an opportunity to understand it. They also open a new door to improve current diagnosis and prognosis tests as well as to complement current therapies. This is urgent for cancers like RCC, mostly due to the lack of an efficient screening test for early relapse detection and follow-up and the development of resistance to current therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3akidneys 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aprognosis 3arelapse 3arenal cell carcinoma 0aRenal cell carcinoma 0amicroRNAs 0aAerobic glycolysis 0aWarburg effect1 aDias, Francisca1 aTeixeira, Ana L.1 aMedeiros, Rui0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Sept., v. 1861, no. 9 p.2175-2185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002500158245014300183300001600326520134900342592002801691650001301719650002401732650002501756650000901781650001901790650001201809650001201821650001101833650001101844650002301855650002001878650002001898650001501918650001701933650001201950650002501962650002301987650001902010650002302029650001602052651002302068651001502091700002202106700002402128773009802152856007302250852000902323655001202332IND50072440620221122051111.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007244062DNAL7 a241152862pmid7 a10.1111/gcb.123992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorensen, Christina,10aAerobic vs. anaerobic scope: sibling species of fish indicate that temperature dependence of hypoxia tolerance can predict future survival  ap. 724-729.  aThe temperature dependence of aerobic scope has been suggested to be a major determinant of how marine animals will cope with future rises in environmental temperature. Here, we present data suggesting that in some animals, the temperature dependence of anaerobic scope (i.e., the capacity for surviving severe hypoxia) may determine present‐day latitudinal distributions and potential for persistence in a warmer future. As a model for investigating the role of anaerobic scope, we studied two sibling species of coral‐dwelling gobies, Gobiodon histrio, and G. erythrospilus, with different latitudinal distributions, but which overlap in equal abundance at Lizard Island (14°40′S) on the Great Barrier Reef. These species did not differ in the temperature dependence of resting oxygen consumption or critical oxygen concentration (the lowest oxygen level where resting oxygen consumption can be maintained). In contrast, the more equatorial species (G. histrio) had a better capacity to endure anaerobic conditions at oxygen levels below the critical oxygen concentration at the high temperatures (32–33 °C) more likely to occur near the equator, or in a warmer future. These results suggest that anaerobic scope, in addition to aerobic scope, could be important in determining the impacts of global warming on some marine animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGobiidae 3aambient temperature 3aanaerobic conditions 3afish 3aglobal warming 3ahypoxia 3aislands 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3asibling species 2aAcclimatization 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aHypoxiaxmetabolism. 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aGlobal Warming 2aOxygen Consumption 2aTemperature 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0aQueensland1 aMunday, Philip L.1 aNilsson, Göran E.,0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.724-729dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.123993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013200164300001800296500001900314520154700333592002801880596005901908596005901967650001902026650001102045650000902056650002302065650002402088650002402112650002402136650001902160650002102179650001502200650001602215650001202231650001102243700001602254700001302270700001602283773013802299856008202437852000902519655001202528IND60728808520221120205232.0210224e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072880852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-020-02855-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Gang,13aAn effective thermal treatment of toluene-contaminated soil by uniform heating from microwave coupled infrared radiation (MCIR)  ap. 1329-1336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Thermal treatment technologies are generally very effective for the remediation of soils contaminated. For the traditional thermal treatment method of contaminated soil, the heating method from the outside to the inside will inevitably cause a waste of energy, and it may be expensive due to the energy costs. Therefore, it is necessary to find a new heating technology to improve the thermal treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a novel microwave coupled infrared radiation (MCIR) technology was used to achieve uniform heating treatment of contaminated soil. A mathematical model was established and applied to simulate the electric field and temperature induced by microwave radiation and MCIR. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The model results showed that MCIR heating produces well uniformity of thermal field distribution. Then, the influence of infrared in the MCIR treatment of soil was investigated by the lab experiment. The lab experimental results indicated that infrared could efficiently improve the microwave treatment of soil. A toluene removal efficiency of 92.8% could be achieved at 500 W microwave coupled with 300 W infrared radiation for 300 s, retaining 9.2% soil moisture. In addition, it exhibited a high cost-benefit. Furthermore, MCIR did not destroy the structure of toluene by infrared spectrum analysis. CONCLUSION: The results show that this MCIR treatment has the advantages of uniform heating, high efficiency, and low damage, which indicates the application prospect of MCIR in soil remediation.  aPublisher supplied data  a21806011cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21607009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aelectric field 3aenergy 3aheat 3ainfrared radiation 3amathematical models 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3apolluted soils 3asoil remediation 3asoil water 3atemperature 3atoluene 3awastes1 aFan, Mingyu1 aHan, Xue1 aWang, Yafei0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2021 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.1329-1336dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02855-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009900167300001600266500001900282520093700301592002801238650001501266650001701281650002101298650001301319700001501332700001201347700001701359700001901376700002201395700006201417773011501479856008301594852000901677655001201686IND60726159420221119142033.0210202e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072615942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c009202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurata, Asako10aSmall Molecule-Induced Dimerization of Hairpin RNA Interfered with the Dicer Cleavage Reaction  ap. 245-249.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroRNAs are potential targets for drug development. Small molecules that can inhibit or promote a specific miRNA’s biogenesis would be useful for regulating its target genes. Various types of small molecules have been investigated so far for their potential application in modulating miRNA biogenesis. They bind to the target primary or precursor miRNAs and inhibit the processing of these precursors by Drosha or Dicer. However, the binding site that effectively interferes with the Dicer cleavage reaction is still undetermined. Here we report that our designed small molecule restricted naphthyridine dimer (RND) binds to the hairpin loop of a hairpin RNA and induces its dimerization. This study shows that the binding of the RND to the hairpin loop was not effective in interfering with the Dicer cleavage reaction, but dimerization of the hairpin RNA by RND binding effectively interfered with the Dicer cleavage reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3adimerization 3adrug development 3amicroRNA1 aMori, Yuki1 aDi, Yue1 aSugai, Ayako1 aDas, Bimolendu1 aTakashima, Yusuke1 aNakatani, Kazuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1705-52650 tBiochemistry.g2021 Jan. 21, v. 60, no. 4 p.245-249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c009203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001800179245012200197300001600319506007600335520196900411592002802380506003702408650001402445650001902459650002102478650002202499650001302521650001202534650001902546650001702565650002402582650001002606650002402616650001302640650001102653650001002664650001602674650001002690650001102700650002102711650003002732650001302762650001902775650002102794650001402815650005802829651001002887700001702897700001402914700001602928700001602944700002102960773010002981856007803081852000903159655001203168IND4470122820221207073305.0120419e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447012282DNAL7 a222108482pmid7 aPMC32862822pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcr3152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Eryuan10aAnnual increments of juniper dwarf shrubs above the tree line on the central Tibetan Plateau: a useful climatic proxy  ap. 721-728.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dendroclimatology is playing an important role in understanding past climatic changes on the Tibetan Plateau. Forests, however, are mainly confined to the eastern Tibetan Plateau. On the central Tibetan Plateau, in contrast, shrubs and dwarf shrubs need to be studied instead of trees as a source of climate information. The objectives of this study were to check the dendrochronological potential of the dwarf shrub Wilson juniper (Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii) growing from 4740 to 4780 m a.s.l. and to identify the climatic factors controlling its radial growth. METHODS: Forty-three discs from 33 stems of Wilson juniper were sampled near the north-eastern shore of the Nam Co (Heavenly Lake). Cross-dating was performed along two directions of each stem, avoiding the compression-wood side as far as possible. A ring-width chronology was developed after a negative exponential function or a straight line of any slope had been fit to the raw measurements. Then, correlations were calculated between the standard ring-width chronology and monthly climate data recorded by a weather station around 100 km away. KEY RESULTS: Our study has shown high dendrochronological potential of Wilson juniper, based on its longevity (one individual was 324 years old), well-defined growth rings, reliable cross-dating between individuals and distinct climatic signals reflected by the ring-width variability. Unlike dwarf shrubs in the circum-arctic tundra ecosystem which positively responded to above-average temperature in the growing season, moisture turned out to be growth limiting for Wilson juniper, particularly the loss of moisture caused by high maximum temperatures in May–June. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the wide distribution of shrub and dwarf shrub species on the central Tibetan Plateau, an exciting prospect was opened up to extend the presently existing tree-ring networks far up into one of the largest tundra regions of the world.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJuniperus 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adendroclimatology 3adwarfing 3aforests 3agrowing season 3agrowth rings 3ainformation sources 3alakes 3ameteorological data 3aplateaus 3ashrubs 3astems 3atemperature 3atrees 3atundra 3aweather stations 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAltitude 2aClimate Change 2aCold Temperature 2aEcosystem 2aJuniperusxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 0aTibet1 aLu, Xiaoming1 aRen, Ping1 aLi, Xiaoxia1 aZhu, Liping1 aEckstein, Dieter0 tAnnals of botany.g2012 Mar., v. 109, no. 4 p.721-728dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcr3153Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002500168245008600193300001600279520091300295592002801208653002201236653001401258653003501272653001101307700002101318700002501339773015201364856011601516852000901632655001201641IND60130773720221117211427.0151127e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013077372DNAL7 a10.1660/0022-8443(2006)109[184:IOMSOP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBontrager, Lynett R.10aInfluence of meal size on postprandial thermophily in cornsnakes (Elaphe guttata)  ap. 184-190.  aPostprandial thermophily occurs because snakes presumably select body temperatures to maximize digestive functions. However, there seems to be little to no literature available on meal size affecting the degree of postprandial thermophily in snakes. We were interested in determining if meal size influenced post-feeding thermoregulation. To test this, we placed individual snakes into linear thermal gradients with floor temperatures ranging from 10 ±± 0.5 °°C to 40 ±± 1.0 °°C. After a 24 h habituation period, substrate temperatures were measured underneath the snake's body, 1/3 of the way down its length, at 3-hour intervals from 0900 to 1800 h. Each snake was monitored under three different conditions: during a fast, after ingesting a 5%% body mass meal, and after ingesting a 10%% body mass meal. The size of the meal had a significant effect (P==0.0365) on selected substrate temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 0abody temperatures 0ameal size 0apost-feedikng thermoregulation 0asnakes1 aJones, Daphne M.1 aSievert, Lynnette M.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2006 Sept., v. 109, no. 3 p.184-190dTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Sciencex0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660%2F0022-8443%282006%29109%5B184%3AIOMSOP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013700174520130800311592002801619650001201647650002301659650001301682650001101695650001501706650001101721650002501732650003001757650001701787650000901804650001401813650000901827650002601836650001101862650001401873650000701887650001401894650001801908650002201926650000901948653003501957653002201992653002602014653001302040653002602053700001902079700001902098700001902117773009102136856009002227852000902317655001202326IND60683482120221121024423.0210212e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068348212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1261392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yu-Fong10aHeterogeneous Fenton oxidation of trichloroethylene catalyzed by sewage sludge biochar: Experimental study and life cycle assessment  aHeterogeneous Fenton oxidation of trichloroethylene (TCE) catalyzed by sewage sludge biochar was studied. The highest TCE removal efficiency was 83% at pH 3.1, catalyzed by 300 W biochar. The biochars produced at higher microwave power levels provided better catalytic effect, due to higher iron contents and specific surface areas. Reactivity of sewage sludge biochar maintained after several uses, which provides an advantage for using as a permeable reactive barrier to remediate groundwater pollution. Chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc were found in the leachate generated from sewage sludge biochar, and most of the concentrations were lower than the standards for non-drinking water use. Besides, copper, zinc, and iron were found in the reaction solutions of Fenton oxidation. Because of the highest dosage required for Fenton oxidation, the environmental impact caused by 200 W biochar is highest. The environmental impact caused by 300 W biochar is lowest. Among the four endpoint impact categories in the life cycle assessment (LCA), human health is the highest concern, whereas ecosystem quality is the least. According to experimental and LCA results, the optimum microwave power level would be 300 W. The primary impact source is microwave pyrolysis because of high energy usage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater contamination 3ahuman health 3airon 3aleachates 3alead 3alife cycle assessment 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3atrichloroethylene 3azinc 0aHeterogeneous fenton oxidation 0aTrichloroethylene 0aSewage sludge biochar 0aCatalyst 0aLife cycle assessment1 aHuang, Yu-Yang1 aChiueh, Pei-Te1 aLo, Shang-Lien0 tChemosphere.g2020 June, v. 249 p.126139-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1261393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245008600161300001200247500001900259500000900278520135800287592002801645650002401673650002001697650001301717650001101730650001901741650001701760650002101777650001601798651001001814700001301824700001301837700001501850773012901865856007901994852000902073655001202082IND60663504220221118032559.0191122e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066350422DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2013.01482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Shuxia10aManaging Tall Fescue and Zoysiagrass Mixtures as Turfgrass in the Transition Zone  ap. 1-6.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aMaintaining a mixture of cool- and warm-season turfgrasses year-round instead of overseeding into a perennial monoculture stand annually in the transition zone may be an effective way to combine the strengths of two species. Four mixtures of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.) (Jaguar 3 and Bonsai) and zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) (Zenith and Cathy) were evaluated under 5- and 7.5-cm mowing heights and N regimes of 400, 200, and 100 kg ha–¹ yr–¹ in Beijing, China, during 2011 and 2012. Turf quality was better at a 5-cm mowing height than a 7.5-cm mowing height in July and October and was equivalent between the two mowing heights for the other months. Visual quality was highest in plots receiving N at 400 kg ha–¹ yr–¹ in May, June, September, October, and November. In August, however, the highest visual turf quality was observed for an N rate of 100 kg ha–¹ yr–¹. Generally, the 5-cm mowing height and low N application produced high shoot density and ground coverage by zoysiagrass, whereas the shoot density of tall fescue showed no difference between the two mowing heights. The higher N rate most often favored greater tall fescue shoot density and ground coverage. Based on the results, we recommend a 5-cm mowing height and an N rate of 400 kg ha–¹ yr–¹, avoiding application in August, for the mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aZoysia japonica 3aagronomy 3abonsai 3alawns and turf 3aturf grasses 3avegetation cover 3awarm season 3aChina1 aLi, Qing1 aLiu, Wei1 aLi, Deying0 tAgronomy journal.g2014 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.1-6dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.01483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007500168300001800243520150300261592002801764650001501792650001101807650001901818650001501837650002801852650001601880651001001896700001701906700002301923700001201946773012201958856008502080852000902165655001202174IND60537083920221119060443.0161213e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053708392DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2016.12143002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yunwei12aA multiple-point spatially weighted k-NN classifier for remote sensing  ap. 4441-4459.  aA novel classification method based on multiple-point statistics (MPS) is proposed in this article. The method is a modified version of the spatially weighted k -nearest neighbour (k -NN) classifier, which accounts for spatial correlation through weights applied to neighbouring pixels. The MPS characterizes the spatial correlation between multiple points of land-cover classes by learning local patterns in a training image. This rich spatial information is then converted to multiple-point probabilities and incorporated into the k -NN classifier. Experiments were conducted in two study areas, in which the proposed method for classification was tested on a WorldView-2 sub-scene of the Sichuan mountainous area and an IKONOS image of the Beijing urban area. The multiple-point weighted k -NN method (MP k -NN) was compared to several alternatives; including the traditional k -NN and two previously published spatially weighted k -NN schemes; the inverse distance weighted k -NN, and the geostatistically weighted k -NN. The classifiers using the Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods, and these classifiers weighted with spatial context using the Markov random field (MRF) model, were also introduced to provide a benchmark comparison with the MP k -NN method. The proposed approach increased classification accuracy significantly relative to the alternatives, and it is, thus, recommended for the identification of land-cover types with complex and diverse spatial distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland cover 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3astatistics 3asupport vector machines 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aJing, Linhai1 aAtkinson, Peter M.1 aLi, Hui0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2016 Sept. 16, v. 37, no. 18 p.4441-4459dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.12143003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245016100164500001900325520104400344592002801388650001801416650001501434650001701449650002101466650002401487650002401511650001201535650001001547650004201557650001101599650001101610650002201621650001201643650002301655650002601678650001001704650001601714653002401730653002201754653003001776700001501806700001301821700001701834700002101851700001401872773010601886856008701992852000902079655001202088IND60697951620221117161826.0200719e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069795162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Lan10aEnhancement of anaerobic digestion of phoenix tree leaf by mild alkali pretreatment: Optimization by Taguchi orthogonal design and semi-continuous operation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed at evaluating the valorization of a typical yard waste, phoenix tree leaf (PTL), through mild alkali pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion (AD). To this end, L₉ Taguchi orthogonal biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests and semi-continuous AD experiments were conducted to examine the optimum pretreatment condition and the long term effect of alkali pretreatment on AD. The community structure evolutions were analyzed by high throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The results indicated that alkali pretreatment was effective on decrystallization and releasing more surface of PTL for enzyme attacking. The methane yield was positively correlated with lignin removal (R²=0.8242). In semi-continuous mode, 151.5±7.9 mL/g VS of the methane yield was obtained for alkali pretreated PTL, which was 80% higher than that of untreated one.

The results showed that vermicomposting could effectively remove Cd (up to 18.9%) from the BR. Synchrotron radiation based FTIR spectromicroscopy demonstrated a weakened correlation between functional groups after vermicomposting, suggesting that the activity of earthworms affects the binding sites and bioavailability of heavy metals. Under optimum conditions, the hydrolysis rate of earthworms was ~97% and the removal efficiency of Cd was up to 93%. Furthermore, addition of 20% of earthworm hydrolysate promoted the largest production of Trichoderma sporulation (~2.95 × 10⁸ cfu/g straw), indicating the possibility of earthworm hydrolysates promoting the growth of Trichoderma guizhouense is a suitable way to recycle earthworms after vermicomposting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aTrichoderma 3abioavailability 3abiogas 3acadmium 3aearthworms 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3asporulation 3astraw 3atechnology 3avermicomposting 0aAmino acid 0aBiogas residues 0aTrichoderma guizhouense 0aSynchrotron radiation1 aYu, Guang-Hui1 aNing, Jing-Yuan1 aZhu, Xiao-Dong1 aGoodman, B.

In order to investigate the LCCCI of this resource, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of a WTE facility in Jamesville, NY, was performed utilizing system expansion to account for avoided landfilling emissions, additional metals recycling, and the loss of potential electricity generation from landfill gas. The LCCCI of electricity from this WTE facility ranges from 0.664 to 0.951 kg CO₂ₑq/kWh before system expansion, which reduced the impact to −0.280 to 0.593 kg CO₂ₑq/kWh when accounting for avoided waste management emissions. Combustion is the leading contributor of GHG emissions from cradle-to-gate, and sensitivity analysis indicates that the nonbiogenic fraction of the waste most significantly influences the LCCCI before including cobenefits. The fraction of methane from landfills that is not captured is the most influential variable under system expansion. Before system expansion, the LCCCI of this system is comparable to that of electricity from fossil fuels. With system expansion, the LCCCI ranges from below that of renewable energy to comparable to natural gas based electricity. These results disagree with claims in the reviewed literature that WTE can avoid GHG emissions overall, although avoided emissions reduce the magnitude of its impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3acradle-to-gate 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3alandfills 3amethane 3amunicipal solid waste 3anatural gas 3atechnology1 aVolk, Timothy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6969-92811 aFortier, Marie-Odile P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0737-00770 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 55, no. 3 p.1436-1445dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c034773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008900165300001800254520155500272592002801827596002901855596003701884596001901921650001901940650002201959650002601981650001102007650001802018650001002036650001702046650002302063650003502086650001902121650001202140651001202152653002302164653002502187653001602212653002702228700006002255700002202315700002502337773010802362856008202470852000902552655001202561IND60708511820221120215235.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070851182DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-19-2461-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yixiao10aDecreased Sensitivity of Leptosphaeria maculans to Pyraclostrobin in Alberta, Canada  ap. 2462-2468.  aLeptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of blackleg of canola (Brassica napus), can be managed with pyraclostrobin and other strobilurin fungicides. Their frequent application, however, poses a risk for the development of insensitivity in fungal populations. A collection of L. maculans single-spore isolates recovered from infected canola stubble in Alberta, Canada, in 2016 was evaluated for its pyraclostrobin sensitivity. In conventional growth plate assays, the concentration of pyraclostrobin required to inhibit fungal growth by 50% (EC₅₀) was determined to be 0.28 mg/liter in a subset of 38 isolates. This EC₅₀ was four times greater than the mean EC₅₀ (0.07 mg/liter) of baseline isolates collected in 2011. Two hundred sixty-three isolates were screened further with two discriminatory doses of 0.28 and 3.5 mg/liter of pyraclostrobin, resulting in growth inhibition values ranging from 16 to 82% and 41 to 100%, respectively. In microtiter plate assays with the same isolates, the mean EC₅₀ was determined to be 0.0049 mg/liter, almost 3.3 times greater than the mean EC₅₀ (0.0015 mg/liter) of the baseline isolates. The sensitivity of the isolates was also evaluated in microtiter plate assays with discriminatory doses of 0.006 and 0.075 mg/liter of pyraclostrobin, resulting in inhibition values ranging from 20 to 88% and 49 to 100%, respectively. This is the first report of isolates of L. maculans with increased insensitivity to pyraclostrobin in Canada, suggesting the need for improved fungicide stewardship.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanola Council of Canada  cAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada  cAlberta Canola 3aBrassica napus 3aPlenodomus lingam 3ablackleg of crucifers 3acanola 3afungal growth 3afungi 3agrowth plate 3agrowth retardation 3amedian effective concentration 3apyraclostrobin 3astubble 3aAlberta 0ablackleg of canola 0afungicide resistance 0asensitivity 0aLeptosphaeria maculans1 aAkhavan, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4991-01981 aHwang, Sheau-Fang1 aStrelkov, Stephen E.0 tPlant disease.g2020 Sept., v. 104, no. 9 p.2462-2468dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-11-19-2461-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014800166520194500314592002802259650001402287650001902301650001902320650001202339650001102351650004302362650002402405650002102429650002102450650001102471650001502482651001002497653003402507653002602541653002502567653002002592700001302612700001602625700001702641700001902658773010202677856008502779852000902864655001202873IND60750613220221118040351.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075061322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1057112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Junxia10aResponse of soil respiration and Q10 to temperature and moisture in naturally regenerated and bare lands based on an 11-year observation period  aAlthough correlations between soil respiration (Rₛ) and environmental factors in different ecosystems have been extensively investigated, results based on long-term experiments are limited. In this study, we analyzed the correlations between Rₛ and soil temperature (Tₛ), moisture (θ), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil organic matter (SOM) based on an 11-year field campaign in abandoned farmland (HD) and bare land (LD) areas with a Cambisol soil type in the eastern Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that the mean annual Rₛ and annual temperature sensitivity (Q₁₀) values in HD were significantly larger than those in LD during the measurement period. Rₛ and the annual contribution ratio (Rᵣₐₜᵢₒ) of root respiration (Rᵣ) to Rₛ in HD increased significantly with vegetation recovery years. On the annual scale, Rₛ was controlled primarily by Tₛ at both sites. However, in the summer months, Rₛ was controlled by θ rather than Tₛ. A two-variable model, including Tₛ and θ, could more accurately predict the temporal variations in Rₛ at the annual and seasonal time scales than a single-variable model, and the explanatory power of the equations in HD was significantly larger than that in LD. On the interannual scale, variations in the annual Rₛ and Rᵣ showed significant positive correlations with the annual θ and NDVI and SOM, and negative correlations with Tₛ in HD. Moreover, the annual Q₁₀ was significantly positively related to θ in HD. In LD, the only significant relationship was between the annual Q₁₀ and the annual θ. All differences between HD and LD in Rₛ, Tₛ, and θ and their correlations were attributed to differences in vegetation. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term observations for the accurate estimation of CO₂ efflux in semiarid regions and the impact of vegetation changes on soil respiration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aabandoned land 3acarbon dioxide 3acatenas 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3avegetation 3aChina 0aTemperature sensitivity (Q10) 0aInterannual variation 0aEnvironmental factor 0aEmpirical model1 aFeng, Ya1 aLi, Junjian1 aLi, Hongjian1 aDing, Guangwei0 tCatena.g2022 Jan., v. 208 p.105711-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1057113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05758naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245009600203520392500299592002804224650001704252650001604269650002204285650002204307650001204329650001104341650001204352650001804364650001404382650001804396650000804414650001204422650001004434650001004444650001104454650003304465650001304498650001304511650001304524650001804537650003104555650001604586650001404602650001104616650002204627650001604649650001704665651001104682651001004693651001604703653002304719653002504742700002604767700002304793700001804816700002604834700002104860700001904881773010404900856008305004852000905087655001205096IND60708511920221121111125.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070851192DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-19-2499-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3118-818710aFirst Report of Cladosporium tenuissimum Causing Blossom Blight on Strawberry in the Brazil  aBlossom blight in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) was first detected in high tunnel covered field plantings of cultivar Monterey imported from Chile. This detection occurred in the municipality of Barra da Estiva, Bahia, Brazil, during the months of January and February 2018. The disease occurred during all seasons of the year, with an average incidence of ∼20%. Disease symptoms began with gray sporulation of the fungus on the stigmas and anthers of strawberry flowers, followed by necrosis and full flower abortion, similar to that described by Nam et al. (2015) in South Korea. The fungus was isolated directly from affected pistils, which were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25°C with a 12-h dark/light cycle. Five isolates on PDA culture presented both immersed and superficial mycelium composed of branched hyphae, 1 to 5 μm wide, septate, subhyaline to pale brown, smooth, with thin walls. The conidiophores are macronematous, solitary, sometimes in groups of two to three, erect, straight or slightly flexuous, cylindrical, 5 to 7 μm wide, having intercalary swellings, sometimes slightly geniculate toward the apex, unbranched or branched, reaching 500 × 3 to 4 μm, septate, medium brown, smooth, possessing walls somewhat thickened, and presenting a swollen base. The conidiogenous cells are integrated, terminal and intercalary, cylindrical-oblong, 10 to 42 μm long, sub-denticulate to denticulate. The ramoconidia are rare, subcylindrical or cylindrical, 17 to 27 × 3 to 4 μm, continuous, sometimes one-septate, with a broadly truncate base, 2 to 3.5 μm wide. The conidia form branched chains with small terminal conidia, subglobose, obovoid, limoniform, sometimes globose, 4 to 5 × 2 to 3 μm, aseptate, apically rounded; the secondary ramoconidia are ellipsoid, fusiform to subcylindrical or cylindrical, 8 to 10 × 4 to 7 μm, with distal hila, zero- to one-septate, pale brown or pale olivaceous-brown, smooth, walls unthickened, attenuated toward apex and showing a basal hilum conspicuous, sub-denticulate to denticulate. Culture characteristics: colonies on PDA attained up to 84 mm in diameter after 14 days, smoke-gray, reverse gray to olivaceous-black, woolly to fluffy, margin glabrous to feathery, gray-olivaceous to white, aerial mycelium abundant, high, fluffy, smoke-gray, dense, without exudates, sporulating. These morphological characteristics fit the description of Cladosporium tenuissimum Cook (Bensch et al. 2012). Morphological identification was confirmed through phylogenetic analyses using the combined internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (TEF) sequences of related species. To amplify the ITS region and the TEF, the respective primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) were used. The resulting sequences from one isolate have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MK775118 (TEF) and MT241370 (ITS). BLASTn analysis revealed that the sequences were 100% identical to the respective ITS (MH864840) and TEF (HM148442) of the neotype strain of C. tenuissimum (CBS 125995). Phylogenetic analysis further confirmed the results. The pathogenicity test was performed with conidia of a 14-day-old culture, sprayed at a final concentration of 16.5 × 10⁶ conidia/ml on flower clusters of Monterey variety strawberry plants. Nine plants and three flower clusters per plant were used. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew plastic box at 25°C and 100% relative humidity. The same procedure was done with sterilized water sprayed on two control plants. All inoculated strawberry flowers reproduced symptoms of blossom blight within 2 days. C. tenuissimum was reisolated from the inoculated flowers. This is the first report of the occurrence of this fungus on strawberry blossom in Brazil, and the second report worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium 3aDNA primers 3aFragaria ananassa 3aabortion (plants) 3aanthers 3ablight 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adew 3aflowers 3afungi 3agenes 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3aneotypes 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphotoperiod 3aphylogeny 3apistil 3arelative humidity 3asporulation 3astrawberries 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aSouth Korea 0apathogen detection 0aFragaria × ananassa1 aRocha Sobrinho, G.

The aim of the study is to document the resence of Chordatortilis crassicauda (Nematoda, Acuariidae) in the Wren Troglodytes troglodytes. Four Chordatortilis crassicauda individuals (three female and one male) were found between the proventriculus and muscular stomach of one T. troglodytes individual (adult female) collected in the village of Wicie on the Baltic Coast (north-western Poland) on 28 April 2013. The Wren is a new hostrecord for C. crassicauda. The fact that C. crassicauda had not previously been recorded in Europe may indicate that it is a rare species, specific to birds of the genus Troglodytes, which seldom undergo necropsy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcuariidae 3aTroglodytes troglodytes 3aadults 3abirds 3acoasts 3afemales 3amales 3anecropsy 3aparasites 3aproventriculus 3arare species 3astomach 3avillages 3aBrazil 3aPoland 0aChordatortilinae 0aEurope 0aparasites 0aTroglodytidae1 aRząd, I.0 tHelminthologia.g2016 Mar. 1, v. 53, no. 1 p.99-104dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helmin-2015-00753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002600158245009200184300001600276520134700292592002801639650001201667650001801679650001201697650001101709650002301720650001201743650001101755650001101766650000701777650001801784650001301802650001201815650003101827650004501858650004701903650002001950650002301970650002401993700002602017700002202043700002402065700001902089773009802108856007302206852000902279655001202288IND50072441220221120140311.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007244122DNAL7 a243439092pmid7 a10.1111/gcb.124852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrieder, Christina A.10aCan variable pH and low oxygen moderate ocean acidification outcomes for mussel larvae?  ap. 754-764.  aNatural variation and changing climate in coastal oceans subject meroplanktonic organisms to broad ranges of pH and oxygen ([O₂]) levels. In controlled‐laboratory experiments we explored the interactive effects of pH, [O₂], and semidiurnal pH fluctuations on the survivorship, development, and size of early life stages of two mytilid mussels, Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis. Survivorship of larvae was unaffected by low pH, low [O₂], or semidiurnal fluctuations for both mytilid species. Low pH (<7.6) resulted in delayed transition from the trochophore to veliger stage, but this effect of low pH was absent when incorporating semidiurnal fluctuations in both species. Also at low pH, larval shells were smaller and had greater variance; this effect was absent when semidiurnal fluctuations of 0.3 units were incorporated at low pH for M. galloprovincialis but not for M. californianus. Low [O₂] in combination with low pH had no effect on larval development and size, indicating that early life stages of mytilid mussels are largely tolerant to a broad range of [O₂] reflective of their environment (80–260 μmol kg⁻¹). The role of pH variability should be recognized as an important feature in coastal oceans that has the capacity to modulate the effects of ocean acidification on biological responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aacidification 3aclimate 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amussels 3aoceans 3aoxygen 3apH 3asurvival rate 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMytilusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOceans and Seas 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxchemistry1 aGonzalez, Jennifer P.1 aBockmon, Emily E.1 aNavarro, Michael O.1 aLevin, Lisa A.0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.754-764dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.124853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012600163300001800289520145500307592002801762650001001790650001301800650001801813650002901831650001301860650001301873650002501886650001701911650001401928650001101942650001801953650001201971650000901983650001201992650004902004650000902053650001802062650001902080650001002099653001402109653002202123653003402145653001002179700001502189700001802204700001902222700001702241700001502258700001302273700001302286700001602299700002402315700001802339700002002357700005302377773012202430856008502552852000902637655001202646IND60570285520221116215422.0180829e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057028552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xing10aVitamin C deficiency exacerbates diabetic glomerular injury through activation of transforming growth factor-β signaling  ap. 2186-2195.  aThe hyperglycemia and hyperoxidation that characterize diabetes lead to reduced vitamin C (VC) in diabetic humans and experimentally diabetic animals. Herein, we access the effects of VC deficiency on the diabetic kidney injury and explore the underlying mechanism.l-gulonolactone oxidase conventional knockout (Gulo⁻/⁻) mice genetically unable to synthesize VC were subjected to streptozotocin-induced diabetic kidney injury and the role of VC deficiency was evaluated by biochemical and histological approaches. Rat mesangial cells were cultured to investigate the underlying mechanism.Functionally, VC deficiency aggravates the streptozotocin-induced renal insufficiency, exhibiting the increased urine albumin, water intake, and urine volume in Gulo⁻/⁻ mice. Morphologically, VC deficiency exacerbates the streptozotocin-induced kidney injury, exhibiting the increased glomerular expansion, deposition of Periodic Acid-Schiff- and Masson-positive materials, and expression of α-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and type 4 collagen in glomeruli of Gulo⁻/⁻ mice. Mechanistically, VC activates protein kinase B (Akt) to destabilize Ski and thereby induce the expression of Smad7, resulting in suppression of TGF-β/Smad signaling and extracellular matrix deposition in mesangial cells.VC is essential for the renal function maintenance in diabetes.Compensation for the loss of VC could be an effective remedy for diabetic kidney injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aalbumins 3aascorbic acid 3aascorbic acid deficiency 3acollagen 3adiabetes 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3ahistology 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3akidneys 3amice 3amuscles 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3arats 3arenal failure 3arenal function 3aurine 0aVitamin C 0aGlomerular injury 0aTransforming growth factor-β 0aSmad71 aHu, Xinhua1 aZou, Chaochun1 aRuan, Hongfeng1 aFan, Xueying1 aTang, Chao1 aShi, Wei1 aMei, Liu1 aZhu, Haibin1 aHussain, Musaddique1 aZeng, Linghui1 aZhang, Xiaodong1 aWu, Ximei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3316-893X0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Sept., v. 1861, no. 9 p.2186-2195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008600166300001400252520034100266592002800607650002600635650001300661650000900674650001000683650001000693650001500703651001400718653001400732653001800746653001700764653003000781653001500811653002600826700002300852700001900875773010200894856008100996852000901077655001201086IND60520021820221121140057.0210304e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052002182DNAL7 a10.1515/helmin-2015-00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScioscia, N.

The reported uses of these species by Native American and First Nations peoples include analgesic, antiinflammatory, antiseptic, immunostimulation activity, as well as the treatment of afflictions from spiritual origins. Taxonomic revision for North American Sagebrush has created a number of synonyms that confuse the literature. The phytochemical diversity of the Tridentatae includes at least 220 distinct and important specialized metabolites. This manuscript reviews the current phytochemical, botanical and pharmacological understanding for the subgenus Tridentatae, and provides a foundation for future studies of the metabolomes of the Tridentatae. Modern approaches to phytochemical analysis and drug discovery are likely to provide interesting lead compounds in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aFirst Nations 3aanalgesics 3aantiseptics 3aindigenous species 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ataxonomic revisions 0aArtemisia tridentata 0aTridentatae 0aAsteraceae 0aSagebrush 0aSpiritual botany1 aShipley, Paul R.1 aMurch, S.

The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and N -nitrosodimethylamine formation potential (NDMA-FP) of the reservoir and canal water were analyzed. Water samples from two reservoirs and raw water from water treatment plants at upstream, midstream, and downstream locations of the canal were collected twice. The analysis of the DMA, DEA, DBA, and AN were conducted using gas chromatography and spectrofluorometry techniques. The DMA, DEA, and DBA levels in the reservoir and canal waters ranged from not detectable (ND) to 10 µg/L and from ND to 21.2 µg/L, respectively. AN was detected from 123 to 129 ng/L and from 112 to 177 ng/L in the reservoir and canal waters, respectively. The DMA, DEA, DBA, and AN exhibited two fluorescent peaks at 230nm Eₓ/345nm Eₘ and 280 nm Eₓ/355nm Eₘ. These two peaks corresponded to the peak positions of tryptophan. Detection limits of DMA, DEA, and DBA for fluorescent analysis were 500 μg/L whereas that of AN and tryptophan were 10 and 0.5 μg/L, respectively. The NDMA-FP measured in all the water samples was lower than the detection limit of 237 ng/L. THMFP ranged from 175 to 248 μg/L and 214 to 429 μg/L was detected in the reservoir and canal waters, respectively. The THMFP/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the reservoir and canal waters were comparable within the ranges of 73 to 131 µg THMFP/mg DOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3abyproducts 3adetection limit 3adimethylamine 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agas chromatography 3atryptophan 3awater treatment 3awatersheds 3aThailand 0aAliphatic and aromatic amines 0acanal 0areservoir 0aFEEM 0aTHMFP 0aNDMA-FP1 aMusikavong, Charongpun1 aSuttinun, Oramas0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 Sept. 18, v. 51, no. 11 p.900-913dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2016.11913033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008600166300001800252520190600270592002802176596006402204650001302268650002202281650002002303650002402323650001802347650002602365650003202391650001502423650002402438650001102462650001702473650001502490650002302505650001602528650002002544650001602564650001402580650001702594650001602611650001302627650000902640650001502649650001102664650001202675651001002687653002102697653002802718653001402746653002802760653002802788653002702816653002902843700006002872773010802932856008203040852000903122655001203131IND60708512220221120234728.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070851222DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-12-19-2556-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishad, Resna10aSurvey and Identification of Date Palm Pathogens and Indigenous Biocontrol Agents  ap. 2498-2508.  aFungal diseases are considered a major threat to plant growth and productivity. However, some beneficial fungi growing in the same environment protect plants from various pathogens, either by secreting antifungal metabolites or by stimulating the host immune defense mechanism. Date palms are susceptible to several fungal pathogens. Nevertheless, information on the pathogenic fungal distribution in date palm fields across different seasons is limited, especially that from Qatar. Therefore, the current study’s aim was to evaluate the pathogenic and beneficial fungal diversity and distribution, including the endophytic fungi from the date palm tissues and root-associated soil fungi, during different seasons, for the identification of indigenous biocontrol agents. Our results showed that the highest number of fungal species was isolated in fall and spring, and pathogenic fungi were isolated mainly in spring. This is the first report that in Qatar, Neodeightonia phoenicum and Thielaviopsis punctulata cause date palm root rot disease, Fusarium brachygibbosum and Fusarium equiseti cause date palm wilting, and N. phoenicum causes diplodia disease in date palm offshoots. The combinations of the fungi that did not frequently occur together in date palm rhizosphere soil were investigated to identify indigenous biocontrol agents. Based on the results, we determined that Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma longibrachiatum are effective antagonistic fungi against T. punctulata, N. phoenicum, F. brachygibbosum, and Fusarium solani, qualifying them as potential biocontrol agents. Antagonistic activity of endophytic fungi against the pathogens was tested; except for Ulocladium chartarum, no endophytic fungi showed antagonistic activity against the tested pathogens.

In a long‐term study, we investigated the effects of food availability and elevated pCO₂(ca. 400, 1000 and 3000 μatm) on growth of newly settled Amphibalanus (Balanus) improvisus to reproduction, and on their offspring. We also compared two different populations, which were presumed to differ in their sensitivity to pCO₂due to differing habitat conditions: Kiel Fjord, Germany (Western Baltic Sea) with naturally strong pCO₂fluctuations, and the Tjärnö Archipelago, Sweden (Skagerrak) with far lower fluctuations. Over 20 weeks, survival, growth, reproduction and shell strength of Kiel barnacles were all unaffected by elevated pCO₂, regardless of food availability. Moulting frequency and shell corrosion increased with increasing pCO₂in adults. Larval development and juvenile growth of the F1 generation were tolerant to increased pCO₂, irrespective of parental treatment. In contrast, elevated pCO₂had a strong negative impact on survival of Tjärnö barnacles. Specimens from this population were able to withstand moderate levels of elevated pCO₂over 5 weeks when food was plentiful but showed reduced growth under food limitation. Severe levels of elevated pCO₂negatively impacted growth of Tjärnö barnacles in both food treatments. We demonstrate a conspicuously higher tolerance to elevated pCO₂in Kiel barnacles than in Tjärnö barnacles. This tolerance was carried over from adults to their offspring. Our findings indicate that populations from fluctuating pCO₂environments are more tolerant to elevated pCO₂than populations from more stable pCO₂habitats. We furthermore provide evidence that energy availability can mediate the ability of barnacles to withstand moderate CO₂stress. Considering the high tolerance of Kiel specimens and the possibility to adapt over many generations, near future OA alone does not seem to present a major threat for A. improvisus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalanus 3aacidification 3aadults 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3alarval development 3amolting 3aprogeny 3areproduction 2aAnimal Shellsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aCrustaceaxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aFood 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMolting 2aOceans and Seas 2aReproduction 2aSeawaterxchemistry 3aBaltic Sea 3aGermany 3aSweden1 aSchaub, Iris1 aHavenhand, Jonathan1 aWahl, Martin0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.765-777dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.124783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011300176520101100289592002801300650001601328650001201344650002501356650001901381650001101400650002601411651001101437653001301448653001701461653002001478653002101498700003201519700003701551773008701588856008501675852000901760655001201769IND60750613620221118040458.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075061362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1057172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sena, Ítalo Sousa10aGeotourism Potential in Karst Geosystems: An example from the Lund Warming Ramsar Site, Minas Gerais, Brazil  aThe Lund Warming Ramsar Site (LWRS), located in southeastern Brazil, is an area rich in geological and geomorphological features, especially karst formations that are excellent representatives of local geodiversity. However, the Geotourism potential of LWRS has not yet been studied in its full potential. This research aims to perform a spatial analysis of the Geotourism potential of LWRS. The methods used were a quantitative evaluation of sites and the spatialisation of geotourism according to four variables: geodiversity index, visibility, capillarity, and the fragility of the abiotic system. The results indicate a spatial distribution of the Geotourism potential associated with the natural protection areas network and transport infrastructure. It is believed that the results of this analysis can support decisions within the territorial scope of the LWRS, thus safeguarding the healthy functioning of the karst geosystem without giving up the possibility of economic development in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillarity 3acatenas 3aeconomic development 3ainfrastructure 3akarsts 3aquantitative analysis 3aBrazil 0aWetlands 0aGeodiversity 0aGeoconservation 0aSpatial analysis1 aRuchkys, Úrsula de Azevedo1 aTravassos, Luiz Eduardo Panisset0 tCatena.g2022 Jan., v. 208 p.105717-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1057173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016100170300001600331520117800347592002801525650002401553650001901577650001001596650001401606650004101620650001101661650002701672650001501699650002501714653002701739653001901766653004101785653003101826700001701857700001801874700001801892700001701910700001801927700001801945773012401963856008502087852000902172655001202181IND60537084520221119060328.0160807e20160918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053708452DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2016.11913042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengtao10aValidation and application of an analytical method for the determination of selected acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogenic hormones in wastewater and sludge  ap. 914-920.  aThis study was undertaken to develop an extraction method for seven acidic pharmaceuticals and five steroidal estrogens from wastewater, treated wastewater and sludge samples.

Our results show that pretreatment combined with solid phase extraction (SPE) for wastewater samples (using an ENVI-C18 cartridge) and liquid-solid extraction combined with SPE (using an HLB cartridge) for sludge samples increased the analytical efficiency for acidic pharmaceuticals and estrogenic hormones using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The derivatization conditions were optimized at 40°C for 2 h. In addition, the derivatized samples were stable at ambient temperature. The new method was validated and applied to the analysis of real wastewater and discharged sludge samples from a local wastewater treatment plant.

Many of these materials pose an ecological threat in that they can take decades if not centuries to biodegrade in landfills consequently allowing long-term seepage of hazardous materials into the soil and water supply. The purpose of this project was to construct an eco-friendly biodegradable battery employing aluminum and copper as an anode and cathode, and utilizing natural components for the electrolyte system and battery casing. In order to create the battery, a paper derived from cellulose grass, okra juice, and water was used to contain the citric acid-rich lemon juice electrolyte that was subsequently encased in the biodegradable plastic casing. The paper matrix was then placed between the electrodes and water was added, creating a functional, eco-friendly battery. The cells generated an average of .51 volts over a 24-hour period and an average of .50 volts when placed in circuit with a 1-watt, 10-ohm resistor. The gelatin-based, biodegradable plastic was tested and was found to completely biodegrade in 33 hours, making it the optimal eco-friendly battery.  aPublisher supplied data 0abattery 0abiodegradable 0aecological 0anon-hazardous0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2007 Apr., v. 110, no. 1 p.116-124dTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Sciencex0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660%2F0022-8443%282007%29110%5B116%3APAUOBM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012100167300001600288500001900304520145900323592002801782596014201810596013201952650001602084650001702100650001802117650001602135650001702151700002302168700005902191773011502250856008202365852000902447655001202456IND60728809520221120205354.0210224e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072880952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-020-01472-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Chengqian10aApplication of the highly sensitive labeling reagent to the structural confirmation of readily isomerizable peptides  ap. 339-343.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThioamycolamide A (1) is a biosynthetically unique cytotoxic cyclic microbial lipopeptide that bears a D-configured thiazoline, a thioether bridge, a fatty acid side chain, and a reduced C-terminus. It has gained attention for its unique structure, and very recently we reported the total synthesis of 1 via a biomimetic route. The NMR spectra of synthetic 1 agreed with those of natural 1. However, structural identity between peptidic natural and synthetic compounds is often difficult to confirm by comparison of NMR spectra because their NMR spectra vary depending on the conditions in the NMR tube, which often result in the structural misassignment of peptidic compounds. Especially, our total synthesis based on the putative biomimetic route potentially gives 1 as a diastereomixture at the final step. The problem is that the diastereomers of peptidic mid-sized molecules often exhibit similar properties (such as NMR spectra and bioactivities), and their separation procedures are often laborious. Herein we report the structural confirmation of synthetic 1 by the LC–MS-based chromatographic comparison with the use of our highly sensitive labeling reagent L-FDVDA; the highly sensitive-advanced Marfey’s method (HS-advanced Marfey’s method). This work demonstrated the utility of our highly sensitive labeling reagent for the structural determination of not only scarce natural products but also readily isomerizable synthetic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H06401, 19H02840ca Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan  a18K14396ca Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan 3abiomimetics 3acytotoxicity 3adiastereomers 3afatty acids 3alipopeptides1 aKuranaga, Takefumi1 aKakeya, Hideaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4293-73310 tNatural medicines.g2021 Mar., v. 75, no. 2 p.339-343dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-020-01472-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002700135040001800162100001800180245010700198300001600305506007600321520141100397592002801808506003701836650001101873650002501884650001501909650001101924650002601935650001501961650001501976650001101991650001102002650002502013650002302038650000902061650002502070650002602095650001602121650001502137650000902152650001702161650002402178650001202202650002002214650001002234650002102244650002002265700002602285700001902311700002002330700001902350700003102369700002102400700001802421700001802439700002102457773009802478856004002576852000902616655001202625IND50072441620221207123017.0140129e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007244162DNAL7 a239969172pmid7 aPMC42987652pmcid7 a10.1111/gcb.123752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowland, Lucy10aEvidence for strong seasonality in the carbon storage and carbon use efficiency of an Amazonian forest  ap. 979-991.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe relative contribution of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in the net carbon flux of tropical forests remains poorly quantified by both modelling and field studies. We use data assimilation to combine nine ecological time series from an eastern Amazonian forest, with mass balance constraints from an ecosystem carbon cycle model. The resulting analysis quantifies, with uncertainty estimates, the seasonal changes in the net carbon flux of a tropical rainforest which experiences a pronounced dry season. We show that the carbon accumulation in this forest was four times greater in the dry season than in the wet season and that this was accompanied by a 5% increase in the carbon use efficiency. This seasonal response was caused by a dry season increase in gross primary productivity, in response to radiation and a similar magnitude decrease in heterotrophic respiration, in response to drying soils. The analysis also predicts increased carbon allocation to leaves and wood in the wet season, and greater allocation to fine roots in the dry season. This study demonstrates implementation of seasonal variations in parameters better enables models to simulate observed patterns in data. In particular, we highlight the necessity to simulate the seasonal patterns of heterotrophic respiration to accurately simulate the net carbon flux seasonal tropical forest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3adry season 3adrying 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3afine roots 3aleaves 3amodels 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3atime series analysis 3atropical rain forests 3auncertainty 3awet season 3awood 2aCarbon Cycle 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSeasons 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTrees 2aTropical Climate 2aWaterxanalysis1 aHill, Timothy Charles1 aStahl, Clement1 aSiebicke, Lukas1 aBurban, Benoit1 aZaragoza‐Castells, Joana1 aPonton, Stephane1 aBonal, Damien1 aMeir, Patrick1 aWilliams, Mathew0 tGlobal change biology.g2014 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.979-991dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12375  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010000166300001600266520094200282592002801224650002001252650001601272650001101288650001501299650001201314650002201326650003001348650001601378650001401394650001601408650002501424650001101449650001801460650002401478650002201502650001301524650001601537651001101553653002801564653004901592653002901641653002401670700002501694700002701719700002401746773010401770856008101874852000901955655001201964IND60520022120221121091113.0210304e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052002212DNAL7 a10.1515/helmin-2016-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillar-Luna, E.10aPresence of Meloidogyne enterolobii on Jalapeño pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in Sinaloa, Mexico  ap. 155-160.  aMeloidogyne enterolobii (Me) is an emerging root-knot nematode (RKN) and the most important worldwide for its high aggressiveness and increasing geographical distribution. In Mexico only in watermelon and tomato has been reported. Here we report the presence of this nematode in Jalapeño pepper collected in the state of Sinaloa. The morphological and morphometric characteristics of the second-stage juveniles and adult females were similar to those described for Me. DNA sequencing and alignment analysis (BLAST/GenBank) showed that the SCAR and rDNA IGS2 fragments had a 99 % of identity, with Me DNA sequences present in the database. The results obtained indicate that the RKN detected corresponds to M. enterolobii. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this nematode in chilli pepper in this region of Mexico, considered of major economic importance for the variety of vegetables grown and the extension of the area sown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aMeloidogyne 3aadults 3aaggression 3afemales 3agenetic databases 3ageographical distribution 3ahot peppers 3ajuveniles 3amorphometry 3anucleotide sequences 3apepper 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes 3awatermelons 3aMexico 0aMeloidogyne mayaguensis 0aPCR; sequence-characterized amplified region 0aintergenic spacer region 0aroot-knot nematodes1 aGoméz-Rodriguez, O.1 aRojas-Martínez, R.

The temperature, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were reached the maturity of compost. Results indicated that BD + B treatment promoted organic matter degradation and increased humic acid content by 19.5–25.1% from the control (CK). Additionally, the bacterial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing, and their metabolic functions were evaluated through the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstructing unobserved states (PICRUSt). BD + B influenced the microbial community structure of compost, and the PICRUSt results indicated that BD + B strengthened the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted, and a positive correlation was observed between organic matter transformation and temperature, pH, DOC, and community structure. Therefore, regulating these compost properties can effectively promote organic matter transformation during composting.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abeans 3abiochar 3acommunity structure 3acomposts 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3ametabolism 3apH 3aphylogeny 3apig manure 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aB 0aBD 0aPM 0aWS 0aDOC 0aCK 0aPICRUSt 0aRDA 0aHA 0aFA 0aTKN 0aEC 0aTOM 0aTOC 0aKEGG 0aPCA 0aTAMB 0aOTUs 0aRAs 0aComposting 0aOrganic matter 0aBacterial1 aAwasthi, Mukesh Kumar1 aBao, Huanyu1 aBie, Jingya1 aLei, Shuang1 aLv, Jialong0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Oct., v. 313 p.123647-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008000168300001600248500001900264520140700283592002801690650001401718650001001732650001801742650000901760650001301769650002501782650001001807650002401817650001401841700001701855773011501872856008201987852000902069655001202078IND60728809620221120205314.0210224e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072880962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-020-01470-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIijima, Tomoko,10aSedative effects of l-menthol, d-camphor, phenylethyl alcohol, and geraniol  ap. 319-325.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVarious essential oils from plants and fragrance components such as monoterpenes have been discovered to reduce spontaneous movements in mice; thus, it has been made clear that the odor itself has the sedative activity. In the present study, we examined the sedative activity of the odors of fragrance components added to eye drops; l-menthol, d-camphor, phenylethyl alcohol, and geraniol, which are often used as refreshers or preservatives. Each fragrance component was administered by the inhalation route to mice, and the sedative effects were evaluated using an open field test. The results showed that four components administered via inhalation to mice significantly decreased the amount of spontaneous motor activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that all four components have a sedative effect. The optimal concentrations at which l-menthol, d-camphor, phenylethyl alcohol, and geraniol showed the highest sedative activity were 4 × 10–² mg per cage, 4 × 10–⁴ mg per cage, 4 × 10–² mg per cage, and both 4 × 10–⁴ and 4 × 10–² mg per cage, respectively. The AUC graph of geraniol was represented as a W-shaped curve, suggesting that the sedative action of geraniol was biphasic. The present finding demonstrates a new perspective on a possible pharmacological property of eye drop additives used with no expected pharmacological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreathing 3acages 3adose response 3aeyes 3ageraniol 3amedicinal properties 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3asedatives1 aIto, Michiho0 tNatural medicines.g2021 Mar., v. 75, no. 2 p.319-325dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-020-01470-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013000161300001400291520143400305592002801739650001501767650003401782650002501816650001501841650001601856650001601872650001201888650001201900650003601912650001901948650001201967650002601979650002002005650001902025650000702044650002202051650002002073650000902093650001302102650002502115650001502140650001802155650001402173650001002187653001202197653001702209653001702226653002002243653001502263700001702278700001902295773010902314856008202423852000902505655001202514IND60541910420221116235026.0190401e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054191042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Zhou10aLigustrazine attenuates elevated levels of indoxyl sulfate, kidney injury molecule-1 and clusterin in rats exposed to cadmium  ap. 62-68.  aIn this study, we aimed at evaluating the effect of ligustrazine, a major constituent of Ligusticum wallichii from traditional Chinese medicine, on Cd-induced changes in nephrotoxicity indices. Rats were divided into four experimental groups: control; ligustrazine; Cd and ligustrazine+Cd. Cd treated alone group showed significant decreases (P<0.05) in body weight, renal levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR); and significant increases (P<0.05) in urine volume (24h), pH values, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum uric acid, kidney malondialdehyde (MDA), urinary total protein, urinary glucose, urinary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and urinary alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Apart from indoxyl sulfate (a uremic toxin), two newly accepted nephrotoxicity biomarkers including kidney injury molecule-1 (kim-1) and clusterin were also found to be increased. Nonetheless, all these effects induced by Cd were reversed upon treatment by ligustrazine although it failed in decreasing the concentrations of Cd in kidney and urine. Histopathological studies in Cd-treated rats exhibited renal tubule damage, which was also ameliorated by ligustrazine pretreatment. These results suggest that ligustrazine exhibits protective effects on Cd-induced nephrotoxicity. Additionally, this study also demonstrates Cd exposure induces elevated levels of indoxyl sulfate in serum and kidney, and clusterin in urine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigusticum 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acadmium 3aglucose 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amalondialdehyde 3anephrotoxicity 3apH 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3arats 3asulfates 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 3aurea nitrogen 3auric acid 3aurine 0aCadmium 0aLigustrazine 0aAntioxidants 0aIndoxyl sulfate 0aBiomarkers1 aBi, Kai Shun1 aChen, Xiao Hui0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Jan., v. 63 p.62-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008500164300001600249520135500265592002801620650002501648650001401673650001101687650001801698650002401716650002101740650002001761650001701781650001501798650001101813650000901824650001201833650001401845650002001859650001701879650003701896650001601933650001301949653002501962653001701987653002402004653002402028700001902052773010402071856008102175852000902256655001202265IND60520022320221121055210.0210304e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052002232DNAL7 a10.1515/helmin-2016-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOthman, A.

The treatment is a challenge for the physician, and the available therapy is far from ideal. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the effect of heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, on the adult worms and larvae of Trichinella spiralis. This research comprised an in vivo study in which T. spiralis-infected mice were treated by two different doses of geldanamycin, thereafter larval count and pathological changes were determined in the muscles. Meanwhile, the in vitro study investigated the effect of two different concentrations of geldanamycin on adult worms and larvae of T. spiralis via transmission electron microscopy. The in vivo study showed significant reduction of muscle larval counts under the effect of geldanamycin. Moreover, characteristic changes were noted as regards the parasite and the inflammatory response. The in vitro study revealed degenerative changes in the body wall of larvae and adults of T. spiralis under the influence of geldanamycin. In conclusion, heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, seems to have detrimental effects on the adults and larvae of T. spiralis. It, or one of its derivatives, could be an adjuvant to anthelmintic therapy of trichinellosis, but more studies are warranted to establish its usefulness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aadjuvants 3aadults 3aanthelmintics 3aheat shock proteins 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3aintegument 3alarvae 3amice 3amuscles 3aparasites 3atemperate zones 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrichinosis 3azoonoses 0aTrichinella spiralis 0aGeldanamycin 0aHeat shock proteins 0aElectron microscopy1 aShoheib, Z.

The core domain of it (residues 94–292) plays an important role for specific DNA binding. The involved 9 tyrosine and 9 cysteine residues provide the possibility to reduce and combine with gold to get metal nanoclusters such as BSA–AuNCs. In the present study, we develop a new method to synthesize red-emitting nanoclusters, p53–AuNCs, by using p53 core as both reductant and template. The synthetic procedure is one-step, straightforward and ecofriendly. In addition, the p53–AuNCs are found to be a sensitive fluorescence probe to detect and screen myricetin from Chinese medicine, providing a bridge between the kind of tumor-related protein and metallic nanoclusters. Particularly, these AuNCs are highly biocompatible as shown by cytotoxicity experiments and can be readily internalized by Hela cells, illustrating dual functions as a red-emitting material in bioimaging and a potential nanocarrier in drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomarkers 3acysteine 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescent dyes 3agold 3ahuman cell lines 3amyricetin 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3areducing agents 3ascreening 3atumor suppressor protein p53 3atyrosine1 aJia, Xiang-Yu1 aLi, Hong-Wei1 aYu, Xu1 aWu, Yuqing0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 07, v. 7, no. 54 p.34276-34282dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05630c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245018800156300001800344520144100362592002801803650004401831650002301875650002201898650001201920650001701932650001301949650001901962650001501981650001801996650001302014650002902027650003302056650003702089700001802126773014102144856007402285852000902359655001202368IND60670942120221121164649.0191002e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067094212DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta06861k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Shuang12aA novel structure for enhancing the sensitivity of gas sensors – α-Fe₂O₃ nanoropes containing a large amount of grain boundaries and their excellent ethanol sensing performance  ap. 5982-5990.  aNovel one-dimensional (1D) α-Fe₂O₃ nanostructures containing a large amount of grain boundaries have been synthesized through the combination of electrospinning and precursor-calcination techniques. The as-prepared α-Fe₂O₃ nanostructures were composed of orderly arranged building blocks (α-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles) which are connected to each other. The investigation of the morphology evolution revealed that the template fiber geometry has an influential impact on the grain growth behavior during preparation and thus the nanostructures of the final products. Different α-Fe₂O₃ nanostructures (nanostrings and nanoropes) were synthesized using different PAN nanofibers as templates. These two samples are similar in microstructures but very different in grain boundary content. FT-IR spectra, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis were used to characterize the structures of the synthesized products. Comparative ethanol sensing measurements between the α-Fe₂O₃ nanostrings and nanoropes were conducted. The nanoropes which contain more grain boundaries showed a 3 to 4-time enhancement in ethanol response compared to the nanostrings. The results prove that creating a large amount of well-ordered grain boundaries is an effective way to enhance the sensing performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aethanol 3aferric oxide 3ageometry 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWu, Qingsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Mar. 3, v. 3, no. 11 p.5982-5990dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta06861k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013900155300002000294520103400314592002801348650001701376650001101393650001401404650002301418650002101441650002401462650001301486650001901499650001501518650001301533650001301546700001701559700001701576700001701593700001801610700001701628700001501645700001701660773012401677856007401801852000901875655001201884IND60642024520221120063154.0190506e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064202452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra05634f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie10aEfficient synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon with flower-like tungsten nitride nanosheets for improving the oxygen reduction reactions  ap. 33921-33928.  aA novel three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalyst composite was successfully prepared through a facile hydrothermal method, consisting of tungsten nitride nanosheets with flower-like morphology (WN FNs) and nitrogen-doped carbon black (N–C). Highly crystalline WN FNs were observed to be uniformly distributed in N–C, and remarkably promoted the catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the N–C. Moreover, the electrochemical results proved that, WN FNs/N–C composite shows a significantly higher ORR activity with a 4-electron transfer pathway and limiting current density of 5.8 mA cm⁻² in alkaline solutions. The stability test of the nanocomposite showed less degradation after 5 h and its methanol tolerance also was enhanced compared with Pt/C. The improved performance of the WN FNs/N–C composite can be attributed to its unique configuration and the increased exposure of active sites, which suggests that it could serve as an ideal candidate for developing high performance ORR catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3amethanol 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3anitrides 3atungsten1 aChen, Jinwei1 aYang, Haowei1 aFan, Jinlong1 aZhou, Feilong1 aWang, Yichun1 aWang, Gang1 aWang, Ruilin0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 05, v. 7, no. 54 p.33921-33928dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05634f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003300130040001800163100005800181245011200239300001800351500001900369520152400388592002801912596006201940596008302002650001402085650001902099650001502118650002502133650002302158700005802181700005702239700005602296700002002352700005902372773013902431856008002570852000902650655001202659IND60726160620221119141932.0210202e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072616062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c045932chorus7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c045932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yangying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2486-484510aDifferentiating Solutes with Precise Nanofiltration for Next Generation Environmental Separations: A Review  ap. 1359-1376.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelective removal or enrichment of targeted solutes including micropollutants, valuable elements, and mineral scalants from complex aqueous matrices is both challenging and pivotal to the success of water purification and resource recovery from unconventional water resources. Membrane separation with precision at the subnanometer or even subangstrom scale is of paramount importance to address those challenges via enabling “fit-for-purpose” water and wastewater treatment. So far, researchers have attempted to develop novel membrane materials with precise and tailored selectivity by tuning membrane structure and chemistry. In this critical review, we first present the environmental challenges and opportunities that necessitate improved solute–solute selectivity in membrane separation. We then discuss the mechanisms and desired membrane properties required for better membrane selectivity. On the basis of the most recent progress reported in the literature, we examine the key principles of material design and fabrication, which create membranes with enhanced and more targeted selectivity. We highlight the important roles of surface engineering, nanotechnology, and molecular-level design in improving membrane selectivity. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of highly selective NF membranes for practical environmental applications, identifying knowledge gaps that will guide future research to promote environmental sustainability through more precise and tunable membrane separation.  aPublisher supplied data  cBureau of Reclamationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006450  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3achemistry 3ananofiltration 3apollutants 3awastewater treatment 3awater purification1 aTong, Tiezheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9289-33301 aWang, Xiaomao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2907-39511 aLin, Shihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9832-91271 aReid, Elliot M.1 aChen, Yongsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9519-23020 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Jan. 13, v. 55, no. 3 p.1359-1376dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c045933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012100178500001900299520161700318592002801935650002401963650001401987650001202001650001502013650001202028650002302040650002102063650001902084650003302103650002302136650001502159650001402174653002702188653001102215653001802226653002902244653001702273653001002290700003102300700002102331700001902352773010702371856008702478852000902565655001202574IND60697952720221117175700.0200621e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069795272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1056022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDima, Andreea Daniela10aOptimization of substrate composition in anaerobic co-digestion of agricultural waste using central composite design  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochemical methane potential (BMP) tests and modelling of anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of ternary mixtures of agricultural waste, i.e., sugar beet root waste (BW), cow dung (CD), and poultry manure (PM), are presented. According to a two-factor central composite design (CCD), 12 BMP tests were conducted under mesophilic conditions for 30 days (d). CD mass fraction (0.146–0.854) in the animal manure mixture and C/N ratio (13.515–30.485) of ternary waste mixture were selected as process factors. Experimental values of ultimate cumulative methane yield as process response were in the range of 105.32–356.10 mL/g VS. A first-order rate model was applied to predict the process kinetics. Enhanced values of methane production rate, evaluated as rate constant (0.044–0.123 d⁻¹), were obtained for lower levels of CD mass fraction and higher levels of C/N ratio. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to assess the effects of process factors on the response and to find the optimum factor levels leading to a maximum performance. A maximum value of response variable of 347.48 mL/g VS was predicted for a CD fraction of 0.323 and a C/N ratio of 26.24. Values of experimental ultimate methane yield of 358.45 ± 33.40 mL/g VS, obtained in the BMP tests at optimum levels of process factors, were close to that of the maximum response predicted by the statistical model, demonstrating the model validity. Moreover, a significant synergistic effect (an increase in methane yield by 41.2%) related to the weighed experimental BMP of substrate mixture was obtained under optimum conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acow manure 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodel validation 3apoultry manure 3aresponse surface methodology 3astatistical models 3asugar beet 3asynergism 0aAnaerobic co-digestion 0aBiogas 0aKinetic model 0aCentral composite design 0aOptimization 0aWaste1 aPârvulescu, Oana Cristina1 aMateescu, Carmen1 aDobre, Tănase0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 July, v. 138 p.105602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1056023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245015000162300001600312520101000328592002801338650001301366650000901379650001801388650001201406650001401418650001201432650001601444650001601460650001001476653003001486653001601516653001301532653002601545700001601571773010401587856008101691852000901772655001201781IND60520022520221121064217.0210304e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052002252DNAL7 a10.1515/helmin-2016-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlawat, S.10aDescription and developmental biology of the predatory diplogastrid Acrostichus nudicapitatus (Steiner, 1914) Massey, 1962 (Nematoda: Rhabditida)  ap. 142-154.  aAcrostichus nudicapitatus (Steiner, 1914) Massey, 1962 is redescribed and illustrated along with observations on its developmental biology. Most morphometrics of the present population agree well with those of A. nudicapitatus (Steiner, 1914) Massey, 1962. The largely oviparous females of A. nudicapitatus lay eggs in single-celled or two-celled stage, 1.5 – 2 h after fertilization. In cultured females, the uterine tract was observed to accommodate occasionally as many as 4 – 6 eggs. The eggs are smooth-shelled, oval in shape measuring 45 – 48 x 23 – 26 μm in dimension. The pole of entry of sperm marks the posterior end of the developing embryo. The embryonation time has been recorded to be 20 – 25 h at 25 ± 2 °C. The first moult occurs inside the egg and the juvenile hatches as second stage juvenile. The gonad development follows the trends found in most rhabditids, however, three prime cells of the 12 vulval precursor cells have been observed to be involved in vulva formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3amolting 3amorphometry 3aspermatozoa 3avulva 0aAcrostichus nudicapitatus 0adescription 0ataxonomy 0adevelopmental biology1 aTahseen, Q.0 tHelminthologia.g2016 June 1, v. 53, no. 2 p.142-154dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helmin-2016-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245013900157300001400296500001500310520124500325592002801570650004301598650002801641650001201669650001901681650001601700650001401716650001601730650002901746650001001775650001401785650002001799650001001819650001201829650001101841650001801852653002401870653001501894653001901909653001001928653001001938700002001948700002201968700002501990700002302015700002002038773009102058856003802149852000902187655001202196IND50072463420221120140223.0140130s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007246342DNAL7 a10.1071/CP131402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadaleta, Agata10aIsolation and characterisation of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GSe) genes and association with grain protein content in durum wheat  ap. 38-45.  a2019-12-05  aGlutamine synthetase (GS) enzyme (EC 6.3.1.2) plays a central role in assimilating ammonia produced in the leaf from metabolic processes, spanning from assimilation to transamination reactions and catabolic processes. GS is located in both cytoplasm (GS1, GSe and GSr) and plastids (GS2) of plant cells. Glutamine and glutamate, produced by the concerted action of GS and glutamate synthase, are then transported from the leaf to the developing sinks or grain in wheat. The goal of the present study was to characterise GSe genes and to assess the linkage with grain protein content, an important quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. Here, we report the isolation of the complete cytosolic GS gene sequences of the durum wheat cvv. ‘Ciccio’ and ‘Svevo’ (characterised by low and high protein content, respectively). GSe-A4 located on 4A chromosome comprises 12 exons separated by 11 introns, while the GSe-B4 gene on 4B chromosome comprises 11 exons separated by 10 introns. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated different expression levels of GSe-A4 and GSe-B4 genes in the two wheat cvv. ‘Ciccio’ and ‘Svevo’. The two GSe genes were significantly associated to quantitative trait loci for grain protein content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3aammonia 3atransamination 3achromosomes 3aglutamine 3adurum wheat 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3acells 3acytoplasm 3aprotein content 3aexons 3aintrons 3aleaves 3agrain protein 0anitrogen metabolism 0asequencing 0acandidate gene 0awheat 0agenes1 aNigro, Domenica1 aMarcotuli, Ilaria1 aGiancaspro, Angelica1 aGiove, Stefania L.1 aBlanco, Antonio0 tCrop & pasture science.g2014, v. 65, no. 1 p.38-45dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP13140  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010900168300001200277520152900289592002801818650002001846650002501866650001701891650001801908650002501926650001701951650001001968650001501978650002001993650001802013650001102031650001102042650002102053650001702074650001302091650002002104650001002124650001102134651001002145653002502155653001802180653002002198653002302218653001702241700001602258700001602274700001702290700001902307700001902326700001802345700001102363773010502374856008602479852000902565655001202574IND60570286420221116211515.0190319e20171118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057028642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Da-Wei10aSelenium enrichment, fruit quality and yield of winter jujube as affected by addition of sodium selenite  ap. 1-5.  aWinter jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.) is a kind of high quality, fresh jujube fruit originated from China. Selenium (Se) affects the chemical composition and antioxidative properties in plants. At appropriate concentrations, Se acts as an antioxidant or activates mechanisms that can alleviate oxidative stress in the chloroplast, and enhances plant growth. Although the addition of Se is known to increase Se uptake in crops, it is unclear whether exogenous Se affects nutritional and functional components in winter jujube. Winter jujube trees were sprayed with selenium (as sodium selenite) at five concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, or 200mg/L of Se) three times at the fruitlet stage between July and August. The Se content, ratio of organic Se to total Se in leaves and fruits, fruit quality, and yield were measured. At Se concentrations of 50mg/L or higher, total Se content increased rapidly whereas the ratio increased initially and decreased later. Different Se concentrations affected the quality of fruits differently: at 50mg/L, compared to their values in the unsprayed control trees, vitamin C content was greater by 20.94%; soluble sugars, 29.48%; total flavonoids, 43.48%; and the sugar: acid ratio, 41.81%. Along with the increase of Se addition, average fruit weight and yield of winter jujube presented a trend of increasing up to 50mgL−1 and decreasing thereafter. Thus, the foliar spray of sodium selenite at Se concentration of 50mg/L is recommended during the fruitlet stage of Zhanhua winter jujube.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3achemical composition 3achloroplasts 3acrops 3aflavonoids 3afoliar spraying 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3atrees 3awinter 3aChina 0aZizyphus jujuba Mill 0aField orchard 0aFoliar analysis 0aFoliar application 0aMature trees1 aDu, Zhen-Yu1 aMa, Hai-Lin1 aMa, Bing-Yao1 aLiu, Fang-Chun1 aSong, Yong-Gui1 aXu, Yuan-Feng1 aLi, Li0 tScientia horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 18, v. 225 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001600283500001400299520131600313592002801629650000901657650001101666650001301677650001401690650001601704650001101720650001301731650001101744650001501755650001501770650001301785650002501798650001001823650002101833650001101854650001601865651001301881651001101894653001601905653001501921653002401936653001901960653001801979700002501997700002302022700002402045700002302069700002702092700001902119700002302138700002002161700002202181700003102203773011402234856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60715888020221122005927.0201104e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071588802DNAL7 a10.2989/20702620.2019.16866882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lima, Robson B10aImproving the forecasts of commercial timber volume in transition forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon  ap. 148-158.  aNAL-light  aThe commercial volume in tropical forests is fundamental to the implementation of sustainable forest management plans. However, in the absence of local or generic volumetric equations, most forest managers and forest services are still using traditional form factors (FF) to estimate the volume of commercial tree species in the Amazon. Our study shows the modelling to estimate the commercial volume of wood in a transition forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, volumetric models were tested using data from 181 fallen trees and measured in three plots (primary units) in Amapá, Brazil. We tested generic volumetric models and compared them with a specific model (i.e., in all plots), and with FF. Models that include shaft diameter and height have returned the most accurate volume estimates. The Schumacher-Hall generic equation allowed accurate predictions (root mean square error = 0.47 m³ and bias = 0.04). The minimum sampling design for developing volumetric models consists of measuring ∼70% of trees considering a random sampling of the entire population. The locally developed FF generated substantial bias, but presented better performance for small trees. These results can be used by forest managers as a technical tool in predicting the commercial volume of natural forests in Amapá.  aPublisher supplied data 3abias 3adesign 3adiameter 3aequations 3aexhibitions 3aheight 3amanagers 3amodels 3apopulation 3aprediction 3asampling 3asustainable forestry 3atrees 3atropical forests 3avolume 3awood volume 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aform factor 0arainforest 0aregression analysis 0arelative error 0avolume models1 aFerreira, Rinaldo LC1 ada Silva, José AA1 aGuedes, Marcelino C1 ade Abreu, Jadson C1 ade Oliveira, Cinthia P1 aLima, Robson C1 ada Silva, Diego AS1 aSantos, Renan M1 aCarvalho, Erik PF1 aSilva, Robson M de Araújo0 tSouthern forests.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 82, no. 2 p.148-158dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000154x2070-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/20702620.2019.16866883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245014200189300001400331520102200345592002801367653001801395653000801413653001501421653002301436700002401459700002201483773014901505856011501654852000901769655001201778IND60130775420221117212106.0151127e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013077542DNAL7 a10.1660/0022-8443(2007)110[30:TANDIT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpicer, Judson F.10aTesting a non-lethal DNA isolation technique for freshwater mussels that is compatible with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based studies  ap. 30-34.  aIn this study, a non-lethal DNA isolation technique was developed for freshwater mussels.

DNA was successfully isolated from 82 mussels using the non-lethal technique developed in this study. Spectrophotometer analysis of the 82 DNA samples resulted in an average DNA concentration of 488 ng/μμl. Agarose gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction products obtained using the purified mussel DNA demonstrated high quality, reproducible amplification products. All mussels remained alive for several months after tissue biopsy in the laboratory. A mark and recapture study was also performed to confirm survivability, thereby ensuring our procedure was non-lethal. Recapture efforts resulted in a 56%% live recovery of mussels from the Neosho River and a 78%% live recovery from mussels in the Verdigris River approximately four and one-half months after their release.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDNA isolation 0aPCR 0anon-lethal 0afreshwater mussels1 aSobieski, Rodney J.1 aCrupper, Scott S.0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2007 Apr., v. 110, no. 1 p.30-34dTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Sciencex0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660%2F0022-8443%282007%29110%5B30%3ATANDIT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245009100159300002000250520107300270592002801343650002401371650001201395650002101407650003401428650001401462650002201476650001301498700001601511700001101527700001901538700001301557700001801570700001701588700001801605700001901623700005301642700001601695700001701711700005501728773013701783856008001920852000902000655001202009IND60646310520190815000000.0190606e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064631052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b019232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xu10aEpitaxial Growth and Structural Properties of Bi(110) Thin Films on TiSe₂ Substrates  ap. 13637-13641.  aWe report the growth and structural properties of Bi thin films on TiSe₂ substrates by using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. Extended Bi(110) thin films are formed on the TiSe₂ substrates and adopt a distorted black-phosphorus structure at room temperature (RT). The diagonal of the Bi(110) rectangular unit cell is parallel to the close-packed direction of the top-layer Se atoms of the TiSe₂ substrates, resulting in the formation of a stripe-shaped commensurate moiré pattern with a periodicity of ∼38.5 Å at RT. Meanwhile, the charge density wave phase transition of the TiSe₂ substrate and the different coefficients of thermal expansion of Bi(110) and TiSe₂ lead to the formation of a quasi-hexagonal incommensurate moiré pattern with a periodicity of 14.5 Å at 77 K. In particular, the combination of domains with twisting angles of 30° or 60° results in the formation of various domain boundaries. Our work is very helpful for understanding and tuning the structural and electronic properties of epitaxial Bi(110) thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abismuth 3aphase transition 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aselenides 3athermal expansion 3atitanium1 aLi, Yongkai1 aLi, Ji1 aPeng, Xianglin1 aQiao, Lu1 aChen, Dongyun1 aYang, Huixia1 aXiong, Xiaolu1 aWang, Qinsheng1 aLi, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4013-02591 aDuan, Junxi1 aHan, Junfeng1 aXiao, Wende1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4786-719X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 May 10, v. 123, no. 22 p.13637-13641dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b019233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001800254500002000272500000900292520182000301592002802121650001702149650001602166650001902182650001802201650001302219650001102232650001502243650002502258650000902283650001602292650001802308650001302326650001502339650002102354650001302375650001502388650001402403650000802417650000902425650001102434650001602445650001802461700002402479700002302503773016002526856008202686852000902768655001202777IND60668758520221119172336.0220813e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066875852DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2018.03.01112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Gurbir10aCover Crops and Tillage Influence on Nitrogen Dynamics in Plant‐Soil‐Water Pools  ap. 1572-1582.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCore Ideas Cereal rye reduced the NO₃–N leaching loads during the cover crop season. Nitrate‐N leaching in corn may increase following legume cover crops. Conventional tillage may result in greater N loss compared with no‐tillage. Poor synchronization of N supply‐demand by cash crop can result in higher N losses. Cover crops (CCs) planted after cash crop harvest have the potential to improve vadose zone water quality through scavenging residual soil N. Limited research is available on N release from the biomass after CC termination and its subsequent leaching. This study examined the influence of rotations corn (Zea mays L.)–no cover crop (noCC)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]–noCC (CncSnc), corn–cereal rye (Secale cereale L.)–soybean–hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) (CcrShv), corn–cereal rye–soybean–oat+radish (Avena sativa L.+Raphanus sativus L.) (CcrSor) and tillage (conventional‐tillage [CT] and no‐tillage [NT]) on available N in soil, N accumulation in plant biomass, and N leaching to pan lysimeters. The rotations CcrShv and CcrSor with hairy vetch and oat+radish resulted in 89% (37.7 vs. 20.0 kg ha⁻¹) and 68% (33.5 vs. 20.0 kg ha⁻¹) more nitrate N (NO₃–N) leaching than CncSnc during cash crop season in fall 2015. Under CT in fall 2017, the rotation CcrShv (19.4 kg ha⁻¹) had higher NO₃–N leaching than CncSnc (3.2 kg ha⁻¹) and CcrSor (1.4 kg ha⁻¹). During CC season in spring 2016, cereal rye in CcrShv and CcrSor reduced NO₃–N leaching by 84 and 78% compared with the CncSnc, respectively, under CT. Our results indicated that CT had greater N leaching losses than NT. The higher NO₃–N leaching during cash crop season with rotations having CCs was due to the mismatched timing of N availability and demand by the cash crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aGlycine max 3aSecale cereale 3aVicia villosa 3aZea mays 3aautumn 3acash crops 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aphytomass 3arye 3asoil 3aspring 3avadose zone 3awater quality1 aWilliard, Karl W.J.1 aSchoonover, Jon E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2018 Nov., v. 82, no. 6 p.1572-1582dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.03.01113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013700168300001400305520132500319592002801644650002301672650001101695650001701706650002001723650001001743650001101753650001901764650001901783650001701802650002601819650001701845653000901862653002101871653001701892653002201909653001601931653001601947653000801963653000801971653000801979653001001987653000901997653000902006700001502015700001802030700001702048700001802065700002402083700002102107700002102128773012202149856008102271852000902352655001202361IND60591562420221120145927.0180320e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059156242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhnuma, Tomokazu10aSelective antagonization of activated Nrf2 and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by procyanidins from Cinnamomi Cortex extract  ap. 17-24.  aNuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important transcription factor and plays a central role in inducible expression of many cytoprotective genes. Recent studies have reported that various cancer cells having unrestrained Nrf2 due to its overexpression exhibit increased proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Suppression of abnormal Nrf2 activation is needed for a new therapeutic approach against these cancers. Our previous study found that procyanidins prepared from Cinnamomi Cortex extract (CCE) have an ability to suppress Nrf2-regulated enzyme activity and Nrf2 expression in human lung cancer A549 cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CCE procyanidins on Nrf2 activity and cell proliferation in several cancer cells, which have normal or constitutively active Nrf2. Interestingly, CCE procyanidin treatment selectively reduced Nrf2 expression and inhibited cell proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress Nrf2, but these phenomena were not seen in cells with low Nrf2 expression. Moreover, transfection assay demonstrated that CCE procyanidins had selective inhibition of activated Nrf2. These results suggest that CCE procyanidins might be an effective cancer therapeutic agent to selectively suppress abnormal Nrf2 activation responsible for enhanced proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3acortex 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aprocyanidins 3atranscription factors 3atransfection 0aNrf2 0aCinnamomi Cortex 0aCancer cells 0aAntiproliferation 0aProcyanidin 0aSuppression 0aARE 0aCCE 0aGST 0aKeap1 0aNQO1 0aNrf21 aAnzai, Eri1 aSuzuki, Yohei1 aShimoda, Mai1 aSaitō, Shin,1 aNishiyama, Takahito1 aOgura, Kenichiro1 aHiratsuka, Akira0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 585 p.17-24dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014500175300001500320520201500335592002802350650001402378650001702392650001702409650001002426650002702436650001902463650003302482650003002515650001402545650003202559650001802591650001102609650001202620650002702632650001202659651001102671653002702682653001702709653002002726653002502746653002302771653001302794653001102807653002002818700001702838700002102855773009702876856008502973852000903058655001203067IND60585979720221120085359.0181020e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058597972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geodrs.2017.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBölenius, Elisabeth10aWithin field cereal yield variability as affected by soil physical properties and weather variations – A case study in east central Sweden  ap. 96-103.  aYield variations within fields can be substantial and soil physical properties are important as explanatory factors. However, correlations between yield and soil physical properties change between years, mainly depending on weather conditions. This study examined yield variations within a field and the explanatory power of interactions with soil physical factors. It also examined whether soil penetration resistance measurements can indicate areas where soil physical properties are potentially yield-limiting. Field measurements and soil sampling were carried out at 20 locations spread across a 7.5ha area on a Eutric Cambisol within a 28ha field at Kvarnbo farm in Uppsala, Sweden (59°50′N, 17°32′E). Yield was monitored in 1996–2000 and 2004. Soil sampling was performed in spring 2004 for measurement of soil texture, organic matter content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and water-holding capacity at two matric tensions, 0.5kPa and 10kPa. Penetration resistance was measured on three separate occasions in 2004 and 2005, to cover any changes within and between seasons. “Simple” regression and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to test for significant differences in the data. Texture proved to be the main factor explaining the overall variation between sampling points, but penetration resistance was the most influential factor for yield variations. Yield in 2000 differed from that in other years due to excess water in lower-lying parts of the field (r=−0.70 between yield in 2000 and water-holding capacity in the subsoil, compared with r=0.6 in dry years). Since penetration resistance was correlated to several other measured soil properties it could be suitable as a screening tool to identify areas with poorer soil physical status for further investigations. Soil physical properties and their effects on yield were highly dependent on the weather. In high-yielding years, when water was not the limiting factor, soil physical status mattered less.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3abulk density 3acase studies 3afarms 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aorganic matter 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresistance to penetration 3ascreening 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil sampling 3aspring 3atexture 3awater holding capacity 3aweather 3aSweden 0aPenetration resistance 0aCereal yield 0aYield variation 0aSoil physical status 0aWater availability 0aCambisol 0aSweden 0aNorthern Europe1 aStenberg, Bo1 aArvidsson, Johan0 tGeoderma regional.g2017 Dec., v. 11 p.96-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009000170300001400260520167000274592002801944650002901972650001702001650001702018650001502035650001502050650001402065650003702079650002202116650002602138650001502164650002702179650001502206650001202221650002002233650001702253650000902270650002202279650001202301651001202313653001602325653002602341653002002367653002302387653002302410653001602433653001202449700002102461700002102482700002902503700002602532700002202558700002202580700002602602700002702628700002402655700002802679700002102707700002902728700002102757700002202778773007902800856008002879852000902959655001202968IND60563538320221118075016.0170224e20170218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056353832DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParnikoza, Ivan Yu.14aThe current state of steppe perennial plants populations: A case study on Iris pumila  ap. 24-35.  aA comprehensive study of a typical steppe perennial Iris pumila L. were carried out in the central zone of the European part of this species’ range, namely in Ukraine. Intraspecific differentiation, population size and isolation degree and its consequences, the threat of human impact were analyzed, as well as ecological amplitude and genetic variation in ISSR markers and selected chloroplast regions were determined. The species was found to have a low intraspecific differentiation that indicates the uniformity of the gene pool in the studied part of the range. Moreover, the results of isolation assessment, population and ecological study of I. pumila confirm the potential risk of extinction. A considerable part of the species populations exist as separated patches of rare ecosystems, isolated from the nearest neighbours due to intense plowing of the steppe zone. The generative reproduction is rare. In contrast, ISSR analysis revealed comparably high genetic diversity in all the sampled populations. Furthermore, specific plastid haplotypes were demonstrated in some of them. The inconsistency between the results of population ecological study and the data of molecular genetic analysis indicates that the loss of genetic diversity in the species caused by habitat fragmentation and isolation under increasing anthropogenic pressure is likely to be slower than it would appear judging from the assessment of population parameters, which clearly show negative trends. This result also emphasizes the necessity for integrated approach to assessment of the extinction risk for particular species and careful analysis of all determinants of extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3achloroplasts 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3agene pool 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aperennials 3aplowing 3apopulation size 3areproduction 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3asteppes 3aUkraine 0aIris pumila 0agenetic heterogeneity 0agenetic erosion 0apopulation biology 0arisk of extinction 0asteppe zone 0aUkraine1 aAndreev, Igor O.1 aBublyk, Olena M.1 aSpiridonova, Kateryna V.1 aGołębiewska, Joanna1 aKubiak, Magdalena1 aKuczyńska, Anna,1 aMystkowska, Katarzyna1 aOlędrzyńska, Natalia1 aUrasińska, Barbara1 aSlęzak-Parnikoza, Anna1 aGórniak, Marcin1 aWojciechowski, Krzysztof1 aDidukh, Yakiv P.1 aKunakh, Viktor A.0 tBiologia.g2017 Feb. 18, v. 72, no. 1 p.24-35dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001600172245007000188300001600258520121900274592002801493650002001521650001401541650001001555650001601565650001601581650002001597650001601617650001901633650001301652650002001665650000901685650000901694650001501703650001201718650003001730650002601760650002801786650001101814650003401825650001701859773008301876856008901959852000902048655001202057IND4466579720221120230044.0141110e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446657972DNAL7 a227482152pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuff, James10aLong-term toxicology and carcinogenicity of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol  ap. 521-525.  aCarcinogenesis bioassays were conducted by giving 2,4,6-trichlorophenol [2,4,6-TCP] in feed to groups of 50 male and female Fischer rats and male B6C3F1 mice for two years. Dietary concentrations were 0 [20/group], 5000 [0.5%], or 10,000 [1%] ppm. Female mice began with 10,000 and 20,000ppm but after 38weeks were lowered due to reduced body weights to 2500 and 5000ppm for 67weeks; exposures averaged 5200 and 10,400ppm. Adverse effects at two years were leukocytosis and monocytosis of peripheral blood and hyperplasia of bone marrow in both sexes of rats. In mice, liver toxicity, including individual liver cell abnormalities, focal areas of cellular alteration, and focal and nodular areas of hyperplasia were commonly present. Regarding carcinogenic activity, TCP caused leukemias/lymphomas in male rats, and possibly in female rats and female mice as well, and induced liver tumors in male and female mice. Using NTP categories of evidence indicates ‘clear evidence of carcinogenicity’ for male rats [hematopoietic system tumors]; ‘equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity’ for female rats [hematopoietic system tumors]; ‘clear evidence of carcinogenicity’ for male and female mice [liver tumors].  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3ablood 3abody weight 3abone marrow 3acarcinogenicity 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3aleukemia 3aliver neoplasms 3amice 3arats 3atoxicology 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aChlorophenolsxtoxicity 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxchemically induced 2aTime Factors0 tChemosphere.g2012 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.521-525dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001400282520128800296592002801584650001701612650001001629650001701639650000901656650001501665650001401680650001101694650002201705650001501727650001401742653000901756653001301765653001801778653001801796653002201814653001401836700002201850773012201872856008101994852000902075655001202084IND60591562620221120145827.0180320e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059156262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPichert, Annelie10aInteraction of the chlorite-based drug WF10 and chlorite with hemoglobin, methemoglobin and ferryl hemoglobin  ap. 82-89.  aThe interaction of the chlorite-based drug solution WF10 with human oxyhemoglobin and oxidized hemoglobin forms was investigated monitoring the corresponding spectral changes in heme states. The chlorite component of WF10 converts oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin with a rate of 35.4 M⁻¹s⁻¹. Methemoglobin is also formed upon the interaction of ferryl hemoglobin and WF10/chlorite. The rate of this interconversion depends on the oxidation state of ferryl hemoglobin. This rate is 114 M⁻¹s⁻¹, when ferryl hemoglobin was generated upon reaction of oxyhemoglobin and hydrogen peroxide. A considerable higher rate (6600 M⁻¹s⁻¹) is measured between the chlorite components of WF10 and ferryl hemoglobin after formation of the latter species from methemoglobin. WF10/chlorite inactivates also methemoglobin as evidenced by the continuous decrease of the Soret band and all other absorbances with a rate of 8.3 M⁻¹s⁻¹. In all interconversions, the chlorite component of WF10 was the active principle as shown in experiments applying pure chlorite at the same concentration as in WF10. Thus, WF10 is able to diminish efficiently the yield of cytotoxic hemoglobin species that might appear after excessive hemolysis of red blood cells under pathologic situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aerythrocytes 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 0aWF10 0aChlorite 0aOxyhemoglobin 0aMethemoglobin 0aFerryl hemoglobin 0aHemolysis1 aArnhold, Jürgen,0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 585 p.82-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245020500163300001600368520100500384592002801389653001801417653002401435653001701459653002001476653001501496653002201511653001801533653002101551653002001572653001501592700002001607773011501627856007601742852000901818655001201827IND60520146620221119233600.0160514e20061212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052014662DNAL7 a10.1515/JLM.2006.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Heike10aTandem-Massenspektrometrie in der therapeutischen Arzneimittelspiegel-Bestimmung: Praxis und Tücken der Anwendung / Tandem mass spectrometry in drug monitoring: experience and pitfalls in application  ap. 428-437.  aMass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) coupled to HPLC has been one of the most expanding technologies in clinical chemistry and drug monitoring in the last years. The reason is its increasingly user-friendly operation and high sensitivity and specificity. However, so far no manufacturer has offered integrated and validated diagnostic systems to analyze defined parameters. The user is forced to develop and validate a method for each desired parameter. A major challenge in using LC/MS/MS is to manage the validation process and quality assurance in daily practice. Some basic pitfalls and drawbacks associated with LC/MS/MS in quantification mode have already been described in literature. However, especially the non-experienced user is challenged by additional problems that can be avoided or solved with some additional practical tips. Main aspects of method development and quality assurance in the daily use of LC/MS/MS systems are discussed in context with examples from the literature in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFehlerquellen 0aMassenspektrometrie 0aMatrixeffekt 0aRoutineanalytik 0aValidation 0amass spectrometry 0amatrix effect 0aroutine analysis 0asource of error 0avalidation1 aSteimer, Werner0 tLaboratoriumsMedizin.g2006 Dec. 12, v. 30, no. 6 p.428-437dWalter de GruyterwJournal:23156x0025-84667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/JLM.2006.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300001800297520159600315592002801911650001201939650001601951650001101967650002001978650000901998650001302007650001002020650001202030650002202042650001202064700001902076700001902095700001702114700001802131700002002149700002002169773012002189856008202309990002302391852000902414655001202423IND60087111620221119221705.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008711162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orcp.2011.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Ji-Young10aNew diagnostic criteria for obesity and overweight in Korean children and adolescents using 2007 Korean National Growth Charts  ap. e182-e189.  aThe diagnostic criteria (KCDC Criteria) to define obesity and overweight of Korean children and adolescents were newly presented in the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts. The KCDC Criteria were criticized for several problems caused by upward shift of body mass index (BMI) percentile curves of the growth charts. This study was conducted to establish new diagnostic criteria (New Criteria) for obesity and overweight in Korean children and adolescents that would be less affected by a change of BMI distribution in the reference population of the Growth Charts. The BMI values for ages 2–18 years corresponding to Asia-Pacific adult BMI cutoffs of obesity (25.0kg/m²) and overweight (23.0kg/m²) were calculated with L, M and S values presented in the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts. Additionally, we examined the frequencies of obesity and overweight among children and adolescents who participated in the 2005 National Growth Survey based on both New Criteria and KCDC Criteria. The Z-scores corresponding to BMIs of 25 and 23kg/m² at 18-years-of-age were 0.99 and 0.41 in boys, and 1.34 and 0.71 in girls, respectively. The BMI values corresponding to these Z-scores from age 2 to 18 years were determined as new BMI cutoffs for obesity and overweight. The frequencies of obesity and overweight estimated by New Criteria were greater by 2 times in boys and 1.5 times in girls than those by KCDC Criteria. We suggest that New Criteria could be a good alternative that can resolve problems caused by upward shift of BMI percentile curves of the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKoreans 3aadolescents 3aadults 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildren 3agirls 3aobesity 3apopulation growth 3asurveys1 aCho, Young-Gyu1 aKang, Jae-Heon1 aHur, Yang-Im1 aPark, Hyun-Ah1 aKim, Kyoung-Woo1 aKwon, Su-Kyoung0 tObesity research & clinical practice.g2013 , v. 7, no. 3 p.e182-e189dElsevier LtdwJournal:12129x1871-403X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004100135040001800176100002100194245010400215300001600319506007600335520153400411592002801945506003701973650000802010650000802018650001402026650001302040650000902053650002202062650002302084650001002107650003302117650001902150650001502169650001702184650001302201651000902214653001402223653001402237653001702251653001802268653001502286700001602301700001902317700002002336700002002356700002202376700002302398700002102421700001902442773013802461856008802599852000902687655001202696IND60581989720221207061641.0201111e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058198972DNAL7 a288031982pmid7 aPMC67289132pmcid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.2742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoombs, Kanistha10aVariability of indoor fungal microbiome of green and non-green low-income homes in Cincinnati, Ohio  ap. 212-218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a“Green” housing is designed to use low-impact materials, increase energy efficiency and improve occupant health. However, little is known about the indoor mycobiome of green homes. The current study is a subset of a multicenter study that aims to investigate the indoor environment of green homes and the respiratory health of asthmatic children. In the current study, the mycobiome in air, bed dust and floor dust was compared between green (study site) and non-green (control site), low-income homes in Cincinnati, Ohio. The samples were collected at baseline (within four months following renovation), and 12months after the baseline at the study site. Parallel sample collection was conducted in non-green control homes. Air samples were collected by PM2.5 samplers over 5-days. Bed and floor dust samples were vacuumed after the air sampling was completed. The DNA sample extracts were analyzed using ITS amplicon sequencing. Analysis indicated that there was no clear trend in the fungal communities between green and non-green homes. Instead, fungal community differences were greatest between sample types - air, bed, and floor. Microbial communities also changed substantially between sampling intervals in both green and non-green homes for all sample types, potentially indicating that there was very little stability in the mycobiomes. Research gaps remain regarding how indoor mycobiome fluctuates over time. Longer follow-up periods might elucidate the effect of green renovation on microbial load in buildings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aair 3abuildings 3achildren 3adust 3aenergy efficiency 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiome 3aparticulates 3asamplers 3aOhio 0aMycobiome 0aOccupancy 0aAir sampling 0aDust sampling 0aSequencing1 aTaft, Diana1 aWard, Doyle V.1 aGreen, Brett J.1 aChew, Ginger L.1 aShamsaei, Behrouz1 aMeller, Jarosław,1 aIndugula, Reshmi1 aReponen, Tiina0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 610-611 p.212-218dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.2743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010900170300001600279520123000295592002801525650001101553650001701564650001901581650001101600650002501611650001701636650002001653650000901673650001401682650001301696651001201709653002501721653001901746653002601765653001901791653002501810653002401835653002501859700006801884700006001952700002302012700001902035700002302054700001602077773011802093856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60633835620221119131058.0190321e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063383562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.03.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDvorak, Ana C.10aPossible impacts of sea level rise on disease transmission and potential adaptation strategies, a review  ap. 951-968.  aSea levels are projected to rise in response to climate change, causing the intrusion of sea water into land. In flat coastal regions, this would generate an increase in shallow water covered areas with limited circulation. This scenario raises a concern about the consequences it could have on human health, specifically the possible impacts on disease transmission. In this review paper we identified three categories of diseases which are associated with water and whose transmission can be affected by sea level rise. These categories include: mosquitoborne diseases, naturalized organisms (Vibrio spp. and toxic algae), and fecal-oral diseases. For each disease category, we propose comprehensive adaptation strategies that would help minimize possible health risks. Finally, the City of Key West, Florida is analyzed as a case study, due to its inherent vulnerability to sea level rise. Current and projected adaptation techniques are discussed as well as the integration of additional recommendations, focused on disease transmission control. Given that sea level rise will likely continue into the future, the promotion and implementation of positive adaptation strategies is necessary to ensure community resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adisease transmission 3ahuman health 3apoisonous algae 3arisk 3asea level 3aseawater 3aFlorida 0aDisease transmission 0aSea level rise 0aMosquitoborne disease 0aClimate change 0aNaturalized microbes 0aFecal-oral microbes 0aCommunity resilience1 aSolo-Gabriele, Helena M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3390-38231 aGalletti, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6976-49631 aBenzecry, Bernardo1 aMalone, Hannah1 aBoguszewski, Vicki1 aBird, Jason0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 July 01, v. 217 p.951-968dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.03.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011100169300001500280500001500295520202000310592002802330650001402358650002802372650001802400650001802418650001902436650002002455650001002475650001602485650002202501650001202523650002502535650001302560650000902573650001002582650000902592650002002601650002702621650001502648650001802663650001902681653002002700653002602720653002302746653001702769700001902786700002002805700002502825700002402850700001802874700002102892700002202913700001802935773008002953856008003033852000903113655001203122IND60563538520221118075008.0170224e20170218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056353852DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapcarova, Marcela10aEffectiveness of non-antibiotic stimulators in Japanese quail diet: Gender comparison and economical annex  ap. 96-104.  a2019-12-06  aEconomical as well as medicinal and nutritional benefits of Japanese quails are important. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary inclusion of probiotics and humic acids on some antioxidant, carcass and egg production parameters of Japanese quails. As Japanese quails are an interesting animal model attracting attention in the last years, a partial aim of this study is also a brief economical annex to the topic. A total of 60 birds (30 males and 30 females, age of 35 days) were involved in the experiment. Animals were fed by standard basal diet and divided to 6 experimental groups as follows: two groups (10 females and 10 males) received addition of probiotics preparation in a single dose of 1 g kg⁻¹ of feed mixture, two groups (10 females and 10 males) received a preparation of humic acids in a single dose of 3 g kg⁻¹ of feed mixture. The groups (10 females and 10 males) fed on basal diet without any additive served as the control group. After 210 days the animals were euthanized and blood samples, carcass organs and abdominal fat were collected. Antioxidant/oxidant parameters (activity of superoxide dismutase SOD, glutathione peroxidase GPx, total antioxidant status TAS, content of bilirubin and reactive oxygen species ROS) from blood samples were measured. The production of eggs was recorded during the experiment. Probiotic and humic acids treatments resulted in significant increase of TAS in females in contrast to males. Content of bilirubin was significantly lower in females fed with addition of humic acids in comparison to the male group. In both treatments (probiotics and humic acids) significantly lower amount of abdominal fat in females in comparison to the controls were recorded. The other investigated parameters of Japanese quails were not influenced by the treatments. The effect of probiotics and humic acids is probably dose dependent and the assessment of an accurate dose of substantives used in poultry feeding plays a crucial role.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3areactive oxygen species 3aabdominal fat 3adose response 3ablood sampling 3apoultry feeding 3amales 3ahumic acids 3aCoturnix japonica 3afemales 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aoxidants 3aeggs 3abirds 3adiet 3anutritive value 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aprobiotics 3aanimal models 3aegg production 0aJapanese quails 0aeconomical evaluation 0acarcass parameters 0aantioxidants1 aKalafova, Anna1 aLajdova, Zuzana1 aSchwarzova, Marianna1 aZbynovska, Katarina1 aHrncar, Cyril1 aHanusova, Emilia1 aBrunaiova, Zuzana1 aBielik, Peter0 tBiologia.g2017 Feb. 18, v. 72, no. 1 p.96-104dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010700172300001800279520164800297592002801945650002001973650001301993650002002006650002502026650001202051650002202063650002102085650001402106650001002120650001202130650001602142650000902158650002102167700002402188700001802212773012002230856008202350990002302432852000902455655001202464IND60087111720221119222225.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008711172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orcp.2011.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohan, K.B. Kishore10aAnthropometry: A new approach to identify communal body fat status in an urban south Indian population  ap. e190-e197.  aBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deep penetration of obesity into geographical and ethnic communities based on profession is being highly evidenced by researchers. Impact of this penetration in the Indian urban population is addressed by the accepted factors of professional and cultural changes. High risk of Atherosclerosis, hyperinsulinaemia, impaired glucose tolerance; prothrombotic is not addressed by the relationship between BMI vs. body fat, while body fat plays major role in all risks. The present study attempts to prove an anthropometrical empirical formula which can be an indicator of body fat in a group, based on profession or life style. METHODS: A total number of 159 (77 males of age 36.95±14.795, 82 females of age 38.07±13.16) subjects participated in the study. Body composition analysis and anthropometric measurements were performed after conducting careful clinical examination. Body fat was measured using body composition analyzer and used as a reference to justify indication of anthropometrical empirical indicator (AEI). Indicative accuracy of AEI was cross verified by male and female analysis individually. RESULTS: Community specific mean body fat 23.15±8.47 (kg) for the mean weight of 66.05±13.46 (kg) indicated prevalence of excess 35% body fat. This much of body fat has not been addressed by mean BMI 25.56±4.66 (kg/m²). CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATION: Statistical relation between AEI and body fat reflects original information of risk (where as BMI does not) in the selected community. AEI outperforms the identification of obesity affected profession or life style based communities over BMI analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3aclinical examination 3afemales 3aglucose tolerance 3ahyperinsulinemia 3alifestyle 3amales 3aobesity 3aoccupations 3arisk 3aurban population1 aSapthagirivasan, V.1 aAnburajan, M.0 tObesity research & clinical practice.g2013 , v. 7, no. 3 p.e190-e197dElsevier LtdwJournal:12129x1871-403X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orcp.2011.11.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010000165300002000265520118800285592002801473650002201501650001301523650001201536650002001548650001301568650002401581650001301605650001901618650001101637650001901648650001501667650003701682700002301719700002001742700001901762700005801781700005901839700006101898773013701959856008002096852000902176655001202185IND60646311020221122232449.0190606e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064631102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b020812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Pei-Lun10aShape-Tunable SrTiO₃ Crystals Revealing Facet-Dependent Optical and Photocatalytic Properties  ap. 13664-13671.  aSrTiO₃ cubes with tunable sizes of 160–290 nm have been synthesized by mixing TiCl₄, SrCl₂, and LiOH in pure ethanol or a water/ethanol mixed solution at just 70 °C for 3 h. Replacing water/ethanol with water/hexanol and water/ethylene glycol, and fine tuning the amounts of other reagents, resulted in the formation of edge-truncated cubes and {100}-truncated rhombic dodecahedra, respectively. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterization, supported by Rietveld refinement analysis, have revealed shape-dependent tuning in lattice parameters. The cubes display slight size-related optical band shifts, and they show clearly more blue-shifted light absorption than the other particles exposing significant {110} faces. The {100}-truncated rhombic dodecahedra are far more efficient than cubes at photodegradation of methylene blue and photocatalyzed hydrogen evolution from water in the presence of methanol.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that ethnic difference in fat storage capacity contributes to this ethnic difference in liver fat. DESIGN: To examine this, we assessed liver fat among 244 Japanese-American aged 40–49, using regional computed-tomography images, along with metabolic variables. RESULTS: Despite the similar BMI between Japanese-Americans and NHW men, Japanese-Americans had more liver fat (liver to spleen attenuation ratio: 1.03±0.22 for Japanese-Americans, and 1.07±0.15 for NHW men; p<0.05) and tended to have a greater disposition for fatty liver with an increase in BMI than NHW, indicating a clear difference between the two groups. In addition, liver fat is less in Japanese-Americans compared with Japanese men (1.03±0.22 vs. 1.01±0.16; p<0.05), despite of a much higher BMI. These ethnic differences support the hypothesis that higher fat storage capacity indeed seems to be associated with less liver fat. In all the groups, liver fat content strongly correlated with triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Nevertheless, these metabolic variables were worse in Japanese-Americans, despite of less liver fat, compared with Japanese. Moreover, CRP levels were least among Japanese with highest liver fat, and highest among NHW men with least liver fat, despite of a strong positive association between CRP and fatty liver within each population. CONCLUSIONS: Fat content in the liver is intermediate for Japanese-Americans compared with Japanese and NHW men, which supports the hypothesis of less fat storage capacity among Japanese, closely linked to ethnic difference in predisposition to fatty liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aJapanese people 3aWhites 3abody mass index 3acomputed tomography 3aethnic differences 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3alipid content 3aliver 3amen 3aspleen 3atriacylglycerols 3aHawaii 3aJapan1 aCurb, J.

However, recent biochemical investigations revealed that this molecule actually comprises two SBDs. This necessitates new equations (Calc2) for FT and BAT calculation. Methods and results: Calc2 was deduced using the recently published SHBG-testosterone association constant and was compared to other FT and/or BAT determination methods (e.g., a conventional calculation version [CalcV], ammonium sulfate precipitation [for measuring BAT] relying on total testosterone [TT] by mass spectrometry, and a FT radioimmunoassay [RIA] proving satisfactory). In contrast to CalcV BAT, Calc2 BAT fitted ammonium sulfate precipitation BAT. An analogous result was found by means of a comparison of FT ratios determined by RIA, Calc2, and CalcV, respectively. Additionally, Calc2 data mostly appear to meet literature data (measured by methods such as equilibrium dialysis) better than CalcV data do. Conclusions: There is evidence that Calc2 affords reliable FT and BAT derivation from assayed TT, SHBG, and albumin making direct FT and BAT measurements unnecessary in most cases. Finally, Calc2 was formatted as a preliminary nomogram for convenient clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 0aandrogen disorders 0a“bioavailable” testosterone 0afree testosterone 0anomogram 0asex hormone binding globulin 0atestosterone 0aAndrogenstörungen 0a„bioverfügbares” Testosteron 0afreies Testosteron 0aNomogramm 0asexhormonbindendes Globulin 0aTestosteron1 aHerklotz, Roberto1 aLuppa, Peter B.1 aDiver, Michael J.1 aThevis, Mario1 aMetzger, Jochen1 aSavoca, Reto1 aJermini, Fernando1 aHuber, Andreas R.0 tLaboratoriumsMedizin.g2006 Dec. 12, v. 30, no. 6 p.492-505dWalter de Gruyterx0025-84667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/JLM.2006.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001400286520107700300592002801377650001301405650001901418650002701437650002101464650002301485650002201508650001801530650001601548650002201564650001901586650002201605650002501627650000901652650001101661650002801672650002001700650001801720650001201738653002801750653001401778653002001792653002101812653001901833653001701852700002101869700002501890773010201915856008302017852000902100655001202109IND60616810520221122222544.0200607e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mran.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessens, Winy10aUse of predictive modelling in recent work of the Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority  ap. 37-43.  aThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides independent scientific advice to the EU risk managers in relation to legislation and policies in all fields which have a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety. The EFSA Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ Panel) provides independent scientific advice on biological hazards in relation to food safety and food-borne diseases. This paper aims to give an overview of the recent EFSA BIOHAZ Panel activities that used predictive microbiology. In four scientific outputs (three opinions and one report), bacterial growth during storage of meat and pre-packed fishery products was predicted using available predictive microbiology models and software. In another scientific opinion, a predictive model for thermal destruction of viruses was developed and further used to evaluate heat treatments that could be applied to live bivalve molluscs to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. It is concluded that predictive microbiology has great value in risk assessment and in risk-based food safety management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aEuropean Union 3aattitudes and opinions 3abacterial growth 3abiological hazards 3acomputer software 3afish products 3afood safety 3afoodborne illness 3aheat treatment 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3ameat 3amodels 3apredictive microbiology 3arisk assessment 3arisk managers 3aviruses 0aPredictive microbiology 0aPathogens 0aRisk assessment 0aBivalve molluscs 0aMeat transport 0aFish storage1 aHempen, Michaela1 aKoutsoumanis, Kostas0 tMicrobial risk analysis.g2018 Dec., v. 10 p.37-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23482x2352-35227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014600166300001800312520154300330592002801873650004401901650001301945650001101958650001701969650001701986650003802003650003302041650001302074650003402087650001402121700002102135700002102156700001702177700002402194773008402218856008502302990002302387852000902410655001202419IND60105793820221120051917.0141108e20130708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010579382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Amy10aBisphenol E cyanate ester as a novel resin for repairing BMI/carbon fiber composites: Influence of cure temperature on adhesive bond strength  ap. 3994-4002.  aThe increasing use of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) in structural applications created demand for advanced repair techniques to fix internal delaminations in PMCs. One of a variety of repair techniques is injection repair, which involves injecting a low viscosity resin directly into the damaged area and subsequently curing the resin to heal the damage. In this study, bisphenol E cyanate ester (BECy) was investigated as a potential resin for injection repair of bismaleimide-carbon fiber based composite panels for aircraft. Temperature sensitive repair applications required a technique that avoided the high temperature post-cure of the injection repair resin. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) experiments were used to examine the degree of cross-linking and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of under-cured injection repair resin. The chemistry of cross-linking in under-cured BECy was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Lap shear tests of the under-cured injection repair resin on composite substrates revealed the influence of change in isothermal under-cure temperature on the bond strength. Temperature dependent dynamic mechanical analysis disclosed the significance of sub-Tg relaxations on the adhesive properties of the under-cured resin. Post-fracture surface analysis of the lap shear specimens, performed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs, indicated a mixed mode of fracture in the form of a combination of resin and resin–composite interface failure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaircraft 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3adelamination 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass transition temperature 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aviscosity1 aThunga, Mahendra1 aObusek, Kristine1 aAkinc, Mufit1 aKessler, Michael R.0 tPolymer.g2013 July 8, v. 54, no. 15 p.3994-4002dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.05.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245007300167300001600240500002400256500001500280520104200295650001801337650001701355650001101372650001401383650002001397650001401417650002201431650001401453650002801467650002101495650001601516650002501532650002501557651000901582653001901591700002601610700002001636773010101656852000901757856011201766930003301878945002501911946001101936961001301947655001201960IND4409508720221118055815.0080828e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440950872DNAL7 a10113/191572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aJaradat, A.A.10aBiomass production potential in the Batini barley landrace from Oman  ap. 249-253.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aDiversity available in seven subpopulations of the Batini barley landrace was quantified for pre- and post-anthesis thermal time, filling period, biological and grain yield, number of tillers and plant height. We identified grain, forage and dual-purpose types and selected elite germplasm for breeding purposes. Patterns of phenotypic variation and co-variation in the phenological and agronomic traits, measured on 2,040 landrace accessions, subdivided the collection into 14 phenological classes in three (grain, dual-purpose and forage) end-use types, each with distinct phenological trait combinations. The dual-purpose type was more polymorphic and had significantly higher total diversity and differentiation than the grain and forage types. Directional selection, especially in the phenological traits, resulted in large, idiosyncratic changes in plant phenotypes. Targeting traits that have a disproportionately large influence on differences in the mean covariance will help identify sources of variation for breeding purposes. 3aplanting date 3aplant growth 3abarley 3alandraces 3aHordeum vulgare 3aphenology 3agenetic variation 3aheat sums 3adry matter accumulation 3aagronomic traits 3agrain yield 3aphenotypic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aOman 0aplant breeding1 aMoshtaghzadeh, Majid.1 aAl-Maskri, A.Y.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2005 Apr., v.  3, no.  2 p.249-253x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/191573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/09/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03108naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072001700158072001700175100001600192245012100208300001400329500002400343520132200367650003001689650001801719650001901737650002701756650001901783650002801802650001801830650003301848650001801881650002201899650002001921650001101941650001601952650001601968650002301984650001602007651001102023653003002034653003002064653003102094700002002125700001402145773008902159852000902248856007802257856011102335930003302446945002502479946001302504961001302517655001202530IND4378600520221119080350.0060308e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437860052DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-00162doi7 a10113/13072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKeith, L.M.10aIdentification and characterization of Pestalotiopsis spp. causing scab disease of guava, Psidium guajava, in Hawaii  ap. 16-23.  aIncludes references  aGuava is one of the most widely grown plants in the tropics; however, it is affected by many fruit rot diseases. Fruit diseases decrease the marketability of fresh fruit and fruit for processing. A survey of scab disease was conducted at the USDA/ARS Tropical Plant Genetic Resource Management Unit in Hilo, HI, where more than 50 accessions of guava are grown. Symptoms observed were gray/light brown lesions surrounded by dark brown borders on leaves and brown, raised, corky, necrotic lesions on the exocarp of fruit which progressed as the fruits matured. Seventeen isolates from infected fruit, six isolates from lesions on leaves, and nine isolates from additional crops surrounding the guava trees were collected. The main fungi consistently isolated from symptomatic leaves and fruit were Pestalotiopsis spp. Morphology, colony characteristics, and pathogenicity of the isolates were examined and potential sources of host resistance were identified for germplasm characterization studies. Molecular methods were used to identify four Pestalotiopsis taxa (P. clavispora, P. microspora, P. sp. GJ-1, and P. disseminata) on guava in Hawaii. To our knowledge, this is the first report of traditional and molecular methods of identification and characterization being used for fungal pathogens of guava in Hawaii. 3afungal diseases of plants 3ascab diseases 3aPestalotiopsis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal anatomy 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aPsidium guajava 3aguavas 3afruit trees 3ahost plants 3adisease resistance 3atemperature 3aHawaii 0aPestalotiopsis clavispora 0aPestalotiopsis microspora 0aPestalotiopsis disseminata1 aVelasquez, M.E.1 aZee, F.T.0 tPlant disease.g2006 Jan., v.  90, no.  1 p.16-23wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-00163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/13073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03686naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100002000184245008100204300001500285500015100300500002400451520208800475650002702563650002302590650002102613650002402634650002602658650002502684650002002709650003002729650001002759650001902769651001802788653002102806773010102827852000902928856011202937856008503049930003303134945002503167946001103192961001303203655001203216IND4413496220221122050102.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441349622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9322-22doi7 a10113/220842hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF8311 aRossman, Amy Y.14aThe impact of invasive fungi on agricultural ecosystems in the United States  ap. 97-107.  aIn the special issue: Ecological impacts of non-native invertebrates and fungi on terrestrial ecosystems / edited by Jon Sweeney and David Langor.  aIncludes references  aInvasive fungi and other non-indigenous plant pathogens have had a significant effect on American agriculture for hundreds of years. At present crop loss due to invasive plant pathogens, especially fungi, is estimated at $21 billion per year in the United States, greater than the loss caused by non-indigenous insects. Plant pathogenic fungi are difficult to detect and identify. Thus knowledge of which fungi pose a threat is essential to prevent their entry by means others than inspection. In this paper, examples are presented of invasive fungi on agricultural commodities introduced into the United States. In all cases two factors have been crucial: first, the pathway through which these fungi have entered, and second, systematic knowledge to prevent and respond to the new invasive species. Historically important plant pathogens such as black stem rust of wheat still cause considerable damage while others such as late blight of potato appear to be having a resurgence. Known previously in Australia, then moving to Africa and South America, the virulent species of soybean rust appeared in the U.S. in 2004 but has not been as devastating as anticipated. Plant pathogenic fungi on specialty crops such as daylily, gladiola and chrysanthemum are threatened by rust fungi recently found in the U.S. apparently brought in on infected germplasm. A crisis in the export of U.S. wheat occurred in the late 1990's when the molecular diagnostic test for Karnal bunt gave a false positive response to a closely related but previously unknown species. Many potentially dangerous plant pathogens of crop plants have not yet been introduced into the U.S. It is critical that meticulous surveillance be conducted as plant material enters the country as well as where crops are grown prior to shipment. In addition, the scientific infrastructure is needed to be able to respond quickly to new invasive fungi. This requires sound systematic knowledge of plant pathogenic fungi both in the U.S. and around the world and a cadre of systematic experts who can characterize invasive fungi. 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aagricultural products 3aenvironmental impact 3aeconomic impact 3afungal diseases of plants 3acrops 3aagroecosystems 3aUnited States 0ainvasion pathway0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Jan., v.  11, no.  1 p.97-107dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/220843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9322-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20081219b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/12/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02286naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003000115024002100145040001800166072000900184100001700193245012000210300001600330500002500346520078500371650000901156650002801165650001101193650001901204650000901223650000901232650002301241650001201264650000901276650003401285650002401319650001101343650000901354650000901363650000901372653000901381653001101390700001701401773009001418852000901508856008001517856011201597930003301709946001301742961001301755655001201768991616386540742620221122011014.0870925e198704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870642872DNAL7 a35846372pmid7 a10.1093/jee/80.2.4272doi7 a10113/220882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aTaylor, D.B.10aComparison of gelled and meat diets for rearing screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Diptera: Calliphoridae), larvae  ap. 427-432.  aIncludes references.  aA liquid diet solidified with an acrylamide-acrylate polymer gelling agent (Water-Lock) was compared with a standard meat diet for rearing larvae of Cochliomyia hominivorax. The size and yield of larvae reared on the gel diet were equal to, or greater than, those of larvae reared on the meat diet. The duration of larval development was increased by about 13 h on the gel diet; however, variability of pupal weight and larval survival over generations were reduced when gel was used. Larval size was also more uniform over the 3-day period when larvae leave the rearing medium to pupate (crawl-off). The gelled diet was more uniform over time than the meat diet. In addition, the gelled diet was easier to use, less objectionable to workers and less expensive than the meat diet. 3adiet 3aCochliomyia hominivorax 3alarvae 3aanimal feeding 3agels 3ameat 3alaboratory rearing 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDipteraxgrowth & development 2aEntomologyxmethods 2aFemale 2aGels 2aMale 2aMeat 0asize 0agrowth1 aMangan, R.L.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1987 Apr., v.  80, no.  2 p.427-432x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/80.2.4273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/220883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081222b20090206c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02998naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092024002000116040001800136100001800154245014800172300001600320500014300336500004800479500002400527520136100551650003001912650002101942650002301963650003001986650001302016650002402029650002702053650002202080650002602102650000902128653002402137653003402161773008102195852000902276856011102285856007402396930003302470945001302503946001102516961001302527655001202540IND2332977520221116213830.0030609e200306  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233297752DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.7082doi7 a10113/76732hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, S.L.F.10aUnited States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service research programs on microbes for management of plant-parasitic nematodes  ap. 665-670.  aIn the special issue: Pest management research in the USDA Agricultural Research Service / edited by D.

Consequently, nematode-antagonistic microbes, and active compounds produced by such organisms, are being explored as potential additions to management practices. Programs in this area at the USDA Agricultural Research Service investigate applied biocontrol agents, naturally occurring beneficial soil microbes and natural compounds. Specific research topics include use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and cultural practices for management of root-knot and ring nematodes, determination of management strategies that enhance activity of naturally occurring Pasteuria species (bacterial obligate parasites of nematodes), studies on interactions between biocontrol bacteria and bacterial-feeding nematodes, and screening of microbes for compounds active against plant-parasitic nematodes. Some studies involve biocontrol agents that are active against nematodes and soil-borne plant-pathogenic fungi, or combinations of beneficial bacteria and fungi, to manage a spectrum of plant diseases or to increase efficacy over a broader range of environmental conditions. Effective methods or agents identified in the research programs are investigated as additions to existing management systems for plant-parasitic nematodes. 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3anematode control 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abacteria 3anematophagous fungi 3anematicidal properties 3aresearch projects 3aagricultural research 3aUSDA 0agovernment research 0anatural nematicidal compounds0 tPest management science.g2003 , v.  59, no.  6/7 p.665-670x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76733Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.7083Available from publisher's Web site  a20071207b20080102c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02046naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201100001600210245006300226300001600289500002400305500001500329520048100344650001700825650002300842650001900865650003200884650002900916650003100945650006000976650003201036650003301068653001901101653002301120700001901143700001601162773009101178852000901269856009201278856011201370930003301482945001301515946001101528961001301539655001201552IND2204589520221121170036.0000516e199911  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220458952DNAL7 a106649672pmid7 a10.1046/j.1472-765X.1999.00635.x2doi7 a10113/220482hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ204 0aQ2051 aHua, S.S.T.10aInhibition of aflatoxin biosynthesis by phenolic compounds  ap. 289-291.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe phenolic compounds acetosyringone, syringaldehyde and sinapinic acid inhibited the biosynthesis of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by A. flavus.

The chemicals evaluated included Actellic, Apron, Captan, Cruiser, Gaucho, Maxim, Poncho, Thiram, and Vitavax in 11 seed-treatment combinations. In one experiment, seed-treatment chemicals were evaluated quantitatively in a critical region of ELISA absorbance values near 0.5 using maize seed that were spiked with uniform quantities of a liquid suspension of E. stewartii. The number of bacteria in each sample was estimated from ELISA absorbance values using standard curves. Log CFU of E. stewartii per sample were not significantly different among the untreated control and the 11 seed treatments compared with Tukey's Studentized Range Test (P = 0.05). Means of log CFU/ml for all treatments were tightly clustered around 5.70 which corresponded to an absorbance value of 0.440 and a bacterial population of about 500,000 CFU/ml. In a second set of experiments, seed treatment chemicals were evaluated based on qualitative decisions that resulted from the ELISA-based seed health test of seed lots of Jubilee and A632 infected with E. stewartii. The number of negative samples was not substantially greater than expected based on binomial probabilities except for samples of Captan/Vitavax-treated A632, which we considered to be a type I error. The mean absorbance values of positive samples ranged from 1.42 to 1.72 for A632 and from 1.51 to 1.91 for Jubilee and did not differ significantly among the seed treatments. There was no consistent evidence from these experiments that fungicide or insecticide seed treatments interfered with the sensitivity of the ELISA or altered low (e.g., 0.5) or high (e.g. 1.4 to 1.9) absorbance values. The ability of the ELISA-based seed health test to detect E. stewartii in maize seed was not affected by these seed treatments. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aseed-borne bacteria 3aPantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aseeds 3aserodiagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aseed dressings 3afungicides 3ainsecticides1 aBlock, C.C.1 aMichener, P.M.1 aShepherd, L.M.1 aMcGee, D.C.1 aWhite, D.G.0 tPlant disease.g2004 June, v.  88, no.  6 p.633-640x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.6.6333Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/84473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071220b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02189naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001700148245007000165300001600235500002400251520093900275650002301214650001101237650002001248650001601268650002601284650002101310651001501331653002601346653002601372653002301398700001801421700001701439773009501456852000901551856011101560930003301671945002501704946001301729961001301742655001201755IND4384777320221123001426.0061027e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438477732DNAL7 a10113/19132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aF1201 aAmonov, M.O.10aMachine Innovation for Inter Row Cotton Cultivation in Uzbekistan  ap. 665-674.  aIncludes references  aUzbekistan is a leading country in cotton production and export. Inter-row cultivation is an important production operation that assists in soil loosening, weeding, fertilizing, and ridge forming between rows. However, the operation is problematic because of risks of damaging the plants during critical growth phases. The article examines a new design for precision cultivator guidance for inter-row tillage and presents the results of field trials of the new design. The proposed cultivator utilizes light torsion pivots with gauging beams and guiding slits to allow a reduction of the protected zone surrounding the plant by 2 to 2.5 cm and improves the soil surface condition (soil crumbling ability). Herbicide use and hand labor can be significantly reduced, which should lead to an increase in profit. This cultivator also allowed for an increase in operating speed by 14%, which would increase the efficiency of the operation. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3acrop production 3acultivators 3aequipment performance 3aequipment design 3aUzbekistan 0ainter row cultivation 0aprecision cultivators 0aprecision guidance1 aPulatov, A.S.1 aColvin, T.S.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2006 Sept., v.  22, no.  5 p.665-674x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/19133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070802b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02997naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003800134024002500172024004100197024002300238040001800261100005500279245013100334520162500465650002002090650001402110650001302124650003002137650002002167650001702187650001502204650002402219650001302243650002802256651002902284700002102313700002202334700002302356773007802379856008802457961000902545852000902554655001202563IND60766548820221214231751.0220208e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076654882DNAL7 a10113/76654882hdl7 a3771762aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02409482doi7 a4341502aris_accn_no7 a5062-12210-003-000D2aris_project_no7 a3771762seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhanyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7633-036X10aPredictions from algorithmic modeling result in better decisions than from data modeling for soybean iron deficiency chlorosis  aSoybean iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) is one of the major yield-reducing factors in the U.S. upper Midwest. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) has not been successful for breeding for IDC resistance, due to the complexity of trait. Genomic prediction has been extensively applied to increase selection accuracy for continuous numeric traits such as yield and plant height. For ordinal data types such as IDC, which are typically scored on a scale of 1-9 (resistant to susceptible), genomic prediction methods have not been systematically compared. Data modeling methods include logistic regression and ridge-regression BLUP (rrBLUP), and algorithm modeling methods include neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian inference, and support vector machines. The objectives of this research was: 1) to select the best model measured by discard specificity, selection sensitivity, selection precision, overall prediction accuracy, and receiver operating curve (ROC); and 2) to compare prediction accuracies between data modeling approaches (rrBLUP and logistic regression) and algorithmic modeling methods (random forest (RF), gradient boosting algorithm (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network (ANN)). We found that among the eight tested models, SVMs generated the highest discard specificity for de-selecting IDC susceptible lines, while RF has the highest selection sensitivity for selecting IDC resistant lines, and RF has the highest overall accuracy. For the soybean IDC ordinal data type, algorithmic modeling outperformed data modeling methods. 3aBayesian theory 3achlorosis 3agenomics 3amarker-assisted selection 3aneural networks 3aplant height 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoybeans 3asupport vector machines 3aMidwestern United States1 aKurek, Andreomar1 aCannon, Steven B.1 aBeavis, William D.0 tPloS one.g2021 July 9, v. 16, no. 7wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02409483Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168100001200177245012700189300001800316500002400334520163900358650003701997650002202034650003002056650002802086650002102114650001602135650003302151650002202184650002502206650002202231650002102253650003302274650002502307650001002332650001602342651001202358700001602370700001602386700001502402700001902417700001702436700001602453700001902469700001802488700002002506773007602526852000902602856008802611856011102699930003302810945002502843946001302868961001502881655001202896IND4366752020221121060626.0050125e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436675202DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.11792doi7 a10113/84522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aSun, X.10aDetection and characterization of a new strain of citrus canker bacteria from Key/Mexican lime and alemow in South Florida  ap. 1179-1188.  aIncludes references  aIn the Wellington and Lake Worth areas of Palm Beach County, FL, citrus canker appeared on Key/Mexican lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) and alemow (C. macrophylla) trees over a period of about 6 to 7 years before detection, but nearby canker-susceptible citrus, such as grapefruit (C. x paradisi) and sweet orange (C. sinensis), were unaffected. Colonies of the causal bacterium, isolated from leaf, stem, and fruit lesions, appeared similar to the Asiatic group of strains of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac-A) on the nutrient agar plate, but the growth on lima bean agar slants was less mucoid. The bacterium produced erumpent, pustule-like lesions of typical Asiatic citrus canker syndrome after inoculation into Key/Mexican lime, but brownish, flat, and necrotic lesions on the leaves of Duncan grapefruit, Madame Vinous sweet orange, sour orange (C. aurantium), citron (C. medica), Orlando tangelo (C. reticulata x C. x paradisi), and trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata). The bacterium did not react with the Xac-A specific monoclonal antibody A1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and could not be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays using primers selected for Xac-A. DNA reassociation analysis confirmed that the pathogen, designated as Xac-A(W), was more closely related to Xac-A and Xac-A* strains than X. axonopodis pv. aurantifolii or the citrus bacterial spot pathogen (X. axonopodis pv. citrumelo). The strain can be easily differentiated from Xac-A and Xac-A* using ELISA, PCR-based tests, fatty acid analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA, and host specificity. 3aXanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri 3aXanthomonas citri 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apathogen identification 3agenetic distance 3afatty acids 3aprincipal component analysis 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic variation 3adisease detection 3acankers (plants) 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3alimes 3afruit trees 3aFlorida1 aStall, R.E.1 aJones, J.B.1 aCubero, J.1 aGottwald, T.R.1 aGraham, J.H.1 aDixon, W.N.1 aSchubert, T.S.1 aChaloux, P.H.1 aStromberg, V.K.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Nov., v.  88, no.  11 p.1179-1188x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.11793Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/84523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071220b20080102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/05/09  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168072000900177100002000186245009300206300001800299500002400317520133300341650002201674650002701696650003001723650001801753650002001771650001901791650001101810650001601821650001601837650001901853651001501872773007601887852000901963856008801972856011102060930003302171945002502204946001302229961001302242655001202255IND4366754220221121060738.0050125e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436675422DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12352doi7 a10113/84532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aJ7001 aBaumgartner, K.10aRoot collar excavation for postinfection control of Armillaria root disease of grapevine  ap. 1235-1240.  aIncludes references  aRoot collar excavation for control of Armillaria root disease of grapevine was investigated in two California vineyards (vineyard K1 and vineyard N1) from 2002 to 2004. The hypothesis tested was that root collar excavation, when timed in early stages of root collar infection, may cause mycelial fans of the pathogen Armillaria mellea to recede from the root collar before severe disease results from vascular tissue decay. In vineyard N1, excavation significantly increased yield and cluster weight of symptomatic grapevines; symptomatic-excavated grapevines had the same high mean cluster weight as healthy grapevines, and there were no significant effects of excavation on yield or pruning weight of healthy grapevines. In vineyard K1, where excavated root collars frequently refilled with soil, excavation had no significant effects on yield or pruning weight of symptomatic grapevines, and significantly reduced pruning weight and shoot weight of healthy grapevines. Reexamination in March 2004 revealed that mycelial fans had receded from root collars of symptomatic-excavated grapevines, but remained on root collars of symptomatic-nonexcavated grapevines. Root collar excavation appears to be a promising cultural approach for control of Armillaria root disease, as long as excavated root collars are kept clear of soil. 3aArmillaria mellea 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3aroot diseases 3adisease control 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3ahost plants 3aviticulture 3avineyard soils 3aCalifornia0 tPlant disease.g2004 Nov., v.  88, no.  11 p.1235-1240x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12353Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/84533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071220b20080102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/05/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02956naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002500170024004000195024002300235040001800258100001900276245012400295520153900419650002001958650003101978650001002009650001302019650001802032650002102050650001302071650002902084650001802113700001602131700001702147700001802164700001502182700001402197700005802211700001502269700001502284773008302299856008602382961000902468852000902477655001202486IND60766549020221214231756.0220208e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076654902DNAL7 a10113/76654902hdl7 a3799062aris7 a10.1186/s12864-021-07783-z2doi7 a4343652aris_accn_no7 a5070-21000-042-00D2aris_project_no7 a3799062seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hengyou10aTranscriptome profiling reveals the spatial-temporal dynamics of gene expression essential for soybean seed development  aBackground Seeds are the economic basis of oilseed crops, especially soybeans, the most widely cultivated oilseed crop worldwide. Seed development is accompanied by a multitude of diverse cellular processes, and revealing the underlying regulatory activities is critical for seed improvement. Results In this study, we profiled the transcriptomes of developing seeds at 20, 25, 30, and 40'days after flowering (DAF), as these stages represent critical time points of seed development from early to full development. We identified a set of highly abundant genes and highlighted the importance of these genes in supporting nutrient accumulation and transcriptional regulation for seed development. We identified 8925 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that exhibited temporal expression patterns over the course and expression specificities in distinct tissues, including seeds and nonseed tissues (roots, stems, and leaves). Genes specific to nonseed tissues might have tissue-associated roles, with relatively low transcript abundance in developing seeds, suggesting their spatially supportive roles in seed development. Coexpression network analysis identified several underexplored genes in soybeans that bridge tissue-specific gene modules. Conclusions Our study provides a global view of gene activities and biological processes critical for seed formation in soybeans and prioritizes a set of genes for further study. The results of this study help to elucidate the mechanism controlling seed development and storage reserves. 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3aoilseed crops 3aseed development 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aHu, Zhenbin1 aYang, Yuming1 aLiu, Xiaoqian1 aLv, Haiyan1 aSong, Bao1 aAn, Yong Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4637-57161 aLi, Zhimin1 aZhang, Dan0 tBMC genomics.g2021 June 16, v. 22, no. 1wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07783-z3Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003800134024002500172024004100197024002300238040001800261100006600279245009200345506002800437506005700465520166700522596007002189596007002259596006602329506003702395650002902432650002402461650001402485650001802499650002102517650001302538650001102551650001202562650002102574650001102595700002102606700002002627700002402647700001902671700002302690773007802713856008802791903002202879961000902901852000902910655001202919IND60766549120221214231732.0220208e20210708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076654912DNAL7 a10113/76654912hdl7 a3802692aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02533662doi7 a4361072aris_accn_no7 a8040-52000-068-000D2aris_project_no7 a3802692seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Katherine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5954-903910aDietary Fiber, Starch, and Sugars in Bananas at Different Ripeness in the Retail Market  aResource is Open Access  aPublic Library of Science (PLoS) License Information  aThe goal of this work was to evaluate changes in dietary fiber measured by the traditional enzymatic-gravimetric method (AOAC 991.43) and the more recently accepted modified enzymatic-gravimetric method (AOAC 2011.25), mono- and disaccharides, and starch as a function of assessed ripeness in a controlled study of a single lot of bananas and in bananas at the same assessed stages of ripeness from bananas purchased in retail stores, from different suppliers. Sugars, starch, and dietary fiber were analyzed in bananas from a single lot, at different stages of ripeness, and in retail samples at the same assessed stages of ripeness. Mean fiber measured by the traditional enzymatic-gravimetric method (EG) was ~2 g/100g and not affected by ripeness. Mean fiber assessed with the recently modified method (mEG) was ~18 g/100g in unripe fruit and decreased to 4–5 g/100g in ripe and ~2 g/100g in overripe bananas. Slightly ripe and ripe bananas differed by ~1.1 g/100g in the controlled single-lot study but not among retail samples. There was a large increase in fructose, glucose and total sugar going from unripe to ripe with no differences between ripe and overripe. Aside from stage of ripeness, the carbohydrate composition in retail bananas is likely affected by differences in cultivar and post-harvest handling. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of measuring dietary fiber using the mEG approach, developing more comprehensive and sensitive carbohydrate analytical protocols and food composition data, and recognizing the impact of different stages of maturity and ripeness on carbohydrate intake estimated from food composition data.  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cNational Cancer Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000540 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbohydrate composition 3acarbohydrate intake 3acultivars 3adietary fiber 3afood composition 3afructose 3afruits 3aglucose 3aretail marketing 3astarch1 aMcGinty, Ryan C.1 aCouture, Garret1 aPehrsson, Pamela R.1 aMcKillop, Kyle1 aFukagawa, Naomi K.0 tPloS one.g2021 July 8, v. 16, no. 7wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02533663Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04348naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002300158245007700181300001600258500002400274500001500298520277200313650002003085650001103105650001803116650001903134650001703153650002403170650002103194650001303215650000903228650002303237650001203260650002103272650002403293650002803317651001603345653001503361653001703376700002203393700001903415700002203434700001703456773010603473852000903579856011203588930003303700945002503733946001103758961001303769655001203782IND4409491620221118055746.0080828s2002    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440949162DNAL7 a10113/191352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aJ7001 aCooper, Charles M.12aA Mississippi flood control reservoir: life expectancy and contamination  ap. 151-160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe fate of reservoirs is a major water management, water quality, and aquatic life use concern across the globe. We examined sedimentation rates, current watershed contamination contributions and potential impacts of long-term row cropping (cotton, corn, soybeans, and sweet potato) in a large flood control reservoir in the loess hills of Mississippi, USA. Grenada Reservoir, created in January 1954, was constructed as part of a comprehensive plan for flood control in the Yazoo River Basin in northwestern Mississippi. Two rivers, the Yalobusha and Skuna, contribute inflow to the reservoir, forming a distinctive Y-shape within the topography of the flood pool. Total watershed drainage area for the reservoir is approximately 3,419 square kilometers (1,320 square miles). Reservoir sediment accumulation rates were sampled in 1998 and 1999. Although reservoir life expectancy was originally estimated at 25 years because of high erosion rates in the watershed, our study revealed that the reservoir continues to function with only slightly reduced storage capacity. Sediment accumulation within the permanent pool adjacent to the dam was < 1cm yr.1 except for a depositional area near tributary inflow that accumulated sediment at about 5 cm yr.1. The central area of the permanent pool experienced sediment accumulation rates that averaged < 1.5 cm yr.1. Sites within the two reservoir arms fed by the two river inflows showed little or no sedimentation. Sedimentation rates further upstream in these two inflow areas were also generally low. Sedimentation rates within Grenada Reservoir were higher until the mid 1960s & early 70s but were considerably lower thereafter. These lower sedimentation rates paralleled land use changes and followed discontinuance of major upstream channel alterations for flood control. From 1996 to 2002 analyses were conducted in water and sediment for 8 metals and 48 pesticides/ contaminants at 26 stream/river locations and 9 locations within the reservoir. In spite of long-term historical use of residual pesticides in the watershed and widespread use of currently applied agricultural compounds, concentrations in stream or reservoir sediments and overlying water were generally low and sporadic or not detectable. Conversely, several metals (arsenic, lead, copper, iron, aluminum and zinc) were abundant in stream and reservoir sediments. Atrazine, a triazine herbicide, was routinely found in stream water and sediment. It was also detected in reservoir water samples but at nearly one fifth less than contributing stream concentrations. Naturally occurring aluminum and iron were found in high concentrations. Residual pesticides were generally not detected in water but were detected in stream and reservoir sediments. 3awater pollution 3acotton 3awater quality 3asweet potatoes 3aheavy metals 3aagricultural runoff 3awater management 3asoybeans 3acorn 3apesticide residues 3astreams 3acropping systems 3asediment deposition 3aagricultural watersheds 3aMississippi 0areservoirs 0arow cropping1 aSmith, Sammie Jr.1 aTesta, Sam III1 aRitchie, Jerry C.1 aWelch, Terry0 tInternational journal of ecology and environmental sciences.g2002, v.  28 p.151-160x0377-015X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/191353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080922b20081011c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/09/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03393naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002500170024004100195024002300236040001800259100002500277245014200302520177600444650001502220650001502235650003102250650001302281650001302294650001102307650001402318650001902332650001902351650001302370650001402383650002902397650002602426650001802452700002702470700006602497700002402563700001502587700002202602700002602624773007602650856008602726856004502812961000902857852000902866655001202875IND60766549320221214231755.0220208e20211211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076654932DNAL7 a10113/76654932hdl7 a3814432aris7 a10.1186/s12864-021-08147-32doi7 a4344932aris_accn_no7 a5030-21220-006-000D2aris_project_no7 a3814432seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatukunda, Martha I.10aInteraction between Rag genes results in a unique synergistic transcriptional response that enhances soybean resistance to soybean aphids  aPyramiding different resistance genes into one plant genotype confers enhanced resistance at the phenotypic level, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are not well-understood. In soybean, resistance to aphids (Aphis glycines) is conferred by Rag genes. We analyzed the effect of pyramiding Rag genes at the transcriptome level by comparing the response to aphids in four soybean genotypes, aphid-susceptible (no Rag gene), monogenic aphid resistance (Rag1 or Rag2 alone), and pyramid (Rag1/2), at 6 and 12 hours after infestation. A strong synergistic interaction was identified between Rag1 and Rag2 in the Rag1/2 genotype, resulting in differential expression of large gene sets unique to the pyramid. This synergistic effect was very evident early (6 hours after infestation) and involved biological processes unique to the pyramid. However, the response of all four genotypes shared more commonalities 12 hours after aphid infestation. Transcription factor (TF) analyses identified a network of interacting TF that potentially integrates signaling from Rag1 and Rag2 to produce the unique Rag1/2 response. Pyramiding resulted in rapid induction of phytochemicals production and deposition of lignin to strengthen the secondary cell wall, while repressing photosynthesis. We also identified Glyma.07G063700 as a novel, strong candidate for the Rag1 gene. The synergistic interaction between Rag1 and Rag2 in the Rag1/2 genotype can explain its enhanced resistance phenotype. This synergistic effect can change the selective pressure on colonizing aphids, impacting the durability of resistance. Understanding molecular mechanisms that support enhanced resistance in pyramid genotypes could also facilitate more directed approaches for crop improvement. 3acell walls 3adurability 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3agenotype 3alignin 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytochemicals 3asoybeans 3asynergism 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aHohenstein, Jessica D.1 aMccabe, Chantal Elaine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2786-54961 aGraham, Michelle A.1 aQi, Yunhui1 aSingh, Asheesh K.1 aMacintosh, Gustavo C.0 tBMC genomics.g2021 Dec. 11, v. 22wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-08147-33Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7665493  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008003300030016002300063024002300086024001700109024003800126024002500164024004100189024002300230040001800253100003200271245009200303506002800395506005700423520066900480596007001149596007001219506003701289650002801326650002301354650002101377650001501398650001301413650001001426650001701436650001201453650001401465650001601479650001401495700002101509700002101530700003101551773007901582856008801661903002201749961000901771852000901780655001201789IND60766549520221214231753.0220208exx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076654952DNAL7 a10113/76654952hdl7 a3856112aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02581572doi7 a4401842aris_accn_no7 a8042-32000-113-000D2aris_project_no7 a3856112seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Matthew Scott1None10aDynamically expressed genes provide candidate viability biomarkers in a model coccidian  aResource is Open Access  aPublic Library of Science (PLoS) License Information  aParasites of the genus Eimeria, and the closely related human pathogen Cyclospora cayetanensis, cause enteric disease in livestock and people worldwide. These coccidian parasites must undergo maturation (sporulation) before becoming infectious. Understanding oocyst maturation would benefit attempts to reduce the harm they cause to veterinary and human health. One such approach would be to develop treatments that prevent sporulation. Here, we assessed transcription in maturing oocysts of Eimeria acervulina, a widespread chicken parasite. We also investigated predicted gene function and determined which of this parasite's genes also occur in C. cayetanensis.  cagricultural research servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cagricultural research servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyclospora cayetanensis 3aEimeria acervulina 3aanimal pathogens 3abiomarkers 3achickens 3agenes 3ahuman health 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3asporulation 3aviability1 aObrien, Celia N.1 aJenkins, Mark C.1 aRosenthal, Benjamin Martin0 tPloS one.g2021 Oct. 1, v. 16, no. 10wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02581573Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100001900167245009100186300001600277500002400293500001500317520133700332650002001669650002101689650003001710650001301740650003501753650002101788650002401809650001801833650002401851650001201875650001401887650001701901650001501918650001201933651003101945653002601976700002002002773008302022852000902105856011202114930003302226945002502259946001302284961001202297655001202309IND4438316420221121040700.0100611e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443831642DNAL7 a10113/426982hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK510 0aK200 0aE700 0aX1001 aAnderson, Nate10aLand cover, land use, and mill characteristics as predictors of wood procurement range  ap. 100-107.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUrbanization of forestland has the potential to reduce the timberland base indefinitely. Wood-using industry located in areas with declining timberlands may be forced to expand the range of procurement operations to meet production requirements. This article examines 11 different land use and land cover variables as predictors of woodshed area for sawmills in the northeastern United States. Based on woodshed maps provided by 175 sawmills in seven states, geospatial analysis and multiple regression are used to test the hypothesis that mills in areas with higher proportions of nontimber land have larger woodsheds. Results indicate that mill characteristics, not landscape variables, are the strongest predictors of woodshed area. Although some cover types, including farmland and open water, are associated with larger woodsheds, none of the measures of urbanization used in this study are significant predictors of woodshed area. If urbanization is leading to a reduced flow of sawlogs, the explanation for the lack of observed effects of urban cover on woodshed area may be tied to the flow of sawlogs from terminal harvests, prior relocation of sawmills out of urbanizing areas, or the implementation of alternative procurement and production strategies that help sawmills remain competitive as local wood supplies tighten. 3aland use change 3aforest economics 3ageographical distribution 3asawmills 3ageographic information systems 3avegetation cover 3asawmilling industry 3atimber supply 3aregression analysis 3asawlogs 3awoodlands 3aurbanization 3aprediction 3aforests 3aNortheastern United States 0ageospatial technology1 aGermain, René.0 tForest products journal.g2009 , v.  59, no.  11-12 p.100-107x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100706b20100807c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/28  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03345naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158100002100167245012300188300001400311500001500325520173300340592002802073650001502101650001802116650002802134650002902162650002002191650001902211650002302230650001802253650001902271650002002290653002502310653002902335653002802364700002502392700002502417700002402442773011602466852000902582856011202591856007702703930003302780945002502813961001302838655001202851IND4435106620221118045031.0100409e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443510662DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-2253.12doi7 a10113/419242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aSchwarz, Ryan S.10aCoccidian Merozoite Transcriptome Analysis from Eimeria maxima in Comparison to Eimeria tenella and Eimeria acervulina  ap. 49-57.  a2019-12-06  aWith the Eimeria spp. populations that infect chickens used as a model for coccidian biology, we aimed to survey the transcriptome of Eimeria maxima and contrast it to the 2 other Eimeria spp. for which transcriptome data are available, i.e., Eimeria tenella and Eimeria acervulina. The asexual intracellular development stage, the merozoite, was specifically examined, and we used expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis to provide experimental evidence of transcription and a framework for understanding the merozoite stage of E. maxima. Of 2,680 individual ESTs obtained, 48.2%% shared most significant (E < 10⁻⁻⁵) homology to sequences from other apicomplexan species, primarily other Eimeria spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, and 47.5%% were unique. Annotation of these ESTs enabled categorization to putative biological function and revealed an emphasis on translation, cytoskeleton, metabolism, signaling, transport, and protein folding, as well as the apicomplexan specific surface antigens and micronemes. Comparative analysis of abundantly expressed transcripts from merozoites of the 3 Eimeria spp. revealed a novel transcript common to all 3. Sharing no significant homology to any other sequence in public databases, this transcript was predicted to encode an Eimeria-specific protein (ESP) with 166––178 amino acids and 58.9––65.1%% interspecific identity. A predicted signal peptide was identified, consistent with the assumption that ESP is a secreted protein. These annotated ESTs from E. maxima merozoites provide a resource for intra- and interspecific comparative analyses that will be useful in distinguishing the unique biology of coccidian parasites in relation to the diverse phylum of Apicomplexa.  aPublisher supplied data 3amerozoites 3amessenger RNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aEimeria maxima 3aEimeria acervulina 3atranscriptome 3asignal peptide 3aEimeria tenella 0anucleotide sequences 0aEimeria-specific protein 0amolecular sequence data1 aFetterer, Raymond H.1 aRosenberg, George H.1 aMiska, Katarzyna B.0 tJournal of parasitology.g2010 Feb., v. 96, no. 1 p.49-57dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/419243Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-2253.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/05/17  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02437naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008003300029016002200062024002100084040001800105072000900123072000900132072000900141072000900150100001900159245012700178500002400305500001500329520083900344650001701183650002001200650001901220650002101239650001901260651001801279653003101297653002401328653002001352653001901372653002401391653002501415653004401440773028301484852000901767856011201776930003301888945002501921946000901946961001201955655001201967IND4435795720221122072414.0100421|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443579572DNAL7 a10113/426572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aF300 0aK001 0aX1001 aKing, Susan L.10aUsing ROC curves to compare neural networks and logistic regression for modeling individual noncatastrophic tree mortality  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe performance of two classifiers, logistic regression and neural networks, are compared for modeling noncatastrophic individual tree mortality for 21 species of trees in West Virginia. The output of the classifier is usually a continuous number between 0 and 1. A threshold is selected between 0 and 1 and all of the trees below the threshold are classified as mortality trees and all of the trees above the threshold are classified as survival trees. Selecting the threshold that has both a high sensitivity and specificity is a major decision. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve graphically describes the performance of the classifier without the requirement of a threshold. Its accuracy is measured by the area under the curve (AUC). A neural network is the superior classifier because it has a higher AUC statistic. 3aforest trees 3aneural networks 3alogit analysis 3aforest inventory 3atree mortality 3aWest Virginia 0amathematics and statistics 0amathematical models 0amortality trees 0asurvival trees 0aregression analysis 0astatistical analysis 0areceiver operating characteristic curve0 t13th Central Hardwood Forest Conference proceedings of a conference held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, April 1-3, 2002 / edited by: J.W.

Analysis of variance of yield indicated highly significant differences among the progenies. General combining ability (GCA) determined most of the differences among the crosses. Specific combing ability (SCA) was also significant but less important. The estimates of GCA effects indicated that one line was the best general combiner for grain yield under drought. Nei's genetic distance, measured using SSR markers, differed from 0.20 to 0.48 among the eight genotypes. The correlation of Nei's genetic distance with SCA for grain yield and heterosis ranged from 0.4 to 0.5. These results indicate that the level of SCA and heterosis depends on the level of genetic diversity between the wheat genotypes examined. Microsatellite markers were effective in predicting the mean and the variance of SCA in various cultivars combinations. However, selection of crosses solely on microsatellite data would miss superior combinations. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3ageneral combining ability 3aspecific combining ability 3amicrosatellite repeats 3awater stress 3adrought 3agrain yield 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3aheterosis 3agenotype-environment interaction1 aMoussa, M.E.1 aHana, N.S.1 aAgrama, H.A.0 tEuphytica.g2005, v.  141, no.  3 p.301-308x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/42663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-005-8066-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20071011b20071102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/09  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02910naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100002000200245008600220300001800306500002400324500001500348520117600363650002201539650001001561650002401571650001801595650002201613650002001635650002301655650002401678650001801702650001701720650001901737651001801756653002001774653002401794653002601818700002701844700002901871700001801900700002201918773011001940852000902050856011202059856009202171930003302263945002502296946001102321961001202332655001202344IND4424235520221120091636.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442423552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01903.x2doi7 a10113/426682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aK001 0aJ1001 aFissore, Cinzia10aVariable temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon in North American forests  ap. 2295-2310.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated mean residence time (MRT) for soil organic carbon (SOC) sampled from paired hardwood and pine forests located along a 22 °C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient in North America. We used acid hydrolysis fractionation, radiocarbon analyses, long-term laboratory incubations (525-d), and a three-pool model to describe the size and kinetics of the acid insoluble C (AIC), active and slow SOC fractions in soil. We found that active SOC was 2 ± 0.2% (mean ± SE) of total SOC, with an MRT of 33 ± 6 days that decreased strongly with increasing MAT. In contrast, MRT for slow SOC and AIC (70 ± 6% and 27 ± 6% of total SOC, respectively) ranged from decades to thousands of years, and neither was significantly related to MAT. The accumulation of AIC (as a percent of total SOC) was greater in hardwood than pine stands (36% and 21%, respectively) although the MRT for AIC was longer in pine stands. Based on these results, we suggest that the responsiveness of most SOC decomposition in upland forests to global warming will be less than currently modeled, but any shifts in vegetation from hardwood to pine may alter the size and MRT of SOC fractions. 3adeciduous forests 3aPinus 3asoil organic carbon 3afractionation 3atemperate forests 3aair temperature 3aconiferous forests 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil analysis 3aforest soils 3abiodegradation 3aUnited States 0abiogeochemistry 0amean residence time 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aGiardina, Christian P.1 aSwanston, Christopher W.1 aKing, Gary M.1 aKolka, Randall K.0 tGlobal change biology.g2009 Sept., v.  15, no.  9 p.2295-2310dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01903.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03025naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001800158245008900176300001600265500002400281500001500305520152600320650001501846650001201861650001701873650000901890650002701899650002801926650002601954650002201980650002802002650002702030650002002057650001602077650001802093650001302111650001802124650001902142653001602161653001202177773010302189852000902292856011202301930003302413945002502446946001102471961001302482655001202495IND4372978720221118055802.0050803e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437297872DNAL7 a10113/191072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF831 0aL8311 aWeiland, J.J.10aProduction of protease isozymes by Aphanomyces cochlioides and Aphanomyces euteiches  ap. 225-233.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe production of protease activity by the sugarbeet pathogen Aphanomyces cochlioides, the legume pathogen A. euteiches, and the fish pathogen Saprolegnia parasitica was examined. Protease activity was readily detected in supernatants of water cultures of each organism using autoclaved host tissue as a nutrient source. Most of the protease isozymes extracted from sugarbeet and pea seedlings infected with A. cochlioides and A. euteiches, respectively, co-migrated with enzymes produced by the pathogens in culture. In inoculated sugarbeet seedlings, the protease activities were detected prior to or concommitent with the onset of disease symptoms and the activities were capable of digesting protein extracted from sugarbeet hypocotyls. Use of class-specific inhibitors indicated that a portion of the protease activity was of the trypsin-class. Trypsin-like isozymes that possessed a relatively fast electrophoretic migration were detected in the A. cochlioides, A. euteiches, and S. parasitica protease complements, whereas the remaining isozymes were not affected by any of the inhibitors tested. Proteinaceous trypsin inhibitors from the legumes lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and soybean (Glycine max) inhibited the trypsin-like isozymes from A. cochlioides, but not A. euteiches, whereas low molecular weight, synthetic trypsin inhibitors inhibited these isozymes from both pathogen sources. The potential role of protease inhibition in determining host range in phytopathogenic Aphanomyces species is discussed. 3asugar beet 3atrypsin 3abiosynthesis 3apeas 3aSaprolegnia parasitica 3aAphanomyces cochlioides 3aAphanomyces euteiches 3aenzyme inhibition 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal proteins 3asugar crops 3aPisum sativum 3aisozymes 3aBeta vulgaris 3aOsmerus mordax 0aproteinases 0aOsmerus0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2004 Nov., v.  65, no.  5 p.225-233x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/191073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02515naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001800196245010700214300001600321500002500337520130500362650001001667650001701677650002101694700001801715700001701733700001901750773009401769852000901863856011201872856008801984930003302072946001102105961001302116655001202129IND9303529220221121061209.0930609e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930352922DNAL7 a10.1016/0168-1591(93)90007-C2doi7 a10113/220362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aF900 0aL8101 aPfister, J.A.10aMaternal locoweed exposure in utero and as a neonate does not disrupt taste aversion learning in lambs  ap. 159-167.  aIncludes references.  aTaste aversion learning has been suggested as a sensitive measure of behavioral toxicosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if maternal locowood (Oxtropis sericea) ingestion would adversely influence the ability of lambs to acquire and retain a conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Pregnant and lactating ewes were fed locoweed (300 g day-1) from Days 100 to 130 of gestation and/or from Days 10 to 50 of lactation. Surviving lambs were evaluated at 9 months of age. Ingestion of corn (Zea mays), a novel feed, was paired with lithium chloride. Lambs were tested for three 15-min periods in a two-choice test (corn and alfalfa pellets) immediately after aversive conditioning; persistence was tested 30 days later using the same procedures. All aversively conditioned lambs formed a strong CTA to corn; previous locoweed history did not influence either the strength or the persistence of the aversion. Even though lambs were overtly intoxicated at birth by maternal locoweed exposure, lambs showed no overt signs of intoxication when this study was conducted. Lambs exposed to locoweed do not have an impaired ability to form taste aversions, suggesting that there were no learning deficits secondary to toxicosis and that lambs are likely to have as normal diet selection patterns as adults. 3alambs 3afood choices 3apoisonous plants1 aAstorga, J.B.1 aPanter, K.E.1 aMolyneux, R.J.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g1993 Apr., v.  36, no.  2/3 p.159-167x0168-15917nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/220363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1591(93)90007-C3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081219b20090206c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02778naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001800175245010900193300001400302500002400316500001500340520113900355650001301494650000901507650001901516650002301535650002001558650001401578650001401592650001801606650000901624650001301633650001201646650002201658650002501680651001101705653001401716700001501730700001401745700001601759700001701775700001701792700001601809700001601825773007101841852000901912856011201921856008502033930003302118945002502151946001102176961001302187655001202200IND4400102020221119195036.0080116e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440010202DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820070036542doi7 a10113/131512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aLindstrom, I.10aIsolation and genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii from Ugandan chickens reveals frequent multiple infections  ap. 39-45.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe genetic make-up of an infecting Toxoplasma gondii strain may be important for the outcome of infection and the risk of reactivation of chronic disease. In order to survey the distribution of different genotypes within an area, free-range chickens act as a good model species. In this study 85 chickens were used to investigate the prevalence, genotype and mouse virulence of T. gondii in Kampala, Uganda. Antibodies were detected in 40 chickens, of which 20 had MAT-titres of 1:20 or higher and were also positive by PCR. Genotyping of 5 loci (SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB and GRA6) showed that 6 strains belonged to genotype I, 8 to Type II and 1 to Type III. Five chickens had multiple infections; 3 individuals with Type I plus Type II and a further 2 harbouring Types I, II and III. Isolates were obtained from 9 chickens via bioassay in mice, 6 were Type II strains and 3 were from animals with mixed infection. This is the first set of African T. gondii strains to be genotyped at multiple loci and in addition to the 3 predominant lineages we found a small number of new polymorphisms and a high frequency of multiple infections. 3achickens 3aloci 3aseroprevalence 3aantibody detection 3amixed infection 3avirulence 3abioassays 3atoxoplasmosis 3amice 3agenotype 3astrains 3aToxoplasma gondii 3agenetic polymorphism 3aUganda 0aisolation1 aSundar, N.1 aLindh, J.1 aKironde, F.1 aKabasa, J.D.1 aKwok, O.C.H.1 aDubey, J.P.1 aSmith, J.E.0 tParasitology.g2008 Jan., v.  135, no.  1 p.39-45x0031-18207nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/131513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820070036543Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01651naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002100099040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172072001700189100001900206245006500225300001600290520045200306650001900758650001500777650002400792650001300816650001400829650002000843650001100863650002300874651001400897700001900911773009400930852000901024856011201033930003301145945002501178946001301203961001301216655001201229991575424500742620221122062045.0720901e197207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290807052DNAL7 a10113/426762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular aspects of this hypertrophy have been under investigation for a long time. However the transition from compensated hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure has not been investigated in the study of CuD. We set out to investigate the contractile and hemodynamic parameters of the CuD mouse heart and to determine whether heart failure follows hypertrophy in the CuD heart. Dams of FVB mice were fed CuD or copper-adequate (CuA) diet starting from the third day post delivery and the weanling pups were fed the same diet for a total period of 5 weeks (pre- and postweanling). At week 4, the functional parameters of the heart were analyzed using a surgical technique for catheterizing the left ventricle. A significant decrease in left ventricle systolic pressure was observed with no significant change in heart rate, and more importantly contractility as measured by the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+dP/dt) and decline (–dP/dt) were significantly depressed in the CuD mice. However, left ventricle end diastolic pressure was elevated, and relaxation was impaired in the CuD animals; the duration of relaxation was prolonged. In addition to significant changes in the basal level of cardiac function, CuD hearts had a blunted response to the stimulation of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Furthermore, morphological analysis revealed increased collagen accumulation in the CuD hearts along with lipid deposition. This study shows that CuD leads to systolic and diastolic dysfunction in association with histopathological changes, which are indices commonly used to diagnose congestive heart failure. 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3acardiomyopathy 3aweanlings 3aheart failure 3adiastolic blood pressure 3anutrient deficiencies 3acollagen 3asystolic blood pressure 3amice 3aelectrophysiology 3adietary minerals 3ahistopathology 3adietary mineral supplements 3ahypertrophy 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCeruloplasminxmetabolism 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aCopperxbloodxdeficiency. 2aFemale 2aHeartxphysiopathology 2aHeart Failurexetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aHemodynamicsxphysiology 2aIsoproterenolxpharmacology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMice 2aMyocardial Contractionxphysiology 2aMyocardiumxenzymology 2aOrgan Size 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aVentricular Function, Leftxphysiology 0ahemodynamics 0acongestive heart failure1 aOrtines, Raymond V.1 aSaari, Jack T.1 aKang, Y.

E55-E65.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt is well established that estrogen is required for mammary epithelial cell proliferation and ductal development in the growing animal, and that lobuloalveolar development during gestation is dependent on progesterone. The effects of these steroid hormones on gene expression in the mammary gland are mediated primarily by their respective nuclear hormone receptors, which function as hormone-bound transcription factors. To gain insight into how estrogen and progesterone regulate mammary gland growth and function in cattle, we and others have characterized the expression patterns of their cognate nuclear hormone receptors in the bovine mammary gland throughout development, pregnancy, and lactation. This work has identified a lack of expression of estrogen receptor β and a greater abundance of progesterone receptor during lactation in the bovine mammary gland, compared with the rodent gland. We speculate that interactions among the estrogen receptor isoforms that regulate progesterone receptor expression may contribute to these species differences. Further, demonstrated expression of substantial quantities of estrogen receptor within the prepubertal bovine mammary fat pad, along with coordinated insulin-like growth factor-I expression, suggests that this tissue may stimulate parenchymal growth via an estrogen-responsive paracrine mechanism. In addition, the recent availability of bovine genomic sequence information and microarray technologies has permitted the study of global gene expression in the mammary gland in response to the steroid environment. We have identified more than 100 estrogen-responsive genes, of which the majority are novel estrogen gene targets. Estrogen-induced changes in gene expression were consistent with increased mammary epithelial cell proliferation, increased extracellular matrix turnover in parenchyma, and increased extracellular matrix deposition in the fat pad. A comparison of estrogen-responsive genes in the mammary glands of humans, mice, and cattle suggests considerable variation among species, as well as potential differences in regulatory elements in common estrogen receptor gene targets. Continuing studies using advanced molecular techniques should assist in elucidating the complex regulation of mammary function at the transcript level. 3atranscription factors 3ahormone receptors 3aprogesterone 3agene expression 3aestrogens 3acows 3amammary glands 3agene expression regulation 0acattle1 aMeyer, M.J.1 aLi, R.W.1 aVan Amburgh, M.E.1 aBoisclair, Y.R.1 aCapuco, A.V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 June, v.  90 p.E55-E65x1525-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2006-4663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100602b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02971naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072001700156072001700173072001700190100002200207245009900229300001600328500002400344500002300368500001500391520122700406650001601633650002401649650003201673650002101705650001801726650001801744650001601762650002001778650002201798650001901820650002101839653003301860653001601893653001501909653002901924700002601953700002001979700001801999773011102017852000902128856007502137856011202212930003302324945002502357946001102382961001202393655001202405IND4437607820221118045132.0100525e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443760782DNAL7 a10.1139/X10-0392doi7 a10113/419112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We examined long-term silvicultural experiments in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) to characterize how stand age, thinning treatments (thinned from above, below, or both), and stocking levels (residual basal area) influence stand-level growth dominance through time. In stands thinned from below or from both above and below, growth dominance was not significantly different from zero at any age or stocking level. Growth dominance in stands thinned from above trended from negative at low stocking levels to positive at high stocking levels and was positive in young stands. Growth dominance in unthinned stands was positive and increased with age. These results suggest that growth dominance provides a useful tool for assessing the efficacy of thinning treatments designed to reduce competition between trees and promote high levels of productivity across a population, particularly among crop trees. 3atree growth 3aplantation forestry 3atree and stand measurements 3aage at first egg 3aforest stands 3astand density 3amethodology 3aforest thinning 3aplant competition 3aPinus resinosa 3astand basal area 0astand-level growth dominance 0anew methods 0abasal area 0aforest stand development1 aD’Amato, Anthony W.1 aPalik, Brian J.1 aFraver, Shawn0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2010 May, v.  40, no.  5 p.843-849wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X10-0393Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/419113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100603b20100703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle01585naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245005500174300001300229500002400242520041600266650001700682650001600699650002700715650002000742650002200762650001400784651000900798653002600807653002200833700002700855773007600882852000900958856011200967930003301079945002501112946001301137961001301150655001201163IND4438236120221122222113.0100608s2009    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443823612DNAL7 a10113/426452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL400 0aL0011 aWaqa, Hilda10aNew Fijian Callidiopini (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)  ap. 3-15.  aIncludes references  aBased on examination of material collected as part of the nSf - fiji terrestrial arthropod Survey, two new species of Callidiopini (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae) are described from fiji: Ceresium tuberculatum Waqa & lingafelter, n. sp.

We contend that similar approaches are needed in disease ecology because these complicated systems are inherently difficult to observe without error. For example, wildlife disease studies often designate individuals, populations, or spatial units to states (e.g., susceptible, infected, post-infected), but the uncertainty associated with these state assignments remains largely ignored or unaccounted for. We demonstrate how recent developments incorporating observation error through repeated sampling extend quite naturally to hierarchical spatial models of disease effects, prevalence, and dynamics in natural systems. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus in migratory waterfowl and a pathogenic fungus recently implicated in the global loss of amphibian biodiversity are used as motivating examples. Both show that relatively simple modifications to study designs can greatly improve our understanding of complex spatio-temporal disease dynamics by rigorously accounting for uncertainty at each level of the hierarchy. 3atemporal variation 3adisease detection 3adisease models 3adisease prevalence 3awildlife diseases 3aspatial variation 3aprobabilistic models 3adisease diagnosis 2aAmphibiansxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aAnimal Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxmicrobiologyxphysiologyxvirology. 2aAnimals, Wildxmicrobiologyxphysiologyxvirology. 2aAnseriformesxvirology 2aEcologyxstatistics & numerical data 2aFungixpathogenicity 2aHumans 2aInfluenza A virusxpathogenicity 2aInfluenza in Birdsxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aModels, Statistical 2aMycosesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aUncertainty 0amathematical models1 aNichols, James D.1 aBailey, Larissa L.1 aMacKenzie, Darryl I.1 aKendall, William.L.1 aFranklin, Alan B.0 tEcology letters.g2010 June, v.  13, no.  6 p.659-674dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/419153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01472.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100603b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02935naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002000127040001800147072000900165100001700174245009100191300001400282500002400296520155000320650002701870650001601897650001601913650002201929650001801951650002601969650002401995650002802019650002302047650001102070650000902081651001202090700001502102773007102117852000902188856008502197856011102282930003302393945002502426946001302451961001302464655001202477IND4364417520221121050424.0040914e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436441752DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.1.342doi7 a10113/84182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aKamenova, I.10aComparison of detection methods for a novel tobamovirus isolated from Florida hibiscus  ap. 34-40.  aIncludes references  aA novel tobamovirus recently was isolated from hibiscus in Florida. Serological and molecular methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dot-blot immunoassay (DBIA), tissue-blot immunoassay (TBIA), and immunocapture reverse-transcription poly-merase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) were compared to evaluate their usefulness for diagnosis of this virus. Each method was tested with partially purified virus preparations and tissue samples from infected hibiscus and Chenopodium quinoa plants. Indirect ELISA was more sensitive than double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA with all samples tested. The Florida hibiscus virus was detectable in hibiscus leaves and bark up to 1:12,800 and 1:6,400 dilutions, respectively, by indirect ELISA and up to 1:3,200 and 1:400 dilutions by DAS-ELISA. End-point dilutions of partially purified virus preparations from indirect and DAS-ELISA were 4 and 31 ng/ml, respectively. Florida hibiscus virus was detected by DBIA in sap from hibiscus bark and leaves at dilutions up to 1:400 and 1:800, respectively, showing that DBIA was less sensitive than either ELISA method. The virus also was detected reliably by TBIA from leaves and bark of hibiscus plants. The most sensitive method was IC-RT-PCR, which could detect as little as 500 pg/ml of virus in partially purified preparations and was 16- and 32-fold more sensitive than DAS-ELISA with hibiscus bark and leaf extracts, respectively. Over 600 hibiscus samples were tested by various combinations of these methods to validate their usefulness. 3aHibiscus rosa-sinensis 3aTobamovirus 3ahost plants 3aornamental plants 3aplant viruses 3adiagnostic techniques 3amicrobial detection 3apathogen identification 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aleaves 3abark 3aFlorida1 aAdkins, S.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Jan., v.  88, no.  1 p.34-40x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.1.343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/84183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080603b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2004/12/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03291naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001700187245016100204300001600365500002400381500001500405520141100420650001801831650002101849650001401870650001801884650002001902650001101922650001701933650002801950650001701978650002001995650001102015650002302026650002002049650002502069650002702094650001602121653001302137653001602150653002102166653001802187700001802205700001502223700001602238700001502254773011702269852000902386856011202395856008802507930003302595945002502628946001102653961001302664655001202677IND4408152320221118055516.0080723e20080815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440815232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.04.0042doi7 a10113/190902hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL8321 aBastos, R.G.10aBovine NK cells acquire cytotoxic activity and produce IFN-γ after stimulation by Mycobacterium bovis BCG- or Babesia bovis-exposed splenic dendritic cells  ap. 302-312.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aEarly interactions of innate immune cell populations, such as dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells, can affect the ability of the acquired immune response to control infection of intracellular microorganisms. In this study, we investigated the activation of bovine NK cells by CD13⁺ splenic DC stimulated with either Mycobacterium bovis BCG or Babesia bovis merozoites. Splenic DC were used either immediately after selection (cytokine⁻) or after exposure to GM-CSF, IL-4 and Flt3L for 72h (cytokine⁺). Phenotypic analyses showed up-regulation of MHCII, CD80 and CD86 on cytokine⁺ DC when compared to cytokine⁻ DC. Purified NK cells (CD335⁺CD3⁻CD2⁺/⁻CD8α⁺/⁻) were co-cultured with microbial-exposed cytokine⁻ DC or cytokine⁺ DC in either transwell or cell-to-cell format and NK cell IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity were assessed. NK cell IFN-γ production was dependent on cell-to-cell contact. Microbial-stimulated cytokine⁺ DC induced significantly more IFN-γ production from NK cells than cytokine⁻ cells. In contrast, cytotoxicity and perforin up-regulation were more pronounced in NK cells cultured with cytokine⁻ DC than cytokine⁺ DC. Therefore, activation of bovine NK cells by microbial-stimulated CD13⁺ splenic DC is influenced by the maturation state of the DC suggesting different roles for the splenic DC during disease-induced maturation. 3aBabesia bovis 3ain vitro studies 3aphenotype 3aT-lymphocytes 3adendritic cells 3acattle 3acell culture 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3acytotoxicity 3acell physiology 3aspleen 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3anatural killer cells 3abiochemical mechanisms 3ainterferons 0aimmunity 0alymphocytes 0agamma-interferon 0aimmune system1 aJohnson, W.C.1 aMwangi, W.1 aBrown, W.C.1 aGoff, W.L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Aug. 15, v.  124, no.  3-4 p.302-312dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/190903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/09/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01937naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131100001600148245011900164300001600283500012400299500002400423520075900447650001801206650002301224650002301247700001601270700001901286773009101305852000901396856011201405930003301517945001301550946001101563961001301574655001201587IND2329507820221121012402.0021029e199808  be |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232950782DNAL7 a10113/220192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A visual bioassay has been developed to facilitate the screening of effective yeast isolates antagonistic to A. flavus. The NOR mutant of A. flavus was used in this visual bioassay because the enzyme norsolorinic acid reductase is blocked resulting in the accumulation of norsolorinic acid, a bright red-orange pigment, which is easily visualized. Each isolate of yeast was tested for its biocontrol activity by scoring its inhibitory effect on colony expansion and sporulation of NOR mutant. Certain yeast strains were found to confine the spreading of NOR mutant and reduce the red-orange pigment formation, an indication of prevention of aflatoxin production. 3aPistacia vera 3aAspergillus flavus 3abiological control1 aBaker, J.L.1 aGrosjean, O.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g1998 Aug., , no. 470 p.576-581wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/220193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081218b20090206c00000000  aINDdAS1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03547naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245017000206300001600376500002400392500001500416520136700431650001301798650003101811650001601842650002201858650002601880650002101906650002101927650001601948650002101964650002801985650002002013650001902033650002902052650002202081650002302103650002902126653001502155653004302170653003102213653004102244653002302285700002202308700002102330700002202351700001902373700002002392700001602412700001502428700002202443773011702465852000902582856011202591856008802703930003302791945002502824946001102849961001302860655001202873IND4408152720221118055424.0080723e20080815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440815272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.04.0132doi7 a10113/190912hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL2001 aKim, Chul Hong10aConstruction and application of an avian intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte cDNA microarray (AVIELA) for gene expression profiling during Eimeria maxima infection  ap. 341-354.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aIntestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are the primary immune effector cells in the gut and play a critical role in eliciting protective immunity to enteric pathogens such as Eimeria, the etiologic agent of avian coccidiosis. In this study, a microarray of genes expressed by intestinal IELs from Eimeria-infected chickens was constructed using the expressed sequence tag (EST) strategy. The avian intestinal IEL cDNA microarray (AVIELA) contained duplicates of 9668 individual ESTs (6654 known genes and 3014 unique singletons of unknown identity) and was used to analyze gene expression profiles during primary and secondary Eimeria maxima infections. Following primary inoculation with E. maxima, the expression levels of 74 genes were significantly altered more than two-fold over the 3-day infection period (51 up-regulated, 23 down-regulated). Following secondary infection, the expression levels of 308 genes were significantly altered (62 up-regulated, 246 down-regulated). Pathway gene analysis indicated that many of the modulated genes were related to apoptosis, JAK/STAT, MAPK, interleukin, and TLR signaling pathways, and involving innate and adaptive immune responses. This chicken IEL microarray will provide a valuable resource for future transcriptional profiling of the genes involved in protective immunity to chicken enteric pathogens. 3achickens 3atranscriptional activation 3acoccidiosis 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3aepithelial cells 3amucosal immunity 3alymphocytes 3apoultry diseases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3aEimeria maxima 3atranscription (genetics) 3aintestinal mucosa 3adisease resistance 3alymphocyte proliferation 0aepithelium 0aintestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes 0agene expression regulation 0aavian intestinal IEL cDNA microarray 0amolecular genetics1 aLillehoj, Hyun S.1 aBliss, Travis W.1 aKeeler, Calvin L.1 aHong, Yeong Ho1 aPark, Dong Woon1 aYamage, Mat1 aMin, Wongi1 aLillehoj, Erik P.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Aug. 15, v.  124, no.  3-4 p.341-354dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/190913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.04.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/09/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04415naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024001900122024002200141024002100163040001800184072000900202072000900211100002500220245011600245300001600361500002400377500001500401506007600416520198700492506003702479650002302516650001602539650001902555650001102574650001802585650001702603650004302620650002302663650001202686650001202698650002702710650000902737650001802746650001702764650002202781650002602803650002502829650001202854650001602866650002902882650003702911650002702948650003702975650003703012650001903049650001803068650000903086650001203095650000903107650002103116650002103137653002603158653001503184700002103199700002003220773009803240856011203338856008003450930003303530945002503563946001103588961001303599852000903612655001203621IND4410028120221207143016.0080909s2001    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441002812DNAL7 a10.1155/EDR.2001.2172doi7 a123697102pmid7 aPMC24785512pmcid7 a10113/190962hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aVelasquez, Manuel T.10aLeptin and Its Relation to Obesity and Insulin in the SHR/N-corpulent Rat, A Model of Type II Diabetes Mellitus  ap. 217-223.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat is a genetic animal model that exhibits obesity, metabolic features of hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, which are characteristic of type II diabetes and mild hypertension. To determine the role of leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, in the development of obesity and diabetes in this model, we measured steady-state circulating levels of leptin in obese and lean SHR/N-cp rats and examined the relation between plasma leptin levels and metabolic variables at the stage of established obesity in these animals. Mean fasting plasma leptin concentration was 8-fold higher in obese than in lean rats (p<0.01). This was associated with a 6-fold elevation in plasma insulin in the obese group. Fasting levels of plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride were all significantly higher in obese rats than in lean controls. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between plasma leptin concentration and body weight among the animals (r=0.73, p<0.01). Similarly, plasma insulin concentration was significantly correlated with BW in all animals (r=0.54, p<0.05). There was also a significant positive.correlation between plasma leptin and plasma insulin in the entire group (r=0.70, p<0.01). However, this relationship was significant only for lean rats but not for obese rats (r=0.59, p<0.05 for lean rats, and r=0.23, p=NS, for obese rats). Plasma leptin also correlated positively with fasting plasma glucose (r=0.75, p<0.05), total cholesterol (r=0.63, p<0.05), and triglyceride (r=0.67, p <0.05). The marked elevation of plasma leptin in obese SHR/N-cp rats suggests that obesity in this animal model is related to up-regulation of the ob gene. Circulating leptin appears to be one of the best biological markers of obesity and that hyperleptinemia is closely associated with several metabolic risk factors related to insulin resistance in the diabesity syndrome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametabolic syndrome 3ablood serum 3ahyperlipidemia 3aleptin 3ablood glucose 3arisk factors 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3ainsulin 3ainheritance (genetics) 3arats 3ahyperglycemia 3aheritability 3aglucose tolerance 3aanimal disease models 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDiabetes Mellitusxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xblood 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHyperinsulinismxphysiopathology 2aHyperlipidemiasxphysiopathology 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aObesity 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred SHR 2aReference Values 0adiet-related diseases 0aoverweight1 aBhathena, Sam J.1 aHansen, Carl T.0 tInternational journal of experimental diabetes research.g2001, v.  2, no.  3 p.217-2237nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/190963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/EDR.2001.2173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/09/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100001900171245009400190300001600284500002400300520091300324650001601237650001301253650002301266650001401289650002101303650001201324650002201336650001201358650003101370650001901401650002001420650001901440650001701459650002501476650001501501700002001516700001601536773008401552852000901636856008101645856011201726930003301838945002501871946001301896961001301909655001201922IND4374420420221118044841.0050918s2005    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND437442042DNAL7 a10.1300/J411v13n01_072doi7 a10113/418782hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aPrasad, P.V.V.10aCrop responses to elevated carbon dioxide and interaction with temperature: grain legumes  ap. 113-155.  aIncludes references  aAtmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and other greenhouse gases have risen over the past few decades. If this continues, it could indirectly lead to increases in global temperature. Responses of grain legume crops (soybean, dry bean, peanut and cowpea) to elevated [CO2] and interactions with temperature are summarized. Our research shows that, in the absence of biotic (pests, diseases and weeds) or abiotic (temperature, water and nutrients) stresses, elevated [CO2] will increase yield due to increased photosynthesis and growth. However, at above optimum temperatures, the beneficial effects of elevated [CO2] are more than offset by negative effects of temperature on yield and yield-components, leading to lower seed yield and poor seed quality Future research should focus on developing genetic and agronomic crop management practices to improve crop productivity under changing climates. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3adry beans 3aArachis hypogaea 3apeanuts 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3acarbon dioxide 3aair temperature 3aphotosynthesis 3agas exchange 3awater use efficiency 3acrop yield1 aAllen, L.H.

An annual nutrient balance was used to determine P and K balances at varying spatial scales on a 128 ha mixed crop and dairy farm in a central Pennsylvania limestone valley for each of nine years. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) occupied 60% and 40% of the cropland, respectively. Inputs of P and K to the farm exceeded outputs over the study period. Net increases of P and a decrease in K were determined in the aggregate of all fields over the 9-yr period. The balance of P and K varied with time within a field, and by field within a year because nutrient inputs and removals varied with crop selection, management tactics, and year in the rotation. Recognizing that increases in field P are in proportion to P entering the farm can help reduce P accumulation in fields by addressing surpluses at their source or balancing managed flows for the farm. Conversely, decreases in field K associated with forage crops may be the reason for additional supplemental K inputs to the farm. Monitoring nutrient stocks (soil testing) and flows (input/output balances) at different scales in conjunction with spatial patterns of nutrient balances can be the foundation for integrating farm activities and information technologies in a new generation of performance enhancing tools. 3asoil nutrient balance 3asoil nutrients 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3ainput output analysis 3acrop production 3adairy farming 3afarms 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aMedicago sativa 3aPhleum pratense 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aagricultural soils 3aPennsylvania1 aLanyon, L.E.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 May, v.  69, no.  1 p.85-94x1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000025298.61906.ef3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/28  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04166naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190072000900199100002100208245010300229300001800332500002400350500001500374520194500389650002302334650002102357650001202378650001602390650001602406650001902422650001702441650001602458650001802474650001502492650002002507650001502527650001102542650001402553650002202567650001102589650002202600650001202622650004002634650005002674650002002724650002602744650003702770650001102807650002402818650001002842650000902852653002002861653001702881653001302898700001802911700002202929700001702951700001802968700001802986773010603004852000903110856008103119856011203200930003303312945002503345946001303370961001303383655001203396IND4407258120221118055651.0080627e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440725812DNAL7 a185776242pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2007-004862doi7 a10113/190752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL105 0aW0001 aOlanrewaju, H.A.10aInteractive Effects of Ammonia and Light Intensity on Hematochemical Variables in Broiler Chickens  ap. 1407-1414.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThis study examined the influence of early atmospheric ammonia exposure, light intensity throughout rearing, and their interaction on blood gases, electrolytes, and acid-base balance in broiler chickens under environmentally controlled conditions. The experiment consisted of a 3 x 3 factorial arranged in a randomized complete block design, with trials being replicated over time. The 9 treatments consisted of 3 levels (0, 25, and 50 ppm) of ammonia concentrations for 14 d and levels (0.2, 2.0, and 20 lx) of light intensities from 8 to 36 d of age. Venous blood samples were collected on d 6, 11, 14, and 35. On d 6, partial pressure of CO₂ and Na⁺ increased significantly (P <= 0.05), whereas partial pressure of O₂, pH, and K⁺ decreased with increasing ammonia concentration. As light intensity increased, pO₂ and K⁺ were significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced. Ammonia x light intensity interactions were observed for hemoglobin, hematocrit, K⁺, and BW. The interaction of ammonia and light intensity for 7 d further exacerbated physiological variables. The main effect of ammonia was more pronounced than that of light intensity. These conditions worsened as the duration of ammonia concentration exposure and light intensity increased from d 7 to 14 of exposure. However, all affected variables returned to near normal at later time points in the exposed chickens so that the apparent effects were lost. Plasma corticosterone and glucose concentrations were not significantly altered by exposure to differing levels of ammonia or light intensity, suggesting an absence of stress related to ammonia, light intensity, or their interaction. It was concluded that exposure of broiler chickens to aerial ammonia concentrations of 0 to 50 ppm from d 1 to 14 posthatch in the presence of light intensities ranging from 0.2 to 20 lx had no direct effect on some physiological blood variables and did not induce stress in broilers. 3atemporal variation 3abroiler chickens 3aammonia 3aair quality 3ablood gases 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrolytes 3abody weight 3aanimal stress 3ahemoglobin 3alight intensity 3ahematocrit 3asodium 3apotassium 3aacid-base balance 3aoxygen 2aAmmoniaxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxveterinary 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aChickensxblood 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aInhalation Exposure 2aLight 2aMale 0ablood chemistry 0afood animals 0ablood pH1 aThaxton, J.P.1 aDozier, W.A.

Root characteristics of 12 soybean cultivars, representing a range of SDS reactions, were evaluated and compared for disease responses. A method was developed to facilitate taproot or lateral root infection. Results show that this procedure may be useful for observing a continuum of foliar and root disease responses. Significant differences in root length, surface area, and average diameter were observed among cultivars when infection occurred at the taproot or on the lateral roots. A significant correlation existed between foliar symptoms (i.e., area under the disease progress curve [AUDPC]) and root length, surface area, and volume for inoculated plants. Root volume and percent root discoloration were significantly different among individual soybean cultivars, and percent root discoloration was associated with AUDPC values only when the initial site of infection was on the lateral roots of soybean plants. Useful information about root system responses to SDS may be obtained from infection of the entire root system as opposed to only taproot infection. 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3adisease course 3asurface area 3adiameter 3asoybeans 3afield crops 3atap roots 3aFusarium wilt 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3alength 3agenetic variation 3aFusarium solani 0aroot systems 0aFusarium solani f.sp. glycines1 aEastburn, D.M.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Sept., v.  88, no.  9 p.1011-1016wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.9.10113Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071220b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2004/12/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02768naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245008700202300001600289500002400305520126400329650000901593650001001602650001601612650002301628650001401651650001901665650002401684650001301708650002301721650001901744650002701763650002001790650003801810650002101848700001501869700001401884773007201898852000901970856008701979856011202066930003302178945002502211946001302236961001302249655001202262IND4371765520221122053139.0050625e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437176552DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2004.81.4.5272doi7 a10113/426292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ5041 aLenihan, E.10aRapid screening to identify unusual thermal starch traits from bulked corn kernels  ap. 527-532.  aIncludes references  aDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used routinely to screen for starch thermal properties. In early generations of line development, the established analysis separately evaluates starch extracted from five, single corn kernels. A thermal property trait carried by a recessive gene would appear 25% of the time; thus, if five separate kernels were evaluated, the likelihood of detecting an unusual thermal trait is high. The objective of the current work was to expedite selection by examining five kernels at a time, instead of one, hypothesizing that we would be able to detect different thermal properties in this blend. Corn lines, all from the same genetic background (ExSeed68 or Oh43), with known thermal functions (amylose-extender, dull, sugary-1, sugary-2, and waxy) were blended with normal starch (control) in ratios of 0:5, 1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1, and 5:0, and analyzed with DSC. The values for each ratio within a mutant type were unique (alpha < 0.01) for most DSC measurements, especially for gelatinization onset temperature, change in enthalpy of gelatinization, and range of gelatinization. These results support the five-kernel method for rapidly screening large amounts of corn germplasm to identify kernels with unusual starch traits. 3acorn 3aseeds 3acorn starch 3athermal properties 3acultivars 3abreeding lines 3agermplasm screening 3aenthalpy 3agelling properties 3agelatinization 3agermplasm conservation 3arecessive genes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aagronomic traits1 aDuvick, S.1 aWhite, P.0 tCereal chemistry.g2004 , v.  81, no.  4 p.527-532x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2004.81.4.5273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100703b20100807c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/07/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03452naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194072000900203072000900212100002300221245018400244300001600428500002400444520127500468650002001743650002201763650003001785650002401815650001701839650001601856650001901872650002301891650003201914650001701946650001901963650001601982650001601998650001202014650002502026650001102051650001602062650001402078650001002092650002602102650002902128650003002157650002302187650001202210650003502222651001002257653002602267700002102293700002202314700002202336773009602358852000902454856008502463856011202548930003302660945002502693946001102718961001302729655001202742IND4432707320221118044928.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443270732DNAL7 a200948792pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0641-72doi7 a10113/418892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aJaramillo, Juliana10aMolecular diagnosis of a previously unreported predator-prey association in coffee: Karnyothrips flavipes Jones (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) predation on the coffee berry borer  ap. 291-298.  aIncludes references  aThe coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei, is the most important pest of coffee throughout the world, causing losses estimated at US $500 million/year. The thrips Karnyothrips flavipes was observed for the first time feeding on immature stages of H. hampei in April 2008 from samples collected in the Kisii area of Western Kenya. Since the trophic interactions between H. hampei and K. flavipes are carried out entirely within the coffee berry, and because thrips feed by liquid ingestion, we used molecular gut-content analysis to confirm the potential role of K. flavipes as a predator of H. hampei in an organic coffee production system. Species-specific COI primers designed for H. hampei were shown to have a high degree of specificity for H. hampei DNA and did not produce any PCR product from DNA templates of the other insects associated with the coffee agroecosystems. In total, 3,327 K. flavipes emerged from 17,792 H. hampei-infested berries collected from the field between April and September 2008. Throughout the season, 8.3% of K. flavipes tested positive for H. hampei DNA, although at times this figure approached 50%. Prey availability was significantly correlated with prey consumption, thus indicating the potential impact on H. hampei populations. 3aPhlaeothripidae 3apredatory insects 3abiological control agents 3aHypothenemus hampei 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3apredator-prey relationships 3acoffee beans 3aCoffea arabica 3aDNA primers 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCoffeaxparasitology 2aCoffee 2aDNA Primers 2aEcosystem 2aFruit 2aPest Controlxmethods 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSeasons 2aWeevilsxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aKenya 0aKarnyothrips flavipes1 aChapman, Eric G.1 aVega, Fernando E.1 aHarwood, James D.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2010 Mar., v.  97, no.  3 p.291-298dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0641-73Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100602b20100703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/06/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03226naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201100001300210245008100223300001600304500002400320500001500344520127000359650004801629650002201677650002101699650001601720650002801736650002701764650001801791650002701809650003101836650004801867650005001915650001701965650003101982650004202013650003002055650004302085650002502128653002502153653001302178653001402191700001802205773011802223852000902341856011202350856009202462930003302554945002502587946001102612961001302623655001202636IND4424225220221122095338.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442422522DNAL7 a196220762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02676.x2doi7 a10113/426302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aPaul, M.10aDegradation of milk-based bioactive peptides by yogurt fermentation bacteria  ap. 345-350.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo analyse the effect of cell-associated peptidases in yogurt starter culture strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) on milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides in order to determine their survival in yogurt-type dairy foods. The 11mer antimicrobial and 12mer hypotensive milk-protein-derived peptides were incubated with mid-log cells of LB and ST, which are required for yogurt production. Incubations were performed at pH 4·5 and 7·0, and samples removed at various time points were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptides remained mostly intact at pH 4·5 in the presence of ST strains and moderately digested by exposure to LB cells. Peptide loss occurred more rapidly and was more extensive after incubation at pH 7·0. The 11mer and 12mer bioactive peptides may be added at the end of the yogurt-making process when the pH level has dropped to 4·5, limiting the overall extent of proteolysis. The results show the feasibility of using milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides as food supplements to improve the health-promoting qualities of liquid and semi-solid dairy foods prepared by the yogurt fermentation process. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aprotein synthesis 3ahealth promotion 3aproteolysis 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantimicrobial peptides 3afrozen yogurt 3acultured milk starters 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxmetabolism 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactobacillus delbrueckiixmetabolism 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aStreptococcus thermophilusxmetabolism 2aYogurtxmicrobiology 0ahypotensive peptides 0apeptides 0aisolation1 aSomkuti, G.A.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Sept., v.  49, no.  3 p.345-350dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02676.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100703b20100807c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/07/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02917naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001900189245007800208300001600286500002400302500001500326520159500341650001801936650002001954650002201974653003101996653002702027700001802054700001502072700002302087773008702110856008102197856011202278930003302390945002502423946001302448961001302461852000902474655001202483IND4438941520221119155102.0100622e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443894152DNAL7 a10.1175/2008JHM1038.12doi7 a10113/426032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aX100 0aX6201 aRyu, Dongryeol10aCorrecting Unintended Perturbation Biases in Hydrologic Data Assimilation  ap. 734-750.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHydrologic data assimilation has become an important tool for improving hydrologic model predictions by using observations from ground, aircraft, and satellite sensors. Among existing data assimilation methods, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) provides a robust framework for optimally updating nonlinear model predictions using observations. In the EnKF, background prediction uncertainty is obtained using a Monte Carlo approach where state variables, parameters, and forcing data for the model are synthetically perturbed to explicitly simulate the error-prone representation of hydrologic processes in the model. However, it is shown here that, owing to the nonlinear nature of these processes, an ensemble of model forecasts perturbed by mean-zero Gaussian noise can produce biased background predictions. This ensemble perturbation bias in soil moisture states can lead to significant mass balance errors and degrade the performance of the EnKF analysis in deeper soil layers. Here, a simple method of bias correction is introduced in which such perturbation bias is corrected using an unperturbed model simulation run in parallel with the EnKF analysis. The proposed bias-correction scheme effectively removes biases in soil moisture and reduces soil water mass balance errors. The performance of the EnKF is improved in deeper layers when the filter is applied with the bias-correction scheme. The interplay of nonlinear hydrologic processes is discussed in the context of perturbation biases, and implications of the bias correction for real-data assimilation cases are presented. 3adata analysis 3ahydrologic data 3ahydrologic models 0amathematics and statistics 0aensemble Kalman filter1 aCrow, Wade T.1 aZhan, Xiwu1 aJackson, Thomas J.0 tJournal of hydrometeorology.g2009 June, v.  10, no.  3 p.734-750x1525-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JHM1038.13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174100001900192245013700211300001600348500001500364520179800379592002802177650002202205650001202227650002002239650001002259650001902269650001002288650002802298650001302326650001602339650001802355650002802373650002002401650002602421650001102447650002202458650001802480650001602498650001102514650001402525650001102539650002202550650001202572650002302584650002302607650004802630650004602678650001402724650005602738650002802794650002502822650002802847650004302875653004302918700002202961700001802983700002003001700001903021700002203040700001903062773009703081852000903178856005503187856011203242655001203354IND4434816920221118045046.0120921e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443481692DNAL7 a200705662pmid7 a10113/418602hdl7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04128.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTieman, Denise10aFunctional analysis of a tomato salicylic acid methyl transferase and its role in synthesis of the flavor volatile methyl salicylate  ap. 113-123.  a2019-12-06  aMethyl salicylate (MeSA) is a volatile plant secondary metabolite that is an important contributor to taste and scent of many fruits and flowers. It is synthesized from salicylic acid (SA), a phytohormone that contributes to plant pathogen defense. MeSA is synthesized by members of a family of O‐methyltransferases. In order to elaborate the mechanism of MeSA synthesis in tomato, we screened a set of O‐methyltransferases for activity against multiple substrates. An enzyme that specifically catalyzes methylation of SA, SlSAMT, as well as enzymes that act upon jasmonic acid and indole‐3‐acetic acid were identified. Analyses of transgenic over‐ and under‐producing lines validated the function of SlSAMT in vivo. The SlSAMT gene was mapped to a position near the bottom of chromosome 9. Analysis of MeSA emissions from an introgression population derived from a cross with Solanum pennellii revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) linked to higher fruit methyl salicylate emissions. The higher MeSA emissions associate with significantly higher SpSAMT expression, consistent with SAMT gene expression being rate limiting for ripening‐associated MeSA emissions. Transgenic plants that constitutively over‐produce MeSA exhibited only slightly delayed symptom development following infection with the disease‐causing bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv). Unexpectedly, pathogen‐challenged leaves accumulated significantly higher levels of SA as well as glycosylated forms of SA and MeSA, indicating a disruption in control of the SA‐related metabolite pool. Taken together, the results indicate that SlSAMT is critical for methyl salicylate synthesis and methyl salicylate, in turn, likely has an important role in controlling SA synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum pennellii 3aenzymes 3aplant pathogens 3agenes 3asalicylic acid 3aodors 3aquantitative trait loci 3atomatoes 3amethylation 3ajasmonic acid 3aXanthomonas vesicatoria 3agene expression 3asecondary metabolites 3aleaves 3amethyl salicylate 3aintrogression 3achromosomes 3aflavor 3aemissions 3afruits 3atransgenic plants 3aflowers 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism 0aXanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria1 aZeigler, Michelle1 aSchmelz, Eric1 aTaylor, Mark G.1 aRushing, Sarah1 aJones, Jeffrey B.1 aKlee, Harry J.0 tplant journal.g2010 Apr., v. 62, no. 1 p.113-123dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04128.x40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system 7aarticle02995naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002000133040001800153100001800171245010200189300001600291500002400307506007600331520138000407506003701787650001401824650001601838650002301854650001801877650003001895650002601925650002801951650002301979650001502002650002502017650001502042650003002057650002102087650002102108651001202129700001702141700001602158700001702174773008202191852000902273856011102282930003302393945001302426946001302439961001302452655001202465IND2200243420221207142543.0990823e199809  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220024342DNAL7 a192742282pmid7 aPMC26203042pmcid7 a10113/76562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, A.W.10aCrop yields and nematode population densities in triticale-cotton and triticale-soybean rotations  ap. 353-361.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTriticale cv. Beagle 82, cotton cv. McNair 235, and soybean cv.

The cropping sequences were triticale (T)-cotton (C)-T-C, T-soybean (S)-T-S, and T-C-T-S. Numbers of Meloidogyne incognita second-stage juveniles declined on triticale but increased on cotton and soybean each year. Root-gall indices of cotton and soybean ranged from 1.00 to 1.08 (1 to 5 scale: 1 = 0%, 2 = 1% to 25%, 3 = 26% to 50%, 4 = 51% to 75%, 5 = 76% to 100% of roots galled) each year and were not affected by fenamiphos treatment or cropping sequence. Numbers of Pratylenchus brachyurus were maintained on triticale and generally increased more on soybean than on cotton. Population densities of Helicotylenchus dihystera wee near or below detection levels in all plots during the first year and increased thereafter in untreated plots in the T-C-T-C and T-S-T-S sequences. Generally, yields of triticale in all cropping sequences declined over the years. Yields of cotton and soybean were not affected by fenamiphos at 6.7 kg a.i./ha. Cotton and soybean were grown successfully with little or no suppression in yields caused by nematodes in conservation tillage following triticale harvested for grain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atriticale 3aGlycine max 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acrop rotation 3aHelicotylenchus dihystera 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPratylenchus brachyurus 3apopulation density 3afenamiphos 3aconservation tillage 3acrop yield 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3anematode control 3acultural control 3aGeorgia1 aDowler, C.C.1 aBaker, S.H.1 aHandoo, Z.A.0 tJournal of nematology.g1998 Sept., v.  30, no.  3 p.353-361x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071207b20080102c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03079naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002000127040001800147072000900165100001800174245007700192300001400269500002400283500001500307520146100322650001901783650002101802650002701823650002301850650000901873650001701882650002401899650002001923650001501943650002301958650001201981650001801993653002002011653002002031653001902051653002602070653002102096700001702117700002002134773009402154852000902248856011102257856008502368930003302453945002502486946001102511961001502522655001202537IND4390780320221121215621.0070502e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439078032DNAL7 a10.1080/096708706010588902doi7 a10113/41872hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8201 aSeamans, T.W.10aEvaluation of two perch deterrents for starlings, blackbirds and pigeons  ap. 45-51.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBird-aircraft collisions are costly and potentially deadly to people and wildlife. From 1990 through 2004, 57 702 bird collisions with aircraft were reported within the USA to the US Federal Aviation Administration. Approximately 82% of the strikes occur below 305 m height above ground level; therefore bird deterrents on airfields that reduce the quality of the birds' habitat are critical to safe airport operation. One management approach is to reduce perching sites within the airport premises. We tested two anti-perching devices (Birdwire[registered trademark]; and BirdBlox[registered trademark];) in an aviary setting. As an ancillary test, we determined which wire in a standard three-strand security array was preferred by blackbirds and starlings. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were deterred from sitting on a perch when anti-perching wire was installed 5 cm above the perch. These same species preferred the top wire of the three-wire security array. Red-winged blackbirds, common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), brown-headed cowbirds, European starlings, and rock pigeons (Columba livia) were deterred from perches protected by BirdBlox[registered trademark];. Because our tests were conducted in a captive situation, we recommend field testing the products to determine if bird use of airport structures may be reduced in an operational setting. 3aMolothrus ater 3aSturnus vulgaris 3apest control equipment 3aQuiscalus quiscula 3awire 3abird control 3aAgelaius phoeniceus 3acontrol methods 3awild birds 3aanimal preferences 3apigeons 3aColumba livia 0aanimal behavior 0aperch exclusion 0aperching sites 0aanti-perching devices 0aperch preference1 aBarras, S.C.1 aBernhardt, G.E.0 tInternational journal of pest management.g2007 , v.  53, no.  1 p.45-51x0967-08747nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/41873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096708706010588903Available from publisher's Web site  a20071004b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/08  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02223naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245011300156300001800269500002400287500001500311520115400326650001801480653002701498653002501525700002001550700001901570773009301589852000901682856011201691930003301803945001301836946001101849961001301860655001201873IND2323681620221118045007.0011025e200109  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232368162DNAL7 a10113/418702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aSlack, J.M.12aA study of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus ODV envelope protein p74 using a GFP tag  ap. 2279-2287.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) protein p74 is associated with the occlusion-derived virus (ODV) envelope. p74 is essential for oral infectivity of ODV and has been proposed to play a role in midgut attachment and/or fusion. In this study, p74 protein was expressed in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to create a p74-GFP chimera. The C-terminal GFP portion of the chimera facilitated visualization of the trafficking of p74 in baculovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. p74-GFP chimeric proteins localized in the intranuclear ring zone of the nucleus and were found to co-precipitate with the microvesicle fraction of cell lysates. A series of truncations of p74 was expressed as p74-GFP chimeras in recombinant baculoviruses. When C-terminal region S580-F645 was deleted from p74, p74-GFP chimera localization became non-specific and chimeras became soluble. p74 region S580-F645 directed GFP to the intranuclear ring zone in a similar pattern to full-length p74. The hydrophobic C terminus of p74 plays a role in protein localization and possibly in transmembrane anchoring and insertion. 3aBaculoviridae 0aenvelope glycoproteins 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aDougherty, E.M.1 aLawrence, S.D.0 tJournal of general virology.g2001 Sept., v.  82, no.  pt.9 p.2279-2287x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02569naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245010300205300001800308500002400326520105900350650005701409650002601466650001101492650001601503650001201519650003501531650001401566650001101580650002001591650001101611650001701622653002201639653003001661700001901691773008101710852000901791856011201800856008101912930003301993945002502026946001102051961001302062655001202075IND4372103420221118044919.0050708e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437210342DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.80832-02doi7 a10113/418712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL833 0aL0011 aSlack, J.M.10aEvidence for proteolytic cleavage of the baculovirus occlusion-derived virion envelope protein P74  ap. 1637-1643.  aIncludes references  aBaculovirus occlusion-derived virions (ODVs) are released from occlusion bodies by the alkaline environment of the insect midgut. The ODV envelope protein P74 is required for oral infectivity. A soluble form of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus P74 protein, P74sol, was engineered as part of a chimeric protein with jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP). P74sol-GFP was overproduced by the baculovirus expression system and purified away from the wild-type P74. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) were prepared from the midguts of third-instar Helicoverpa zea larvae. When P74sol-GFP was incubated under alkaline conditions with BBMVs, a P74sol-GFP product with a smaller molecular mass was produced. Immunoblots indicated that the smaller product was generated by N-terminal cleavage of P74. This cleavage was prevented by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Analysis of the peptide sequences of P74 homologues identified a conserved trypsin cleavage site that could generate the observed P74sol-GFP BBMV-specific cleavage product. 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aviral fusion proteins 3avirion 3aproteolysis 3atrypsin 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3ainfection 3amidgut 3aHelicoverpa zea 3alarvae 3ainsect pests 0aenvelope proteins 0aocclusion-derived virions1 aLawrence, S.D.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 June, v.  86 p.1637-1643x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418713Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.80832-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04140naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131024002100172040001800193072000900211100001600220245009500236300001800331500002400349506007600373520174100449506003702190650004302227650004602270650002102316650002102337650002702358650002602385650002102411650001902432650002302451650001402474650003502488650001802523650001202541650003902553650005002592650004802642650002502690650004202715650002302757650002702780650003102807650002402838650004202862650004702904650005002951653001303001653001503014700001503029700001403044773010003058852000903158856009103167856011203258930003303370945001303403946001303416961001303429655001203442IND2321994320221207095033.0010712e200103  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232199432DNAL7 a112298952pmid7 aPMC926982pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.67.3.1085-1089.20012doi7 a10113/129192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aHerrero, S.10aDifferent mechanisms of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins in the indianmeal moth  ap. 1085-1089.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSusceptibility to protoxin and toxin forms of Cry1Ab and the binding of 125I-labeled Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac has been examined in three Plodia interpunctella colonies, one susceptible (688s) and two resistant (198r and Dpl(r)) to Bacillus thuringiensis. Toxicological studies showed that the 198r colony was 11-fold more resistant to Cry1Ab protoxin than to Cry1Ab activated toxin, whereas the Dpl(r) colony was 4-fold more resistant to protoxin versus toxin. Binding results with 125I-labeled toxins indicated the occurrence of two different binding sites for Cry1Ab in the susceptible insects, one of them shared with Cry1Ac. Cry1Ab binding was found to be altered in insects from both resistant colonies, though in different ways. Compared with the susceptible colony, insects from the Dpl(r) colony showed a drastic reduction in binding affinity (60-fold higher K(d)), although they had similar concentrations of binding sites. Insects from the 198r colony showed a slight reduction in both binding affinity and binding site concentration (five-fold-higher K(d) and ca. three-fold-lower R(t) compared with the 688s colony). No major difference in Cry1Ac binding was found among the three colonies. The fact that the 198r colony also has a protease-mediated mechanism of resistance (B. Oppert, R. Hammel, J. E. Throne, and K. J. Kramer, J. Biol. Chem. 272:23473-23476, 1997) is in agreement with our toxicological data in which this colony has a different susceptibility to the protoxin and toxin forms of Cry1Ab. It is noteworthy that the three colonies used in this work derived originally from ca. 100 insects, which reflects the high variability and high frequency of B. thuringiensis resistance genes occurring in natural populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. entomocidus 3abacterial toxins 3acrystal proteins 3ainsecticide resistance 3aPlodia interpunctella 3adigestive system 3acell membranes 3astrain differences 3abioassays 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBinding, Competitive 2aEndotoxinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMicrovillixdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMothsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0acolonies 0aprecursors1 aOppert, B.1 aFerre, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2001 Mar., v.  67, no.  3 p.1085-1089x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.67.3.1085-1089.20013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/129193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090223b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02552naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002200193245015100215300001600366500002400382500001500406520078800421650001001209650002001219650002001239650001901259650001301278650001601291650001501307650001501322650002301337650001201360650002201372650001701394650001601411650002301427650001301450651001201463651001001475651001201485653001601497700001801513700002101531700002501552773008301577856011201660856008501772930003301857945002501890946001301915961001301928852000901941655001201950IND4438964320221119153329.0100624e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443896432DNAL7 a10.1080/016479504086843762doi7 a10113/425872hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL831 0aL0011 aBenoit, Joshua B.10aMycoflora and fungal vector capacity of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) in honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies  ap. 103-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFemale adults of the honey bee mite, Varroa destructor, have fungi on their surfaces, and have the potential to disperse fungal spores (conidia) throughout the bee colony.

These fungi have no biological control implications (i.e., entomopathogenic) because none were recovered internally within the mites; absence of fungi internally also implies that this mite is not a fungivore. Our isolation of Aspergillus flavus, agent of stonebrood disease in honey bees, implicates Varroa as a potential fungal vector of stonebrood disease. 3aMucor 3aparasitic mites 3adisease vectors 3aApis mellifera 3aRhizopus 3aTrichoderma 3aAlternaria 3ahoney bees 3ahoney bee colonies 3amycoses 3aVarroa destructor 3abee diseases 3aPenicillium 3aAspergillus flavus 3aFusarium 3aArizona 3aMaine 3aFlorida 0aAspergillus1 aYoder, Jay A.1 aSammataro, Diana1 aZettler, Lawrence W.0 tInternational journal of acarology.g2004 June, v.  30, no.  2 p.103-1067nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016479504086843763Available from publisher's Web site  a20110927b20111007c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/07/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002100158245008400179300001400263500002400277520094400301650002601245650002301271650001901294650001301313650001201326650001101338650001901349650002601368650001901394650003001413650002501443653002801468700001701496700001901513773007401532852000901606856011201615930003301727945002501760946001301785961001301798655001201811IND4438966820221119200124.0100624e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443896682DNAL7 a10113/425912hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF200 0aM0011 aMadeira, Paul T.13aAn Improved Molecular Tool for Distinguishing Monoecious and Dioecious Hydrilla  ap. 28-32.  aIncludes references  aTwo biotypes of hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle] occur in the United States, a dioecious type centered in the southeast and a monoecious type in the central Atlantic and northeastern states. Ecosystem managers need tools to distinguish the types as the ranges of each type expand and begin to overlap. A molecular tool using the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) procedure is available but its use is limited by a need for reference samples. We describe an alternative molecular tool which uses "universal primers" to sequence the trnL intron and trnL-F intergenic spacer of the chloroplast genome. This sequence yields three differences between the biotypes (two gaps and one single nucleotide polymorphism). A primer has been designed which ends in a gap that shows up only in the dioecious plant. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using this primer produces a product for the monoecious but not the dioecious plant. 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aintroduced species 3aaquatic plants 3abiotypes 3amonoecy 3adioecy 3aplant genetics 3amolecular systematics 3aplant taxonomy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aVan, Thai K.1 aCenter, Ted D.0 tJournal of aquatic plant management.g2004 Jan., v.  42 p.28-327nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/07/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03444naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245005800156300001600214500002400230500001500254520225500269650001302524650002302537650001602560650002002576650001402596650001402610650001002624650002102634653003102655653001902686700001802705773009402723852000902817856011202826930003302938945002502971946001302996961001303009655001203022IND4369297320221118045043.0050427e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436929732DNAL7 a10113/418402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aBonta, J.V.10aDesign, measurement, and sampling with drop-box weirs  ap. 689-700.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRangelands, surface mines, construction sites, unprotected and long slopes, gullies, eroding stream channels, and erosion plots will yield large sediment loads under high intensity rainfalls. Conventional flow-measuring devices can easily become clogged with sediment and debris during a major runoff event, resulting in the loss of runoff and sediment records. Flow measurements can also be inaccurate using conventional flow-measuring devices in steep channels. The drop-box weir (DBW) was developed to overcome many of the problems encountered in sediment-laden flow measurement. The weir creates turbulence in a box that entrains and passes sediment through the weir. It is not a well-known device, and it has not been widely used. Yet it is only one of two devices suitable for obtaining flow records with large sediment concentrations. It has utility for a range of watershed sizes from small erosion plots to large watersheds. Information on what is known about the design and operation of the DBW, and of sediment sampling approaches using the DBW, was compiled. Weir sizing, rating-curve development, and sampling strategies were presented to facilitate its use and to identify its limitations. There are four known configurations of the DBW: the original weir with upper weir lips; a modification of the DBW for erosion plots (removal of upper weir lips); a modification of the DBW for small watersheds in steep and skewed channels (removal of upper weir lips and use of baffle); and a Korean version of the weir (larger chute opening to minimize blockage of trash – suitable for large and small watersheds). For each of the four configurations, rating tables and weir-sizing guidelines were summarized. Low-flow rating curves must be developed from field data for individual weirs, but laboratory curves can be used for larger flow rates. Curve-fitting procedures are outlined specifically for determining rating-curve equations where field data are obtained. Water samplers designed specifically for use with DBWs are described. Other design considerations are discussed for practical use of DBWs including measurement of stage, maintenance, and sediment traps. Research needs for hydraulic modeling and sediment sampling are presented. 3asampling 3asediment transport 3astream flow 3ahydrologic data 3aequipment 3aequations 3aweirs 3aequipment design 0amathematics and statistics 0adrop-box weirs1 aPierson, F.B.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2003 Nov., v.  19, no.  6 p.689-700x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02464naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001100140245010900151300001800260500002400278520120000302650002301502650002101525650001801546650001801564650001601582650001401598650001001612650002101622700001301643700001301656700001501669700002201684700001601706700001801722773007301740852000901813856011201822930003301934945002501967946001301992961001302005655001202018IND4374631120221118055747.0050923e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437463112DNAL7 a10113/190402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aQu, L.10aCommercial seed lots exhibit reduced seed dormancy in comparison to wild seed lots of Echinacea purpurea  ap. 1843-1845.  aIncludes references  aSeed germination patterns were studied in Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench grouped by seed source, one group of seven lots from commercially cultivated populations and a second group of nine lots regenerated from ex situ conserved wild populations. Germination tests were conducted in a growth chamber in light (40 micromol.m(-2).s(-1)) or darkness at 25 degrees C for 20 days after soaking the seeds in water for 10 minutes. Except for two seed lots from wild populations, better germination was observed for commercially cultivated populations in light (90% mean among seed lots, ranging from 82% to 95%) and in darkness (88% mean among seed lots, ranging from 82% to 97%) than for wild populations in light (56% mean among seed lots, ranging from 9% to 92%) or in darkness (37% mean among seed lots, ranging from 4% to 78%). No germination difference was measured between treatments in light and darkness in the commercially cultivated populations, but significant differences were noted for treatments among wild populations. These results suggest that repeated cycles of sowing seeds during cultivation without treatments for dormancy release resulted in reduced seed dormancy in E. purpurea. 3aEchinacea purpurea 3amedicinal plants 3aseed dormancy 3aplanting seed 3awild plants 3acultivars 3alight 3aseed germination1 aWang, X.1 aChen, Y.1 aScalzo, R.1 aWidrlechner, M.P.1 aDavis, J.M.1 aHancock, J.F.0 tHortScience.g2005 Oct., v.  40, no.  6 p.1843-1845x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/190403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02760naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001500157245010600172300001600278500002400294520124900318650001601567650001901583650001901602650001101621650002001632650002701652650001801679650001101697650001301708650001101721650001501732650001501747650001401762650001001776653002501786653001501811653001701826700001701843773009801860852000901958856011101967856006802078930003302146945002502179946001302204961001302217655001202230IND4395980520221120082546.0071010s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439598052DNAL7 a10113/83562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF110 0aF6001 aBlom, P.E.10aRapid and nondestructive estimation of leaf area on field-grown concord (Vitis labruscana) grapevines  ap. 393-397.  aIncludes references  aThree potential variables, shoot basal diameter, leaf count per shoot, and shoot length, were examined as potential rapid, nondestructive methods for estimating leaf area per shoot, a frequent component of estimates of leaf area per vine. The metrics were recorded in large field-grown vines over five years. Shoot basal diameter, the most rapid method, was not a good predictor of leaf area per shoot. After transformation, shoot length and leaf count per shoot had relatively tight linear relationships with the square root of leaf area per shoot (R2 = 0.90 and R2 = 0.85, respectively). Some of the variation in the relationships due to between-year and within-season variability can be reduced by expressing the relationships as a function of thermal time. Furthermore, nonlinear models can be fit to the ratio of leaf area per shoot to the rapidly obtained metrics. Using this ratio approach accounts for the dynamics of canopy development and should increase the accuracy of leaf area estimates during early-season rapid shoot growth. Early in the season the length and count measurements can be made at ∼0.5 min per shoot, but as the canopy develops and shoots intertwine, the sampling rate progressively slows to ∼2.5 min per shoot. 3aviticulture 3aVitis labrusca 3awine cultivars 3afields 3aleaf area index 3anondestructive methods 3arapid methods 3ashoots 3adiameter 3alength 3aprediction 3atree crown 3avineyards 3avines 0ashoot basal diameter 0aleaf count 0ashoot length1 aTarara, J.M.0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2007, v.  58, no.  3 p.393-397x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/10/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03748naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245018000202300001600382500002400398500001500422520183400437650001302271650001702284650002402301650001802325650002702343650001802370650001702388650001802405650001802423650001402441650002502455650002302480650001602503650001602519650002902535650001502564650001602579653001302595653002702608653002702635700001902662700002002681700001502701700001802716773011002734852000902844856011202853856008702965930003303052945002503085946001103110961001303121655001203134IND4438924920221119200344.0100622e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443892492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2003.12.0012doi7 a10113/425972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aOkamura, M.10aCell-mediated immune responses to a killed Salmonella enteritidis vaccine: lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell changes and interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1, IL-2, and IFN-γ production  ap. 255-272.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo experimental approaches were used to investigate the immunological responses of chickens to a commercial killed Salmonella enteritidis (SE) vaccine. In the first, the effects of host age on antigen-specific proliferative responses and cytokine production were examined. Compared with non-vaccinated controls, 4-wk-old vaccinated chickens showed higher proliferation to SE LPS and flagella. The lymphoproliferation responses to these antigens of 8-mo-old vaccinated chickens were not different compared to the non-vaccinated controls. Increased production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) by antigen-stimulated splenocytes following vaccination were, in general, more often observed in 4-wk-old compared with 8-mo-old chickens, whereas serum levels of these cytokines were consistently higher in the vaccinated birds compared with controls regardless of age. The second set of experiments were designed to determine the effects of SE vaccination on mitogen- or antigen-induced splenocyte proliferation and serum nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine levels. Splenocytes from vaccinated chickens stimulated with SE flagella showed significantly increased numbers of TCRγδ+ cells at 7 days post-vaccination compared with non-vaccinated birds. In contrast, no differences were noted with CD4+, CD8+, or TCRαβ+ cells at any time points examined. Higher levels of NO production were observed following stimulation with SE flagella at 4, 7, 11, and 14 days after SE vaccination while serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 were elevated only at day 7 post-vaccination. In conclusion, younger chickens mounted a more robust antigen-specific immune response to the SE vaccine compared with older birds and vaccination induced not only T-cell-mediated responses but also host innate and pro-inflammatory responses. 3achickens 3abiosynthesis 3alipopolysaccharides 3ainterleukin-1 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aT-lymphocytes 3anitric oxide 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-2 3aflagellum 3ainactivated vaccines 3abacterial antigens 3asplenocytes 3avaccination 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aanimal age 3ainterferons 0avaccines 0acell-mediated immunity 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aLillehoj, H.S.1 aRaybourne, R.B.1 aBabu, U.S.1 aHeckert, R.A.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2004 July, v.  27, no.  4 p.255-2727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2003.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02766naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100002000184245007400204300001600278500002400294500001500318520121000333650001601543650001501559650001101574650001501585650001601600650001501616650001901631650002401650650002401674650001501698651001501713653001901728653003701747653004301784700001801827700002301845773009001868856011201958856008502070930003302155945002502188946001302213961001302226852000902239655001202248IND4438931820221119153225.0100622e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443893182DNAL7 a10.1109/LGRS.2008.20027542doi7 a10113/425992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX6201 aBindlish, Rajat10aRole of Passive Microwave Remote Sensing in Improving Flood Forecasts  ap. 112-116.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAccurate information concerning antecedent soil moisture conditions is a key source of hydrologic forecasting skill for regional-scale flooding events occurring over time scales of days to weeks. Remotely sensed surface soil moisture observations are a viable source of such information and can potentially improve flood peak timing and magnitude forecasting in such events. C- and X-band brightness temperature data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite are used here to demonstrate the potential for improving streamflow forecasts by using remotely sensed surface soil moisture during a flooding event in northeastern Australia (Queensland) during January-February 2004. An analysis of AMSR-E brightness temperature imagery reveals a clear anomaly of low AMSR-E brightness temperatures (i.e., high soil moisture conditions) over the affected areas in the four- to five-day period preceding peak streamflow conditions. Land surface conditions are a remotely detectable precursor to subsequent downstream flooding. Use of a simple adaptive model demonstrates that AMSR-E passive microwave observations can add skill to streamflow forecasts during the event. 3astream flow 3aradiometry 3afloods 3awatersheds 3aradiometers 3asoil water 3aremote sensing 3awatershed hydrology 3amicrowave radiation 3aprediction 3aQueensland 0asurface layers 0apassive microwave remote sensing 0aAdvanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer1 aCrow, Wade T.1 aJackson, Thomas J.0 tIEEE Geoscience and remote sensing letters.g2009 Jan., v.  6, no.  1 p.112-1167nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2008.20027543Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171100001800180245007200198300001400270500002400284520097600308650002101284650001901305650002101324650001301345650001501358650002301373650002201396650001201418650001401430650001401444650001101458650000901469650001401478653001701492700001401509700001601523700001601539700001501555773008701570852000901657856008101666856011201747930003301859945002501892946001301917961001301930655001201943IND4364826720221118045007.0041006s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436482672DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v24n01_042doi7 a10113/418472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ5001 aSistani, K.R.10aSeasonal and management impact on broiler cake nutrient composition  ap. 27-37.  aIncludes references  aBroiler "cake," which is the by-product of broiler manure management practice, is directly applied to pasture or crop lands. We studied the impact of season and broiler producers' management on broiler cake nutrient content from three commercial broiler producers. Broiler cake pH ranged from 7.0 in the summer to 8.3 in the winter among all producers. The cake total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) were significantly impacted by season for all producers. Total N ranged from 34.8 in the spring to 43.6 g kg(-1) in the winter while TP ranged from 16.96 in the winter to 19.80 g kg(-1) in the spring. Broiler cake NH4-N content ranged from 5.78 to 15.5% of the TN for all seasons and producers. Broiler cake generated in the spring and summer contained more Ca, Mg, K, Cu, Fe, and Mn than in the fall and winter. The results provide on-farm site specific information that may help producers and nutrient planners in relation to broiler cake application rate and timing. 3abroiler chickens 3apoultry manure 3anutrient content 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aseasonal variation 3aammonium nitrogen 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3acopper 3airon 3amanganese 0abroiler cake1 aAdeli, A.1 aBrink, G.E.1 aTewolde, H.1 aRowe, D.E.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2004, v.  24, no.  1 p.27-37x1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v24n01_043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04274naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002000141040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197100002000206245008400226300001800310500002400328500001500352520223600367650002002603650001802623650002202641650001602663650001402679650001302693650001402706650001602720650002002736650001902756650002302775650001002798650001802808650003002826650001902856650001202875650002102887650002102908650002202929650001302951650001102964650000902975650001702984650001603001653001303017653001003030653002703040653001603067700001703083700001703100700001603117700001603133773010703149852000903256856008003265856011103345930003303456945002503489946001303514961001303527655001203540IND4394282420221121184913.0070819e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439428242DNAL7 a177043682pmid7 a10.1093/ps/86.9.18312doi7 a10113/83352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL840 0aL3001 aGustafson, L.A.14aThe Effects of Different Bill-Trimming Methods on the Well-Being of Pekin Ducks  ap. 1831-1839.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPekin ducks are often bill-trimmed to prevent feather pecking and cannibalism, but this practice has been criticized because of the resulting potential for acute and chronic pain. The goal of this experiment was to compare 2 different bill-trimming methods, hot blade trimming with cautery (TRIM) and cautery only (tip-searing; SEAR), on the behavior, bill morphology, and weight gain of Pekin ducks. Ducklings (n = 192, 96 per sex) were trimmed at the hatchery and assigned to 12 floor pens (3.66 x0.91 m) by treatment. Behavior was evaluated by scan sampling, and plumage condition was scored using a 0 to 3 scoring system. Thirty-six ducks were randomly euthanized at 3 and 6 wk of age, and their bills were collected for examination. Following fixation and decalcification, the bills were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned longitudinally. Alternate sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome for the connective tissues, and with Bielschowsky's silver impregnation, Bodian's staining, and Holmes' staining for the nerve fibers. Trimmed ducks engaged in fewer bill-related behaviors and rested more than untrimmed ducks (NOTRIM) during the first 2 wk posttrim. Ducks in the SEAR and NOTRIM groups showed similar patterns of weight gain, but those in the TRIM group had a lower rate of gain than ducks in the SEAR group during the first week posttrim and had a lower rate of gain than those in the NOTRIM group for 2 wk posttrim. Feather scores of ducks in the NOTRIM group were significantly worse than those in the TRIM or SEAR group by 18 d, and scores continued to deteriorate at a greater rate than those of trimmed ducks throughout the study. Both trimming methods caused connective tissue proliferation in the bill stumps, but the TRIM method caused thicker scar tissue than the SEAR method. No neuromas were found with either trimming method, but there were more nerve fibers in bill stumps of the SEAR ducks than the TRIM ducks. These results suggest that acute pain is associated with both trimming methods, but that SEAR may be a preferable method, causing less check in weight gain and fewer bill morphological changes while still being effective in minimizing feather pecking damage. 3aanimal behavior 3atissue repair 3aanimal well-being 3abody weight 3aducklings 3afeathers 3aneoplasms 3amethodology 3aliveweight gain 3ahistochemistry 3aconnective tissues 3aPekin 3abeak trimming 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBeakxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDucksxphysiology 2aFeathers 2aFemale 2aMale 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 0aneuromas 0aducks 0aanatomy and morphology 0ascar tissue1 aCheng, H.-W.1 aGarner, J.P.1 aPajor, E.A.1 aMench, J.A.0 tPoultry science.g2007 Sept., v.  86, no.  9 p.1831-1839dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/86.9.18313Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/11/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03236naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100001700184245013600201300001600337500002400353500001500377520148400392650001101876650002701887650001101914650001901925650001501944650002701959650002301986650001902009650003302028650002302061650002302084650003502107653004302142653001002185653002302195700001902218700002102237700001802258700001802276773010002294852000902394856011202403856008502515930003302600945002502633946001102658961001302669655001202682IND4434358620221119200421.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443435862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-009-9355-y2doi7 a10113/425712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8321 aXiao, Jinhua12aA SNP haplotype associated with a gene resistant to Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  ap. 593-602.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn F₄:₅ population of 285 families with each tracing back to a different F₂ plant, derived from a cotton bacterial blight resistant line 'DeltaOpal' and a susceptible line 'DP388', was artificially inoculated with bacterial blight race 18 (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum) to assay their resistance or susceptibility to the disease. The segregation in the F₄:₅ population indicates that the resistance was conditioned by a single dominant gene designated B ₁₂. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers identified as putatively linked to the resistance gene by bulked segregant analysis were confirmed on the entire F₄:₅ population. Three SSR markers, CIR246, BNL3545 and BNL3644 on chromosome 14, were found closely linked to B ₁₂ . The association between CIR246 and B ₁₂ was validated among 354 plants of 16 diverse varieties. Based on Monsanto SSR/single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) consensus map, SNP markers closely linked to CIR246 were used to screen 'DeltaOpal' and 'DP388' for polymorphism. The polymorphic SNP markers were run on the F₄:₅ population and the four SNP markers spanning 3.4 cM were found to flank the resistance gene on chromosome 14. The linkage between B ₁₂ and the 4-SNP marker haplotype was validated using 18 elite cotton lines. This 4-SNP marker haplotype can be used for marker assisted selection for bacterial blight resistance breeding programs or for screening germplasm collections for this locus rapidly. 3acotton 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ablight 3adominant genes 3ahaplotypes 3aXanthomonas axonopodis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3alinkage groups 3abacterial diseases of plants 3achromosome mapping 3adisease resistance 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aXanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum 0agenes 0alinkage (genetics)1 aFang, David D.1 aBhatti, Muhammad1 aHendrix, Bill1 aCantrell, Roy0 tMolecular breeding.g2010 Apr., v.  25, no.  4 p.593-602dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425713Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9355-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/01  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01713naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002000133040001800153100001700171245011400188300001400302500002500316506007600341520049800417506003700915650001600952650003000968650001300998653001901011653001301030653000901043700001701052773007901069852000901148856011101157930003301268946001301301961001301314655001201327IND9203490920221207142212.0920601e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920349092DNAL7 a192832012pmid7 aPMC26192602pmcid7 a10113/76352hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandoo, Z.A.12aA key and diagnostic compendium to the species of the genus Hoplolaimus Daday, 1905 (Nematoda: Hoplolaimidae)  ap. 45-53.  aIncludes references.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn identification key to 29 valid species of Hoplolaimus is given.

Methods and Results: Genetic variability among Fl. columnare isolates was characterized using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S rDNA gene, intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting. Thirty Fl. columnare cultures isolated from different fish species and geographical origins as well as reference strains were included in the study. Fifteen isolates belonged to genomovar I while eleven were ascribed to genomovar II. Analysis of the ISR sequence confirmed the genetic differences between both genomovars but revealed a higher diversity among genomovar I isolates. The maximum resolution was provided by AFLP fingerprinting, as up to 22 AFLP profiles could be defined within the species. Conclusions: We confirmed the division of Fl. columnare isolates from cultured fish into different genogroups. We showed that both genomovars I and II are present in channel catfish from the US. We described a unique genetic group represented by four Fl. columnare isolates from tilapia in Brazil which appears to be related to both genomovars. We were able to further subdivide the species by analysing the ISR. Finally, the use of AFLP® allowed us to fingerprint the species at clone level without losing the higher genetic hierarchy of genomovar division. Significance and Impact of the Study: This paper reports on an extensive assessment of the use of molecular tools for the study of the epidemiology of the fish pathogen Fl. columnare. 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3astrains 3afarmed fish 3afreshwater fish 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aDNA fingerprinting 3amicrobial genetics 2aAnimals 2aCatfishesxmicrobiology 2aCichlidsxmicrobiology 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Intergenicxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aFlavobacteriumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0aintergenic spacer region 0amolecular sequence data 0agenomovars1 aWelker, T.L.1 aShoemaker, C.A.1 aAbernathy, J.W.1 aKlesius, P.H.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2004, v.  97, no.  2 p.421-428x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02314.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/01  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02898naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172100001600181245018000197300001800377500002400395520119700419650002301616650002601639650001901665650001701684650002701701650002001728650002301748650001601771650002301787650001401810650001101824650002201835650001801857651001501875651001101890700001301901700001801914700001301932700001501945773011201960852000902072856009202081856011102173930003302284945002502317946001302342961001302355655001202368IND4394733220221120203612.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439473322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00445.x2doi7 a10113/83412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aJetti, R.R.10aQuantification of Selected Aroma-Active Compounds in Strawberries by Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction Gas Chromatography and Correlation with Sensory Descriptive Analysis  ap.

Ten strawberry cultivars grown in California and Oregon were studied. The standard curves were built in a synthetic matrix and quantification was achieved using multiple internal standards. Odor activity values (OAVs) of the aroma compounds were calculated to understand their contribution to the overall aroma. Although the concentrations of the aroma compounds varied depending on the cultivars, in general, ethyl butanoate, mesifurane, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, hexyl acetate, and γ-dodecalactone had the highest OAVs. Descriptive sensory analysis was performed by a trained panel of 10 members. A PCA plot was built to understand the aroma contribution of principal components. The chemical results were compared with sensory data. The OAV of esters correlated well with the floral, pineapple, and banana notes. The green notes did not correlate with the concentration or OAVs of aldehydes or C6 alcohols. It is assumed that the higher amounts of green, sulfur, musty, and waxy notes in some cultivars were due to the lack of fruity notes. 3aheadspace analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3aodor compounds 3astrawberries 3asolid phase extraction 3amicroextraction 3agas chromatography 3acorrelation 3asensory properties 3acultivars 3aesters 3aFragaria ananassa 3afruit quality 3aCalifornia 3aOregon1 aYang, E.1 aKurnianta, A.1 aFinn, C.1 aQian, M.C.0 tJournal of food science.g2007 Sept., v.  72, no.  7 p.S487-S496dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00445.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03662naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024001900131024002000150040001800170072000900188100001400197245011300211300001600324500002400340500001500364520147500379650001301854650002701867650003201894650002701926650001801953650001601971650002601987650002002013650001702033650001602050650002902066650001602095650001202111650001402123650003502137650002602172650002502198650004502223650004302268650002902311650002202340650005202362650003402414650003902448653001302487653002002500653001502520653002702535700001702562700001502579773008902594852000902683856011102692856008902803930003302892945002502925946001302950961001302963655001202976IND4395738920221120083827.0071004e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439573892DNAL7 a10.1016/S0145-305X(02)00040-X2doi7 a123772212pmid7 a10113/42582hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aKogut, M.10aDifferential effects of age on chicken heterophil functional activation by recombinant chicken interleukin-2  ap. 817-830.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInterleukin-2 (IL-2) exercises an array of biological effects on many cells including the functional activation of cells of the innate immune response. Heterophils, the avian equivalent of the neutrophil, function as professional phagocytes to aid in regulation of innate host defenses. The objective of the present studies was to examine the effects of recombinant chicken IL-2 (rChIL-2) on functional activities of heterophils from chickens during the first 3 weeks after hatch. Peripheral blood heterophils were isolated and incubated with either COS cell-derived rChIL-2 or supernatants from mock-transfected COS cells. rChIL-2 had no effect on the functional activities of heterophils from day-of-hatch chickens, but significantly increased the phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of heterophils from 7- and 14-day-old chickens. rChIL-2 induced no direct stimulation of the respiratory burst by heterophils, but primed heterophils from 7- and 14-day-old birds for an enhanced respiratory burst in response to phorbol ester stimulation. Lastly, rChIL-2 had neither direct nor priming effects on heterophil degranulation. The enhancing effects on heterophil functional activity by rChIL-2 were abated by a neutralizing anti-chicken IL-2 mAb and were therefore specific for this cytokine. These results show that rChIL-2 can directly activate chicken heterophils to exert effector functions, and that heterophil activation by rChIL-2 is also an age-dependent event. 3achickens 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3acell-mediated immunity 3ainterleukin-2 3aneutrophils 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aimmune response 3aphagocytosis 3aheterophils 3aantibacterial properties 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCOS Cells 2aCell Degranulationximmunology 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aChickensximmunology 2aInterleukin-2ximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aPhagocytosisximmunology 2aRandom Allocation 2aRecombinant Proteinsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aRespiratory Burstximmunology 2aSalmonella enteritidisximmunology 0aimmunity 0aoxidative burst 0aphagocytes 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aRothwell, L.1 aKaiser, P.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2002 Dec., v.  26, no.  9 p.817-8307nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/42583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0145-305X(02)00040-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071009b20071102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/10/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04607naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111024002000144040001800164072001700182072001700199100001200216245011600228300001600344500002400360520299800384650001903382650001703401650001803418650002203436650002703458650001803485650002303503650002303526650002803549650002303577650002003600651001003620653003503630700001703665700001503682700001303697773009203710852000903802856008303811856011103894930003304005945002504038946001304063961001304076655001204089IND4395218320221120214113.0070920e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439521832DNAL7 a189436082pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-6-07672doi7 a10113/83462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSim, S.10aMapping and Comparative Analysis of QTL for Crown Rust Resistance in an Italian x Perennial Ryegrass Population  ap. 767-776.  aIncludes references  aCrown rust (Puccinia coronata f. sp. lolli) is a serious fungal foliar disease of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), which are important forage and turf species. A number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for crown rust resistance previously were identified in perennial ryegrass under growth chamber or greenhouse conditions. In this study, we conducted a QTL mapping for crown rust resistance in a three-generation Italian x perennial ryegrass interspecific population under natural field conditions at two locations over 2 years. Through a comparative mapping analysis, we also investigated the syntenic relationships of previously known crown rust resistance genes in other ryegrass germplasms and oat, and genetic linkage between crown rust resistance QTL and three lignin genes: LpOMT1, LpCAD2, and LpCCR1. The interspecific mapping population of 156 progeny was developed from a cross between two Italian x perennial ryegrass hybrids, MFA and MFB. Because highly susceptible reactions to crown rust were observed from all perennial ryegrass clones, including two grandparental clones and eight clones from different pedigrees tested in this study, two grandparent clones from Italian ryegrass cv. Floregon appeared to be a source of the resistance. Two QTL on linkage groups (LGs) 2 and 7 in the resistant parent MFA map were detected consistently regardless of year and location. The others, specific to year and location, were located on LGs 3 and 6 in the susceptible parent MFB map. The QTL on LG2 was likely to correspond to those previously reported in three unrelated perennial ryegrass mapping populations; however, the other QTL on LGs 3, 6, and 7 were not. The QTL on LG7 was closely located in the syntenic genomic region where genes Pca cluster, Pcq2, Pc38, and Prq1b resistant to crown rust (P. coronata f. sp. avenae) in oat (Avena sativa L.) were previously identified. Similarly, the QTL on LG3 was found in a syntenic region with oat genes resistant to crown rust isolates PC54 and PC59. This indicates that the ortholoci for resistance genes to different formae speciales of crown rust might be present between two distantly related grass species, ryegrass and oat. In addition, we mapped four restriction fragment length polymorphism loci for three key ryegrass lignin genes encoding caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and cinnamoyl CoA-reductase on LG7. These loci were within a range of 8 to 17 centimorgans from the QTL on LG7, suggesting no tight linkage between them. The putative ortholoci for those lignin biosynthesis genes were identified on segments of rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosomes 6 and 8, which are the counterparts of ryegrass LG7. Results from the current study facilitate understanding of crown rust resistance and its relationship with lignin biosynthesis, and also will benefit ryegrass breeders for improving crown rust resistance through marker-assisted selection. 3aLolium perenne 3aturf grasses 3arust diseases 3aPuccinia coronata 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aquantitative trait loci 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3aItaly 0aPuccinia coronata f. sp. lolli1 aDiesburg, K.1 aCasler, M.1 aJung, G.0 tPhytopathology.g2007 June, v.  97, no.  6 p.767-776wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-6-07673Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/12/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03893naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181100002200190245008300212300001800295500002400313500001500337520139500352650001901747650001801766650002401784650003201808650001701840650000901857650002001866650001901886650001201905650003001917650001601947650002201963650001201985650007001997650004402067650003902111650002702150650003802177650001902215650003502234650003302269650004402302650003102346650004902377650000902426650003902435650002802474650002902502650003902531650004102570653001702611653001402628700002002642700001902662700001702681700002502698700002302723773009302746852000902839856008102848856011202929930003303041945002503074946001103099961001303110655001203123IND4437177820221118044734.0100518e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443717782DNAL7 a153682852pmid7 a10.1002/eji.2003248332doi7 a10113/417992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3801 aElliott, David E.10aHeligmosomoides polygyrus inhibits established colitis in IL-10-deficient mice  ap. 2690-2698.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is prevalent in industrialized countries, but rare in less-developed countries. Helminths, common in less-developed countries, may induce immunoregulatory circuits protective against IBD. IL-10-/- mice given piroxicam develop severe and persistent colitis. Lamina propria mononuclear cells from colitic IL-10-/- mice released IFN-γ and IL-12. The ongoing piroxicam-induced colitis could be partially blocked with anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody suggesting that the inflammation was at least partly IL-12 dependent. Colonization of piroxicam-treated colitic IL-10-/- mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus (an intestinal helminth) suppressed established inflammation and inhibited mucosal IL-12 and IFN-γ production. H. polygyrus augmented mucosal IL-13, but not IL-4 or IL-5 production. Transfer of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) T cells from IL-10-/- animals harboring H. polygyrus into colitic IL-10-/- recipients inhibited colitis. MLN T cells from worm-free mice did not. Foxp3 (scurfin) drives regulatory T cell function. H. polygyrus enhanced Foxp3 mRNA expression in MLN T cells that had regulatory activity. This suggests that H. polygyrus inhibits ongoing IL-10-/- colitis in part through blocking mucosal Th1 cytokine production. Resolution of inflammation is associated with increased IL-13 production and can be adoptively transferred by MLN T cells. 3ainterleukin-12 3aT-lymphocytes 3anematode infections 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ainflammation 3amice 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3acolitis 3aHeligmosomoides polygyrus 3ainterferons 2aAdoptive Transfer 2aAnimals 2aColitisxchemically inducedximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aCyclooxygenase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFlow Cytometry 2aForkhead Transcription Factors 2aInterferon-gammaximmunology 2aInterleukin-10xdeficiencyximmunology. 2aInterleukin-12ximmunology 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aNematospiroides dubiusximmunology 2aPiroxicamxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aStrongylida Infectionsximmunology 2aTh1 Cellsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 0ainterleukins 0acytokines1 aSetiawan, Tommy1 aMetwali, Ahmed1 aBlum, Arthur1 aUrban, Joseph F.

Plasma triacylglycerols and atherogenic index were higher in alcoholics than in control subjects. Plasma total cholesterol was not different among groups, but plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower in alcoholics. There were positive correlations between ethanol consumption and plasma lipid peroxide and atherogenic index in all subjects; there were negative correlations between ethanol consumption and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in all subjects. There were no significant differences between alcoholics and control subjects in plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol, although plasma α-tocopherol/lipid tended to be lower in alcoholics. Plasma retinol was lower in alcoholics. These results suggest that chronic ethanol consumption can contribute to increased risk for vascular diseases in Korean alcoholics. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3anutritional status 3amen 3ablood serum 3alipid peroxidation 3ahealth status 3atriacylglycerols 3amiddle-aged adults 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acholesterol 3arisk factors 3aalcoholic beverages 3aantioxidants 3avitamin A 3aalcohol abuse 3aatherogenesis 3aSouth Korea 0avascular diseases1 aYang, K.M.1 aKim, J.M.1 aMin, H.1 aKim, C.S.1 aBurri, B.J.0 tNutrition research.g2004 Dec., v.  24, no.  12 p.959-968x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2004.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03136naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002000131040001800151100001900169245018600188300001600374500002400390500001500414520145200429650002501881650002801906650003001934650001801964650001701982650002101999650001202020650002502032650001502057650001302072650002002085650001402105650001402119653001202133653002502145653001802170653001802188700001602206700001802222773008702240852000902327856011102336856008902447930003302536945001302569946001102582961001302593655001202606IND2061230520221120152919.0980113e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123052DNAL7 a10.1016/S0022-1910(96)00124-22doi7 a10113/41802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvucci, M.E.10aEffect of sucrose concentration on carbohydrate metabolism in Bemisia argentifolii: biochemical mechanism and physiological role for trehalulose synthesis in the silverleaf whitefly  ap. 457-464.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUptake and metabolism of sucrose by adult silverleaf whiteflies (Bemisia argentifolii) were investigated on defined diets containing sucrose concentrations from 3 to 30% (w/v). At an optimal pH of 7, the volume of liquid ingested decreased with increasing dietary sucrose concentration, but the amount of sucrose ingested showed a net increase. Above a dietary sucrose concentration of about 10%, a greater amount of the ingested carbon was excreted by the white flies than was retained, and the proportion that was excreted increased progressively with increasing dietary sucrose concentration. Carbohydrate analysis showed that the composition of excreted honeydew changed from predominantly glucose and fructose at low dietary sucrose concentrations to predominantly trehalulose at high concentrations, with little change in the proportion of larger oligosaccharides. Measurements of whitefly trehalulose synthase and sucrase activities revealed that the enzymatic potential for metabolizing sucrose shifted from favoring sucrose hydrolysis at low sucrose concentrations to sucrose isomerization at high sucrose concentrations. Thus, the amount of trehalulose synthesized by the silverleaf whitefly was directly related to the properties of trehalulose synthase and sucrase and the concentration of sucrose in the diet. We propose that trehalulose is synthesized for excretion when the carbon input from sucrose is in excess of metabolic needs. 3achemical composition 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3aisomerization 3abiosynthesis 3aartificial diets 3asucrose 3aBemisia argentifolii 3ahydrolysis 3ahoneydew 3aenzyme activity 3aingestion 3aexcretion 0aenzymes 0atrehalulose synthase 0aconcentration 0adisaccharides1 aWolfe, G.R.1 aHendrix, D.L.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1997 May, v.  43, no.  5 p.457-464x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/41803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1910(96)00124-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071004b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04302naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024001900134024002100153024002100174040001800195072000900213072000900222072000900231100001800240245012800258300001800386500002400404500001500428506007600443520162500519506003702144650001902181650002802200650001502228650001602243650002302259650003002282650002302312650001402335650001902349650001002368650002502378650002202403650002702425650001402452650002002466650001202486650003302498650002502531650002202556650001102578650006902589650003002658650002802688650002102716650003202737650001402769650003902783650002702822650001502849650003102864650001402895653001402909653002802923653001202951700001702963700002302980700002403003700001803027700001903045773008703064852000903151856011203160856009203272930003303364945002503397946001303422961001303435655001203448IND4439203420221207083307.0100628e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443920342DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.186.15.4994-5002.20042doi7 a152629372pmid7 aPMC4516612pmcid7 a10113/425592hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aL832 0aX3801 aWard, Todd J.10aIntraspecific Phylogeny and Lineage Group Identification Based on the prfA Virulence Gene Cluster of Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 4994-5002.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aListeria monocytogenes is a serious food-borne pathogen that can cause invasive disease in humans and other animals and has been the leading cause of food recalls due to microbiological concerns in recent years. In order to test hypotheses regarding L. monocytogenes lineage composition, evolution, ecology, and taxonomy, a robust intraspecific phylogeny was developed based on prfA virulence gene cluster sequences from 113 L. monocytogenes isolates. The results of the multigene phylogenetic analyses confirm that L. monocytogenes comprises at least three evolutionary lineages, demonstrate that lineages most frequently (lineage 1) and least frequently (lineage 3) associated with human listeriosis are sister-groups, and reveal for the first time that the human epidemic associated serotype 4b is prevalent among strains from lineage 1 and lineage 3. In addition, a PCR-based test for lineage identification was developed and used in a survey of food products demonstrating that the low frequency of association between lineage 3 isolates and human listeriosis cases likely reflects rarity of exposure and not reduced virulence for humans as has been previously suggested. However, prevalence data do suggest lineage 3 isolates may be better adapted to the animal production environment than the food-processing environment. Finally, analyses of haplotype diversity indicate that lineage 1 has experienced a purge of genetic variation that was not observed in the other lineages, suggesting that the three L. monocytogenes lineages may represent distinct species within the framework of the cohesion species concept.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahuman diseases 3abacterial contamination 3ahaplotypes 3alisteriosis 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3aphylogeny 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3afoodborne illness 3aListeria monocytogenes 3avirulence 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aListeriosisxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPeptide Termination Factors 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSerotyping 2aTrans-Activatorsxgenetics 2aVirulence 0aprfA gene 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains1 aGorski, Lisa1 aBorucki, Monica K.1 aMandrell, Robert E.1 aHutchins, Jan1 aPupedis, Kitty0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2004 Aug., v.  186, no.  15 p.4994-5002x1098-55307nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.186.15.4994-5002.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01910naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100001600130245008000146300001600226500002500242500002400267520075200291650003001043650003001073650003201103650001201135650001601147650001601163651001001179651001101189700001701200700001501217700001501232773008601247852000901333856011101342930003301453946001301486961001301499655001201512IND9300644820221118030900.0930129e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930064482DNAL7 a10113/76302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafez, S.L.10aPlant-parasitic nematodes associated with crops in Idaho and eastern Oregon  ap. 193-204.  aIncludes references.  aSummary in Spanish.  aThis is the first detailed report on plant-parasitic nematodes occurring in Idaho and eastern Oregon, U.S.A.

To test the hypothesis that virus incidence and movement within plots would be reduced in soybean with resistance to feeding by the virus' bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata) vector, BPMV spread was evaluated in five soybean genotypes at two inoculum levels over 2 years at two locations in Ohio. Soybean genotypes included two insect-feeding-susceptible genotypes (Williams 82 and Resnik), two insect-feeding-resistant, semidwarf genotypes (HC95-15 and HC95-24), and an insect-feeding-susceptible, semidwarf genotype (Troll). BPMV incidence was assessed in individual plants at growth stages R5/R6 and R7/R8 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Beetle feeding was visually assessed in 2004. Data for infection of individual plants were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, with a binomial distribution and logit-link. Within plots, BPMV incidence was highest in Resnik and Williams 82 and significantly lower in Troll. Incidence in HC95-15 was not significantly different than in Williams 82 and Resnik but incidence in HC95-24 was lower than in Resnik. BPMV incidence was also significantly (P < 0.05) affected by year, location, inoculum level and sampling date, with increasing incidence over time and higher incidence at the higher inoculum level. Beetle feeding damage was affected by the interaction of location–genotype. Significant spatial aggregation of infected plants was found for most plots but aggregation was independent of host genotype and inoculum level. Although the results indicate that BPMV infection varied by genotype, they do not support the hypothesis that insect-feeding resistance is sufficient to reduce the incidence and spread of BPMV. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3afield crops 3aBean pod mottle virus 3aplant viruses 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aCerotoma trifurcata 3aplant pests 3ainsect pests 3ainsect vectors 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3atemporal variation 3aspatial distribution 3avector control 3aOhio1 aMolineros, Julio E.1 aVacha, Jean1 aBerry, Sue Ann1 aHammond, Ronald B.1 aMadden, Laurence V.1 aDorrance, Anne E.0 tPlant disease.g2010 Feb., v.  94, no.  2 p.265-270wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-94-2-02653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/418073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04013naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111024002000144040001800164072000900182072000900191100001400200245006300214300001600277500002400293500001500317520188900332650001002221650001202231650001702243650001502260650001702275650001202292650001702304650001002321650001002331650002102341650001702362650003102379650004602410650003602456650002302492650002502515650001102540650003402551650001102585650004502596650001602641650005302657650006402710650001702774653002002791653002402811653001002835653002502845700001602870700001502886700001902901773009802920852000903018856008303027856011103110930003303221945002503254946001103279961001303290655001203303IND4372717520221123020750.0050726e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437271752DNAL7 a151641182pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16019222doi7 a10113/83272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aBacon, L.10aLow bone mass in premenopausal chronic dieting obese women  ap. 966-971.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground: Obese premenopausal women are thought to be at low risk for osteoporosis due to increased body weight and effects of estrogen on weight-bearing bone. Objective: To examine the effect of restrained eating on obese women, we examined bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) of the spine and femur in obese women who were restrained eaters, with emphasis on the relationship between BMC and determinants of bone mass, and current eating behaviors, dietary intake, physical activity, and indices of calcium regulation, bone metabolism, stress and inflammation. Design: A total of 78 obese, Caucasian, female, restrained eaters, ages 30-45 y, were enrolled in a weight lose program. Height, weight, bone turnover markers, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), cortisol, c-reactive protein (CRP), dietary intake, eating behaviors, physical activity, and BMD and BMC were measured. Setting: This study was conducted at the University of California, in Davis, CA, USA. Results: In all, 31% of women had osteopenia or osteoporosis (OSTEO). In the OSTEO group, 87.5% of women had osteoporosis or osteopenia of the lumbar spine and 12.5% of the women had osteoporosis or osteopenia in femur. A significant positive correlation between BMC and energy expenditure (r=0.256), and a significant negative correlation between BMC and number of times on a weight loss diet (r=-0.250) and cognitive restraint (r=-0.239) were observed. No significant differences were observed between OSTEO women and nonosteoporotic women for current eating behaviors, dietary intake, physical activity habits, bone turnover, calcium regulation, stress, or inflammation. Conclusions: Obese restrained eaters are at risk for low bone mass. Prior dieting may be responsible. Chronic dieters should be encouraged to decrease their dietary restraint, develop healthy eating habits and increase physical activity. 3awomen 3adieting 3arisk factors 3aosteopenia 3abone density 3aobesity 3aosteoporosis 3afemur 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBone Density 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aDiet, Reducingxadverse effects 2aEatingxphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aFemurxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHumans 2aLumbar Vertebraexmetabolismxpathology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiet therapyxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aOsteoporosisxepidemiologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aPremenopause 0achronic dieting 0apremenopausal women 0aspine 0abone mineral content1 aStern, J.S.1 aKeim, N.L.1 aVan Loan, M.D.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 June, v.  58, no.  6 p.966-971x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16019223Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080902b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/12/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02557naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072001700130100001700147245009600164300001600260500002400276500001500300520120500315650002501520650000901545650002001554650002701574650001501601650002501616650001601641650002001657650001501677650001201692653001501704653002701719700001801746700002301764773010801787852000901895856011101904930003302015945002502048946001302073961001302086655001202099IND4373283420221123003949.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437328342DNAL7 a10113/83282hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The first series of tests revealed that a crossflow velocity (V) of 5 m/s and a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 275 kPa were appropriate for filtration. In the next series of tests, a concentration of almost 9% total solids was achieved, and the logarithmic relationship between permeate flux and concentration was described. Permeate flux rates decreased from over 80 L/m2*hour (LMH) for unconcentrated samples to under 20 LMH for the most concentrated samples. The feed flow contained an average of 0.71% total solids and 4395-mg/L biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The permeate contained under 0.10% total solids and 330 mg/L BOD. A membrane system was sized for the test site based on data from these experiments. A system capable of concentrating 68 L/min of cook water to 5%, 8%, and 10% total solids required a total membrane surface area of 75, 100, and 115 m2, respectively. The reduction in sewage expense was predicted to average $10.48 per hour of operation. 3aartificial membranes 3arice 3aprecooked foods 3afood processing wastes 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3arice starch 3amicrofiltration 3aseparation 3acooking 0afiltration 0arice cooker wastewater1 aSoerens, T.S.1 aSiebenmorgen, T.J.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2005 July, v.  21, no.  4 p.689-694wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03325naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152024002100171040001800192072000900210072000900219100001900228245015300247246002000400500001500420506007600435520133300511592002801844506003701872650001101909650001301920650001101933650001101944650001401955650001201969650002001981650001902001650002602020650001902046650001102065650001302076650002202089650003802111650001502149650002002164653002602184653005002210653003102260700001602291700001802307700002002325773007402345852000902419856011202428856008802540930003302628945002502661961001302686655001202699IND4438913820221207095420.0100621e20091124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443891382DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00079782doi7 aPMC27773202pmcid7 a199566592pmid7 a10113/425622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aX1501 aMitra, Apratim12aA Genome-Wide Analysis of Array-Based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) Data to Detect Intra-Species Variations and Evolutionary Relationships3 aCGH and Wavelet  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArray-based comparative genomics hybridization (aCGH) has gained prevalence as an effective technique for measuring structural variations in the genome. Copy-number variations (CNVs) form a large source of genomic structural variation, but it is not known whether phenotypic differences between intra-species groups, such as divergent human populations, or breeds of a domestic animal, can be attributed to CNVs. Several computational methods have been proposed to improve the detection of CNVs from array CGH data, but few population studies have used CGH data for identification of intra-species differences. In this paper we propose a novel method of genome-wide comparison and classification using CGH data that condenses whole genome information, aimed at quantification of intra-species variations and discovery of shared ancestry. Our strategy included smoothing CGH data using an appropriate denoising algorithm, extracting features via wavelets, quantifying the information via wavelet power spectrum and hierarchical clustering of the resultant profile. To evaluate the classification efficiency of our method, we used simulated data sets. We applied it to aCGH data from human and bovine individuals and showed that it successfully detects existing intra-specific variations with additional evolutionary implications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3aancestry 3agenome 3acattle 3aevolution 3awavelet 3adata collection 3ahuman genetics 3amicroarray technology 3abioinformatics 3abreeds 3agenomics 3agenetic variation 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3aalgorithms 3aanimal genetics 0acopy number variation 0aarray-based comparative genomic hybridization 0anucleic acid hybridization1 aLiu, George1 aSong, Jiuzhou1 aSturtevant, Joy0 tPloS one.g, v. 4, no. 11dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00079783Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/01  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03376naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181100001600190245017000206300001600376500002400392520118700416650003301603650002101636650001601657650001301673650001901686650002201705650001001727650001601737650001601753650002301769650001201792650001301804650001101817650002601828650000901854650002501863650002801888650004501916650002801961650001201989650004502001650004502046650003502091653002602126653002102152700001902173700001502192700001602207700001802223700001502241700001402256700001902270773010302289852000902392856008102401856011202482930003302594945002502627946001302652961001302665655001202678IND4435221520221119200005.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443522152DNAL7 a203718512pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-004812doi7 a10113/425682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aBakst, M.R.10aComparisons of sperm storage tubule distribution and number in 4 strains of mature broiler breeders and in turkey hens before and after the onset of photostimulation  ap. 986-992.  aIncludes references  aThe biological basis of sustained fertility in broiler and turkey hens is their capacity to store sperm in the oviductal sperm storage tubules (SST) located in the uterovaginal junction. The objectives of this study were to determine if the numbers of SST varied between 4 strains of broiler breeders and determine the number of SST in the turkey before (less than 9 d of photostimulation) and after (up to 22 d of photostimulation and laying) photostimulation. No statistical differences were observed in SST numbers in the 4 strains of broilers examined or in turkey hens before and after the onset of egg production. The mean numbers of SST for broilers and turkeys were 4,893 and 30,566, respectively. We conclude that any differences between the fertility of the 4 broiler breeder strains examined cannot be explained by differences in SST numbers. However, differences in the duration of fertility between broilers and turkeys are, in part, related to their respective numbers of number of SST. Furthermore, we conclude that turkey SST are morphologically differentiated and functional before the onset of photostimulation and while the oviduct is morphologically undeveloped. 3afertilization (reproduction) 3abroiler breeders 3aturkey hens 3aoviducts 3aanimal anatomy 3aanimal morphology 3alight 3aspermatozoa 3aoviposition 3astrain differences 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aMale 2aOviductsxphysiology 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm-Ovum Interactions 2aTurkeys 2aUterusxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aVaginaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aVitelline Membranexphysiology 0asperm storage tubules 0aphotostimulation1 aDonoghue, A.M.1 aYoho, D.E.1 aMoyle, J.R.1 aWhipple, S.M.1 aCamp, M.J.1 aLiu, G.Q.1 aBramwell, R.K.0 tPoultry science.g2010 May, v.  89, no.  5 p.986-992dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-004813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/07/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03093naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002000131040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001900196245013600215300001400351500002400365500001500389520144700404650002501851650001701876650001901893650002501912650001301937650001601950650002501966650001301991650001602004650002002020653001502040653002102055653002702076653002202103653002602125700001802151700001602169773007502185852000902260856011102269856008902380930003302469945002502502946001102527961001302538655001202551IND4395735720221120083723.0071004e199901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439573572DNAL7 a10.1016/S0022-1910(98)00105-X2doi7 a10113/42572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aSalvucci, M.E.10aEffect of high temperature on the metabolic processes affecting sorbitol synthesis in the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii  ap. 21-27.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWhiteflies accumulate the polyhydric alcohol, sorbitol, when exposed to temperatures greater than about 30°C. Feeding experiments using artificial diets containing labeled sucrose showed that more of the label was incorporated into whitefly bodies and less was excreted in the honeydew when feeding was conducted at 41 compared with 25°C. Analysis of the components of the honeydew showed that more of the excreted label was in glucose and fructose and less in trehalulose at 41°C than at 25°C. A similar effect of temperature on honeydew composition occurred for whiteflies feeding on cotton leaves. Measurement of the activities of glycolytic, pentose-phosphate and polyol pathway enzymes at 30 and 42°C showed that NADPH-dependent ketose reductase/sorbitol dehydrogenase (NADPH-KR/SDH), sucrase, glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were stimulated to a greater extent at 42°C than trehalulose synthase and fructokinase. NAD+-sorbitol dehydrogenase (NAD+-SDH) activity was inhibited at 42°C. We propose that high temperature alters metabolic activity in a way that increases the availability of fructose and stimulates pentose-phosphate pathway activity, providing both the substrate and coenzyme for sorbitol synthesis. High temperature also increases the activity of NADPH-KR/SDH, the enzyme in whiteflies that synthesizes sorbitol, but inhibits the activity of NAD+-SDH, the enzyme that degrades sorbitol. 3achemical composition 3abiosynthesis 3aheat tolerance 3aBemisia argentifolii 3asorbitol 3aheat stress 3abiochemical pathways 3ahoneydew 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 0ametabolism 0aketose reductase 0asorbitol dehydrogenase 0athermoprotectants 0asorbitol accumulation1 aHendrix, D.L.1 aWolfe, G.R.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1999 Jan., v.  45, no.  1 p.21-277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/42573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1910(98)00105-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071009b20071102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/10/09  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03331naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158072000900167100002600176245014600202300001800348500002400366500001500390520174800405650001702153650001702170650002002187650001502207650001202222650002702234650001902261650002302280653001802303653003602321653003502357700002102392700002102413773013502434852000902569856011202578856007702690930003302767945002502800946001102825961001302836655001202849IND4409414620221119000838.0080822e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440941462DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.33382doi7 a10113/189862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aBreksa III, Andrew P.10aClarification of reconstituted frozen orange juice concentrate by continuous flow centrifugation for limonin glucoside solid phase extraction  ap. 2213-2218.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: The suitability of continuous flow centrifugation for the clarification of reconstituted frozen orange juice concentrate prior to its application to a solid phase extraction column for the isolation of limonin glucoside was evaluated. Clarification experiments spanning three flow rates (325, 588 and 875 mL min⁻¹) and three rotor speeds (equivalent to 2130, 8521 and 19 172 x g) were conducted in a simple factorial design.RESULTS: With increasing rotor speed or decreasing flow rate the average particle size, colour parameters (CIE L*, a*, b*) and residual solids in the resulting centrifugates were found to decrease, whereas juice characteristics including pH, conductivity, °Brix and limonin glucoside content were unchanged by the clarification process. Mean particle size in the resulting centrifugates ranged from 1.14 to 79.31 μm. The most effective clarification was obtained using a 325 mL min⁻¹ flow rate in conjunction with the maximum rotor speed. Suitability of the centrifugates for processing by solid phase extraction was tested through a two-step process, in which the centrifugates were first screened using small columns, followed by application of the centrifugate to a larger self-packed column (6.5 cm x 20 cm) containing SP-70 Sepabeads.CONCLUSION: Centrifugates from two conditions (325 and 588 mL min⁻¹ at the maximum rotor speed) were suitable for direct application to both columns. It was found that up to 19 L of these centrifugates could be applied to the 6.5 cm x 20 cm column without clogging or experiencing a decrease in flow rate. Analysis of the column effluent revealed that 11 L of centrifugate was sufficient to saturate this column.

Each herd-year-parity phenotypic variance estimate was combined with those of adjacent years and regressed toward a region-year-parity variance. Heritability was assumed to be .25 at mean variance within year and to range from .2 for herds with smallest phenotypic SD to .3 for herds with largest phenotypic SD. Lactation deviations from management group mean were adjusted by ratio of base genetic SD to genetic SD estimated from heritability and phenotypic SD. The base was defined as 1987 calvings for first parity and 1988 calvings for later parities. Records were weighted according to heritability by multiplying lactation length weight by herd error weight defined as ratio of base error variance to error variance in the adjusted record. Estimated genetic trend for milk increased by nearly 5 kg/yr for Holsteins with this adjustment, which caused predicted breeding values of oldest animals to be lower by about 100 kg. Most correlations of parent and progeny information were slightly higher with adjusted data. Cows in high variance herds were most likely to have large reductions in their evaluations. Adjustment for heterogeneous variance was implemented in July 1991 for national evaluations for yield traits. 3adairy cows 3aanimal models 3avariance 3amilk yield 3aequations 3aphenotypic correlation 3agenetic correlation 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Genetic 2aParity 2aPhenotype 0aUnited States1 aVanRaden, P.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v.  74, no.  12 p.4350-4357x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/417863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100527b20100605c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072001700130072001700147100001900164245012100183300001800304500002400322520149500346650001601841650001301857650002001870650001201890650002201902650001401924650002101938650002601959650001701985651001802002653002702020653002802047700001502075773009202090852000902182856011102191930003302302945002502335946001302360961001302373655001202386IND4366178020221122163358.0041221e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436617802DNAL7 a10113/83032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

For example, agriculture has been cited as a major source of N that contributes to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Although other sources of N have been well characterized in large ecosystem studies, the contribution of legume crops to the N cycle has not. Furthermore, the role legumes play in reducing excess N is not widely recognized. Symbiotic N2 fixation is a facultative process that is reduced by plant N uptake from other sources. Using reported and estimated crop yield and protein concentration with published estimates of soil N mineralization and atmospheric N deposition, we estimated spatial patterns of symbiotic N2 fixation for soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) across the Mississippi River Basin, the largest in North America. We estimate that alfalfa haylage adds about 20% to total production of dry alfalfa hay and increases total land area in alfalfa by about 11% over that reported in the Census of Agriculture. Our analysis shows wide ranges in N2 fixation (0 to 185 kg N ha(-1) for soybean and 45 to 470 kg N ha(-1) for alfalfa), reasonable mean rates (84 kg N ha(-1) for soybean and 152 kg N ha(-1) for alfalfa), and suggests that about 2.9 million Mg of fixed N is harvested annually in these two cultivated legumes. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3anitrogen fixation 3asymbiosis 3anitrogen content 3asoil nutrient balance 3afarm surveys 3aUnited States 0afixed nitrogen content 0aMississippi River Basin1 aBirr, A.S.0 tAgronomy journal.g2004 , v.  96, no.  6 p.1754-1760wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/83033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02205naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170100001700179245007200196300001400268500002400282520090700306650001501213650000801228650001501236650003401251650001001285653002801295700002201323700001701345700002201362700002101384773008401405852000901489856011201498856008901610930003301699945002501732946001301757961001301770655001201783IND4437175020221118044731.0100518e20030401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443717502DNAL7 a10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00665-62doi7 a10113/417982hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aMichiels, An10aExtraction of high-quality genomic DNA from latex-containing plants  ap. 85-89.  aIncludes references  aThe isolation of intact, high-molecular-mass genomic DNA is essential for many molecular biology applications including long PCR, endonuclease restriction digestion, Southern blot analysis, and genomic library construction. Many protocols are available for the extraction of DNA from plant material. However, for latex-containing Asteraceae (Cichorioideae) species, standard protocols and commercially available kits do not produce efficient yields of high-quality amplifiable DNA. A cetyltrimethylammonium bromide protocol has been optimized for isolation of genomic DNA from latex-containing plants. Key steps in the modified protocol are the use of etiolated leaf tissue for extraction and an overnight 25 °C isopropanol precipitation step. The purified DNA has excellent spectral qualities, is efficiently digested by restriction endonucleases, and is suitable for long-fragment PCR amplification. 3aAsteraceae 3aDNA 3aextraction 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3alatex 0alatex containing plants1 aEnde, Wim van den1 aTucker, Mark1 aRiet, Liesbet van1 aLaere, Andre van0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2003 Apr. 1, v.  315, no.  1 p.85-89x1096-03097nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/417983Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00665-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100527b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04521naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181100002500190245014400215300001600359500002400375520181600399650001602215650001502231650002202246650001202268650001902280650001602299650002002315650001402335650000902349650001002358650002302368650007202391650001202463650004202475650001602517650001102533650003102544650001402575650001402589650005402603650004402657650002602701650002202727650003902749650000902788650002502797650002102822650004402843650001502887650001502902650001502917650003102932650002202963650002002985650004503005650004903050653002703099653002003126700002003146700002203166700002103188700002403209700002503233700002303258773011203281852000903393856008103402856011203483930003303595945002503628946001303653961001303666655001203679IND4435931320221119153000.0100423e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443593132DNAL7 a202202072pmid7 a10.3945/jn.109.1108902doi7 a10113/425332hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aKadegowda, Anil K.G.10aDietary trans Fatty Acid Isomers Differ in Their Effects on Mammary Lipid Metabolism As Well As Lipogenic Gene Expression in Lactating Mice  ap. 919-924.  aIncludes references  aThe biological activities and mechanisms of action of individual transoctadecenoic acids (trans-18:1 FA) have not been completely elucidated. We examined the effects of several individual trans-18:1 FA isomers and trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on fat synthesis, and expression of lipogenic genes in mammary and liver tissue in lactating mice. From d 6 to 10 postpartum, 30 lactating C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a control (CTR) diet containing 20 g/kg oleic acid or diets in which the oleic acid was either completely replaced by partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (PHVO), trans-7 18:1 (T7), trans-9 18:1 (T9), or trans-11 18:1 (T11) or partially replaced with 6.66 g/kg trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Milk fat percentage was decreased by CLA (44%), T7 (27%), and PHVO (23%), compared with CTR. In the mammary gland, CLA decreased the expression of genes related to de novo FA synthesis, desaturation, triacylglycerol formation, and transcriptional regulation. PHVO and T7 diets decreased the expression of 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase and thyroid hormone responsive SPOT14 homolog (THRSP) mRNA. In contrast, dietary trans FA (tFA) did not affect hepatic lipogenic gene expression. However, mice fed CLA, T7, and PHVO diets had increased liver weights due to hepatic steatosis. Trans-7 18:1 was extensively desaturated to trans-7, cis-9 CLA in mammary and liver tissues. Dietary trans-7 18:1 could lead to milk fat depression in lactating mice, possibly through its desaturation product trans-7, cis-9 CLA. Also, the differences between the effects of trans-10, cis-12 CLA and other tFA could be attributed to its effects on carbohydrate response element binding protein and PPARγ, in addition to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c and THRSP. 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3atrans fatty acids 3aisomers 3amammary glands 3alipogenesis 3agene expression 3alactation 3amice 3agenes 3aexperimental diets 2a1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Liver 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aIsomerism 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolismxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLipogenesisxgenetics 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOleic Acid 2aOrgan Size 2aPlant Oils 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aStereoisomerism 2aTrans Fatty Acidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0atransoctadecenoic acid 0alipogenic genes1 aConnor, Erin E.1 aTeter, Beverly B.1 aSampugna, Joseph1 aDelmonte, Pierluigi1 aPiperova, Liliana S.1 aErdman, Richard A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2010 May, v.  140, no.  5 p.919-924dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.1108903Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04593naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100001700203245012100220300001600341500002400357520254300381650002202924650001502946650002102961650001802982650002003000650003003020650002203050650002003072650001803092650002403110650002803134650002303162650002203185650001803207650002103225650001603246650001903262650001503281650001603296650002003312650002103332650001903353650002103372651001203393700002103405700001903426700001903445700002303464700002003487773011103507852000903618856011203627856008603739930003303825945002503858946001103883961001303894655001203907IND4407215920221118235952.0080627e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2008.04.0052doi7 a10113/189822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ500 0aX100 0aJ7001 aMeals, D.

Model application  ap. 223-233.  aIncludes references  aCost-effective nonpoint source phosphorus (P) control should target the land areas at greatest risk for P loss. We combined mass-balance modeling and geographic analysis to identify and map high-risk areas for P export by integrating long-term P input/output accounting with spatially variable physiographic, land use, and agronomic factors. The dynamic interactive simulation of phosphorus loss areas (DISPLA) model evaluates changes over time and space in soil P concentration and P export in response to management interventions targeted specifically to critical P source areas. Five scenarios were simulated in a test watershed dominated by dairy agriculture in Vermont's Champlain Valley: (1) baseline; (2) nutrient management applied to corn and hay land and to urban lawns; (3) erosion control applied to silage corn land; (4) conversion of critically eroding cropland to permanent grass; and (5) all management changes combined. If present-day conditions continue, soil test P and P export will inevitably increase as P inputs continue to exceed outputs. Soil test P levels on corn land are projected to increase more than fourfold over 80 years if present management continues; estimated P export is expected to more than double over the same period. Increases in soil test P over time in the watershed are not uniform, but varied spatially in response to variability in initial conditions and input/output P balance. Targeted nutrient management was effective in reducing soil test P concentrations (50-90%) and appeared to hold the line on P export for the test watershed over the 80-year simulation. Simulated P export in the test watershed at the end of the nutrient management simulation was reduced by 64% compared to baseline. Implementation of erosion control on row cropland had little effect on soil test P and achieved only a transitory reduction in P export. Exclusive reliance on cropland erosion control to manage nonpoint source P is unlikely to succeed over the long term. Conversion of critical row cropland to permanent grass reduced P export by 54%, but did not affect soil P levels. Because row cropland converted to grassland retains its soil test P concentration, management of converted grassland to reduce runoff and P export is very important; row cropland with elevated soil test P converted to riparian buffer may still serve as a source of dissolved P to runoff. Application of all management measures combined yielded a 74% reduction in P export. Implications to watershed P management are discussed. 3aagricultural land 3aphosphorus 3alosses from soil 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3anonpoint source pollution 3asimulation models 3abalance studies 3amass transfer 3anutrient management 3aagricultural watersheds 3atemporal variation 3aspatial variation 3adairy farming 3amodel validation 3acalibration 3alawns and turf 3agrasslands 3afield crops 3aerosion control 3acropping systems 3asoil fertility 3asoil test values 3aVermont1 aCassell, E.

Likewise, limonin glucoside concentrations did not vary significantly, with the exception of the beverage matrix that included vitamin B₂. Exposure of the vitamin B₂-containing beverages to light resulted in a rapid reduction in the limonin glucoside content. Liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance results from the analyses of pre- and post-light exposed beverages suggest photooxidation of the furan moiety as the likely degradation pathway.CONCLUSION: Results from this study indicate that limonin glucoside is resistant to degradation into limonin, the stability of limonin glucoside formulated into beverages exceeds six months and that limonin glucoside should not be formulated into beverages containing vitamin B₂ unless the beverages are protected from light.

Such projected yields have less phenotypic and genetic variation than completed yields but were modeled as having greater or equal variation in evaluations. Analysis of first lactations from 48,424 daughters of 844 Holstein sires indicated that yields predicted early (46 to 75 d) in lactation had less than one-half as much additive genetic variance as completed yields. Multiple-trait REML estimates of genetic correlations of predicted and completed yields were all above .92, indicating that early lactation information is valuable if modeled appropriately. Expanded records with genetic ariances equal to those of completed yields and new lactation length weights were derived. Expanded records have larger error variances than either projected or completed yields and, thus, are given less weight when included in animal model evaluations. Genetic gains are expected to increase only .2 to .3%, but more stable genetic evaluations should result from use of expanded records, particularly for animals evaluated primarily from first lactation records in progress. 3adairy cows 3amilk yield 3aanimal models 3agenetic improvement 3aestimation 3aequations 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxanalysisxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPhenotype1 aWiggans, G.R.1 aErnst, C.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 Dec., v.  74, no.  12 p.4344-4349x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/417823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100527b20100605c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03335naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198072000900207072000900216100002300225245010200248300001600350500002400366520137200390650001601762650001801778650002101796650001901817650002201836650001801858650002601876650001701902650001501919650002301934650002501957650001901982650001302001650003202014650001802046650002502064650001902089650002302108650002002131650001702151650002202168650002802190650002302218651001902241700001902260773009302279852000902372856011202381856008102493930003302574945002502607946001302632961001602645655001202661IND4437181020221118044824.0100518s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443718102DNAL7 a10.1081/TXR-2000278172doi7 a10113/417532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF100 0aL100 0aT300 0aX380 0aF831 0aL831 0aQ2001 aCardwell, Kitty F.10aRisk of Exposure to and Mitigation of Effect of Aflatoxin on Human Health: A West African Example  ap. 217-247.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this chapter is to examine the relative risk of exposure of different human populations to food-borne aflatoxins; the types of health impact that may be incurred by dietary exposure to aflatoxins; and possible strategies likely to mitigate risks to human health. Risk of exposure is examined in a global context comparing risk of toxin exposure by levels of national socioeconomic development. Then risk of exposure is reexamined in the context of agro-ecology, distribution of toxigenicity of Aspergillus flavus, and social factors that influence food management practices. The effects of aflatoxin exposure on human health are explored in three sections: human disease and nutritional status, carcinogenicity, and child growth and development. The section concerning mitigation of the effects of aflatoxin on human health contrasts efficacy of regulation, food basket modification, and production-side agriculture intervention. It is concluded that risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in developing countries, such as West Africa, may be addressed by vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and other public health options. Young children in West Africa who are chronically exposed to aflatoxin in foods and who consume nutritionally deficient diets have been shown to be stunted and underweight, as measured by World Health Organization (WHO) Z-scores. 3aagroecology 3apublic health 3adietary exposure 3afood pathogens 3atoxigenic strains 3amolds (fungi) 3asecondary metabolites 3arisk factors 3aaflatoxins 3aAspergillus flavus 3apsychosocial factors 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahepatoma 3agood agricultural practices 3afood handling 3asocioeconomic status 3ahuman diseases 3anutritional status 3acarcinogenicity 3achild growth 3achild development 3aepidemiological studies 3afood contamination 3aWestern Africa1 aHenry, Sara H.0 tJournal of toxicology.

The objective of this study was to screen 25 rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) at low, medium, and high levels of soil P. Number of tillers, root length, plant height, root dry weight and shoot dry weight were related to tissue P concentrations, P uptake and P-use efficiency. Shoot weight was found to be the plant parameter most sensitive to P deficiency. Significant cultivar differences in P use efficiency were found. Phosphorus use efficiency was higher in roots than shoots and decreased with increasing levels of soil P. Positive correlations were found among growth parameters such as plant height, tillers, root and shoot weight, and P content of roots and shoots. These results indicate selection of rice cultivars for satisfactory performance under low P availability can be carried out using shoot and root dry weight as criteria. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aOryza sativa 3acultivars 3aroots 3ashoots 3aphosphorus 3aacid soils 3alength 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 0aselection 0adry matter 0agrowth rate 0auptake1 aWright, R.J.1 aBaligar, V.C.0 tPlant and soil.g1988 Sept., v.  111, no.  1 p.105-109x0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF021820433Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/417593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100527b20100605c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02314naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163100002100172245010000193300001600293500002400309520110300333650001601436650001801452650002101470650001401491700001501505700001801520773011701538852000901655856011201664856008201776930003301858945002501891946001101916961001301927655001201940IND4409486020221118053442.0080827e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440948602DNAL7 a10.1054/plef.2002.04142doi7 a10113/189362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aGoodfriend, T.L.13aAn oxidized derivative of linoleic acid affects aldosterone secretion by adrenal cells in vitro  ap. 163-167.  aIncludes references  aBased on the clinical observation that humans with visceral adiposity have higher plasma aldosterone levels than controls, we postulated that endogenous fatty acids can be oxidized by the liver to form stimuli of the adrenal cortex. Although we could show that hepatocytes produced adrenal stimuli from linoleic acid in vitro, the yield was very small. To facilitate the elucidation of chemical structures, we incubated a large amount of linoleic acid with lipoxygenase, then treated the hydroperoxide with cysteine and iron. The major product of this process was 12,13-epoxy-9-keto-10- trans -octadecenoic acid. This epoxy-keto compound stimulated aldosterone production at concentrations from 0.5 to 15 μm. At higher concentrations, it was inhibitory. The epoxy-keto-octadecenoic acid exhibited the chromatographic characteristics of one product of the incubation of linoleic acid with hepatocytes. The results are consistent with the postulated conversion of linoleic acid to stimuli of aldosterone production. This may be a mechanistic link between visceral obesity and hypertension in humans. 3aaldosterone 3alinoleic acid 3alipid metabolism 3aoxidation1 aBall, D.L.1 aGardner, H.W.0 tProstaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids.g2002 Aug., v.  67, no.  2-3 p.163-167x1532-28237nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1054/plef.2002.04143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02713naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171100001700180245014700197300001800344500002400362520136900386650003001755650001901785650002001804650002601824650003001850650001701880700001701897700001101914773009401925852000902019856008102028856011202109930003302221945002502254946001102279961001302290655001202303IND4409491120221118053533.0080828e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440949112DNAL7 a10.1007/s0043801004982doi7 a10113/189372hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX320 0aX3501 aThomason, L.10aGene insertion and replacement in Schizosaccharomyces pombe mediated by the Streptomyces bacteriophage fC31 site-specific recombination system  ap. 1031-1038.  aIncludes references  aThe site-specific recombination system used by the Streptomyces bacteriophage JC31 was tested in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A target strain with the phage attachment site attP inserted at the leu1 locus was co-transformed with one plasmid containing the bacterial attachment site attB linked to a ura4+ marker, and a second plasmid expressing the JC31 integrase gene. High-efficiency transformation to the Ura+ phenotype occurred when the integrase gene was expressed. Southern analysis revealed that the attB-ura4+ plasmid integrated into the chromosomal attP site. Sequence analysis showed that the attB2attP recombination was precise. In another approach, DNA with a ura4+marker flanked by two attB sites in direct orientation was used to transform S. pombe cells bearing an attP duplication. The JC31 integrase catalyzed two reciprocal cross-overs, resulting in a precise gene replacement. The site-specific insertions are stable, as no excision (the reverse reaction) was observed on maintenance of the integrase gene in the integrant lines. The irreversibility of the JC31 site-specific recombination system sets it apart from other systems currently used in eukaryotic cells, which reverse readily. Deployment of the JC31 recombination provides new opportunities for directing transgene and chromosome rearrangements in eukaryotic systems. 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abacteriophages 3agenetic vectors 3agenetic recombination 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3acircular DNA1 aCalendar, R.1 aOw, D.0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2001 Aug., v.  265, no.  6 p.1031-1038x1617-46237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0043801004983Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189373Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02135naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158072000900167100001400176245017800190300001800368500002400386520081000410650001601220650001301236650002401249650001101273650001101284650001101295650002101306700001601327773010001343852000901443856007701452856011201529930003301641945002501674946001301699961001301712655001201725IND4409493220221118053525.0080828e20020624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440949322DNAL7 a10.1002/app.105042doi7 a10113/189392hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX5001 aLiu, Z.S.10aConversion of soybean oil into ion exchange resins: Removal of copper (II), nickel (II), and cobalt (II) ions from dilute aqueous solution using carboxylate-containing resin  ap. 2386-2396.  aIncludes references  aAn ion-exchange resin containing carboxylic acid groups was prepared by reaction of epoxidized soybean oil with triethylene tetramine, followed by hydrolysis of glycerides by using sodium hydroxide solution.

The adsorption capacity for Cu2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ on the obtained resin at pH 5.0 was found to be 192, 96, and 78 mg/g, respectively. Effect of pH on the adsorption capacity for copper (II), nickel (II), and cobalt (II) ions were also studied. Cu2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ were adsorbed at a pH above 3. These metal ions adsorbed on the resin are easily eluted by using 1N HCl solution. The selectivity of the resin for Cu2+ from mixtures containing Cu2+/Co2+/Ni2+ ions in the presence of sodium chloride was also investigated. 3asoybean oil 3aepoxides 3aion exchange resins 3acopper 3anickel 3acobalt 3acarboxylic acids1 aErhan, S.Z.0 tJournal of applied polymer science.g2002 June 24, v.  84, no.  13 p.2386-2396x1097-46287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.105043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04405naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100002100203245013900224300001400363500002400377520130900401650001501710650001001725650002001735650002101755650002701776650002001803650001901823650001901842650001701861650001501878650001501893650002001908650002001928650005201948650001802000650004802018650001202066650005902078650004202137650003702179650002302216650001502239650003702254650001302291650003002304650005602334650001102390650003002401650003902431650004402470650008202514650007602596650001902672650004402691650004202735650001702777650004702794650002802841653002702869700001802896700002602914700002302940700002802963700002302991700001803014700002703032700002503059700002303084773010803107852000903215856008503224856011203309930003303421945002503454946001103479961001303490655001203503IND4434002820221119200317.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443400282DNAL7 a197278722pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-009-0133-z2doi7 a10113/425142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL2001 aRinaldi, Manuela12aA sentinel function for teat tissues in dairy cows: dominant innate immune response elements define early response to E. coli mastitis  ap. 21-38.  aIncludes references  aEscherichia coli intramammary infection elicits localized and systemic responses, some of which have been characterized in mammary secretory tissue. Our objective was to characterize gene expression patterns that become activated in different regions of the mammary gland during the acute phase of experimentally induced E. coli mastitis. Tissues evaluated were from Furstenburg's rosette, teat cistern (TC), gland cistern (GC), and lobulo-alveolar (LA) regions of control and infected mammary glands, 12 and 24 h after bacterial (or control) infusions. The main networks activated by E. coli infection pertained to immune and inflammatory response, with marked induction of genes encoding proteins that function in chemotaxis and leukocyte activation and signaling. Genomic response at 12 h post-infection was greatest in tissues of the TC and GC. Only at 24 h post-infection did tissue from the LA region respond, at which time the response was the greatest of all regions. Similar genetic networks were impacted in all regions during early phases of intramammary infection, although regional differences throughout the gland were noted. Data support an important sentinel function for the teat, as these tissues responded rapidly and intensely, with production of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. 3adairy cows 3ateats 3abovine mastitis 3aEscherichia coli 3aEscherichia infections 3aimmune response 3aanimal tissues 3amammary glands 3ainflammation 3achemotaxis 3aleukocytes 3aanimal genetics 3agene expression 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlood Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCapillary Permeabilityxgenetics 2aCattleximmunology 2aCell Count 2aCytokinesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDairying 2aDown-Regulationxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Regulatory Networksxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgeneticsximmunology. 2aMammary Glands, Animalximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMastitis, Bovineximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMilkxcytology 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aToll-Like Receptorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulationxgenetics 0aintramammary infection1 aLi, Robert W.1 aBannerman, Douglas D.1 aDaniels, Kristy M.1 aEvock-Clover, Christina1 aSilva, Marcos V.B.1 aPaape, Max J.1 aVan Ryssen, Bernadette1 aBurvenich, Christian1 aCapuco, Anthony V.0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2010 Mar., v.  10, no.  1 p.21-38dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-009-0133-z3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100630b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02707naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092024002100136040001800157072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100001900211245005900230300001600289500002400305520124200329650002001571650001301591650001801604650001501622650001701637650002001654650002701674650002801701650002601729650001901755650001901774650002001793700002101813773008201834852000901916856011201925856009402037930003302131945002502164946001102189961001302200655001202213IND4438586720221119195903.0100616e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443858672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0765.2005.tb00097.x2doi7 a10113/425162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aJ200 0aF500 0aF6001 aBaligar, V.

A controlled growth chamber experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of three Al saturations (0.2, 19, and 26%) adjusted by addition of dolomitic lime on growth and nutrient uptake parameters of cacao. Overall, increasing soil Al saturation decreased shoot and root dry weight, stem height, root length, relative growth rate, and net assimilation rate. However, increasing soil Al saturation increased leaf area, specific leaf area (total leaf area/total leaf dry wt), and leaf area ratio (total leaf area/shoot+root wt). Increasing soil Al saturation decreased uptake of elements. Nutrient influx (IN) and transport (TR) decreased significantly for K, Ca and Mg, and showed an increasing trend for S and P as soil Al saturation increased. However, increasing soil Al saturation significantly increased nutrient use efficiency ratio (ER, mg of shoot weight produced per mg of element in shoot) of Ca, Mg and K and decreased ER for other elements. Reduction of soil acidity constraints with addition of lime and fertilizers appear to be key factors in improving cacao yields in infertile, acidic, tropical soils. 3aTheobroma cacao 3aaluminum 3aphytotoxicity 3aacid soils 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3achemical concentration 3anutrient use efficiency 3anet assimilation rate 3atropical soils 3asoil fertility 3anutrient uptake1 aFageria, Nand K.0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2005 Sept., v.  51, no.  5 p.709-7137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0765.2005.tb00097.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100630b20100703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02774naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002200188245011400210300001300324500002400337520122100361650002401582650002001606650001501626650001101641650001101652650002201663650002701685650001501712650002201727650001501749650004401764651001801808651002201826700002301848700002301871773009401894852000901988856011201997856008902109930003302198945002502231946001102256961001302267655001202280IND4409569420221118053422.0080829e20080915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440956942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.06.0012doi7 a10113/189432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aKannan, Narayanan10aDevelopment of an automated procedure for estimation of the spatial variation of runoff in large river basins  ap. 1-15.  aIncludes references  aThe use of distributed parameter models to address water resource management problems has increased in recent years. Calibration is necessary to reduce the uncertainties associated with model input parameters. Manual calibration of a distributed parameter model is a very time consuming effort. Therefore, more attention is given to automated calibration procedures. This paper describes the development and demonstration of such an automated procedure developed for a national/continental scale assessment study called Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). The automated procedure is developed to calibrate spatial variation of annual average runoff components for each USGS eight-digit watershed of the United States. It uses nine parameters to calibrate water yield, surface runoff and sub-surface flow respectively. If necessary, the procedure uses a linear interpolation method to arrive at a better value of a model parameter. When tested for the Upper Mississippi river basin of the United States, the automated calibration procedure gave satisfactory results. Other test results from the procedure are very encouraging and show potential for its use in very large-scale hydrologic modeling studies. 3awatershed hydrology 3asubsurface flow 3awatersheds 3arunoff 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3ageographical variation 3aestimation 3ahydrologic models 3aautomation 3aConservation Effects Assessment Project 3aUnited States 3aMississippi River1 aSanthi, Chinnasamy1 aArnold, Jeffrey G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Sept. 15, v.  359, no.  1-2 p.1-15dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02537naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001800200245007800218300001300296500002400309520106100333650001301394650001301407650001201420650001501432650002801447650001301475650002001488650002201508650001401530650001901544700001801563700001701581700002001598700002801618700001601646773007101662852000901733856011201742856008301854930003301937945002501970946001101995961001302006655001202019IND4438301420221119193811.0100611e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443830142DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10042602226812doi7 a10113/425182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aF500 0aF200 0aF8411 aBaligar, V.C.10aSoil acidity effects on nutrient use efficiency in exotic maize genotypes  ap. 9-13.  aIncludes references  aMaize ( Zea mays L.) is the third most important cereal grown in the world. In South and Central America, maize is mostly grown on acidic soils. On these soils, yields are limited by deficient levels of available P, Ca, and Mg, and toxic levels of Al and Mn. A greenhouse study was conducted with 22 maize genotypes originating from Africa, Europe, and North, Central, and South America on acid, dark red latosol (Typic Haplorthox) at 2%, 41%, and 64% Al saturation at corresponding pH of 5.6, 4.5, and 4.3. With increasing Al levels, the nutrient efficiency ratios (NER = mgs of dry shoot weight / mg of element in shoot) for K, Ca and Mg increased, and NER for P and Zn tended to decrease. Overall, Al-tolerant genotypes produced higher shoot and root weight and had higher NER for P, Ca Mg, and Fe at 41% Al saturation. Genotypes used in this study showed genetic diversity for growth and NER of essential nutrients. It was concluded that selection of acid-soil-tolerant genotypes and further breeding of acid-soil-tolerant maize cultivars are feasible. 3aZea mays 3agenotype 3asoil pH 3aacid soils 3anutrient use efficiency 3aaluminum 3ametal tolerance 3agenetic variation 3acultivars 3atropical soils1 aPitta, G.V.E.1 aGama, E.E.G.1 aSchaffert, R.E.1 aBahia Filho, A.F. de C.1 aClark, R.B.0 tPlant and soil.g1997 May, v.  192, no.  1 p.9-13x1573-50367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/425183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10042602226813Available from publisher's Web site  a20100630b20100703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/06/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02769naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002100133040001800154072001700172100001900189245009800208300001600306500002400322506007600346520127200422506003701694650002401731650001901755650002201774650002501796650002501821650002201846650002001868650002501888650002601913653002801939700001701967700001401984773009601998852000902094856011202103930003302215945002502248946001302273961001302286655001202299IND4374262520221207144334.0050913e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437426252DNAL7 a192628262pmid7 aPMC26207982pmcid7 a10113/189152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Caenorhabditis elegans mutant phenotypes of unc-87 exhibit severe paralysis in larvae and limp paralysis in the adult. We cloned and characterized a full-length cDNA representing a Heterodera glycines homolog of the unc-87 gene from C. elegans that encodes a protein that contains a region of seven repeats similar to CLIK-23 from C-elegans and has 81% amino acid identity with that of C. elegans unc-87 variant A. In the EST database clones labeled "unc-87" encode mainly the 3' portion of unc-87, while clones labeled "calponin homolog OV9M" contain mainly DNA sequence representing the 5' and middle transcribed regions of unc-87. A 1770 nucleotide cDNA encoding H. glycines unc-87 was cloned and encodes a predicted UNC-87 protein product of 375 amino acids. The expression of unc-87 was determined using RT-PCR and, in comparison to its expression in eggs, unc-87 was expressed 6-fold higher in J2 juveniles and 20-fold and 13-fold (P = 0.05) higher in nematodes 15 and 30 days after inoculation, respectively. In situ hybridization patterns confirmed the expression patterns observed with RT-PCR.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHeterodera glycines 3acyst nematodes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 3agene expression 3adevelopmental stages 3ain situ hybridization 0amolecular sequence data1 aPilitt, K.L.1 aKlink, V.0 tJournal of nematology.g2004 Dec., v.  36, no.  4 p.457-465wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03665naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002000141040001800161072000900179100001600188245008700204300001800291500002400309500001500333520188300348650002102231650002202252650002802274650001802302650002602320650001702346650002302363650001202386650002202398650002202420650002102442650001202463650002702475650002802502650002702530650002202557650002302579650001602602653001602618653001602634700001602650700001902666700001702685773007702702852000902779856008002788856011102868930003302979945002503012946001303037961001303050655001203063IND4393924820221119021717.0070810e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392482DNAL7 a175751932pmid7 a10.1093/ps/86.7.14362doi7 a10113/81822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2031 aSmith, D.P.10aEvaluation of carcass scraping to enumerate bacteria on prechill broiler carcasses  ap. 1436-1439.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aExperiments were conducted to evaluate a scraping method for enumerating bacteria on broiler carcasses. In experiment 1, coliforms and Escherichia coli were determined by the whole-carcass rinse (WCR) method and by scraping the skin surface and rinsing the blade (BR). In each of 2 replicate trials, 4 prechill broiler carcasses were collected from 2 different commercial processing plants. The WCR method was conducted on each carcass, then a blunt edge blade was used to scrape an area measuring approximately 80 cm(2) of the breast (front) skin and on the back of the carcass. After scraping, each blade and adhering residue was rinsed in 30 mL of 0.1% peptone. One milliliter of rinsate each from the WCR and BR was plated to determine total coliforms and E. coli. In experiment 2, 6 carcasses were collected from a processing plant in each of 2 replicate trials. Carcasses were split, with one half scraped on all skin surfaces, and the other half remaining unscraped as a control; all halves were then subjected to half-carcass rinses using 200 mL of 0.1% peptone. Coliforms and E. coli were enumerated. Results from both experiments are reported as log cfu/mL. In experiment 1, mean coliform WCR counts (5.1) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than back BR (2.8), which were higher than front BR (2.2). Mean E. coli WCR counts (4.5) were higher than back BR (2.4), which were higher than front BR (1.6). The counts for BR adjusted for the greater surface area sampled by WCR were still lower than the WCR counts. Experiment 2 results showed no difference between control and scraped carcass halves for coliforms (4.7) or E. coli (4.6). Overall, results showed that scraping either prior to or after rinsing did not increase enumeration of coliforms or E. coli. Scraping could be a viable method to compare the numbers of bacteria on different areas of the same carcass. 3abroiler chickens 3acoliform bacteria 3abacterial contamination 3afood surfaces 3aquantitative analysis 3asurface area 3afood contamination 3awashing 3afood microbiology 3achicken carcasses 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aCason, J.A.1 aFletcher, D.L.1 aHannah, J.F.0 tPoultry science.g2007 July, v.  86, no.  7 p.1436-1439x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/86.7.14363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/81823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071218b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001800148245005700166300001600223500002400239500001500263520125500278650001401533650001901547650001901566650002201585650001901607650001401626650001401640650001001654650001501664650000901679650002001688650001701708650001101725650001701736650002401753653001701777653002801794773007601822852000901898856011101907930003302018945002502051946001102076961001302087655001202100IND4397892420221118031054.0071116s1997    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439789242DNAL7 a10113/76192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aX1001 aNearing, M.A.10aMechanics of soil detachment by raindrops and runoff  ap. 552-556.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoil erosion encompasses detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles by the erosive forces of raindrops and surface flow of water. Average shear stresses of flowing water are on the order of Pa. They are much less than the shear strength of soils, which even for the case of tensile failure are on the order of kPa. This discrepancy is explained in terms of the coherent structure of turbulent flow, whereby transient shear stresses on the bed are much greater than the average flow shear stresses. A microscale probabilistic model, E = FPM, is constructed, which describes the probability P that the instantaneous shear stresses of turbulent flow, which occur at a spatial and temporal frequency F exceed the local resistant strength of the soil particles and cause a mass M to be detached. Raindrops impart dynamic, transitory stresses to the soil that are on the order of hundreds of kPa. The pressures generated upon impact of a raindrop are dependent upon the velocity of the drop and the velocities of the compressional waves that move through the two-phase soil material. Uneven pressures under the drop impact cause a crater to be formed, and lateral jetting of water across the bulge of the crater causes the soil to be detached. 3asediments 3asediment yield 3aturbulent flow 3ainterrill erosion 3ashear strength 3aparticles 3aequations 3adepth 3awater flow 3arain 3araindrop impact 3ashear stress 3arunoff 3arill erosion 3asediment deposition 0asoil erosion 0asoil prticle detachment0 tEurasian soil science.g1997, v.  30, no.  5 p.552-556x1064-22937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071206b20080102c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03238naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002100133040001800154072001700172100001500189245015800204300001600362500002400378506007600402520160700478506003702085650003102122650002502153650002602178650002802204650001702232650001602249650002302265650001202288650001202300650001002312650002602322650003002348650002102378653001602399700001602415773009602431852000902527856011202536930003302648945002502681946001302706961001302719655001202732IND4375220520221207140524.0051014e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437522052DNAL7 a192628632pmid7 aPMC26209502pmcid7 a10113/189222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, the reproduction of Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Paratrichodorus minor, Pratylenchus brachyurus, and Meloidogyne javanica race 3 on pearl millet ('HGM-100' and TifGrain 102) was compared relative to cotton, corn, and peanut. Separate greenhouse experiments were conducted for each nematode species. Reproduction of B. longicaudatus was lower on peanut and the two millet hybrids than on cotton and corn. Reproduction of P. minor was lower on peanut and TifGrain 102 than on cotton, corn, and HGM-100. Reproduction of P. brachyurus was lower on both millet hybrids than on cotton, corn, and peanut. Reproduction of M. javanica race 3 was greater on peanut than on the two millet hybrids and corn. Cotton was a nonhost. TifGrain 102 was more resistant than HGM-100 to reproduction of B. longicaudatus, P. minor, and M. javanica. Our results demonstrated that TifGrain 102 was a poor host for B. longicaudatus and P. brachyurus (Rf < 1) and, relative to other crops tested, was less likely to increase densities of P. minor and M. javanica.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBelonolaimus longicaudatus 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aParatrichodorus minor 3aPratylenchus brachyurus 3areproduction 3ahost plants 3aPennisetum glaucum 3ahybrids 3amillets 3acrops 3abiological resistance 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ahost preferences 0ahost status1 aHanna, W.W.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 June, v.  37, no.  2 p.214-219wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/189223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02183naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001700156245007800173300001800251500002400269500001500293520075300308650001801061650001401079650001201093650001501105650002501120650002401145650003601169650002101205650001101226650001001237650002301247650002701270653002701297653001401324653003101338700001701369773008801386852000901474856011001483930003301593945002501626946001301651961001301664655001201677IND4392513520221123020855.0070618e196710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439251352DNAL7 a10113/4252hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF833 0aF2001 aMartin, F.W.14aThe tubers, sapogenins, and virus resistance of Dioscorea species hybrids  ap. 1158-1162.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDioscorea species differ in sapogenin content, tuber size and shape, and virus resistance.

Characteristics of the tuber and resistance to a virus were observed and compared to those of the parents. The presence of particular sapogenins appeared to be a dominant trait modified by minor genes from either parent. Other traits appeared to be determined by many genes. Heterosis was expressed in some hybrids by superior yields and excellent virus tolerance. Some of the hybrids could be used as clonal varieties, but none contained the desired keto sapogenins except in mixtures with diosgenin. 3aplant viruses 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3asapogenins 3aDioscorea floribunda 3aDioscorea composita 3achemical constituents of plants 3amedicinal plants 3atubers 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3ainheritance (genetics) 0aDioscorea spiculiflora 0aDioscorea 0aDioscorea friedrichsthalii1 aDelfel, N.E.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g1967 Oct., v.  54, no.  9 p.1158-1162x0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/4253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070621b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03325naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003500117024002500152024004100177024002300218040001800241100001900259245022900278506002800507506003200535520150300567596004502070506003702115650002402152650002302176650001402199650002702213650001702240650001102257650002502268650001202293650001602305650001102321650002202332650001102354650001902365650001002384700001902394700001802413700006102431700002002492700001902512700002002531773008902551856008502640903002202725961001502747852000902762655001202771IND60762047120221207065639.0220107e20211211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076204712DNAL7 a10113/76204712hdl7 a10.3390/molecules262475042doi7 a4392402aris_accn_no7 a6038-22000-007-000D2aris_project_no7 a3898512seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurtca, Mehmet10aChemical Composition of Essential Oils From Leaves and Fruits of Juniperus Foetidissima and Their Attractancy and Toxicity to Two Economically Important Tephritid Fruit Fly Species, Ceratitis Capitata and Anastrepha Suspensa  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aThe present study analyzed the chemical composition of Juniperus foetidissima Willd. leaf and fruit essential oils (EOs) and evaluated their attractancy and toxicity against two agriculturally important tephritid fruit flies. The composition of the hydrodistilled EOs obtained from leaves (JFLEO) and fruits (JFFEO) of J. foetidissima were analyzed by GC-FID and GC/MS. The main compounds were alpha-pinene (45%) and cedrol (18%) in the JFLEO and alpha-pinene (42%), alpha-thujone (12%), and beta-thujone (25%) in the JFFEO. In behavioral bioassays with male Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), both JFLEO and JFFEO showed strong attraction, comparable to that observed with two positive controls, Melaleuca alternifolia and Tetradenia riparia EOs. In topical bioassays with female adults of Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew), the toxicity of JFFEO was two-fold higher than that of JFLEO, with the LD50 values of 10.46 and 22.07 ug/uL, respectively. This can be due to differences in chemical components between JFLEO and JFFEO. The JFFEO was dominated by 48% monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH) and 46% oxygenated monoterpenes (OM), while JFLEO possessed 57% MH, 18% OM, and 20% oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OS). This is the first study to evaluate attractancy and toxicity of J. foetidissima EOs against tephritid fruit flies. Our results indicate that JFFEO has potential application for management of pest tephritid fruit flies and further investigation is warranted.  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnastrepha suspensa 3aCeratitis capitata 3aJuniperus 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aalpha-pinene 3acedrol 3achemical composition 3afemales 3afruit flies 3afruits 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaves 3alethal dose 50 3amales1 aTumen, Ibrahim1 aKeskin, Hasan1 aTabanca, Nurhayat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2802-87961 aYang, Xiangbing1 aDemirci, Betul1 aKendra, Paul E.0 tMolecules.g2021 Dec. 11, v. 26, no. 24 p.7504-wJournal:jnl4203821x1420-30497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules262475043Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007000126300001600196520051100212650002000723650001100743650002100754650002000775650001800795653001600813700001700829700001400846700001600860773006700876852000900943930003300952945001300985946001100998655001201009IND2039920220221116223520.0940531s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203992022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbera, R.12aA DPCSV method for the determination of nickel in infant formulas  ap. 427-430.  aA useful method for nickel determination in infant formulas is described.

Its antifungal effect on oomycetes can be partly explained by a direct effect on the inhibition of the growth of mycelium (e.g., Plasmopara spp.) by competing for the assimilation of phosphates. Its efficacy is increased by an indirect effect of enhancing natural plant defences via release of ethylphosphonate inside the plant tissue, triggering salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways. In pome fruit, fosetyl-Al exerts interesting activity against bacteria through reduced host susceptibility against the bacteria Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae. It additionally promotes intrinsic flower bud quality and the sink strength potential of flower clusters and may support the plant in overcoming abiotic stress. Evidence has been given that the Plant Defense Enhancement (PDE) effect of fosetyl-Al intensifies the plant immune response against a broad number of ascomycetes such as Stemphylium vesicarium, Venturia inaequalis, Alternaria spp. and Podosphaera leucotricha. Fosetyl-Al offers remarkable persistency against the epiphytic growing S. vesicarium fungus in âConferenceâ (Pyrus communis L.) pears and reduces the conidial infections of V. inaequalis on newly formed leaves. This potential makes fosetyl-Al an interesting partner in the overall disease control strategy in pears and other crops.

Aliette (fosetyl-Al) has been registered against fire blight in Belgium in 2012 as a PDE molecule with applications starting in the post-floral period on pear and at the end of bloom on apple. A PDE molecule like fosetyl-Al should be positioned preventively, prior to the infection, so that the defense mechanisms of the plants can be switched on in time. A reduction in the disease progression and a clear reduction in the ooze formation on the infected tissues were observed on plants treated 3 times preventively with fosetyl-Al and this is considered to be a very interesting factor in the fire blight epidemiology. Furthermore, after hail during the summer period, fosetyl-Al can interfere with the ooze formation on the infected immature fruits and lower the disease spread. To protect the flowering period, the efficacy of the bacterial antagonist Bacillus subtilis, is tested. The antagonistic bacteria Bacillus subtilis can act against fire blight through a competition with Erwinia amylovora for site and nutrients on the stigma of the flowers and through the production of antimicrobial peptides. In 2013 and 2014, the efficacy of different formulations of Bacillus subtilis QST 7013, applied alone or in combination with fosetyl-Al, was assessed against artificial inoculations of flower clusters and young, active growing shoots on potted âConferenceâ pear trees under optimal infection conditions in the quarantine greenhouse. The results showed interesting activity of the bacterial antagonist against Erwinia amylovora: a reduction in the disease progression as necrosis and a limitation of the ooze formation on the infected tissue was observed. A combination of the protection of blossoms with Bacillus subtilis followed by the PDE activity of fosetyl-Al looks promising. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aErwinia amylovora 3aantagonists 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapples 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease course 3aepidemiology 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3ahail 3anecrosis 3anutrients 3apears 3aquarantine 3ashoots 3astigma 3astreptomycin 3asummer 3atissues 3atrees 3aBelgium1 aVerjans, W.1 aDeckers, T.1 aMaeyer, L. de1 aBylemans, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.485-492dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.65  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003900129300001400168520121100182650001601393650002001409650002001429650002101449650003101470650002701501650002301528700002001551773006501571852000901636930003301645945001301678946001101691655001201702IND2040023220221116223829.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsiari, M.C.10aManufacture of low-fat Feta cheese  ap. 53-60.  aFeta cheese was manufactured by the traditional procedure from ewe's milk containing 6.0 (control), 4.5, 3.0, or 1.5% fat. Results indicated that, as the fat content of cheese milk decreased, the FDM, MNFS, and yield values of Feta cheese significantly decreased, but the moisture and protein values significantly increased. Salt, S/M, pH, and acidity values of cheeses were not affected by the fat level in the cheese milk. The extents of proteolysis and lipolysis in the cheeses decreased as the amount of milk fat decreased. Body and texture, and flavour scores of cheeses were adversely affected by the decreases in the amount of milk fat, but significant differences in these characteristics were observed between cheeses only at 180 d of storage for the former and throughout storage for the latter. The rheological properties of cheeses were not significantly affected by the fat level in the cheese milk, but cheeses tended to become firmer (less fracturable), shorter, and harder as fat in the milk decreased. Good low-fat Feta cheese with acceptable flavour, body, and texture can be manufactured from cheese milk containing 1.5% fat. No off-flavour or bitterness was noted in any low-fat cheese. 3afeta cheese 3afood processing 3alow fat cheeses 3afood composition 3aphysicochemical properties 3arheological properties 3asensory evaluation1 aVoutsinas, L.P.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 1 p.53-60x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01870naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009600129300001600225500001500241520077000256650002201026650001401048650001901062650002601081650002301107650001801130650002201148650001701170650001701187650001801204650001601222650000901238650001601247650001501263653001601278700002101294773006701315852000901382930003301391945001301424946001101437655001201448IND2040034520221116223848.0940603s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204003452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Harbi, M.M.10aChemical and biological evaluation of discarded frying palm oil from commercial restaurants  ap. 395-401.  a2019-12-05  aA chemical and biological evaluation of two frying palm oil samples (A and B) discarded by commercial restaurants is reported. The degree of deterioration of the discarded palm oil was chemically estimated by 10 ordinary laboratory methods and five quick-test methods, and the biological effects of the oil were investigated by feeding rats with standard diet containing 20% discarded palm oil for 28 days. The chemical measurements indicated a severe deterioration during frying operations, particularly in sample A, which increased liver index and induced a nonsignificant decrease in platelet aggregation when compared with sample B. Both samples reduced spleen index, but had no effects on animal growth, heart and thymus indices, or aorta prostacyclin release. 3ablood coagulation 3apalm oils 3aliver function 3acooking fats and oils 3aexperimental diets 3adeterioration 3achemical analysis 3afood quality 3aprostacyclin 3aanimal organs 3arestaurants 3arats 3adegradation 3afood waste 0afood wastes1 aAl-Kahtani, H.A.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.395-401x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03195naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245017800166300001600344500010000360520193100460650002502391650001902416650001702435650001302452650001702465650001002482650001302492650001902505650001502524650002402539650001702563700001702580700001402597773014602611856005502757852000902812655001202821IND4533522420221116224328.0160212e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352242DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aEffects of Harvest Maturity, Production Year, Storage Temperature, and Post-Storage Ethylene Conditioning on Ripening Capacity of 1-MCP Treated âdâAnjouâ Pear  ap. 573-578.  aPaper presented at the XII International Pear Symposium held Jul 14-18, 2014, Leuven, (Belgium)  aA continuing challenge for commercializing 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) to control superficial scald (SS) and extend storage life of âdâAnjouâ pear (Pyrus communis L.) is how to initiate ripening capacity (RC) in 1-MCP treated fruit following cold storage. âDâAnjouâ pears harvested at 3 maturities (H1 â 66.7 N, H2 â 58.0 N, and H3 â 55.6 N) were treated with 1-MCP at 0.15 Âµl L-1 and stored either at the commercial storage temperature -1.1Â°C (1-MCP at -1.1Â°C), or at 1.1Â°C (1-MCP at 1.1Â°C) or 2.2Â°C (1-MCP at 2.2Â°C) for 8 months in 2011 and 2012. Control fruit stored at -1.1Â°C developed RC and significant SS within 7 d at 20Â°C following 2-5 and 3-5 months in 2011 and 2012, respectively. While 1-MCP at -1.1Â°C fruit developed neither RC nor SS for 8 months, 1-MCP at 1.1Â°C fruit developed RC with relatively low levels of SS within 7 d at 20Â°C following 5-8 and 6-8 months in 2011 and 2012, respectively. 1-MCP at 2.2Â°C fruit lost quality (yellowing and decay) quickly during storage. Post-storage ethylene conditioning could not ripen 1-MCP at -1.1Â°C fruit until 7-8 and 8 months in 2011 and 2012, respectively, however, ripened 1-MCP at 1.1Â°C fruit following 4-6 months in both production years. H1 and H2 fruit were similar in responding to 1-MCP with respect to developing RC. 1-MCP treated H3 fruit developed RC following 7-8 months of storage at -1.1Â°C in 2011 but did not develop RC for 8 months in 2012. In conclusion, storage at 1.1Â°C can facilitate the initiation of RC in 1-MCP treated âdâAnjouâ pears with relatively low SS following 6-8 months of cold storage; PSEC can ripen the 1-MCP at 1.1Â°C fruit following 4-6 months of cold storage. Late harvest may not be a useful protocol for ripening 1-MCP treated âdâAnjouâ pears due to an inconsistent efficacy among production years. 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aPyrus communis 3acold storage 3aethylene 3aharvest date 3apears 3aripening 3ascald diseases 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3astorage time1 aXie, Xingbin1 aSugar, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.573-578dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.77  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013700127300001600264520141100280650001601691650001401707650003001721650001601751650001301767653001901780653001501799700001501814700001401829773006701843852000901910930003301919945001301952946001101965655001201976IND2040037120221116223437.0940603s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204003712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, K.14aThe appropriateness of using cyanocobalamin as calibration standards in Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 assay of vitamin B12  ap. 427-429.  aThe appropriateness of using solutions of cyanocobalamin as the calibration standards in Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 assay of total vitamin B12 in foods, plasma and serum was examined. This is because the forms of the vitamins that may be present after the addition of sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, sodium metabisulphite or sodium nitrite in the sample extraction procedure are hydroxocobalamin, sulphitocobalamin, cyanocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, dicyanocobalamin and nitritocobalamin, depending on the form of endogenous vitamin B12. Therefore, if Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 has a higher or lower growth response to cyanocobalamin than to the other potential forms of cobalamin, the amount of vitamin B12 determined by comparisons with calibration standards prepared from cyanocobalamin will be an under- or over-estimation. The results of this study showed that the growth response of Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 to cyanocobalamin was similar to its growth responses to hydroxocobalamin, sulphitocobalamin, dicyanocobalamin and nitritocobalamin but lower than that to adenosylcobalamin and higher than that to methylcobalamin. Thus, total vitamin B12 cannot be measured accurately using Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 assay which employs cyanocobalamin as its calibration standards if adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin is present. 3avitamin B12 3abioassays 3aLactobacillus leichmannii 3acalibration 3aaccuracy 0acyanocobalamin 0acobalamins1 aBriggs, D.1 aJones, G.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.427-429x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01676naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014300127300001600270520077400286650001601060650001401076650003001090650001801120650002101138650001301159653001601172700001501188700001401203773006701217852000901284930003301293945001301326946001101339655001201350IND2040037620221116223937.0940603s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204003762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, K.10aComparison of a competitive binding assay with Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830 assay for the determination of vitamin B12 in foods  ap. 431-434.  aThe results obtained by a competitive binding method for the determination of vitamin B12 in food were compared with those obtained by a widely used microbiological assay with Lactobacillus leichmannii A.T.C.C. 7830. Both assays were performed on the same sample extract. The extraction was carried out at pH 4.5, 121 degrees C for 10 min with 0.1 m sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer in the presence of potassium cyanide. A high correlation (r2 = 0.841) between the results from the two methods was found.

A procedure allowing its detection in beef extract down to a level of 1 ppm was developed using sample enrichment by solid-phase extraction and on-line detection by electrospray LC/MS. It is shown that detectable levels of BMP do not occur naturally, in beef digests, or in cooked or grilled beef. Furthermore, a thorough sensory evaluation showed that BMP, when tasted in water, is described as having a strong acid and astringent taste. Tasting in beef stock, both with and without added NaCl or monosodium glutamate, revealed that the compound has little or no detectable flavor or flavor enhancing properties. Therefore, BMP cannot be considered as a flavor carrier or a potential flavor enhancer. 3abeef 3abeef extracts 3aflavor 3aflavor enhancers 3amonosodium glutamate 3asensory evaluation 3asodium chloride 3asolid phase extraction 3ataste1 aCazes, D.1 aFay, L.B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1351-1355x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960710h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01859naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001200137245018800149300001800337520061700355650001700972650001300989650000901002650001701011650001701028650001501045650001201060650002601072650002201098650001401120650001001134650002701144700001801171700001301189773010201202852000901304856007701313930003301390945001301423946001301436655001201449IND2124294120221116223951.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960482r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, W.10aDetection of two naturally occurring structural isomers of partially hydrolyzed fumonisin B1 in corn by on-line capillary liquid chromatography-fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry  ap. 1251-1255.  aFifteen corn kernel and corn screening samples were analyzed for the presence of fumonisin toxins.

On the experimental plots the larval translation was highest at the beginning of July and in the second part of September, following high mean weekly temperatures. Between July and September peak recovery of larvae from herbage occurred 4 weeks after contamination. A seasonal pattern of larval translation similar to that on the experimental plots could be demonstrated on the grazed pastures when the number of larvae per m2 of pasture had been adjusted to the previous egg output by means of a contamination index. The resulting 'relative larval density' is regarded as a good indicator for larval development on pasture. From July to September the larval population on pasture resulted mainly from the egg contamination 2-3 weeks earlier. The short persistence of the infective larvae on herbage was probably due to the frequent and heavy rainfall throughout the season, causing a passive washout of larvae into the soil. On single pastures the larval density started to increase within 1 week after the calves had first contact with these fields. The impact of the calves on the distribution of larvae is discussed. 3aCooperia oncophora 3anematode larvae 3abiological development 3apastures 3aambient temperature 3aair temperature 3aweather 3aseasonal variation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxtransmission 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aTrichostrongyloideaxgrowth & development 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aWeather 3aGermany1 aSchnieder, T.1 aLopmeier, F.J.1 aStoye, M.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1992 Sept., v. 22, no. 6 p.719-730x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02292naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245008100152300001800233520116200251650001801413650001401431650001001445650001301455650001801468650001101486650001601497650001601513650001101529650002201540650001101562650001001573651001101583700001401594700001501608773010201623852000901725856007701734930003301811945001301844946001301857655001201870IND2124291820221116223746.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429182DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960547q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.K.10aContents of phenolics and alkaloids in Areca catechu Linn. during maturation  ap. 1185-1188.  aBetel quid is a popular masticatory in Taiwan. Fresh unripe areca fruit, the fruit of Areca catechu Linn., is the main ingredient of betel quid. In this study, the information on the measurements of phenolics and alkaloids in A. catechu Linn. was obtained. The phenolics in A. catechu Linn. were mainly distributed in root followed by fresh unripe fruit, leaf, spike, and vein, while the contents of alkaloids in A. catechu Linn. were in the order of root, fresh unripe fruit, spike, leaf, and vein. Total amounts of phenolics in areca fruit were well correlated with the length and maturation, but those of alkaloids were only correlated with the maturation. Upside-down areca fruit, areca fruit growing upward (opposite to normal fruits, growing downward), contained a much higher amount of arecaidine (4 mg/g of fresh wt) than normal fresh unripe areca fruit (1.5 mg/g of fresh wt). Tender shoot, the upper young stem of the tree, cooked as a delicious syrup, contained a small amount of total phenolics (0.58 mg of gallic acid equiv/g of fresh wt), condensed tannin (0.85 mg of catechin equiv/g of fresh wt), and total alkaloids (2.38 mg/g of fresh wt). 3aAreca catechu 3aalkaloids 3abetel 3acatechin 3afruit growing 3afruits 3agallic acid 3aingredients 3aleaves 3aproanthocyanidins 3asyrups 3atrees 3aTaiwan1 aLee, W.H.1 aPeng, C.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1185-1188x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960547q3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245014100152300001800293520099400311650004401305650001701349650003801366650001301404650000901417650000901426650001901435650001901454650001601473650000701489650001101496700001301507700001701520773010201537852000901639856007701648930003301725945001301758946001301771655001201784IND2124290420221116224045.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429042DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960360z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoye, J.I.10aUse of differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy in the study of thermal and structural stability of alpha-lactalbumin  ap. 1116-1125.  aStructural changes of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lac) in response to pH, ionic strength, sugars, and heat treatment were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. From DSC, two reversible transitions at 39.6 degrees C (A) and 64.8 degrees C (B) were observed when alpha-lac was heated. At pH 3, transition A was partially reversible (14%) while transition B was completely reversible. At pH 9, both transitions were completely irreversible. Heating alpha-lac at pH 3 resulted in aggregation with no observed gelation; at pH 9 a translucent gel was formed. FTIR showed that at pH 3, denaturation of alpha-lac resulted in the appearance of two bands at 1616 and 1685 cm-1 attributed to intermolecular aggregation. These bands were absent at alkaline pH. The major effects of heat treatment of alpha-lac were loss in the bands attributed to alpha-helix, 3(10)-helix, and beta-sheet and increase in the bands attributed to turns. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aionic strength 3alactalbumin 3apH 3asugars1 aAlli, I.1 aIsmail, A.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1116-1125x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960360z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02265naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245007700154300001800231520102400249650002501273650002301298650001401321650001001335650002801345650001901373650004301392650001001435650002201445650001401467650002201481650002401503650001401527650001001541700001601551700001701567773010201584852000901686856007701695930003301772945001301805946001301818655001201831IND2124288920221116223454.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428892DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96055572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, M.10aAntioxidant compounds from buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) hulls  ap. 1039-1044.  aEthanolic extracts of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) hulls were separated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography into eight fractions. Five of the fractions exhibited peroxyl radical-scavenging activity by inhibiting the oxidation of methyl linoleate in solution. Two of the antioxidant fractions contained proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) from the color reaction of these fractions with HCl under heat treatment. Five antioxidant compounds were isolated by preparative HPLC and identified as quercetin, hyperin, rutin, protocatechuic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. The contents of these active compounds in the buckwheat hulls were as follows: protocatechuic acid (13.4 mg/100 g of dried hulls), 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (6.1 mg/100 g), hyperin (5.0 mg/100 g), rutin (4.3 mg/100 g), and quercetin (2.5 mg/100 g). Besides the isolation of these compounds, two major compounds that showed no peroxyl radical-scavenging activity in the extract were isolated and identified as vitexin and isovitexin. 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aactive ingredients 3abuckwheat 3acolor 3afree radical scavengers 3aheat treatment 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahulls 3ahydrochloric acid 3aoxidation 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aquercetin 3arutin1 aOhshita, Y.1 aTsushida, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1039-1044x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96055573Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle04643naa a2200985 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100002100198245012300219300001800342500002400360500001500384520153000399650001001929650001201939650001501951650001901966650001901985650002102004650001302025650002102038650002102059650002802080650002802108650001102136650001202147650002702159650002102186650001102207650002502218650002902243650001202272650001902284650002202303650002602325650003602351650001302387650007802400650006902478650001702547650008002564650002402644650004102668650004102709650004102750650002202791650003202813650002702845650007102872650002802943650002402971650002502995653002403020653001303044653001203057653001503069653002103084653001603105653001903121653002903140653001903169653001103188653002803199653002303227653001003250700002203260700001903282700001903301700002203320700002103342773011003363852000903473856009203482930003303574945002503607946001303632655001203645IND4425509120221116223600.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442550912DNAL7 a198954812pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01272.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aQ400 0aQ2001 aMkaddem, Mounira10aChemical Composition and Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activities of Mentha (longifolia L. and viridis) Essential Oils  ap.

GC-MS analysis revealed that M. longifolia was constituted by pulegone (54.41%) as a major component followed by isomenthone (12.02%), 1,8-cineole (7.41%), borneol (6.85%), and piperitenone oxide (3.19%). M. viridis was rich in carvone (50.47%), 1,8-cineole (9.14%), and limonene (4.87%). The antioxidant activity by ABTS assay showed IC₅₀ values of 476.3 ± 11.7 and 195.1 ± 4.2 mg/L for M. longifolia and M. viridis, respectively, the DPPH assays have resulted in a moderate IC₅₀ (>8000 mg/L and 3476.3 ± 133 mg/L for M. longifolia and M. viridis, respectively). Antimicrobial activity showed that Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria were more inhibited by the 2 essential oils tested. Escherichia coli was least susceptible. A strong activity was also observed on fungi and yeasts. Carvone, thymol, and piperitone oxide have not been detected in Tunisian M. longifolia. Camphor is reported for the 1st time for M. viridis.

The spread of these weeds is generally in concert with cattle grazing, so that fauna or habitat change is due to multiple interrelated causes. In this study we investigated whether the spread of the introduced pasture grass Bothriochloa pertusa and replacement of the native bluegrass B. ewartiana in eucalypt woodlands of northern Queensland has had an effect on terrestrial vertebrate fauna. We located 40 sites that sampled a range of native and introduced pastures cover, and investigated the spatial pattern of abundance with canonical analysis of principle coordinates, and correlation of the habitat attributes on the ordination space. We then selected a subset of four habitat attributes (eliminating highly colinear variables) and modelled species response to each using an information-theoretic approach. Thirty-one species (26 birds, one mammal and four reptiles) and two summary variables (bird abundance and richness) had best subset Akaike Information Criteria models with reliable parameters estimates. Seventeen models contained the B. pertusa frequency term and a further 16 had a term relating to upper storey cover (tree cover >10, 5-10 or 3-5m). Though pasture grass cover, grazing and habitat features were correlated and thus we cannot ascribe B. pertusa as the sole determinant of fauna species change, this study has demonstrated that tropical savanna woodlands with changing Bothriochloa dominance from native to introduced species have different fauna species composition. In particular bird species richness, ground nesting species (e.g. rufous songlark Cincloramphus mathewsi, golden-headed cisticola Cisticola exilis) and terrestrial reptiles (e.g. Carlia munda and Ctenotus taeniolatus) declined. Disturbance-tolerant species such as Australian magpie Cracticus tibicen and yellow-throated miners Manorina flavigula increased in abundance in exotic pasture-dominated sites. As pastoral intensification continues in northern Australian rangelands there is a potential for significant change in the relative abundance and composition of vertebrate fauna and the reduction or loss of some species in the landscape. 3aBothriochloa pertusa 3aEucalyptus 3abirds 3acattle 3aecosystems 3afauna 3agrasses 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apastures 3arangelands 3areptiles 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aweeds 3awoodlands 3aQueensland1 aFisher, Alaric0 tRangeland journal.g2011, v. 33, no. 1 p.49-58dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ10065 7aarticle02036naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245007900152300001800231520091100249650002101160650001301181650002101194650001101215650001501226650001101241650001501252650002001267650001001287700001601297700001601313700001401329700001701343700001801360773010301378852000901481856007701490930003301567945001301600946001301613655001201626IND2138029920221116223407.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802992DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970102h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabras, P.10aEffect of epicuticular waxes of fruits on the photodegradation of fenthion  ap. 3681-3683.  aAfter treatment lipophilic pesticides tend to diffuse by penetrating the epicuticular wax of fruits. In this way, solar radiation only acts on pesticide molecules after passing through the waxes. The effect of epicuticular waxes of three fruits (orange, nectarine, and olive) on the photodegradation of fenthion was studied. The waxes affected the photodegradation process of fenthion. The decay rate of fenthion increased in the presence of orange and nectarine waxes, while it decreased when olive wax was used. In all waxes, the transformation of fenthion produced mainly fenthion sulfoxide and low amounts of fenthion sulfone. In orange wax, 50% of the initial fenthion was transformed into unknown compounds. In nectarine wax, fenthion was degraded stoichiometrically into fenthion sulfoxide and fenthion sulfone. In olive wax, the photodegradation of fenthion yielded about 80% of fenthion sulfoxide. 3aepicuticular wax 3afenthion 3afenthion sulfone 3afruits 3anectarines 3aolives 3aphotolysis 3asolar radiation 3awaxes1 aAngioni, A.1 aGarau, V.L.1 aMelis, M.1 aPirisi, F.M.1 aMinelli, E.V.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3681-3683x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970102h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02079naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245007100156300001800227520095000245650002301195650001201218650001501230650002101245650001201266650001001278650001501288650001501303650001601318650002101334650002401355650000901379700001201388700002101400773010301421852000901524856007701533930003301610945001301643946001301656655001201669IND2138029320221116223830.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802932DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970298l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchocken, M.J.10aMicrobial transformations of the fungicide cyprodinil (CGA-219417)  ap. 3647-3651.  aA collection of 12 microbial cultures, known to contain cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase or other degradative enzymes, was screened for their ability to degrade the Novartis Crop Protection Inc. developmental fungicide cyprodinil (CGA-219417; 4-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-N-phenyl-2-pyrimidinamine).

The overall results of the study indicated that cyprodinil was readily metabolized by a variety of microbial species. Metabolites generated by these cultures can potentially be used as analytical reference standards to support animal, plant, and soil metabolism studies. 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aanimals 3acyprodinil 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3afungi 3aglycosides 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aplant protection 3areference standards 3asoil1 aMao, J.1 aSchabacker, D.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3647-3651x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970298l3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02134naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245018700153300001800340520087800358650002201236650001201258650001801270650001701288650001801305650001701323650001101340650002001351650002401371650002501395650001201420650001001432700001901442700001501461773010301476852000901579856007701588930003301665945001301698946001301711655001201724IND2138027920221116223546.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802792DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960859t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhetton, M.10aNutritive evaluation of nitrogenous fractions in leaves of Gliricida sepium and Caliandra calothyrsus in relation to tannin content and protein degradation by rumen microbes in vitro  ap. 3570-3576.  aA study of two fodder tree species, Gliricidia sepium and Caliandra calothyrsus, was undertaken to investigate the degradation of leaf protein (crude and soluble protein) by rumen microbes during in vitro fermentation and the effect of total tannin content on that degradation. Differences in DMD and protein degradation were observed between the two leaf species. C. calothyrsus, after extraction with 70% acetone, showed greater DMD and crude protein losses, 40% and 20% greater, respectively. The cumulative gas production of C. calothyrsus was increased after extraction with 70% acetone. It was concluded that the differences in protein degradation characteristics were mainly due to the inhibitory effects of tannins. The apparent increased resistance of glycoproteins to degradation appeared to be of relatively minor importance to the nutritive value of the fodder. 3aGliricidia sepium 3aacetone 3acrude protein 3afermentation 3aglycoproteins 3aleaf protein 3aleaves 3anutritive value 3aprotein degradation 3arumen microorganisms 3atannins 3atrees1 aRossiter, J.T.1 aWood, C.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3570-3576x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960859t3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01968naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245018700154300001800341520091700359650002201276650001401298650001201312650001701324650002101341650001401362700001801376773010301394852000901497856007701506930003301583945001301616946001301629655001201642IND2138028420221116224002.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802842DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970065u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmore, J.S.10aInvestigation of the reaction between ammonium sulfide, aldehydes, and alpha-hydroxyketones or alpha-dicarbonyls to form some lipid-Maillard interaction products found in cooked beef  ap. 3595-3602.  aAqueous reaction mixtures containing alpha-dicarbonyls (2,3-butanedione or 2,3-pentanedione) or alpha-hydroxyketones (1-hydroxypropanone, 1-hydroxy-2-butanone, or 3-hydroxy-2-butanone), alkanals (C4-C10) and ammonium sulfide were heated at 140 degrees C for 30 min.

On its own, alpha-la did not form aggregates, and beta-lg formed large aggregates with no evidence for intermediates. However, the two proteins interacted to form soluble aggregates, as well as larger particles, by means of both disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Two main soluble products were identified: high molecular weight components with molecular masses in excess of 300 000 Da and intermediate aggregates with molecular weights in the region of 100 000 Da. The aggregation process was substantially affected, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by the relative proportions of alpha-la and beta-lg: when the weight fraction of alpha-la in the mixture was <0.3, the smaller aggregates were not induced, whereas they were formed at higher weight fractions and were the only product at a weight fraction of alpha-la of 0.95. The composition of the aggregates changed during heating and was different for each mixture, but it always approximated the beta-lg/alpha-la ratio of the initial mixture after about 8 min of heating. The different interactions observed at the different ratios of proteins may explain the enhancement of heat-induced gelation of beta-lg by alpha-la. 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adenaturation 3adisulfide bonds 3agel chromatography 3agelation 3aheat 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alactalbumin 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein content 3aweight 3awhey protein1 aSenaratne, V.1 aFrancois, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3459-3464x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970113a3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245012200153300001800275520108500293650001601378650001201394650002301406650001201429650004101441650004301482650000901525650001301534650001601547650001901563700001701582700001701599700002101616773010301637852000901740856007701749930003301826945001301859946001301872655001201885IND2138027220221116223311.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802722DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970072i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiles, J.E.10aDetermination of bisphenol-A in reusable polycarbonate food-contact plastics and migration to food-simulating liquids  ap. 3541-3544.  aBisphenol-A (BPA) is a principal reactant in the preparation of polycarbonate (PC) plastics and has been shown in in vitro cell proliferation studies to exhibit estrogen-like characteristics. Reusable baby bottles, water carboys, and other housewares are often made of PC. A high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) protocol was used to determine residual BPA in PC and BPA migrated to food simulants in contact with PC under controlled time/temperature conditions. Confirmation of BPA was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Residual amounts of BPA found in PC food contact articles ranged from 7 to 58 micrograms/g. In migration tests the plastic was exposed to water, ethanol/water mixtures, and Miglyol (a food oil simulant) in sealed vials at a constant temperature of 65 degrees C, for up to 10 days. BPA in food simulants ranged from 13 to 368% of BPA available to migrate from the polymer. GC-MS methods were applied to the analysis of water stored in reusable PC 5-gal water carboys. The amount of BPA found in the water ranged from ND to 5 ppb. 3abisphenol A 3abottles 3acell proliferation 3aethanol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoils 3aplastics 3atemperature 3awater analysis1 aMcNeal, T.P.1 aBegley, T.H.1 aHollifield, H.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3541-3544x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970072i3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01867naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245004700157300001800204520083200222650003401054650001101088650002001099650004301119650004401162650001201206700001701218700001501235700002101250773010101271852000901372856007701381930003301458945001301491946001301504655001201517IND2163491420221116223427.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349142DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960861k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraubinger, M.10aNovel glycosidic constituents from saffron  ap. 1678-1681.  aThe methanolic extract of saffron was prefractionated with the aid of multilayer coil countercurrent chromatography (MLCCC).

Powdered lignins were added to enzyme incubations, either as isolated or after thorough hydroxypropylation of phenolic sites. Extent of cellulose hydrolysis was reduced by 14-60% by the addition of up to 15% lignin to the substrate. Unmodified lignins were more detrimental to cellulose hydrolysis than hydroxypropylated lignins. The inhibitory effect of lignin addition was only partially overcome by a 10-fold increase in cellulase activity, suggesting inhibitory lignin interactions with both substrate and enzyme. Preincubation of cellulase with underivatized lignins resulted in reduced enzyme activity and soluble protein concentration in the supernatant, suggesting protein precipitation with lignin rather than reduced activity of a lignin-enzyme complex as the inhibitory mechanism. Two further experiments showed that the negative impact of lignin on cellulose hydrolysis can be counteracted by addition of various N compounds and by ammoniation. 3aadditives 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme substrates 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3alignin1 aGlasser, W.G.1 aBeauchemin, K.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1823-1828x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96080743Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245009100151300001800242520086000260650001501120650000801135650001301143650001601156650001101172650001701183650001601200650001701216650001101233650001801244650001601262700001401278700001501292700001501307773010101322852000901423856007701432930003301509945001301542946001301555655001201568IND2163491620221116224002.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349162DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960808w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaron, R.10aChanges in phenolic compounds and browning during biological aging of sherry-type wine  ap. 1682-1685.  aContents of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxycinnamic esters, and monomeric and dimeric derivatives of flavan-3-ol during biological aging of dry pale sherry white wine were measured and compared between wine without aging and wines in five different stages of aging.

According to the changes observed in polyphenol contents and the absorbance data obtained at 420 nm, sherry-type wines seem to be protected from excessive browning during biological aging mainly as a result of the partial removal of flavan-3-ol derivatives, besides the effect of protection from air contact carried out by the flor yeasts growing on the wine surface. 3aabsorbance 3aair 3acatechin 3aepicatechin 3aesters 3aferulic acid 3aflor yeasts 3aprocyanidins 3asherry 3asyringic acid 3awhite wines1 aMayen, M.1 aMerida, J.1 aMedina, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1682-1685x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960808w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01968naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245013900150300001800289520099400307650002201301650002201323650000701345650001701352650002501369700001401394773010101408852000901509856007701518930003301595945001301628946001301641655001201654IND2163488720221116223558.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960458d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, S.J.10aKinetic significance of the Schiff base reversion in the early-stage Maillard reaction of a phenylalanine-glucose aqueous model system  ap. 1619-1623.  aThe kinetic constants (k) and activation energy (E(a)) for the formation (k1, E(a1)) and reversion (k-1, E(a-1)) of the Schiff base complex and for the Amadori rearrangement (k2, E(a2)) of the Maillard reaction were determined in a phenylalanine-glucose system to elucidate its early-stage mechanism.

The E(a2) (8.01 x 10(4) kcal/mol) was slightly greater than the E(a1) (6.52 x 10(4) kcal/mol) and the E(a-1) (7.49 x 10(4) kcal/mol), revealing that the Amadori rearrangement was more sensitive to temperature changes and was more favorable at higher temperatures. These suggested that the chemical nature of the reactants, determined by their structures and pH condition, is more important to control the reaction. These results were also supported by the pH and temperature profiles of the Amadori compound formation. 3aMaillard reaction 3aactivation energy 3apH 3aschiff bases 3atemperature profiles1 aLee, T.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1619-1623x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960458d3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01686naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245009400152300001800246520062100264650001300885650001000898650001700908650002000925650001800945650001200963650001100975650001000986650000900996700001501005700001601020700001801036773010101054852000901155856007701164930003301241945001301274946001301287655001201300IND2163490120221116223437.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960668q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasson, G.10aDemonstration of the presence of carotenoids in wood: quantitative study of cooperage oak  ap. 1649-1652.  aThe presence of beta-carotene and a precursor of lutein is described in wood for the first time. These compounds were found in the wood of sessile oak, pedunculate oak, American white oak, chestnut, and beech. The levels were generally low and varied considerably from one tree to another. Among the European oaks, sessile oak was significantly richer in lutein than pedunculate oak. Sessile oaks from Jupilles forest contained the highest beta-carotene levels. The position of the wood sample in the trunk affected the carotenoid content, and barrel wood is taken from a zone that is fairly rich in these compounds. 3aCastanea 3aFagus 3aQuercus alba 3aQuercus petraea 3abeta-carotene 3aforests 3alutein 3atrees 3awood1 aBaumes, R.1 aPuech, J.L.1 aRazungles, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1649-1652x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960668q3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02552naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245015600152300001800308520132300326650001801649650001501667650001601682650001801698650001701716650001801733650001601751650001101767650004301778650002001821650001101841650001601852700001501868700001301883773010101896852000901997856007702006930003302083945001302116946001302129655001202142IND2163512320221116223530.0980820e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216351232DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970002b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, J.P.10aSeparation and analysis of carotenoids and chlorophylls in Haematococcus lacustris by high-performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection  ap. 1952-1956.  aAn improved HPLC method was developed for the separation and analysis of carotenoids and chlorophylls in a green alga, Haematococcus lacustris. Six astaxanthin esters, the principal carotenoids in H. lacustris, were separated and indicated as astaxanthin esters 1-6. The retention times of the six astaxanthin esters were 11.8, 14.3, 15.0, 18.2, 22.0, and 28.4 min, respectively. Astaxanthin ester 4 was the main astaxanthin ester, which accounted for 44-49% of the total astaxanthin esters. The six astaxanthin esters had the same absorption spectra, and their maximum absorption wavelengths in the mobile phase were all 481.3 nm. Relatively small amounts of beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, and echinenone were detected from the alga extracts compared to astaxanthin esters, lutein, and chlorophylls. During the cultivation, the light intensity for illumination of the culture was increased from 90 to 190 micromol/(m2 s) to investigate its effect on pigment formation. The content of the total astaxanthin esters was higher with enhanced light intensity after 4 days of cultivation (6.8 mg/g of dry weight) than after 8 days of cultivation (5.0 mg/g of dry weight). This HPLC method could be used to separate and determine the various algal pigments and assist in the study of biosynthesis of ketocarotenoids in algae. 3aHaematococcus 3aabsorption 3aastaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3abiosynthesis 3acanthaxanthin 3achlorophyll 3aesters 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alight intensity 3alutein 3awavelengths1 aGong, X.D.1 aChen, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1952-1956x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970002b3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02446naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245012200156300001800278520127000296650002901566650001701595650001601612650002601628650002701654650002001681650001201701650001601713650001301729650001101742650001501753700001701768700001701785773010101802852000901903856007701912930003301989945001302022946001302035655001202048IND2163513720221116224024.0980820e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216351372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960634i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauricio, J.C.10aIn vitro specific activities of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases from two flor yeasts during controlled wine aging  ap. 1967-1971.  aTwo flor yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae strains capensis and bayanus) which form velum on the surface of sherry wine during biological aging have been used. Aldehyde and alcohol (isoenzymes I and II) dehydrogenases were detected in vitro during the entire wine-aging process in the flor yeast strains. All enzymatic activities decreased during the first 155 days of wine aging, and after this period, an increase was observed. Ethanol consumption in the wine and the specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase I were independent of the S. cerevisiae strain. The greater activity of alcohol dehydrogenase II is directly related to the higher acetaldehyde production by S. cerevisiae race bayanus in the wine. This strain has a slower and prolonged growth in the flor film, which permits a continued accumulation of acetaldehyde in the wine. The higher activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase in capensis strain during the flor formation may be related to the production and consumption of large amounts of acetic acid, which involved a more abundant and accelerated cellular growth. We suggest that part of the acetaldehyde might be converted into ethanol during wine aging by alcohol dehydrogenase I in order to maintain a normal redox balance. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetic acid 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3aflor yeasts 3aisozymes 3asherry 3awine aging1 aMoreno, J.J.1 aOrtega, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1967-1971x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960634i3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01276naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245017800154300001800332520033400350650001600684650001200700650001700712650001000729773010200739852000900841856007700850930003300927945001300960946001300973655001200986IND2124301520221116223903.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212430152DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960618l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCutler, H.G.10aSyntheses of 3,7-dimethyl-8-hydroxy-6-methoxyisochroman, the 3,7-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-8-methoxy isomer, and their ester and ether derivatives: plant growth regulatory activity  ap. 1422-1429.  aA systematic investigation of ester and ether derivatives of 3,7-dimethyl-8-hydroxy-6-methoxyisochroman and 3,7-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-8-methoxyisochroman has established that all of the derivatives synthesized exhibited activity in the wheat coleoptile assay, with several of the compounds being more active than the parent systems. 3acoleoptiles 3aisomers 3aplant growth 3awheat0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1422-1429x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960618l3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245017200167300001400339500002400353520181800377650001202195650001502207650001502222650003502237650001402272650001902286650001702305650002002322650001002342650001402352650001602366650001102382650002702393650001702420650001602437650002002453700001702473700001602490700001602506700001502522700001602537700001502553773011402568852000902682856005502691655001202746IND4415338920221116223836.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441533892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00986.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÜlker, H.10aChanges in Testicular Development, Ultrasonographic and Histological Appearance of the Testis in Buck Kids Immunized Against LHRH Using Recombinant LHRH Fusion Protein  ap. 37-43.  aIncludes references  aThis study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of recombinant Ovalbumin-LHRL (OL) immunization on changes in testicular size, histological appearance and testosterone production in buck kids. Thirty native buck kids at 18 weeks of age were divided into three groups, control (n = 10), immunization (n = 10) and castration (n = 10) groups. Immunized animals received OL protein generated by recombinant DNA technology. Ultrasonographic and histological examinations of the testes were performed. Animals were slaughtered at 44 weeks of age. Semen and epididymides were evaluated for the presence of sperm cells. Immunized animals generated anti-LHRH antibodies. Testosterone production, testicular and accessory glands development and sperm production were suppressed in the immunized animals (p < 0.01). Semineferous tubule diameters decreased (p < 0.01), basal membrane of the tubule was thickened and hyalinized in immunized kids. Immunization affected ultrasonographic appearance of the testes drastically. While testes of control animals gained their normal ultrasonographic appearance as the age increased, immunized animals had uniform hypoechogenic testicular structure as observed at 18 weeks of age until slaughter. Simultaneous histological and ultrasonographic evaluations indicated that the changes in testicular histology could partly be monitored via ultrasonographic imaging; nevertheless, it is difficult to claim that ultrasonographic image reflects the exact changes in such instances. In conclusion, these results indicate that recombinant OL fusion protein is effective in immunocastration in buck kids and has a potential to be used as an alternative to physical castration. Further researches should be conducted to help assessing reproductive status of testes from ultrasound images. 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3acastration 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3aimmunization 3arecombinant DNA 3asemen 3aslaughter 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atesticular development 3atestosterone 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography1 aKüçük, M.1 aYılmaz, A.1 aYörük, M.1 aArslan, L.1 adeAvila, DM1 aReeves, JJ0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2009 Feb., v. 44, no. 1 p.37-43dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.00986.x 7aarticle02536naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001800185245012300203300001800326500002400344520111400368650001901482650001901501650002201520650001501542650002401557650003801581650003801619650003201657650003001689700002101719700001901740700001501759700002801774773012201802852000901924856008801933930003302021945002502054946001102079655001202090IND4425684920221116223254.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568492DNAL7 a196473542pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ2001 aHung, Hsu-Wen14aThe organic contamination level based on the total soil mass is not a proper index of the soil contamination intensity  ap. 2928-2932.  aIncludes references  aConcentrations of organic contaminants in common productive soils based on the total soil mass give a misleading account of actual contamination effects. This is attributed to the fact that productive soils are essentially water-saturated, with the result that the soil uptake of organic compounds occurs principally by partition into the soil organic matter (SOM). This report illustrates that the soil contamination intensity of a compound is governed by the concentration in the SOM (Com) rather than by the concentration in whole soil (Cs). Supporting data consist of the measured levels and toxicities of many pesticides in soils of widely differing SOM contents and the related levels in in-situ crops that defy explanation by the Cs values. This SOM-based index is timely needed for evaluating the contamination effects of food crops grown in different soils and for establishing a dependable priority ranking for intended remediation of numerous contamination sites.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of NER ageing and fresh soil addition on the microbial communities responsible for their mineralisation. Soil containing either 15 or 90-day-old NER of ¹³C-2,4-D (NER15 and NER90, respectively) was incubated for 90 days with or without fresh soil. The addition of fresh soil had no effect on the mineralisation of NER90 or of SOM, but increased the extent and rate of NER15 mineralisation. The analyses of ¹³C-enriched FAME (fatty acids methyl esters) profiles showed that the fresh soil amendment only influenced the amount and structure of microbial populations responsible for the biodegradation of NER15. By coupling biological and chemical analyses, we gained some insight into the nature and the biodegradability of pesticide NER. Ageing processes influence the NER mineralisation rate and the microbial population involved. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3a2,4-D 3aherbicide residues 3asoil microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3abiodegradation 3amineralization 3acarbon 3alabeling techniques 3aage of soil 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbon Isotopesxchemistry 2aHerbicidesxmetabolism 2aIsotope Labeling 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aDignac, M.-F.1 aNunan, N.1 aBarriuso, E.1 aMariotti, A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2985-2993dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0583Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03690naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245011300210300001800323500002400341520218500365650001702550650002302567650002102590650002402611650002302635650002002658650002002678650002602698650001402724650002102738651001502759653001702774653002302791653002702814700002302841700002202864700002102886773010202907852000903009856008503018930003303103945002503136946001103161655001203172IND4425634220140725000000.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442563422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9371-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aK001 0aF600 0aF300 0aF5001 aSchumacher, Eva10aInfluence of light and nutrient conditions on seedling growth of native and invasive trees in the Seychelles  ap. 1941-1954.  aIncludes references  aSeveral recent studies have shown that plant invasions can occur in resource-poor and relatively undisturbed habitats. It is, therefore, important to investigate whether and how life-history traits of species invasive in such habitats differ from those of species that are only invasive in disturbed and resource rich habitats. We compared the growth of seedlings of native and invasive tree species from nutrient-poor secondary forests in the tropical Seychelles. We hypothesised that the relative performance of the two groups would change predictably along resource gradients, with native species performing better at low levels of resource availability and invasive species performing better at higher levels. To test this hypothesis, we performed a common garden experiment using seedlings of six invasive and seven native tree species grown under three levels of light (65, 11 and 3.5% of ambient light) and two of nutrients (low and high). Due to large variation among species, differences in growth rates (RGR) were not significant among seedlings of the native and the invasive species. However, seedlings of the invasive species showed higher specific leaf areas (SLA) and higher leaf nutrient contents than seedlings of the native species. They also exhibited greater plasticity in biomass and nutrient allocation (i.e., greater plasticity in LAR, RSR and leaf nutrient contents) in response to varying resource availability. However, differences between the mean values of these parameters were generally small compared with variation within groups. We conclude that successful invaders on nutrient-poor soils in the Seychelles are either stress-tolerant, possessing growth traits similar to those of the native species, or fast-growing but adapted to nutrient-poor soils. In contrast, the more typical, fast-growing alien species with no particular adaptations to nutrient-poor soils seem to be restricted to relative nutrient-rich sites in the lowlands. The finding--that some introduced species thrive in resource-poor habitats--suggests that undisturbed habitats with low resource availability may be less resistant to plant invasions than was previously supposed. 3aforest trees 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3acolonizing ability 3aseedling growth 3alight intensity 3anutrient availability 3aleaf area 3anutrient content 3aSeychelles 0anative trees 0abiomass allocation 0aresource-poor habitats1 aKueffer, Christoph1 aEdwards, Peter J.1 aDietz, Hansjörg0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Oct., v. 11, no. 8 p.1941-1954dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9371-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02679naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245006000196300001800256500002400274500001500298520119500313650003001508650002401538650001701562650001501579650002301594650001101617650001501628650002501643650001301668650001001681651001101691653002701702653002501729653001601754653002201770653001701792700001801809700002401827700002101851773010201872852000901974856008501983930003302068945002502101946001102126655001202137IND4425634420221116223256.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442563442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9373-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aM001 0aL300 0aM3101 aRoll, Uri 10aNon-indigenous land and freshwater gastropods in Israel  ap. 1963-1972.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFew comprehensive works have investigated non-indigenous snails and slugs as a group. We compiled a database of non-indigenous gastropods in Israel to explore how they arrived and spread, characteristics of their introduction, and their biological traits. Fifty-two species of introduced gastropods are known from Israel (of which nine species subsequently went extinct): 19 species of freshwater snails and 33 species of terrestrial gastropods. The majority of these species are found only in human-dominated habitats. Most of those found in natural habitats are aquatic species. Most snails are introduced unintentionally from various parts of the Holoarctic region, reaching Israel as stowaways with horticultural imports and the aquarium trade, but some are brought intentionally to be used as pets or for food. Because the study of this group in Israel is very limited, information regarding their distribution in the country and their effects on other species is incomplete. Though only nine species of non-indigenous snails have been found to date in natural habitats, some of these are very abundant. More information and research is required to enable effective management schemes. 3ageographical distribution 3afreshwater molluscs 3alife history 3aGastropoda 3aintroduced species 3asnails 3aprovenance 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3aslugs 3aIsrael 0aterrestrial gastropods 0abiogeographic origin 0aland snails 0afreshwater snails 0abiogeography1 aDayan, Tamar 1 aSimberloff, Daniel 1 aMienis, Henk K. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Oct., v. 11, no. 8 p.1963-1972dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9373-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090922b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02384naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012000126300001600246520157100262650000901833650002601842650001101868650002801879650001301907650000901920700001701929773009301946852000902039939003302048946001302081655001202094IND9300284520221116223123.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, S.H.H.10aElevated striatal levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein associated with neuropathology in copper-deficient rats  ap. 503-509.  aSeverely copper-deficient rats, derived from dams depleted during gestation and lactation, develop neurological signs associated with low dopamine in the corpus striatum. This investigation was designed to assess neuronal death by use of an astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and to determine possible correlation of liver and striatal copper with striatal dopamine. Virgin females were fed low copper diets containing sucrose or glucose (0.5 mg Cu/kg) or control diets (10 mg Cu/kg) during gestation and lactation. The offspring were fed the same diets until clinical signs appeared in the deficient groups, when they were 7-8 weeks of age. The corpus striatum was analyzed for dopamine and copper; striatum, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum were analyzed for GFAP. All rats fed the low copper diets had extremely low liver copper, < 2 microgram/g, dry, but only approximately, one-half developed neuropathology and had low striatal dopamine. The GFAP concentration in the striatum increased in all copper-deficient rats, but was dramatically higher in those with low striatal dopamine. Cerebral GFAP was also higher in copper-deficient rats with low, dopamine than in those with normal dopamine. There were no differences in cerebellar GFAP. Striatal copper correlated with striatal dopamine and was depressed to a greater extent in rats with high GFAP. The results suggest that the development of copper deficiency, neuropathology is caused by neuronal degeneration that is associated with defective copper metabolism in the corpus striatum. 3adiet 3anutrient deficiencies 3acopper 3anervous system diseases 3adopamine 3arats1 aO'Dell, B.L.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g1992 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.503-509x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02882naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245007500165300001800240500001500258520148200273650002901755650001501784650002901799650002501828650001101853650002201864650003201886650003401918650002701952650002301979650003202002650003402034650002602068650004602094650006602140653001302206700001902219700001702238700001702255773008502272852000902357939003302366946001302399655001202412IND9300284120221116223403.0930114e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028412DNAL7 a14471452pmid7 aPMC2074952pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitts, C.L.10aElucidation of the complete Azorhizobium nicotinate catabolism pathway  ap. 7791-7797.  a2019-12-04  aA complete pathway for Azorhizobium caulinodans nicotinate catabolism has been determined from mutant phenotype analyses, isolation of metabolic intermediates, and structural studies. Nicotinate serves as a respiratory electron donor to O2 via a membrane-bound hydroxylase and a specific c-type cytochrome oxidase. The resulting oxidized product, 6-hydroxynicotinate, is next reduced to 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate. Hydrolytic ring breakage follows, with release of pyridine N as ammonium. Decarboxylation then releases the nicotinate C-7 carboxyl group as CO2, and the remaining C skeleton is then oxidized to yield glutarate. Transthioesterification with succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) yields glutaryl-CoA, which is then oxidatively decarboxylated to yield crotonyl-CoA. As with general acyl beta oxidation, L-beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and finally two molecules of acetyl-CoA are produced. In sum, nicotinate is catabolized to yield two CO2 molecules, two acetyl-CoA molecules, and ammonium. Nicotinate catabolism stimulates Azorhizobium N2 fixation rates in culture. Nicotinate catabolism mutants still able to liberate pyridine N as ammonium retain this capability, whereas mutants so blocked do not. From, mutant analyses and additional physiological tests, N2 fixation stimulation is indirect. In N-limited culture, nicotinate catabolism augments anabolic N pools and, as a consequence, yields N2-fixing cells with higher dinitrogenase content. 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3ametabolism 3aAzorhizobium caulinodans 3abiochemical pathways 3aniacin 3aSesbania rostrata 2aAcyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aGlutaratesxmetabolism 2aNiacinxmetabolism 2aNicotinic Acidsxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixationxphysiology 2aPyridinesxmetabolism 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aRhizobiaceaexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0aSesbania1 aLapointe, J.P.1 aLam, T. van.1 aLudwig, R.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 Dec., v. 174, no. 23 p.7791-7797x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015400127300001600281520158800297650000901885650002601894650003201920650001001952650002601962650002001988650002002008650001202028650001002040653001402050700001802064700001502082700001702097700001602114700001802130773009302148852000902241939003302250946001302283655001202296IND9300284620221116223526.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChriston, R.10aDiet-induced structural and functional modifications in the pig liver endoplasmic reticulum membrane: effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency  ap. 510-518.  aWeaned 39-day-old female piglets were fed diets containing either corn-soybean oil (control) or hydrogenated coconut oil (essential fatty acid (EFA) deficient) for 12 weeks. EFA deficiency produced increased cholesterol (Chol) and decreased phospholipid (PL) contents relative to protein, and thereafter an enhanced Chol/PL molar ratio in the liver endoplasmic reticulum (E.R.) membrane. The primary changes included modified PL distribution, with significant decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) levels. Furthermore, fatty acid profiles of the four main PL classes were altered by EFA deficiency. In particular, linoleic, arachidonic, and docosapentaenoic acid levels were largely reduced, whereas palmitoleic and oleic acid levels were increased. The biosynthesis of 5, 8, 11-eicosatrienoic acid (from oleic acid) was strongly stimulated in EFA-deficient pig liver E.R. membranes. The lower polyunsaturated fatty acid level of these latter induced a decreased peroxidability as measured by thiobarbituric assay. Moreover, the modified lipid composition due to EFA deficiency was followed by a decrease in membrane fluidity and an alteration in the activity of several membrane proteins. Liver E. R. membrane from EFA-deficient piglets exhibited a decreased Ca++ uptake, although passive Ca++ efflux was unaffected. NADH-Cyt.B5 and NADH-Cyt.B5 reductase activity were enhanced, whereas NADPH-Cyt. P450 electron transferring system and some of the liver detoxifying enzyme activities were significantly depressed. 3adiet 3anutrient deficiencies 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aliver 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3anutrient uptake 3acalcium 3aswine 0amembranes1 aFernandez, Y.1 aLinard, A.1 aPeriquet, A.1 aDeltour, P.1 aMitjavila, S.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g1992 Oct., v. 3, no. 10 p.510-518x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03408naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002200194245012500216300001800341500002400359500001500383520126500398650000901663650001701672650002001689650001601709650001501725650001901740650001501759650001201774650001501786650001901801650001201820650001201832650002001844650001401864650001001878650002001888650001101908650001201919650001501931650000901946650001201955650003501967650003902002650001402041650003802055650003602093650004102129650004002170651001202210653002302222700002802245700001902273700002602292700001702318700002102335700001802356773012202374852000902496856008802505930003302593945002502626946001102651655001202662IND4425691520140725000000.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569152DNAL7 a195243442pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aJ2001 aVermeulen, Frouke10aHabitat type-based bioaccumulation and risk assessment of metal and As contamination in earthworms, beetles and woodlice  ap. 3098-3105.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study investigated the contribution of environmental factors to the accumulation of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in earthworms, beetles and woodlice, and framed within an exposure assessment of the European hedgehog. Soil and invertebrate samples were collected in three distinct habitat types. Results showed habitat-specific differences in soil and invertebrate metal concentrations and bioaccumulation factors when normalized to soil metal concentration. Further multiple regression analysis showed residual variability (habitat differences) in bioaccumulation that could not be fully explained by differences in soil metal contamination, pH or organic carbon (OC). Therefore, the study demonstrated that in bioaccumulation studies involving terrestrial invertebrates or in risk assessment of metals, it is not sufficient to differentiate habitat types on general soil characteristics such as pH and/or OC alone. Furthermore, simple generic soil risk assessments for Cd and Cu showed that risk characterization was more accurate when performed in a habitat-specific way. Our study provided essential insights into habitat-specific accumulation patterns with respect to factors influencing metal bioaccumulation, BAFs, and site-specific risk assessment. 3alead 3aheavy metals 3asoil properties 3aurban areas 3agrasslands 3apolluted soils 3ametallurgy 3aforests 3aColeoptera 3asoil pollution 3aIsopoda 3acadmium 3arisk assessment 3awoodlands 3aparks 3abioaccumulation 3acopper 3aarsenic 3aearthworms 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aArsenicxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aColeopteraxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aIsopodaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOligochaetaxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aBelgium 0asoil invertebrates1 aBrink, Nico W. van den.1 aD'Havé, Helga1 aMubiana, Valentine K.1 aBlust, Ronny1 aBervoets, Lieven1 aCoen, Wim De.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3098-3105dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02583naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002000185245013000205300001800335500002400353520111700377650001901494650001901513650001201532650001501544650002901559650001501588650002101603650001501624650003301639650003101672650002101703650002001724650003101744650003101775700001901806773012201825852000901947856008801956930003302044945002502077946001102102655001202113IND4425686320221116223836.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568632DNAL7 a195640662pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ2001 aEriksson, Johan10aAniline and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene associate preferentially to low molecular weight fractions of dissolved soil organic matter  ap. 3010-3015.  aIncludes references  aAniline and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were equilibrated with particulate (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from an organic soil at different compositions of adsorbed major cations (Na, Al) and pH (aniline: 3.7-5.1, TNT: 4.8-5.0). After separation of POM, concentrations of ¹⁴C-labelled aniline and TNT* (including TNT degradation products) were determined in DOM size fractions using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and UV-detection. Concentrations in the <3.5 kDa size fraction were 2.8-6.0 and 8.5-9.5 times higher for aniline and TNT*, respectively, as compared to the >40 kDa fraction. Thus, both aniline and TNT* were preferentially associated to the smallest DOM size fraction. The significant binding to DOM (similar extent as to POM) and the fact that the <3.5 kDa DOM fraction was less susceptible to flocculation by major metals suggests that the mobility of aniline and TNT is highly affected by the solubility of soil organic matter. Concentrations of aniline and TNT associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) was shown to increase with decreasing apparent molecular mass of DOM. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aaniline 3aexplosives 3adissolved organic matter 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 2aAdsorption 2aAniline Compoundsxchemistry 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aMolecular Weight 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aTrinitrotoluenexchemistry1 aSkyllberg, Ulf0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3010-3015dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0543Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02824naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001700194245010400211300001800315500002400333520107100357650002001428650001101448650001901459650001801478650002101496650001801517650001801535650001101553650001601564650003901580650004001619650003201659650002301691650004501714650006501759653003001824700002201854700001301876700001901889700001701908700002201925700002301947773012201970852000902092856008802101930003302189945002502222946001102247655001202258IND4425686820221116223614.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568682DNAL7 a195602432pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF841 0aM0011 aMiao, Ai-Jun14aThe algal toxicity of silver engineered nanoparticles and detoxification by exopolymeric substances  ap. 3034-3041.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, we report that silver ions (Ag+) from the oxidative dissolution of silver engineered nanoparticles (Ag-ENs) determined the EN toxicity to the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. Most of the Ag-ENs formed non-toxic aggregates (>0.22 μm) in seawater. When the free Ag+ concentration ([Ag+]F) was greatly reduced by diafiltration or thiol complexation, no toxicity was observed, even though the Ag-ENs were better dispersed in the presence of thiols with up to 1.08 x 10⁻⁵ M Ag-ENs found in the <0.22 μm fraction, which are orders of magnitude higher than predicted for the natural aquatic environment. The secretion of polysaccharide-rich algal exopolymeric substances (EPS) significantly increased at increasing [Ag+]F. Both dissolved and particulate polysaccharide concentrations were higher for nutrient-limited cells, coinciding with their higher Ag+ tolerance, suggesting that EPS may be involved in Ag+ detoxification. Ag-ENs were found to only have indirect toxic effects on marine phytoplankton as a result of their rapid Ag+ release. 3awater pollution 3asilver 3ananotechnology 3aparticle size 3atoxicity testing 3aThalassiosira 3aphytoplankton 3athiols 3abiopolymers 2aDiatomsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxanalysis 2aSilverxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 0aThalassiosira weissflogii1 aSchwehr, Kathy A.1 aXu, Chen1 aZhang, Sai-Jin1 aLuo, Zhiping1 aQuigg, Antonietta1 aSantschi, Peter H.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3034-3041dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03118naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002300203245012000226300001800346500002400364520127200388650001901660650001901679650001301698650002301711650002101734650002501755650001001780650001301790650002401803650001401827650002101841650001901862650002501881650003401906650006701940650002702007650004602034650003202080650004302112700002102155700002302176700001902199700002202218773012202240852000902362856008802371930003302459945002502492946001102517655001202528IND4425687620221116223028.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568762DNAL7 a195250472pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aF600 0aF2001 aMerini, Luciano J.10aPhytoremediation potential of the novel atrazine tolerant Lolium multiflorum and studies on the mechanisms involved  ap. 3059-3063.  aIncludes references  aAtrazine impact on human health and the environment have been extensively studied. Phytoremediation emerged as a low cost, environmental friendly biotechnological solution for atrazine pollution in soil and water. In vitro atrazine tolerance assays were performed and Lolium multiflorum was found as a novel tolerant species, able to germinate and grow in the presence of 1 mg kg⁻¹ of the herbicide. L. multiflorum presented 20% higher atrazine removal capacity than the natural attenuation, with high initial degradation rate in microcosms. The mechanisms involved in atrazine tolerance such as mutation in psbA gene, enzymatic detoxification via P₄₅₀ or chemical hydrolysis through benzoxazinones were evaluated. It was demonstrated that atrazine tolerance is conferred by enhanced enzymatic detoxification via P₄₅₀. Due to its atrazine degradation capacity in soil and its agronomical properties, L. multiflorum is a candidate for designing phytoremediation strategies for atrazine contaminated agricultural soils, especially those involving run-off avoiding. Finding of a novel atrazine-tolerant species, as a potential candidate for phytoremediating herbicide-contaminated agriculture soils and elucidation of the mechanisms involved in tolerance. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aatrazine 3aLolium multiflorum 3aphytoremediation 3aherbicide resistance 3agenes 3amutation 3aenzymatic reactions 3abioassays 3acytochrome P-450 3abiodegradation 2aAtrazinexmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxeconomicsxmethods. 2aHerbicidesxmetabolism 2aLoliumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism1 aBobillo, Cecilia1 aCuadrado, Virginia1 aCorach, Daniel1 aGiulietti, Ana M.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3059-3063dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02944naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100002000186245009600206300001800302500002400320500002300344500001500367520126700382650001401649650001701663650001001680650001901690650001801709650001401727650001001741650001801751650002201769650001301791650002101804650001801825650001501843651001101858653001801869653001801887653001501905700001701920700001901937700001901956700001801975700001901993773015102012852000902163856007502172856003802247930003302285945002502318946001102343655001202354IND4425690720221116223138.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569072DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study presents data on seed quantity and quality for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), a semiserotinous conifer that dominates large areas of North American boreal forest. We sampled seed rain and viability for 2 years after fire (2005-2007) in 39 sites across interior Alaska that burned in 2004. All sites were dominated by black spruce before they burned. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relative importance of prefire spruce abundance, topography effects, canopy fire severity, and distance to unburned stands in explaining variations in black spruce seed rain. Prefire basal area of spruce that remained standing after fire was a significant predictor of total seed rain, but seed viability was more strongly related to site elevation, canopy fire severity, and distances to unburned stands. Although positive relations between tree basal area and the size of the aerial seed bank may place a first constraint on seed availability, accurate prediction of postfire viable seed rain for serotinous conifers also requires consideration of the effects of abiotic stress and canopy fire severity on seed viability. 3aviability 3aforest trees 3aseeds 3aboreal forests 3aPicea mariana 3aequations 3afires 3aforest stands 3aseed productivity 3aconifers 3astand basal area 3afire severity 3aprediction 3aAlaska 0acone serotiny 0aseed quantity 0abasal area1 aBoby, Leslie1 aTissier, Emily1 aMack, Michelle1 aVerbyla, Dave1 aWalker, Xanthe0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1575-1588dNational Research Council of CanadawJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0683Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-068  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03293naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100001900186245006100205300001800266500002400284500002300308520159700331650001001928650001201938650001901950650001401969650002101983650002602004650001702030650001502047650001802062650001402080650002102094650001302115650001502128650001602143650002702159650002202186650002302208650001202231650002102243650001802264650001702282650001802299651001102317700002302328773014902351852000902500856007502509856003802584930003302622945002502655946001102680655001202691IND4425690820221116223433.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569082DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Little) woodland. Information from multiple lines of evidence, including dateable fire scars (n = 83), tree demography, and charred coarse woody debris, was used to quantify fire frequency, severity, and extent. Fire cycle models were developed using survivorship analysis of time-since-fire estimates. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in historical fire regime, addressing the plausibility of postsettlement fire exclusion as an explanation for increased woodland area and density since the late 1800s. Historical fire regime was characterized by infrequent, small, high-severity fires. Estimated fire cycle (1570-1880) was 427 years, with no evidence of postsettlement stand-replacing fires. Topographic analyses indicated that in this drought-prone landscape, more mesic conditions favor continuous fuels that lead to more frequent or extensive fire. Superposed epoch analysis showed increased fire occurrence during drought years but with no influence of antecedent climatic conditions. More frequent grassland and shrubland fires were recorded by fire scars near valley floors. Thus, anthropogenic fire exclusion in adjacent, shrub-dominated communities presents a plausible mechanism for woodland expansion in the study area. However, there is little ecological justification for reintroducing fire to areas of historic woodland, where effects of fire exclusion have been minimal. 3afires 3ahistory 3apinyon-juniper 3awoodlands 3aPinus monophylla 3aJuniperus osteosperma 3agrowth rings 3afire scars 3afire severity 3afrequency 3aclimatic factors 3aland use 3atopography 3afire regime 3aecological restoration 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3adrought 3adendrochronology 3aage structure 3aforest trees 3aforest stands 3aNevada1 aWeisberg, Peter J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1589-1599dNational Research Council of CanadawJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0783Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-078  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02978naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002000173245012200193300001400315500002400329500001500353520127200368650001101640650002201651650001801673650001201691650002601703650002301729650001701752650001501769650001801784650002601802650001601828650001901844650002101863650005801884651001001942653001901952653001701971653001901988700001402007700001602021700001602037773010202053852000902155856008502164856010602249930003302355945002502388946001102413655001202424IND4425707620221116223802.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570762DNAL7 a247849682pmid7 a10.1080/026520309028977472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aCano-Sancho, C.10aSurvey of patulin occurrence in apple juice and apple products in Catalonia, Spain, and an estimate of dietary intake  ap. 59-65.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was conducted to assess patulin exposure in the Catalonian population. Patulin levels were determined in 161 apple juice samples, 77 solid apple-based food samples and 146 apple-based baby food samples obtained from six hypermarkets and supermarkets from twelve main cities of Catalonia, Spain. Patulin was analysed by a well-established validated method involving ethyl acetate extraction and direct analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet light detection. Mean patulin levels for positive samples in apple juice, solid apple-based food and apple-based baby food were 8.05, 13.54 and 7.12 μg kg-1, respectively. No samples exceeded the maximum permitted levels established by European Union regulation. Dietary intake was separately assessed for babies, infants and adults through a Food Frequency Questionnaire developed from 1056 individuals from Catalonia. Babies were the main group exposed to patulin, however no risk was detected at these levels of contamination. Adults and infants consumers were far from risk levels. Another approach to determine estimated exposure was conducted through Monte Carlo simulation that distinguishes variability in exposures from uncertainty of distributional parameter estimates. 3aapples 3atoxigenic strains 3aweaning foods 3apatulin 3aquantitative analysis 3afood contamination 3ainfant foods 3aaflatoxins 3amolds (fungi) 3asecondary metabolites 3aapple juice 3afood pathogens 3adietary exposure 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aSpain 0aapple products 0afruit juices 0afruit products1 aMarin, S.1 aRamos, A.J.1 aSanchis, V.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.59-65dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520309028977473Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02858naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245021800173300001400391500002400405500001500429520127800444650001301722650001301735650001301748650002001761650001801781650002401799650002301823650001501846650001101861650001801872650001501890650002701905650002301932650001001955650003301965650002101998650000902019650001402028650001402042653001602056700002102072700002502093700001402118700002202132773012202154852000902276856005502285655001202340IND4449221320221116223809.0110211e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444922132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00442.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSealey, Wendy M.10aEvaluation of 100% Fish Meal Substitution with Chicken Concentrate, Protein Poultry By-Product Blend, and Chicken and Egg Concentrate on Growth and Disease Resistance of Juvenile Rainbow Trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss  ap. 46-55.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe ability of poultry products to replace fish meal in diets for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, depends on their nutrient composition, cost, and consistency. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of three commercially available poultry products (chicken concentrate, CC, poultry by-product blend, PBB; or chicken and egg concentrate, CE) to maintain growth and disease resistance when substituted for fish meal in a rainbow trout starter diet. A control diet was formulated to contain 48% crude protein and 18% crude lipid; 100% of the fish meal in test diets was replaced with CC, PBB, or CE. At stocking, fry were counted into groups (50 fish/tank) with six replicate tanks for each diet and fed their respective diets four times daily for 8 wk. All the poultry-based diets supported growth (over 1600% increase over initial weight), nutrient retention, and feed conversion ratios of rainbow trout fry equal to or greater than those observed for fry fed with the fish meal-based diet. No effect of diet on survival was observed following subcutaneous injection challenge with Flavobacterium psychrophilum. These data suggest that the examined products can be used in place of fish meal for rainbow trout fry without lowering growth and disease resistance. 3achickens 3aproteins 3afish fry 3afeed conversion 3astarter diets 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3anutrient retention 3abyproducts 3alipids 3acrude protein 3afish feeds 3asubcutaneous injection 3adisease resistance 3atanks 3aFlavobacterium psychrophilum 3apoultry products 3aeggs 3afish meal 3amortality 0aconsistency1 aHardy, Ronald W.1 aBarrows, Frederic T.1 aPan, Qing1 aStone, David A.J.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2011 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.46-55dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00442.x 7aarticle02599naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014800162300001600310500002400326520142900350650001301779650001201792650000901804650001401813650001201827650002801839650002301867650001601890650001101906650001901917650001701936650001201953650001101965650001701976700001701993700001902010773010302029852000902132856004802141655001202189IND4421174420221116223829.0090529e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442117442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-009-9379-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiXin, Zhang10aDifferential plant growth and osmotic effects of two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars to exogenous glycinebetaine application under drought stress  ap. 297-305.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated the effects of exogenous glycinebetaine (GB) and drought stress (DS) on grain yield (GY) and production of dry matter (DM) and osmolytes in two maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars i.e. Shaandan 9 (S₉) and Shaandan 911 (S₉₁₁) during the entire growing period. Drought stress substantially reduced DM and GY but increased free proline, endogenous GB, soluble sugar and K⁺ concentrations in leaves of both cultivars. The DM production, GY, drought index (DI) and concentrations of these osmolytes were greater for S₉ than those for S₉₁₁ under DS. The significant differences in these parameters suggested that S₉ was more drought-tolerant as compared to S₉₁₁. Additionally, foliar application of GB increased the concentrations of all osmolytes measured, DM and GY of both cultivars under DS. These positive responses of exogenous GB spray were more pronounced in S₉₁₁ as compared to those in S₉. Further correlation analysis involving a number of parameters indicated that maize production was tighterly correlated with accumulation of the osmolytes measured during DS rather than well-watered controls. Accordingly, this study demonstrated the notion of an anti-drought role of exogenous GB by osmoregulation under DS, particularly in this drought sensitive cultivar. Thus, exogenous GB application might be firstly used with drought sensitive species/cultivars when exposed to DS. 3aZea mays 3abetaine 3acorn 3acultivars 3adrought 3adry matter accumulation 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3aosmoregulation 3aplant growth 3aproline 3asugars 3awater stress1 aShengXiu, Li1 aZongSuo, Liang0 tPlant growth regulation.g2009 July, v. 58, no. 3 p.297-305dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-009-9379-7 7aarticle02413naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012500171300001600296500002400312520121900336650002301555650002401578650002401602650002601626650001401652650002301666650001901689650002101708650001101729650001101740650001501751650001701766651001801783651001801801700001701819773011501836852000901951856005501960655001202015IND4402250020221116223131.0080302e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440225002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00347.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, A.T.10aEnvironmental data sets matter in ecological niche modelling: an example with Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri  ap. 135-144.  aIncludes references  aIn response to a recent paper suggesting the failure of ecological niche models to predict between native and introduced distributional areas of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), we sought to assess methodological causes of this failure. Ecological niche models were developed on the species' native distributional area in South America, and projected globally. We developed ecological niche models based on six different environmental data sets, and compared their respective abilities to anticipate the North American invasive distributional area of the species. We show that models based on the 'bioclimatic variables' of the WorldClim data set indeed fail to predict the full invasive potential of the species, but that models based on four other data sets could predict this potential correctly. The difference in predictive abilities appears to centre on the complexity of the environmental variables involved. These results emphasize important influences of environmental data sets on the generality and ability of ecological niche models to anticipate novel phenomena, and offer a simpler explanation for the lack of predictive ability among native and invaded distributional areas than that of niche shifts. 3aSolenopsis invicta 3aSolenopsis richteri 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3afire ants 3aindigenous species 3ainsect ecology 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction 3azoogeography 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aNakazawa, Y.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.135-144dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00347.x 7aarticle03115naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002500191245011200216300001300328500002400341520151600365650002501881650002701906650002101933650000901954650001601963650001201979650002801991650001702019650003102036650002602067650002302093650002102116651001002137700001902147700003002166700001602196700001502212773010102227852000902328856008502337856010602422930003302528945002502561946001102586655001202597IND4425705820221116223256.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570582DNAL7 a247849612pmid7 a10.1080/026520308026421022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aQ506 0aT3001 aTang, Anna Shiu Ping10aDietary exposure of Hong Kong secondary school students to total mercury and methylmercury from fish intake  ap. 8-14.  aIncludes references  aFish is the main source of dietary exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), which is a public health concern owing to its potential neurotoxicity. To evaluate the public health risk, this study estimated the total mercury (tHg) and MeHg exposure from fish intake in Hong Kong secondary school students. Median tHg and MeHg concentrations of 280 samples purchased from different commercial outlets (covering 89 species of whole fish and three types of canned tuna), together with the local food consumption data of secondary school students obtained by semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 2000, were used to estimate dietary exposure from fish intake for the average and high consumer (95th percentile exposure). For tHg, the median concentration was 63 μg kg-1 (range 3-1370 μg kg-1) and estimated exposures ranged 0.5-0.6 μg kg-1 body weight (bw) week-1 for an average consumer and 1.6-1.9 μg kg-1 bw week-1 for a high consumer. For MeHg, median concentration was 48 μg kg-1 (range 3-1010 μg kg-1) and estimated dietary exposures were 0.4-0.5 μg kg-1 bw week-1 for an average consumer and 1.2-1.4 μg kg-1 bw week-1 for a high consumer. These values are below the respective provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) established by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The health risk is greater for high consumers since MeHg exposures may approach or exceed the PTWI when other dietary sources are taken into account. 3ahigh school students 3amiddle school students 3adietary exposure 3afish 3afood intake 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3aheavy metals 3amaximum permissible intake 3aquantitative analysis 3afood contamination 3atoxic substances 3aChina1 aKwong, Ka Ping1 aChung, Stephen Wai Cheung1 aHo, Yuk Yin1 aXiao, Ying0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.8-14dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520308026421023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02611naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245015900155300001600314520108100330650002601411650002401437650002101461650002501482650001801507650001401525650002901539650002901568650001701597650001701614650001801631650002301649650001301672650002001685650001601705650002401721650001401745650001001759650001801769650000801787650001801795700001601813700001901829773010001848852000901948856007701957930003302034945001302067946001302080655001202093IND2124058120221116222905.0980717e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212405812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960281n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Gadow, A.10aComparison of the antioxidant activity of aspalathin with that of other plant phenols of rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis), alpha-tocopherol, BHT, and BHA  ap. 632-638.  aThe antioxidant activity of aspalathin, the major flavonoid of unfermented rooibos tea, was compared with that of other polyphenols present in rooibos tea, alpha-tocopherol, BHT, and BHA using the beta-carotene bleaching, alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, and automated Rancimat methods. The phenolic compounds include the flavonoids vitexin, rutin, quercetin, luteolin, isoquercitrin, (+)-catechin, and the phenolic acids protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, and vanillic acid. (+)-Catechin had the longest induction period according to the Rancimat method, while BHT was the most effective inhibitor of beta-carotene bleaching. Compounds with the highest degree of DPPH radical scavenging and highest rate of scavenging were caffeic acid and aspalathin, respectively. Aspalathin offered less protection against lipid oxidation than BHT and alpha-tocopherol according to the Rancimat and beta-carotene methods, but it displayed a higher ability to scavenge the DPPH radical. 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aAspalathus linearis 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acaffeic acid 3aferulic acid 3aisoquercitrin 3alipid peroxidation 3aluteolin 3ap-coumaric acid 3apolyphenols 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asyringic acid 3atea 3avanillic acid1 aJoubert, E.1 aHansmann, C.F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.632-638x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960281n3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01624naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245008100158300001800239520055300257650003300810650001700843650002200860650002300882650001600905650001200921650003400933650002100967650001100988700001600999773010201015852000901117856007701126930003301203945001301236946001301249655001201262IND2124182820221116223443.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212418282DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970080z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagenmaier, R.D.10aLow-dose irradiation of cut iceberg lettuce in modified atmosphere packaging  ap. 2864-2868.  aIrradiation at a mean dosage of 0.19 kGy of commercially prepared fresh-cut lettuce resulted in a product that had, 8 days after irradiation, microbial population of 290 cfu/g and yeast population of 60 cfu/g, compared with values of 220 000 and 1 400 cfu/g, respectively, for the nonirradiated control.

The LA concentration dependence of LOX activity was best fitted by using the Hill equation. It was found that the decrease of LOX activity at high pH corresponds to a pK(a) lower than the pK(a) of LA; thus, such decrease was assigned to some ionizable side chain group of LOX related to the active center. At a fixed LA concentration, the presence of beta-CD led to a decrease in the LOX reaction rate, which was due to its effect on K and the Hill constant since V(max) was not affected. Experiments in the presence of beta-CD revealed that LA monomers were also used as substrate, although less efficiently than aggregates. The different activities exhibited against monomers and aggregates is the reason for the observed apparent substrate cooperativity, which can be interpreted as an aggregate-induced enzyme activation. The effect of beta-CD on LOX activity could be explained on the basis of the specific interaction between LA and beta-CD and the equations derived for such interaction developed in a previous work. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3aenzyme activation 3aequations 3alinoleic acid 3apH 3apotatoes1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.2869-2875x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970106m3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01555naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245008100153300001800234520052300252650002100775650002100796650002600817650002600843650002300869650002300892650001300915700001700928700001300945773010200958852000901060856007701069930003301146945001301179946001301192655001201205IND2124207820221116223659.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212420782DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96085812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBravo, H.R.10aAntimicrobial activity of natural 2-benzoxazolinones and related derivatives  ap. 3255-3257.  aNatural 2-benzoxazolinones BOA and MBOA and related synthetic derivatives inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans.

A marketplace cross-section of five commercial beers was studied, involving products manufactured in different countries using distinctly different raw materials and brewing styles; maximum concentrations of individual diketopiperazines in various beers ranged from below detection limit to approximately 24 ppm. The flavor characteristics of these compounds were described variously as bitter, mouth coating, drying, astringent, salty, metallic, and grainy when evaluated in water at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 ppm.

Females reach puberty at the age of 8-12 months. Females exhibit a constant oestrus between late March and early August if they are not bred. Increasing tumescence in the pink-coloured vulva is a sign of pro-oestrus. Oestrus can persist for up to 5 months, but once ovulation is induced, either pregnancy or pseudopregnancy ensues. Follicular development and atresia overlap in such a manner that there is a recent cohort of follicles available for ovulation whenever copulation might occur. Copulation may last from 15 min to 3 h, the average being 1 h. Ovulation is induced by pressure on the cervix associated with copulation. After sufficient LH release, the pre-ovulatory follicles mature and an average of 12 oocytes (5-13) per female are ovulated 30-40 h after copulation into the ovarian bursa. The ferret oocytes are most capable of being fertilized up to 12 h after ovulation, i.e. 42-52 h after copulation. Ferret oocytes ovulate at the metaphase of the second meiotic division (MII) embedded in three layers of corona radiata cells. Embryos enter the uterus over a period of several days starting on day 5 after mating. Between days 12 and 13 after mating, the embryos have become implanted in the endometrium. Implantation in the ferret is central with rapid invasion of the uterine epithelium by the trophoblast over a broad area that eventually becomes a zonary band of endotheliochorial placenta. Gestation length is 41 days (39-42 days). The domestic ferret gives birth to an average of eight kits (1-18 kits), which weigh 6-12 g at birth. 3aanimal ovaries 3acervix 3acopulation 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3aestrus 3afemales 3aferrets 3afollicular development 3agestation period 3aluteinizing hormone 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aproestrus 3apseudopregnancy 3apuberty 3atrophoblast 3avulva 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCopulationxphysiology 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFerretsxphysiology 2aLitter Size 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aTime Factors0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2008 July, v. 43, no. s2 p.150-156dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01155.x 7aarticle02476naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245010100152300001800253520121900271650002801490650001901518650001601537650003201553650002701585650001701612650002101629650001601650650001401666650000901680650000701689650001301696650002801709650002101737700001901758700001801777773010201795852000901897856007701906930003301983945001302016946001302029655001202042IND2124190220221116223351.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212419022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970127g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHierro, E.10aContribution of microbial and meat endogenous enzymes to the lipolysis of dry fermented sausages  ap. 2989-2995.  aThe role of the starter culture and meat endogenous enzymes in the lipolysis of dry fermented sausages has been studied. Five batches of sausages were manufactured. The control batch was made with aseptic ingredients without microbial inoculation. The other four experimental batches were manufactured with the aseptic ingredients inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum 4045, Staphylococcus sp., L. plantarum 4045 and Micrococcus-12, or L. plantarum 4045 and Staphylococcus sp. Their effects on pH, a(w), long chain free fatty acid and short chain fatty acid contents and compositions were studied. Sausages inoculated with L. plantarum 4045 had the lowest pH as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. However, release of free fatty acids was greater in the inoculated sausages than in the aseptic one. Lipolysis, measured as total content of long chain free fatty acids, occurred not only in the inoculated batches but also in the control, which could suggest that the meat endogenous lipases play an important role in this process. Lipolysis produced an increased release of linoleic and oleic acids. Changes were observed in the short chain fatty acid fraction, but acetic acid was always the major fatty acid. 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aStaphylococcus 3aacetic acid 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3afree fatty acids 3aingredients 3alipolysis 3ameat 3apH 3asausages 3ashort chain fatty acids 3astarter cultures1 aHoz, L. de la.1 aOrdonez, J.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.2989-2995x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970127g3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03042naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008700144300001600231520123600247650002201483650001101505650002401516650001601540650002001556650002001576650003001596650002601626650002001652650002201672650002601694650002001720650001601740650002401756650001801780650002201798650002301820650002101843650002801864650001301892650003301905650003801938650005401976650003202030650003602062650004402098653001202142653001402154653002302168653002502191653003902216700001602255700001502271700001902286773005802305852000902363939003302372946001102405655001202416IND9300280020221116223615.0930115s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028002DNAL7 a13587602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTharaud, C.10aSecretion of human blood coagulation factor XIIIa by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica  ap. 111-119.  aThe industrial yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, secretes high yields of an alkaline extracellular protease (AEP), which is synthesized as a preproprotein encoded by the XPR2 gene. We investigated the possibility of using this system for the secretion of human coagulation factor XIII subunit a (FXIIIa). This protein is naturally secreted in the plasma by an unknown, signal peptide-independent mechanism and has so far been found to be nonsecretable in yeast. We have designed six hybrid genes encoding fusion proteins between increasing portions of the AEP preprodomain and the precursor or mature forms of FxIIIa. All constructs directed translocation of the FXIIIa precursor into the endoplasmic reticulum. Transport of the translocated and core-glycosylated hybrid precursor to the Golgi apparatus appeared to be strongly rate limiting, and most of the precursors appeared to be partially proteolysed. One of these constructs directed the extracellular secretion of a low amount of hyperglycosylated FXIIIa. These results indicate that fusion to the yeast AEP signal peptide and dipeptide stretch allows FxIIIa to be translocated, albeit inefficiently, through the endoplasmic reticulum and to follow a classical secretory transit. 3aSaccharomycetales 3ahumans 3agenetic engineering 3aproteinases 3arecombinant DNA 3asynthetic genes 3ablood coagulation factors 3aaminoacyltransferases 3agene expression 3aprotein secretion 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aGolgi apparatus 3agene fusion 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Precursorsxgenetics 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aSaccharomycetalesxgenetics 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aTransglutaminasesxgeneticsxsecretion. 0avectors 0axpr2 gene 0aexpression vectors 0aalkaline proteinases 0aalkaline extracellular proteinases1 aRibet, A.M.1 aCostes, C.1 aGaillardin, C.0 tGene.g1992, v. 121, no. 1 p.111-119x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01962naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010000132300001600232520122000248650002201468650001801490650001301508650002201521653002501543773007301568852000901641939003301650946001301683655001201696IND9300281520221116223242.0930114e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreudenburg, W.R.10aAddictive economies: extractive industries and vulnerable localitiesin a changing world economy  ap. 305-332.  aRaw material extraction once offered an effective route to economic development, but societal relationships with environment and technology have changed so fundamentally that extractive industries today appear more likely to lead rural regions to economic addiction. Key characteristics of addictive activities include rising costs of operation at most extractive facilities, combined with downward trends in world commodity prices. Key characteristics of vulnerable communities and regions include increasing geographic isolation, imbalances of scale and power with respect to extractive industries, and the absence of realistic alternatives for diversified development. Key pressures toward addiction are created by ambiguities that mask the addictive tendencies, including ambiguities of price signals, of employment and development possibilities for remote regions, and of resource exhaustion. The net result is that, while the encouragement to develop extractive industries is often coupled with advice to avoid developing an excessive dependency on a single economic sector, the very regions and nations having the greatest need to hear such advice may also have the lowest realistic ability to respond to it. 3anatural resources 3araw materials 3aindustry 3arural communities 0aresource development0 tRural sociology.g1992 Fall, v. 57, no. 3 p.305-332x0036-01127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02376naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245007100155300001800226520118700244650001501431650001701446650001601463650001201479650001801491650001801509650001201527650001101539650001801550650001401568650001101582650001301593650001101606650001501617650001701632650001501649700001901664773010201683852000901785856007701794930003301871945001301904946001301917655001201930IND2124189220221116222821.0980723e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212418922DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970010s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortensen, A.10aImportance of carotenoid structure in radical-scavenging reactions  ap. 2970-2977.  aThe rate of (parallel) reaction between carotenoids and phenoxyl radical to yield (i) carotenoid/phenoxyl adducts and (ii) carotenoid radical cations (in effect regenerating the phenol by reduction) has been found to increase for an increasing number of (coplanar) conjugated double bonds in the carotenoid and to decrease in the presence of hydroxy and especially keto groups. The reactions to yield the carotenoid radical have half-lives of tenths of milliseconds, and when studied by transient visible and near-infrared absorption spectroscopy using nanosecond laser flash photolysis for radical generation, the relative rates in di-tert-butyl peroxide/benzene (7/3, v/v) at 20 degrees C were lycopene (1.66), beta-carotene (1), zeaxanthin (0.79), lutein (0.70), and echinenone (0.68), while canthaxanthin and beta-apo-8'-carotenal hardly reacted and astaxanthin not at all. When formed, the carotenoid radicals are rather stable (second-order decay on a millisecond time scale). The lower the energy of the near-infrared transition in the radical cation, the more effective is the carotenoid as phenoxyl scavenger, and lycopene is concluded to be the more efficient antioxidant. 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3abenzene 3abeta-carotene 3acanthaxanthin 3acations 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3ahalf life 3alutein 3alycopene 3aphenol 3aphotolysis 3aspectroscopy 3azeaxanthin1 aSkibsted, L.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.2970-2977x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970010s3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03127naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002200126024001900148040001800167072001700185100002100202245007300223300001800296500008700314500001500401506007600416520167500492506003702167650000802204650001002212650002302222650001302245650001202258650002002270650001902290651001802309651001402327651001002341653001502351773013902366852000902505856008402514930003302598945002502631946001302656655001202669IND4430065420221207061132.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006542DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.28473C2doi7 aPMC27931142pmcid7 a199068042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

OBJECTIVE: To present a picture of global obesity and examine the shifts in BMI in children, I examined BMI data for men and women at the upper ends of the BMI distributions in Australia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. DESIGN: As representative data, I used directly measured weight and height for children aged 6-18 y and for men and women aged ≥19 y. Quantile regression analysis with BMI was used to determine the outcome, and the coefficients of age, age squared, and age cubed represented the explanatory variables plotted to determine mean BMI at the 95th centile for each age group. Overweight and obesity measures across all selected countries, with the use of nationally representative surveys and the 95th centile mean BMI, were determined. RESULTS: Among women, much larger increases were found in mean BMI at the 95th percentile in Australia (+5.7 BMI units) and the United Kingdom (+3.7 BMI units) than in the United States (+2.7 BMI units) in one-half the time. In contrast, among children, younger Chinese children experienced the largest increase. For example, the mean BMI at the 95th centile for 6-y-old Chinese children is 24.8 (a 5.0 increase), which is 2.6 BMI units more than the BMI at the 95th centile for children in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among children, BMIs for US children at the 95th centile are below those in China, whereas among women, Australian and UK women are rapidly approaching BMIs found in US women.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amen 3awomen 3adisease prevalence 3achildren 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aUnited Nations 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 3aChina 0aoverweight0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.284S-288SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.28473C3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle02312naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001600149245010100165300001800266520092500284650000801209650001601217650001301233650001201246650001301258650000901271650002501280650003001305650002201335650001601357650002101373650001601394650001801410650003101428650005401459650003901513650002701552650002501579700001501604700001501619700001701634773009901651852000901750930003301759945001301792946001301805655001201818IND2204076520221116222904.0000425e199909  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220407652DNAL7 a104734182pmid7 aPMC997432pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerenyi, Z.10aMolecular standardization of mating type terminology in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex  ap. 4071-4076.  aMating type in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex is controlled by a single locus with two alleles and is usually identified following sexual crosses with standard, female-fertile tester isolates. The mating type alleles have been arbitrarily designated "+" and "-" within each biological species, and the nomenclature is tied to the standard tester strains. We developed a pair of PCR primers that can be used to amplify a unique fragment of one of the mating type alleles (MAT-2) from at least seven of the biological species in this species complex. Based on the amplification pattern, we propose a replacement for the existing, arbitrary +/- terminology that is presently in use. The new terminology is based on DNA sequence similarities between the mating type allele fragments from the biological species of the G. fujikuroi species complex and the corresponding fragments from other filamentous ascomycetes. 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aFusarium 3aalleles 3acrossing 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3aterminology 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Mating Type, Fungal 2aGibberellaxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTerminology as Topic1 aZeller, K.1 aHornok, L.1 aLeslie, J.F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Sept., v. 65, no. 9 p.4071-4076x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02213naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008600126300001600212520104700228650001801275650001801293650001401311650002101325650002201346650002001368650002501388650002001413650002301433650001101456650002001467650001801487653001201505700002001517700001901537700002001556700002101576700001801597773009801615852000901713930003301722945001301755946001101768655001201779IND2054103320221116223836.0961119e199606  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205410332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenegas, A.10aExpression of recombinant microfilarial chitinase and analysis of domain function  ap. 149-159.  aA family of chitinase isozymes was previously characterized from the microfilariae of Brugia malayi and Brugia pahangi. The expression of these enzymes correlates with the onset of microfilarial infectivity for the mosquito vector. To study the role of chitinase activity in filarial transmission, the p70 chitinase from Brugia malayi was cloned and expressed in two forms: a full-length product of approximately 62 kDa and a truncated product of 43 kDa containing only the N-terminal catalytic domain. Two epitopes defined by monoclonal antibodies were preserved only in the full-length recombinant enzyme. It was found that deletion of the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain increased the yield of the recombinant expression product, and did not affect the Km for di- or trisaccharide substrates. However, affinity for high molecular weight chitin was specific to the full-length molecule, and is apparently mediated by the cysteine-rich domain, suggesting a role for this part of the protein in targeting the secreted enzyme to its substrate. 3aBrugia malayi 3amicrofilariae 3achitinase 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3arecombinant proteins 3aenzyme activity 3achemical structure 3achitin 3adisease vectors 3apathogenicity 0acloning1 aGoldstein, J.C.1 aBeauregard, K.1 aOleś, Andrzej.1 aAbdulhayoglu, N.1 aFuhrman, J.A.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1996 June, v. 78, no. 1/2 p.149-159x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03419naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011800143300001600261500001500277520170100292650001301993650001302006650002302019650002302042650001802065650002802083650001802111650001202129650004702141650002602188650002802214650005502242650004102297650002902338650002102367650002502388650002802413650004402441650005502485653001402540653001302554653002302567653001502590653001002605653002002615700001402635700001702649700001302666773009602679852000902775930003302784945001302817946001102830655001202841IND2060676620221116223454.0971126e199706  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206067662DNAL7 a92001292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoo, K.H.10aStructural characterization of the N-glycans from Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst membrane and protoscoleces  ap. 237-248.  a2019-12-05  aInfection by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in the intermediate host results in the development of a hydatid cyst which contains the protoscoleces within a fluid-filled cavity enclosed by the bilayered cyst membrane. N-glycans were enzymatically released from crude extracts of homogenates of hydatid cyst membranes and protoscoleces and their structures were defined by high sensitivity fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry in conjunction with sequential exoglycosidase digestions. The major N-glycans from the cyst membrane were found to be non-charged structures having complex-type antennae and core fucosylation. The antennae are either truncated at the first N-acetylglucosamine or are extended with beta-galactose to form N-acetyllactosamine (lacNAc). A significant proportion of the lacNAc backbones are capped by alpha-galactose. The resulting Gal alpha-Gal beta-terminal structures may account for the earlier observation that antibodies against the blood group P1 epitope recognise components of hydatid cyst extracts. The complex-type N-glycans identified in the protoscoleces extracts were the same as the neutral structures found in the cyst membrane but a small proportion of high mannose structures and truncated di- and trimannosyl core structures were also identified. Sialylated N-glycans were identified as minor constituents of the cyst membrane preparation but were not observed in protoscoleces extracts. Whether the sialylated glycans are host derived or endogenously synthesized by the parasite remains to be established. This is the first reported structural analysis of N-glycans from cestodes and provides new insights into protein glycosylation in helminths. 3aepitopes 3ahydatids 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aprotoscoleces 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aglycoproteins 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthxchemistryximmunology. 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aEchinococcosisximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aEchinococcusxchemistryximmunology. 2aElectrophoresisxmethods 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aMembranesxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryximmunology. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardmentxmethods 0amembranes 0aantigens 0asialylated glycans 0ap1 epitope 0acysts 0an-glycosylation1 aNieto, A.1 aMorris, H.R.1 aDell, A.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1997 June, v. 86, no. 2 p.237-248x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03542naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007500148300001600223500001500239520173400254650002101988650001902009650002202028650002502050650002602075650002302101650002102124650002002145650002202165650002502187650002402212650001202236650002602248650001802274650006602292650004002358650004002398650001102438650003302449650001302482650000902495650002802504650002102532650002402553650002202577650002602599650005702625653001702682653001002699653001302709700001302722700001902735773009602754852000902850930003302859945001302892946001102905655001202916IND2061213620221116223624.0980112e199704  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206121362DNAL7 a91061972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, A.C. Jr.10aCharacterization of a cysteine proteinase from Taenia crassiceps cysts  ap. 243-253.  a2019-12-05  aHuman neurocysticercosis, due to infestation of the central nervous system with Taenia cysts, is a common cause of neurologic disease in endemic areas and is being increasingly recognized in the United States. Previous studies have suggested that Taenia cysts bind host IgG via Fc-like receptors and that bound IgG is degraded by the parasite, perhaps as a source of nutrients or a means of immune evasion. We now demonstrate that IgG degradation is thiol dependent and is inhibited by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor, E-64. The cysteine proteinase activity from Taenia crassiceps cysts was purified 682-fold by acid extraction, gel filtration chromatography, and anion-exchange FPLC. The cysteine proteinase appeared as a 43 kDa band on silver-stained gels. Its isoelectric point was 5.27. The purified enzyme was inhibited by cysteine proteinase inhibitors and also by chloromethyl ketone inhibitors, but not significantly by other inhibitors of serine, aspartic, or metallo-proteinases. Substrate studies showed pronounced cleavage of Z-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumrin (Z-Phe-Arg-AFC), but not of substrates with neutral or positively charged amino acids in the P2 position. Km for Z-Phe-Arg-AFC was 1.0 X 10(-7) M, Kcat 58 s-1, and Kcat/Km 5.8 X 10(8) mol-1 s-1. Amino acid sequencing of the amino terminus revealed a single cysteine residue with surrounding residues suggestive of a cysteine proteinase active site. The sequence, however, did not contain the conserved active site associated with enzymes of known cysteine proteinase families. This cysteine proteinase may play an important role in the interaction of Taenia cysts and host immunoglobulin and is a potential target for antiparasitic chemotherapy. 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmune evasion 3aisoelectric point 3aamino acid sequences 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aneurocysticercosis 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme activity 3aTaenia crassiceps 3acysteine proteinases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnion Exchange Resins 2aBinding Sites 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aCysticercusxchemistryxenzymology. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aImmunoglobulin Gxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtease Inhibitors 2aResins, Synthetic 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTaeniaxchemistryxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 0apurification 0acysts 0ahost igg1 aBaig, S.1 aChappell, C.L.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1997 Apr., v. 85, no. 2 p.243-253x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03791naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009300191300001800284520173200302650001802034650001302052650001302065650001202078650002202090650002702112650001302139650001102152650002102163650001202184650003002196650002402226650003802250650001102288650002502299650001302324650002702337650002002364650002402384650001202408650002702420651001502447653002502462653002302487653002902510653002102539653001302560653002502573700002102598700002602619700002102645700002002666700002302686700001902709700002602728700003202754700002102786700002402807773011702831852000902948856009202957930003303049946001103082655001203093IND4429557820221116223525.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442955782DNAL7 a199125402pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04416.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Laurie A.10aCharacterizing dispersal patterns in a threatened seabird with limited genetic structure  ap. 5074-5085.  aGenetic assignment methods provide an appealing approach for characterizing dispersal patterns on ecological time scales, but require sufficient genetic differentiation to accurately identify migrants and a large enough sample size of migrants to, for example, compare dispersal between sexes or age classes. We demonstrate that assignment methods can be rigorously used to characterize dispersal patterns in a marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) population from central California that numbers approximately 600 individuals and is only moderately differentiated (FST~ 0.03) from larger populations to the north. We used coalescent simulations to select a significance level that resulted in a low and approximately equal expected number of type I and II errors and then used this significance level to identify a population of origin for 589 individuals genotyped at 13 microsatellite loci. The proportion of migrants in central California was greatest during winter when 83% of individuals were classified as migrants compared to lower proportions during the breeding (6%) and post-breeding (8%) seasons. Dispersal was also biased toward young and female individuals, as is typical in birds. Migrants were rarely members of parent-offspring pairs, suggesting that they contributed few young to the central California population. A greater number of migrants than expected under equilibrium conditions, a lack of individuals with mixed ancestry, and a small number of potential source populations (two), likely allowed us to use assignment methods to rigorously characterize dispersal patterns for a population that was larger and less differentiated than typically thought required for the identification of migrants. 3aage structure 3aancestry 3abreeding 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aseabirds 3awinter 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aCharadriiformesxgenetics 2aComputer Simulation 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aFemale 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aModels, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSeasons 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aCalifornia 0aage-biased dispersal 0aassignment methods 0aBrachyramphus marmoratus 0amarbled murrelet 0amigrants 0asex-biased dispersal1 aPalsboll, Per J.1 aBeissinger, Steven R.1 aHarvey, James T.1 aBerube, Martine1 aRaphael, Martin G.1 aNelsen, S.

Here, we describe the preparation and properties of two new FPP analogs that contain diazotrifluoropropanoyl photophores linked to geranyl diphosphate via amide or ester linkages. The amide-linked analog (3) was synthesized in ³²P-labeled form from geraniol in seven steps. Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein farnesyltransferase (ScPFTase) showed that 3 is an alternative substrate for the enzyme. Photolysis experiments with [³²P]3 demonstrate that this compound labels the β-subunits of both farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase (types 1 and 2). However, the amide-linked probe 3 undergoes a rearrangement to a photochemically unreactive isomeric triazolone upon long term storage making it inconvenient to use. To address this stability issue, the ester-linked analog 4 was prepared in six steps from geraniol. Computational analysis and X-ray crystallographic studies suggest that 4 binds to protein farnesyl transferase (PFTase) in a similar fashion as FPP. Compound 4 is also an alternative substrate for PFTase, and a ³²P-labeled form selectively photocrosslinks the β-subunit of ScPFTase as well as E. coli farnesyldiphosphate synthase and a germacrene-producing sesquiterpene synthase from Nostoc sp. strain PCC7120 (a cyanobacterial source). Finally, nearly exclusive labeling of ScPFTase in crude E. coli extract was observed, suggesting that [³²P]4 manifests significant selectivity and should hence be useful for identifying novel FPP-utilizing enzymes in crude protein preparations. 3aphotoaffinity labeling 2aBinding Sites 2aFarnesyltranstransferasexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aPhotoaffinity Labels 2aPolyisoprenyl Phosphatesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxchemistry 2aSesquiterpenesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSubstrate Specificity 0adiazotrifluoropropanoyl 0afarnesyl diphosphate 0agermacrene synthase 0aprenyltransferase 0aprotein prenylation 0asesquiterpene synthase1 aEdelstein, Rebecca L.1 aHenry, Olivier1 aOchocki, Joshua1 aDeGraw, Amanda1 aLenevich, Stepan1 aTalbot, Trista1 aYoung, Victor G.1 aHruza, Alan W.1 aLópez-Gallego, Fernando.1 aLabello, Nicholas P.1 aStrickland, Corey L.1 aSchmidt-Dannert, Claudia1 aDistefano, Mark D.0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2010 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.51-67dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00914.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02383naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002200180245013400202300001600336520087900352650001001231650002001241650000901261650001901270650001701289650001201306650001501318650001501333650002601348650002701374650001501401650003001416650001501446650003101461650003201492650003101524650002001555650002201575650002001597700002401617700002101641700002801662773008301690852000901773930003301782945002501815946001301840655001201853IND4425731120221116223407.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442573112DNAL7 a196103872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The complex of U(VI) with Chromazorul-S was adsorbed and accumulated from an ammonia buffer solution of pH 8.8, including 2.4 x 10(-5) M Chromazorul-S at the potential -0.2 V for 120 s. After that, the cathodic voltammograms were recorded by potential sweep from -0.2 to -0.9 V in the differential pulse mode. The relationship between the cathodic peak currents versus U(VI) concentrations was linear over the range of 0.7-340 ng/mL. The detection limit was 0.1 ng/mL, and the relative standard deviations (7 determinations) at 10, 100, and 300 ng/mL U(VI) were 2.1, 1.6, and 1.1%, respectively. The validity of this method was estimated by determination of spiked U(VI) in natural water and soil samples. The results were successful. 3awater 3awater pollution 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3aheavy metals 3auranium 3aadsorbents 3aelectrodes 3aquantitative analysis 3aenvironmental exposure 2aAdsorption 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aElectrodes 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydroxybenzoatesxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aUraniumxanalysis 2aWaterxanalysis1 aHosseinzadeh, Laleh1 aAbbasi, Shahriar1 aEsfandyarpour, Mohammad0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.927-932x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle02528naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002000127245023300147300001600380500001500396520115300411650002401564650002801588650001501616650002201631650002301653650003001676650000801706650003901714650001301753650002401766653001601790700002201806700001901828700001801847700001601865700001801881700002001899773008301919852000902002930003302011945002502044946001302069655001202082IND4425731820221116222809.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442573182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To demonstrate the equivalence of the new and old instruments, a validation study was conducted using the BAX system PCR Assay for Salmonella, AOAC Official Method 2003.09, on three food types. The foods were simultaneously analyzed with the BAX system Q7 instrument and either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual or the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook reference method for detecting Salmonella. Comparable performance between the BAX system and the reference methods was observed. Of the 75 paired samples analyzed, 39 samples were positive by both the BAX system and reference methods, and 36 samples were negative by both the BAX system and reference methods, demonstrating 100% correlation. Inclusivity and exclusivity for the BAX system Q7 instrument were also established by testing 50 Salmonella strains and 20 non-Salmonella isolates. All Salmonella strains returned positive results, and all non-Salmonella isolates returned a negative response. 3aautomatic detection 3abacterial contamination 3aSalmonella 3aindicator species 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3aFood Safety and Inspection Service 3avalidity 3amicrobial detection 0afood safety1 aAndaloro, Bridget1 aWhite, H.

  1 aLordly, Daphne10aNational dietetic registration examination: perceptions of the writing experience  ap. 73-80.  aSummary in French.  aPurpose: Dietitians must pass the Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination (CDRE) to practise. Writers' experiences with the exam were examined, along with factors associated with anxiety and coping mechanisms, preparation strategies, and if and how anxiety, coping, and preparation strategies are perceived to be related to exam performance. Methods: An exploratory descriptive methodology with a researcher-designed questionnaire was used to collect data from a purposive sample in 1999 and 2000 (n=54), and from a convenience sample in 2005 and 2006 (n=11). Participants were CDRE writers from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Ontario. Results: Meaningful preparation was correlated with a more positive exam experience (p=0.023). Writers experiencing lower preparation anxiety were more confident they had passed (p=0.016). Successful coping strategies resulted in decreased writing anxiety (p=0.029). The 2005 to 2006 cohorts prepared less (p=0.004) and experienced less preparation anxiety (p=0.02). Five themes emerged, which extend our understanding of the exam-writing experience. Conclusions: Several strategies may positively influence writing anxiety and improve the overall writing experience. Individuals and organizations and/or writers can consider these findings as they engage in the exam process, revise and/or develop support material, give presentations, or provide advice. 3adietitians 3adiet counseling 3adietetic education 3acertification (education) 3awriting skills 2aAdult 2aAnxietyxpsychology 2aCertification 2aComputers 2aCredentialing 2aData Collection 2aDieteticsxeducation 2aEducational Measurementxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 3aCanada 0aCanada0 tCanadian journal of dietetic practice and research.g2008 Summer, v. 69, no. 2 p.73-80wJournal:12957x1486-38477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3148/69.2.2008.733Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/22  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02929naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215072001700232100002300249245015900272300001600431520080500447650001501252650002601267650002601293650002501319650002301344650002101367650002201388650001501410650002601425650001801451650002201469650002901491650001901520650003801539650002401577650002001601650002701621650001601648650002701664650001101691650001101702650005801713650003001771653001701801653002601818653002901844653003401873653001701907653003001924653002001954653002301974773008301997852000902080856008502089930003302174945002502207946001102232655001202243IND4430038920221116222810.0091217e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443003892DNAL7 a218830532pmid7 a10.1080/036702409033085962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The 1995 Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) have been customized in regions and nations, encouraging integrated food systems and culturally-sensitive food-health relationships with economic development. Climate change and diminishing fuel and food affordability have made their role in promoting food security critical. Localities with their eco-systems, communities and households, could apply FBDGs to correct mismatches between food systems, individual health needs, and environmental integrity. Improved infrastructure should allow communities and households to be usefully connected and operate with CCH-FBSs. 3ahouseholds 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritional adequacy 3aDietary Guidelines 3ahealth promotion 3anutrition science 3aecosystems 3anutrient requirements 3afood security 3afood availability 3anutritional intervention 2aClimate Change 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aCultural Competency 2aDietxeconomics 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFood Safety 2aFood Supplyxeconomics 2aHealth 2aHumans 2aNutrition Disordersxeconomicsxprevention & control. 2aResidence Characteristics 0aeconutrition 0anew nutrition science 0aEvidence-Based Nutrition 0aFood-Based Dietary Guidelines 0afood systems 0afood-health relationships 0afood ecosystems 0afood affordibility0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g2009 , v. 48, no. 6 p.457-481x0367-02447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/036702409033085963Available from publisher's Web site  a20100106b20100205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02880naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100002400162245015100186300001800337500001500355520145300370650001301823650001901836650002101855650003101876650001501907650002001922650002101942650002301963650001701986650002302003650001702026650001602043650001602059651002102075653002202096653003302118700001902151773007702170852000902247856008502256930003302341945002502374946001102399655001202410IND4430039920221116222628.0091217s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443003992DNAL7 a10.1108/000707009110010222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design/methodology/approach - Tomato was selected as a model crop. Data used in this study were gathered from questionnaires conducted in Tokat province of Turkey in April 2006. Questionnaires were accomplished via face-to-face interviews over 262 households. "Ordered logit model" was used in determining the factors that affect the willingness of consumers for higher prices for genetically unmodified products. Ordered models are those that limit dependent variables to certain intervals. According to the results, variables of household size, monthly household income, household's monthly food consumption expenditure and level of consumers' sensitivity over the issue affected the willingness to pay higher prices for genetically unmodified products. Findings - Results of the study indicated that household size and monthly household income had negative effects on the willingness to pay extra, while monthly food expenditure and concern had positive effects. Originality/value - The results of the study will be beneficial for the policy makers, producers, consumers and those conducting research in this area alike. Carrying out studies aimed at determining consumer preference, such as this, will help form consumer consciousness, especially in Turkey, to protect consumer health. 3atomatoes 3aquestionnaires 3ahousehold income 3agenetically modified foods 3ainterviews 3afood purchasing 3aconsumer surveys 3awillingness to pay 3afood choices 3aconsumer attitudes 3acase studies 3afamily size 3afood prices 3aTurkey (country) 0aconsumer behavior 0agenetically unmodified foods1 aEsengun, Kemal0 tBritish food journal.g2009, v. 111, no. 11 p.1188-1199x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707009110010223Available from publisher's Web site  a20100223b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03981naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100002000162245006400182300001800246500019300264500001500457520225900472650001302731650001902744650001602763650001102779650002002790650001602810650001702826650002302843650001702866650001802883650002102901650002002922653002202942653001802964653001802982653001903000653003103019653002303050653002803073653001903101700001703120700002103137700002903158773007703187852000903264856008503273930003303358945002503391946001103416655001203427IND4430039720221116222719.0091217s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443003972DNAL7 a10.1108/000707009109929612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However different models and determinants are used in the literature. This paper aims to provide an overview, within a framework linking Schwartz' values theory and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Also it seeks to focus on the importance of affective attitude, emotions, personal norm, involvement and uncertainty related to organic food consumption. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on secondary data sources, namely the literature concerning personal determinants of organic food consumption. Findings - Both the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour have been referred to as relevant theories for better understanding consumers' choice for organic food. Organic food consumption decisions can be explained by relating attributes of organic food with more abstract values such as "security", "hedonism", "universalism", "benevolence", "stimulation", "self-direction" and "conformity". Appealing to these values can positively influence attitudes towards organic food consumption. Besides attitude, subjective and personal norm and (perceived) behavioural control influence consumption of organic food. Research limitations/implications - More research related to the role of uncertainty (reduction) during the process of buying organic food is recommended. Practical implications - Relatively little research has examined the affective component of attitude and emotions in relation to organic food consumption, while these may play an important role as drivers of involvement and thus help to jolt food purchasers out of their routine of buying conventional food and set a first step to adopt organic food. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper providing a comprehensive overview and linking the literature on organic food consumption to the values theory and the theory of planned behaviour, including the role of personal norm and focusing on emotions. The proposed integration of mental processing in an organic food consumption model leads to interesting hypotheses and recommendations for policy makers, researchers and stakeholders involved in the organic food market. 3aemotions 3afood marketing 3auncertainty 3aethics 3apolicy analysis 3afood policy 3afood choices 3aconsumer attitudes 3astakeholders 3aorganic foods 3afood consumption 3adecision making 0aconsumer behavior 0asocial theory 0aeating habits 0apersonal norms 0atheory of planned behavior 0aliterature reviews 0aSchwartz' values theory 0ahuman behavior1 aVerbeke, Wim1 aMondelaers, Koen1 aHuylenbroeck, Guido van.0 tBritish food journal.g2009, v. 111, no. 10 p.1140-1167x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707009109929613Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03063naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001700211245006100228300001600289500002300305500001500328520093800343650001501281650001601296650001601312650002401328650002401352650001701376650001601393650001601409650000901425650001701434650001601451650001601467650002001483650001001503650004601513650001701559650001101576650002201587650003301609650001001642650001101652650000901663650001801672650002101690650002901711650001201740650002501752650001501777651001201792651001201804653002701816653001801843653002401861653001801885653003601903653002801939700002101967773012301988852000902111856008102120930003302201945002502234946001102259990002302270655001202293IND4430046720221116223058.0091218e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443004672DNAL7 a187836412pmid7 a10.3148/69.3.2008.1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMoffat, Tina10aFood Consumption Patterns: In Elementary School Children  ap. 152-154.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose: Food consumption was investigated in children attending three elementary schools in urban Hamilton, Ontario. Methods: Dietary data were collected from 92 children in grades 2 to 4 through 24-hour dietary recalls (39% participation rate). Servings of four food groups were compared with recommended daily servings in Canada's Food Guide. Results: The majority of students did not consume the recommended five daily servings of vegetables and fruit. On average, they consumed a high number of servings of "other foods," which were not included in the four food groups. More than 50% of the students did not consume the recommended daily servings of milk products, and only a small proportion (21%) drank milk during school lunch. Conclusions: We recommend that primary school educators promote the consumption of vegetables and fruits and milk products at school, either through healthy snack programs or educational programs. 3avegetables 3afood intake 3afood groups 3anutrition education 3aelementary students 3aserving size 3asnack foods 3aurban areas 3amilk 3afood choices 3afood guides 3adiet recall 3achild nutrition 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Requirements 2aSchools 2aStudentsxpsychology 2aVegetables 3aOntario 0aOntario 0ahealthy snack programs 0aeating habits 0aCanada's Food Guide 0afruits (food) 0ahealthy eating habits promotion 0adietary recommendations1 aGalloway, Tracey0 tCanadian journal of dietetic practice and research.g2008 Fall, v. 69, no. 3 p.152-154wJournal:12957x1486-38477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3148/69.3.2008.1523Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/15  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03922naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196100001800213245014200231300001600373500001500389520188600404650002002290650001802310650002602328650002502354650001302379650003202392650001602424650003102440650001402471650002102485650001502506650001002521650002102531650002802552650002402580650001102604650001702615650003302632650003302665650002202698650001302720650004202733650002702775653002402802700001602826700002502842700002402867700002702891700001802918700002402936773013702960852000903097856008303106930003303189945002503222946001303247655001203260IND4430062920221116223440.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006292DNAL7 a198898232pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.283762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEilander, Ans10aMultiple micronutrient supplementation for improving cognitive performance in children: systematic review of randomized controlled trials  ap. 115-130.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Although multiple micronutrient interventions have been shown to benefit children's intellectual development, a thorough evaluation of the totality of evidence is currently lacking to direct public health policy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review the present literature and to quantify the effect of multiple micronutrients on cognitive performance in schoolchildren. METHODS: The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge and local medical databases were searched for trials published from 1970 to 2008. Randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of ≥3 micronutrients compared with placebo on cognition in healthy children aged 0-18 y were included following protocol. Data were extracted by 2 independent researchers. The cognitive tests used in the trials were grouped into several cognitive domains (eg, fluid and crystallized intelligence), and pooled effect size estimates were calculated per domain. Heterogeneity was explored through sensitivity and meta-regression techniques. RESULTS: Three trials were retrieved in children aged <5 y, and 17 trials were retrieved in children aged 5-16 y. For the older children, pooled random-effect estimates for intervention were 0.14 SD (95% CI: -0.02, 0.29; P = 0.083) for fluid intelligence and -0.03 SD (95% CI: -0.21, 0.15; P = 0.74) for crystallized intelligence, both of which were based on 12 trials. Four trials yielded an overall effect of 0.30 SD (95% CI: 0.01, 0.58; P = 0.044) for academic performance. For other cognitive domains, no significant effects were found. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple micronutrient supplementation may be associated with a marginal increase in fluid intelligence and academic performance in healthy schoolchildren but not with crystallized intelligence. More research is required, however, before public health recommendations can be given. 3aschool children 3ahealth policy 3acognitive development 3aacademic achievement 3avitamins 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3aadolescents 3arandomized clinical trials 3acognition 3adietary minerals 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aDietary Supplements 2aHumans 2aIntelligence 2aMicronutrientsxpharmacology 2aMulticenter Studies as Topic 2aPatient Selection 2aPlacebos 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aVitaminsxpharmacology 0adietary supplements1 aGera, Tarun1 aSachdev, Harshpal S.1 aTransler, Catherine1 avan der Knaap, Henk CM1 aKok, Frans J.1 aOsendarp, Saskia JM0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.115-130dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.283763Available from publisher's Web site  a20110628b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle04153naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184100002100201245010000222300001600322500001500338506007600353520171000429506003702139650001702176650002402193650001302217650001802230650002402248650001002272650001002282650001702292650001102309650002202320650001602342650001702358650002502375650001602400650001402416650002002430650002802450650002102478650001502499650001002514650004302524650001602567650001602583650004802599650001302647650001102660650001102671650000902682650001602691650002202707650002902729650001502758650003202773650002802805650002802833650001602861651003302877653001902910653000902929653002702938700001702965700002002982700002103002773013703023852000903160856008303169930003303252945002503285946001303310655001203323IND4430063220221207060333.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006322DNAL7 a198898272pmid7 aPMC27931052pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.283212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aField, Alison E.10aWeight-control behaviors and subsequent weight change among adolescents and young adult females  ap. 147-153.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Little is known about the effectiveness of behavioral strategies to prevent long-term weight gain among adolescents and young adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the relation of dietary and physical activity weight-control strategies, alone and together, with subsequent weight change. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 4456 female adolescents and young adults aged 14-22 y in the ongoing Growing Up Today Study. Weight-control behaviors, including dietary approaches and physical activity, were self-reported in 2001 and were used to predict weight change from 2001 to 2005. RESULTS: In 2001-2002, 23.7% of female adolescents and young adults were trying to maintain their weight and another 54.4% were trying to lose weight. Approximately 25% used each of the following weight-control strategies: not eating snacks, following low-calorie or low-fat diets, and limiting portion sizes. In addition, 47.7% reported exercising at least occasionally for weight control. During 4 y of follow-up, participants gained an average of 3.3 kg. None of the dietary approaches to weight control predicted less weight change; however, females who exercised ≥5 d/wk gained significantly less weight than did their peers (-0.9 kg; 95% CI: -1.4, -0.4). The most successful strategy for weight-gain prevention among the females was to limit portion sizes (-1.9 kg; 95% CI: -2.6, -1.1) combined with frequent exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that physical activity is a necessary strategy for long-term weight control among adolescents and young adult females. Combining dietary weight-control approaches with physical activity is the most effective method for reducing weight gain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alow fat diet 3aprospective studies 3aexercise 3aeating habits 3abody weight changes 3agirls 3awomen 3aportion size 3asnacks 3along term effects 3aweight loss 3ayoung adults 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3alifestyle 3abehavior change 3aweight control programs 3alow calorie diet 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBehavior Controlxmethodsxpsychology. 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aDiet, Reducingxstatistics & numerical data 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aOverweightxepidemiology 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aweight control 0adiet 0aGrowing Up Today Study1 aHaines, Jess1 aRosner, Bernard1 aWillett, Walter.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.147-153dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.283213Available from publisher's Web site  a20110628b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle04606naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100002200179245007000201300001600271500001500287520207900302650002402381650001202405650002302417650002002440650002302460650002302483650003002506650001602536650002102552650002302573650002002596650002302616650002302639650002802662650002302690650001802713650001602731650004002747650001502787650001002802650001802812650002302830650002002853650003502873650004202908650002102950650002802971650002802999650001903027650001103046650001103057650002303068650002503091650000903116650002603125650002403151650001703175650002403192650002303216650002503239650002003264651001003284651002503294653003203319653001603351653001303367700001803380700001803398700002403416773013703440852000903577856008303586930003303669945002503702946001303727655001203740IND4430063620141219000000.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006362DNAL7 a199233782pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.275472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCorvalán, Camila10aObesity indicators and cardiometabolic status in 4-y-old children  ap. 166-174.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: In adults and adolescents, obesity is positively associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, evidence in preschool children is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the relations between obesity indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors in 324 Chilean children 4 y of age. DESIGN: We collected anthropometric measurements and calculated general indicators of obesity [weight, body mass index (BMI), sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses, percentage fat, and body fat index] and central obesity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and truncal fatness based on skinfold thickness). We measured blood sample concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, and total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. We used correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity (BMI-for-age z score >2, World Health Organization 2006), central obesity (≥90th percentile, third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), and lipid disorders was high (13%, 11%, and ≥ 20%, respectively), and 70% of the children had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Most correlations between obesity and central obesity indicators were moderate to strong (0.40 < r < 0.96). Obesity was positively but weakly associated with C-reactive protein in both sexes and with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance only in girls (all r < 0.3, P < 0.05). Obesity indicators were unrelated to interleukin-6 and lipid concentrations (P > 0.05). Overall, obesity indicators explained, at most, 8% of the variability in cardiometabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and central obesity were common, and most of the children had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, particularly lipid disorders. Obesity and central obesity indicators were highly intercorrelated and, overall, were weakly related to cardiometabolic status. At this age, body mass index and waist circumference were poor predictors of cardiometabolic status. 3awaist circumference 3aobesity 3apreschool children 3achild nutrition 3aC-reactive protein 3ainsulin resistance 3anutrition risk assessment 3ablood serum 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3abody mass index 3askinfold thickness 3anutritional status 3acardiovascular diseases 3adisease prevalence 3ainterleukin-6 3acholesterol 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Mass Index 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aChild, Preschool 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Characteristics 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 3aChile 0aChilexepidemiology. 0aanthropometric measurements 0abody weight 0abody fat1 aUauy, Ricardo1 aKain, Juliana1 aMartorell, Reynaldo0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.166-174dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.275473Available from publisher's Web site  a20110628b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle04495naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100001800179245011600197300001600313520180000329650003202129650003202161650002602193650002002219650002302239650002402262650001602286650002402302650001502326650001402341650000802355650001902363650001102382650001002393650001402403650001502417650001002432650002802442650002302470650002302493650003302516650003402549650005602583650007302639650003802712650006902750650003102819650001502850650001102865650000902876650004102885650002202926650004502948650004702993650002503040650002203065650003003087650002403117650004503141650002103186650002503207650005403232700003103286700001803317700002203335700002003357773013703377852000903514856008303523930003303606945002503639946001303664655001203677IND4430064120221116223421.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443006412DNAL7 a199233692pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.285862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBouwens, Mark10aPostprandial dietary lipid-specific effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles  ap. 208-217.  aBACKGROUND: Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a variety of beneficial effects, and immune cells play an important role in these effects. The mechanisms of action of PUFAs are still not completely understood, but it is known that PUFAs can influence the expression of a broad set of genes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the postprandial effects of intake of different fatty acids on the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). DESIGN: In a single-blind crossover study, 21 healthy male volunteers consumed shakes enriched in PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in random order. Blood samples were collected before and at several time points after intake. Whole-genome gene expression profiles of PBMCs were examined before and 6 h after intake of the PUFA and SFA shakes. In addition, ex vivo incubation of human PBMCs with different fatty acids was performed. RESULTS: Whole-genome expression analysis showed distinct differences between PUFA and SFA consumption. PUFA intake decreased the expression of genes in liver X receptor signaling, whereas SFA intake increased the expression of these genes. PUFA intake also increased the expression of genes related to cellular stress responses. MUFA intake had an intermediate effect on several genes. Ex vivo experiments showed a direct effect of free fatty acids on PBMC gene expression. CONCLUSION: This study showed that PBMCs can reveal fatty acid-specific gene expression profiles in young healthy men after the consumption of different fatty acids, as evidenced by the opposite effects of PUFA and SFA intakes on the expression of genes involved in liver X receptor signaling. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01000194. 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3agene expression 3apostprandial state 3asignal transduction 3adietary fat 3amechanism of action 3afat intake 3amonocytes 3amen 3ablood sampling 3agenome 3aliver 3areceptors 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDehydroepiandrosteronexblood 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGlycosuria 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMonocytesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOleic Acidxblood 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOrphan Nuclear Receptorsxbloodxgenetics. 2aPalmitic Acidxblood 2aPatient Selection 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPostprandial Period 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReference Values 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexpharmacology.1 aGrootte Bromhaar, Mechteld1 aJansen, Jenny1 aMüller, Michael.1 aAfman, Lydia A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.208-217dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.285863Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle03435naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001100161245016100172300001600333500002400349500001500373520175100388650001302139650005002152650001402202650001402216650002302230650002702253650002702280650002302307650001402330650001302344650001402357650001002371650001902381650004302400653001802443653001202461700001702473700001502490700001702505700001502522700001402537700001702551700001602568700001502584773011602599852000902715856007602724930003302800945002502833946001102858655001202869IND4383611320221120174913.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01149.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aXu, L.10aSymptomatic Evidence for Differential Root Invasion by Fusarium Crown and Root Rot Pathogens Between Common Tomato Lycopersicon esculentum and Its Varieties  ap. 577-586.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe pathogenic isolates (Kin2001a, Kin2001b and Kin2003) of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici were obtained from hydroponically cultured seedlings of pear tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. pyriforme) infected at different times and their pathogenicity examined in an in vitro assay system on cotyledonal seedlings of pear tomato, cherry tomato (L. esculentum var. cerasiforme) and common tomato (L. esculentum). With the in vitro assay, infection and subsequent disease progress could be microscopically observed. Pear and cherry tomatoes suppressed invasion by all isolates at the junctions of epidermal cells along the root, comparable with the resistant cultivars of common tomato. The pathogen entered pear and cherry tomatoes at the tips of lateral roots and tap roots, in contrast to infection of susceptible cultivars of common tomato. In Kin2003-inoculated roots, the top of the lateral rootlets first became discoloured, followed by the cortical parenchyma, central xylem vessel and finally the crown. This dark-brown discolouration expanded rapidly and severe rot developed in the discoloured regions. In contrast, the dark-brown discolouration in Kin2001b-infected roots expanded into the cortical parenchyma cells abutting the originally infected lateral rootlets and at a much slower rate. Kin2001a was in a new group that entered via the cortical cleavage formed by the emergence of lateral rootlets, in addition to the tips of taproots and lateral roots. In this in vitro assay system, the Japanese pathogenic isolates collected from different districts of Japan were characterized and classified by the mode of host invasion. Of 13 isolates, four were placed with Kin2003, six with Kin2001a and three with Kin2001b. 3atomatoes 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici 3acultivars 3aseedlings 3astrain differences 3amicrobial colonization 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3acrown rot 3aroot rot 3avirulence 3aroots 3adisease course 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0apathogenicity 0astrains1 aNonomura, T.1 aSuzuki, S.1 aKitagawa, Y.1 aTajima, H.1 aOkada, K.1 aKusakari, S.1 aMatsuda, Y.1 aToyoda, H.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Oct., v. 154, no. 10 p.577-586dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01149.x3electronic resource  a20070125b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002400197245011500221300001600336500002400352520166100376650002802037650003002065650002402095650001702119650001602136650001702152650001302169650001102182650001002193650001002203650002302213650002302236650003102259650001702290653002402307653001902331653001602350653002402366653002002390700002002410773010502430852000902535856007602544930003302620945002502653946001102678655001202689IND4383609420221120174811.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438360942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00809.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aL300 0aL001 0aL6001 aCAMPBELL, STUART A.10aIntegration of visual and olfactory cues of hosts and non-hosts by three bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)  ap. 437-449.  aIncludes references  a1. There has been a long-standing pre-occupation with how phytophagous insects use olfactory cues to discriminate hosts from non-hosts. Foragers, however, should use whatever cues are accurate and easily assessed, including visual cues. 2. It was hypothesised that three bark beetles, the mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, the Douglas-fir beetle (DFB), D. pseudotsugae Hopkins, and the western balsam bark beetle (WBBB), Dryocoetes confusus Swaine, integrate visual and olfactory information to avoid non-host angiosperms (e.g. paper birch, trembling aspen), that differ in visual and semiochemical profile from their respective host conifers (lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, interior fir), and tested this hypothesis in a series of field trapping experiments. 3. All three species avoided attractant-baited, white (non-host simulating) multiple-funnel traps, and preferred attractant-baited black (host-simulating) traps. In experiments combining white, non-host traps with non-host angiosperm volatiles, bark beetles were repelled by these stimuli in an additive or redundant manner, confirming that these species could integrate visual and olfactory information to avoid non-host angiosperms while flying. 4. When antiaggregation pheromones were released from white traps, the DFB and MPB were repelled in an additive-redundant manner, suggesting that beetles can integrate diverse and potentially anomalous stimuli. 5. The MPB demonstrated the most consistent visual preferences, suggesting that it may be more of a 'visual specialist' than the DFB or WBBB, for which visual responses may be more contingent on olfactory inputs. 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aDendroctonus pseudotsugae 3aDryocoetes confusus 3abark beetles 3ahost plants 3ahost seeking 3aforaging 3avision 3asmell 3abaits 3ainsect attractants 3avolatile compounds 3aantiaggregation pheromones 3afunnel traps 0ahost discrimination 0ahost selection 0avisual cues 0asensory integration 0aplant volatiles1 aBORDEN, JOHN H.0 tEcological entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.437-449dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00809.x3electronic resource  a20061101b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03870naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001800179245016500197300001600362500002400378520221100402650001302613650002202626650002702648650002102675650001402696650002402710650001502734650002202749650002302771650001702794650002502811650001802836650002402854651001302878653001202891700002202903700002002925700002402945700002002969700002102989700002303010700002403033773010503057852000903162856007603171930003303247945002503280946001103305655001203316IND4383610220221120165932.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00811.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF200 0aX1001 aDUAN, JIAN J.10aStatistical power analysis of a 2-year field study and design of experiments to evaluate non-target effects of genetically modified Bacillius thuringiensis corn  ap. 521-531.  aIncludes references  a1. A 2-year field study was conducted in 2000 and 2001 at a farm in Monmouth, Illinois to evaluate the effect of MON 863, a transgenic corn event that expresses the Cry3Bb1 protein for control of corn rootworms, on diverse groups of arthropod populations in a corn ecosystem. 2. The field study employed a split-plot design with MON 863 and conventional corn as the main plots and several insecticide treatments as subplots; each main plot was replicated four times (i.e. n = 4 block replications for each corn variety). A large number of arthropod taxa were trapped, taxonomically characterised, and counted in all plots. A mixed linear repeated-measures model was used for analysis of each taxon collected to determine if there was an effect of MON 863 or insecticide regime on that taxonomic group. 3. This report describes the results of a power analysis to determine the ability of the study design to detect an effect of MON 863 corn on the abundance of different groups of arthropods. A 50% difference in average taxon abundance between MON 863 and conventional corn plots was the criterion used in assessing the power. 4. A statistical power analysis of the taxonomic group comparisons made in the 2-year field study (with independent assignment of treatments each year) showed that only about 28% (22 of 56) of the statistical comparisons made with single years of data achieved >=80% power to detect a 50% difference in population density. When data from both years of the study were analysed jointly, this level of power was obtained for 86% (24 of 28) the comparisons made. 5. Graphical examination of the mean abundance and coefficient of variation (CV) for different taxa indicated that high abundance (> 5 trap captures per plot per sampling period) and low CV (< 100%) contributed to high statistical power (> 80%). Taxa with extremely low abundance (mean trap captures < 1 individual per plot per sampling period) generally had high CV (> 100%), and statistical comparisons for those taxa had lower power (< 80%). 6. The relevance of these findings for designing field studies on the effects of genetically modified crops on non-target arthropods with desired levels of power is discussed. 3aZea mays 3atransgenic plants 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3arootworms 3anontarget organisms 3aarthropods 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation density 3ainsecticides 3astatistical analysis 3alinear models 3aexperimental design 3aIllinois 0aBt corn1 aJiang, Changjian.1 aHead, Graham P.1 aBHATTI, MUHAMMAD A.1 aWARD, DENNIS P.1 aLEVINE, STEVE L.1 aNICKSON, THOMAS E.1 aNEMETH, MARGARET A.0 tEcological entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.521-531dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00811.x3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03038naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002300170245007400193300001600267500002400283520161100307650001401918650002501932650002001957650003201977650001402009650001602023650001202039650002002051650001402071650002702085653002502112653002502137653002002162653002102182653002402203700001802227700002102245700001902266773010502285852000902390856007602399930003302475945002502508946001102533655001202544IND4383609320221120165915.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438360932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2006.00804.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL0011 aMontserrat, Marta.10aTo be an intra-guild predator or a cannibal: is prey quality decisive  ap. 430-436.  aIncludes references  a1. Many cannibalistic species are also intra-guild predators. Such predators will often face the decision whether to consume a conspecific or a heterospecific prey from the same guild. This decision may depend on the relative quality and abundance of the prey but also on other factors such as relatedness by descent, prey-specific defence and the probability of the victim harbouring shared diseases. 2. Here, intra-guild interactions among two cannibalistic species of predatory mites, Iphiseius degenerans and Neoseiulus cucumeris (Acari: Phytoseiidae) that belong to closely related genera were studied. 3. Individuals of I. degenerans were offered a diet of conspecifics or heterospecifics. Because I. degenerans is capable of recognising kin individuals from non-kin, and they were exclusively offered conspecifics that were either distantly related or non-kin, it was expected that it would not refrain from cannibalising for reasons of possible relatedness. 4. When corrected for numbers of victims eaten, survival, and juvenile development of predators fed with intra-guild prey was higher than that of cannibals. This was probably caused by a higher quality of heterospecific victims, even though conspecific victims were larger and therefore potentially contained more food. This led to the prediction that the predators should strongly prefer heterospecific prey. This was indeed borne out in independent choice experiments. Thus, the choice of predators between heterospecific and conspecific prey is not only affected by avoidance of consuming conspecifics, but also by relative prey quality. 3aIphiseius 3aNeoseiulus cucumeris 3apredatory mites 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredation 3acannibalism 3akinship 3akin recognition 3amortality 3abiological development 0aIphiseius degenerans 0aintraguild predation 0aprey preference 0aconspecific prey 0aheterospecific prey1 aJANSSEN, ARNE1 aMAGALHÃES, SARA1 aSabelis, M.

Without a host plant to infect, such germination would lead to a reduced persistence of resting spores in the soil. The effect of four nonhost plants on P. brassicae was investigated in a 3-year field experiment and a 14-month glasshouse experiment. Three of the plant species used, leek (Allium porrum), winter rye (Secale cereale) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), have been reported to stimulate resting spore germination, while the fourth, red clover (Trifolium pratense), does not. In the field experiment, none of the plant species reduced the concentration of P. brassicae in soils when tested with bioassay plants (Chinese cabbage, Brassica rapa var. pekinensis). In the glasshouse experiment, there was a lower disease level in all plant treatments compared with the plant-free control following incorporation and decomposition of plant roots. At this time, pH in the soils with plant treatments was higher than that in the control soil. There were no indications of a species-specific interaction between any of the nonhost plants investigated and P. brassicae, and it cannot be concluded that any of them would be useful in the sanitation of P. brassicae-infested soils within short time periods. 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3afungal diseases of plants 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aspore germination 3afungal spores 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3adisease resistance 3aAllium porrum 3aleeks 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3aLolium perenne 3aturf grasses 3alawns and turf 3aTrifolium pratense 3aforage legumes 3aChinese cabbage 3adisease incidence 3asoil pH 0anonhost plants 0aresting spores 0aspore persistence1 aLagerlöf, J.1 aRämert, B.0 tPlant pathology.g2006 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.690-695dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44596x0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01408.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01408.x  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02808naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001700186245015500203300001600358500002400374520126300398650002001661650000901681650002501690650001601715650001401731650002301745650002301768650001401791650001901805650001901824650002201843650001401865650002401879651001501903700001501918700001201933700001601945700001501961773011701976852000902093856007602102856005502178930003302233945002502266946001102291655001202302IND4383598920221120160518.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438359892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01436.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Three disease parameters: single score on a scale of 0-6 at the seventh day after inoculation (SD7); area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC); and disease progress rate (Rd) were compared, and cultivars were classified into disease-response groups using a rank-sum method based on AUDPC scores for the two most virulent isolates. A wide range of variation in resistance of the D. alata cultivars, and significant effects of pathogen isolate and isolate-cultivar interactions, were observed for all disease parameters. The three disease parameters were positively correlated; however, four cultivars showed great dispersions from the regression lines for comparisons of SD7 with the multiple assessments based AUDPC and Rd. The 60 cultivars were separated into resistant (n = 12), moderately resistant (n = 19), moderately susceptible (n = 18) and susceptible (n = 11) groups. The potential of the tissue culture-derived whole-plant assay to resistance breeding programmes and further understanding of the yam anthracnose pathosystem is discussed. 3aDioscorea alata 3ayams 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aanthracnose 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3abioassays 3atissue culture 3adisease course 3adisease incidence 3avirulence 3aregression analysis 3aGuadeloupe1 aPétro, D.1 aAno, G.1 aEtienne, S.1 aRubens, S.0 tPlant pathology.g2006 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.671-678dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44596x0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01436.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01436.x  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02640naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245006300170300001800233500002400251500001500275520137400290650002301664650001701687650001401704650001901718650001101737650001701748650002301765650002101788650002501809650001701834653001701851653002101868773016001889852000902049856007702058930003302135945002502168946001302193655001202206IND4380164420221120071736.0060512e20060503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438016442DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052409j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aChoi, H.S.10aLipolytic effects of citrus peel oils and their components  ap. 3254-3258.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was conducted to determine the lipolytic effects of eight kinds of citrus peel oils and their components. All of the citrus peel oils revealed lipolytic effects on olive oil model solution ranging from 10.9 to 73.8%. Hakyul (Citrus natsudaidai Hayata) showed the highest lipolytic effect (73.8%), followed by yuza (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka, 68.1%) and lemon (Citrus limonium, 63.4%), and their effects were comparable with or stronger than that of 5 mM raspberry ketone (p < 0.05). Among 17 authentic compounds relating to citrus peel oils, octanal (78.6%) showed the highest lipolytic effect, followed by gamma-terpinene (76.3%), limonene (75%), terpinen-4-ol (70.7%), nerol (69.9%), p-cymene (67.7%), and geranyl acetate (67.2%), and their effects were stronger than that of 5 mM raspberry ketone (p < 0.05). Ethyl acetate, alpha-pinene, myrcene, citronellal, linallyl acetate, and citronellol exhibited poor lipolytic effect in the model solution. Lipolytic effect was found to be high when the oils included a higher content of gamma-terpinene and p-cymene. Limonene showed potential lipolytic effect, and its effect is likely to be enhanced by the presence of gamma-terpinene and p-cymene. It is considered that monoterpene hydrocarbons consisting of one or two double bonds would have stronger lipolytic effect than those having three double bonds. 3avolatile compounds 3aCitrus junos 3aolive oil 3aessential oils 3alipids 3aorange peels 3aCitrus natsudaidai 3aflavor compounds 3amedicinal properties 3aCitrus limon 0acitrus peels 0alipolytic effect0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 May 3, v. 54, no. 9 p.3254-3258dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052409j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/06/20  aOther US 7aarticle02900naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160072000900178100001400187245020700201300001800408500002400426500001500450506007600465520110600541506003701647650002501684650001701709650002001726650004301746650001801789650002201807650002401829650001501853650002301868653002601891653005001917653002601967700001901993700002002012700001402032700001902046773016002065852000902225856007702234930003302311945002502344946001302369655001202382IND4380164220221207061119.0060512e20060503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438016422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06061492doi7 aPMC32043702pmcid7 a166376802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aJiang, B.10aEvaluation of the botanical authenticity and phytochemical profile of black cohosh products by high-performance liquid chromatography with selected ion monitoring liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 3242-3253.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBlack cohosh (Actaea racemosa L., syn.

In this study, 11 black cohosh products were analyzed for triterpene glycosides, phenolic constituents, and formononetin by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection and a new selected ion monitoring liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Three of the 11 products were found to contain the marker compound cimifugin and not cimiracemoside C, thereby indicating that these plants contain Asian Actaea instead of black cohosh. One product contained both black cohosh and an Asian Actaea species. For the products containing only black cohosh, there was significant product-to-product variability in the amounts of the selected triterpene glycosides and phenolic constituents, and as expected, no formononetin was detected.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproduct authenticity 3aformononetin 3aActaea racemosa 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3atriterpenoids 3amass spectrometry 3adietary supplements 3aglycosides 3aphenolic compounds 0atriterpene glycosides 0aselected ion monitoring liquid chromatography 0aliquid chromatography1 aKronenberg, F.1 aNuntanakorn, P.1 aQiu, M.H.1 aKennelly, E.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 May 3, v. 54, no. 9 p.3242-3253dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06061493Available from publisher's Web site  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/06/20  aOther US 7aarticle02921naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166300001800260520155900278650003301837650001401870650001201884650001501896650002301911650002101934650001801955650001101973650002001984650001102004650001102015650005202026650001402078650001502092650002302107650001202130650001202142700001802154700002102172700001702193700001902210773017402229856005102403852000902454655001202463IND60579511220221123025323.0170820e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057951122DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Ju-Yun10aEffect of Wash Treatments on Reducing Human Norovirus on Iceberg Lettuce and Perilla Leaf  ap. 1908-1911.  aHuman noroviruses (NoVs) are major causes of nonbacterial gastroenteritis; they are transmitted by food and water, as well as person-to-person. The consumption of contaminated raw or uncooked food such as vegetables and fruits has been identified as a common source of human NoV outbreaks. In an effort to understand the survival and persistence of human NoVs on fresh produce, the efficacy of washing treatments in the removal of human NoVs from vegetables was evaluated. This study used artificially contaminated vegetables (iceberg lettuce and perilla leaf), and washing was done with tap water for convenience. Wash treatments included immersion in water, rinsing with running water, and a combination of immersion and rinsing (treatments I to III, respectively). The effect of a class I detergent, a commercial product used for washing fruits and vegetables, was also evaluated (treatment IV). After the wash treatments, the remnants of human NoVs on samples were measured via real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The results varied among treatments and by vegetable. For iceberg lettuce, a reduction of 0.9 log was noted in the treatment III group. The wash treatment was more effective in the perilla leaf samples: each treatment significantly reduced the numbers of human NoVs (0.69- to 1.29-log reduction). These data demonstrated that wash treatments reduced numbers of virus from the surfaces of the vegetables. Therefore, washing would seem to be a basic step in reducing numbers of virus in food preparation and in viral transmission routes. 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3aNorovirus 3aPerilla 3adetergents 3afood contamination 3afood preparation 3afresh produce 3afruits 3agastroenteritis 3ahumans 3aleaves 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atap water 3avegetables 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3awashing1 aLee, Jeong-Su1 aShin, Myoung-Hee1 aLee, Soon-Ho1 aHwang, In-Gyun0 tJournal of food protection.g2011 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1908-1911dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-063  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009200173300001800265520171200283650001801995650001402013650002002027650001002047650001502057650001702072650001002089650001302099650001802112650001902130650002602149650002302175650001002198700002502208773017402233856005102407852000902458655001202467IND60579510820221123025322.0170820e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057951082DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontville, Rebecca12aA Meta-Analysis of the Published Literature on the Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Soaps  ap. 1875-1882.  aThe goal of this research was to conduct a systematic quantitative analysis of the existing data in the literature in order to determine if there is a difference between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial soaps and to identify the methodological factors that might affect this difference. Data on hand washing efficacy and experimental conditions (sample size, wash duration, soap quantity, challenge organism, inoculum size, and neutralization method) from published studies were compiled and transferred to a relational database. A total of 25 publications, containing 374 observations, met the study selection criteria. The majority of the studies included fewer than 15 observations with each treatment and included a direct comparison between nonantimicrobial soap and antimicrobial soap. Although differences in efficacy between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial soap were small (~0.5-log CFU reduction difference), antimicrobial soap produced consistently statistically significantly greater reductions. This difference was true for any of the antimicrobial compounds investigated where n was >20 (chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophor, triclosan, or povidone). Average log reductions were statistically significantly greater (~2 log CFU) when either gram-positive or gram-negative transient organisms were deliberately added to hands compared with experiments done with resident hand flora (~0.5 log CFU). Our findings support the importance of using a high initial inoculum on the hands, well above the detection limit. The inherent variability in hand washing seen in the published literature underscores the importance of using a sufficiently large sample size to detect differences when they occur. 3achlorhexidine 3adatabases 3adetection limit 3aflora 3agluconates 3ahand washing 3ahands 3ainoculum 3ameta-analysis 3aneutralization 3aquantitative analysis 3aselection criteria 3asoaps1 aSchaffner, Donald W.0 tJournal of food protection.g2011 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1875-1882dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-122  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016500175300001800340520194600358650001302304650001302317650002402330650001502354650001102369650002102380650002402401650001802425650000902443650002102452650001402473650002002487650001902507650001802526650001502544650001302559650001502572650002202587650001202609650001402621700001702635700002202652700002502674700001902699700002102718773017402739856005102913852000902964655001202973IND60579510120221123025344.0170820e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057951012DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-2692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacDonald, Lauren E.12aA Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Pasteurization on Milk Vitamins, and Evidence for Raw Milk Consumption and Other Health-Related Outcomes  ap. 1814-1832.  aPasteurization of milk ensures safety for human consumption by reducing the number of viable pathogenic bacteria. Although the public health benefits of pasteurization are well established, pro–raw milk advocate organizations continue to promote raw milk as “nature's perfect food.” Advocacy groups' claims include statements that pasteurization destroys important vitamins and that raw milk consumption can prevent and treat allergies, cancer, and lactose intolerance. A systematic review and meta-analysis was completed to summarize available evidence for these selected claims. Forty studies assessing the effects of pasteurization on vitamin levels were found. Qualitatively, vitamins B12 and E decreased following pasteurization, and vitamin A increased. Random effects meta-analysis revealed no significant effect of pasteurization on vitamin B6 concentrations (standardized mean difference [SMD], −2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], −5.40, 0.8; P = 0.06) but a decrease in concentrations of vitamins B1 (SMD, −1.77; 95% CI, −2.57, −0.96; P < 0.001), B2 (SMD, −0.41; 95% CI, −0.81, −0.01; P < 0.05), C (SMD, −2.13; 95% CI, −3.52, −0.74; P < 0.01), and folate (SMD, −11.99; 95% CI, −20.95, −3.03; P < 0.01). The effect of pasteurization on milk's nutritive value was minimal because many of these vitamins are naturally found in relatively low levels. However, milk is an important dietary source of vitamin B2, and the impact of heat treatment should be further considered. Raw milk consumption may have a protective association with allergy development (six studies), although this relationship may be potentially confounded by other farming-related factors. Raw milk consumption was not associated with cancer (two studies) or lactose intolerance (one study). Overall, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the poor quality of reported methodology in many of the included studies. 3aadvocacy 3abacteria 3aconfidence interval 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3alactose intolerance 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3aneoplasms 3anutritive value 3apasteurization 3apublic health 3apyridoxine 3araw milk 3ariboflavin 3asystematic review 3athiamin 3avitamin A1 aBrett, James1 aKelton, W.

They feature a clear regulatory function in the development of different tissues, which is chiefly conveyed by the endostatin domain. This domain can be found in proteolytically released monomeric and trimeric versions, and their diverse and opposed effects on the migratory behavior of epithelial and endothelial cell types have been demonstrated in cell culture experiments. The only Drosophila multiplexin displays specific features of both vertebrate multiplexins, collagens XV and XVIII. We characterized the Drosophila multiplexin (dmp) gene and found that three main isoforms are expressed from it, one of which is the monomeric endostatin version. Generation of dmp deletion alleles revealed that Dmp plays a role in motor axon pathfinding, as the mutants exhibit ventral bypass defects of the intersegmental nerve b (ISNb) similar to other motor axon guidance mutants. Transgenic overexpression of monomeric endostatin as well as of full-length Dmp, but not trimeric endostatin, were able to rescue these defects. In contrast, trimeric endostatin increased axon pathfinding accuracy in wild type background. We conclude that Dmp plays a modulating role in motor axon pathfinding and may be part of a buffering system that functions to avoid innervation errors. 3aDrosophila 3aextracellular matrix 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxphysiology 2aCollagenxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEndostatinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aProtein Isoformsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 0acollagen XVIII and XV 0aendostatin 0amotoaxon guidance1 aMoussian, Bernard0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2009 June, v. 51, no. 5 p.483-498dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01111.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01790naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017900124300001600303500001500319520057500334650002000909650001400929650002400943650002000967650003000987650003001017650001901047650001801066650001201084650001401096653002601110653001201136700001501148700001801163700001401181700001401195773009301209852000901302930003301311945001301344946001101357655001201368IND2243423920221122034657.0010302e200004  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224342392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusuf, M.10aElectron microscopical evidence of a vertically transmitted Wolbachia-like parasite in the pathenogenetic, stored-product pest Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel (Psocoptera)  ap. 169-175.  a2019-12-05  aElectron microscopical investigations of the reproductive system of the common domestic pest, Liposcelis bostrychophila show the presence of dense concentrations of small bacterial inclusions.

(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) led to the present investigation. Maximum female size and average number of progeny per female mite were assessed at eight different temperatures (ranging from 20 to 41 degrees C) and 60% r.h. using R. dominica as the host. The ability of the mite species to suppress eggs, first instar larvae, and adults of R. dominica was assessed at 30 degrees C and 60% r.h. The largest female sizes of the mite and progeny numbers were obtained around 30 degrees C (259 micrometers and 17 offspring/female respectively) with minimum values obtained at the most extreme temperatures used in this study. Mite densities of at least four individuals per 500 ml jar containing 50 adults of R. dominica, resulted in almost complete suppression of eggs, first instar larvae, and adults of the host species after 45 days. This same range of mite densities led to reductions of wheat weight losses of 15 and 25% after 45 and 60 days after infestation respectively. Acarophenax lacunatus shows good potential as a biological control agent of R. dominica. 3areproduction 3aAcarophenax 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aambient temperature 3apopulation density 3awheat 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3astorage pests 3aparasites 3afemales 0alosses 0aseed weight 0asize 0aparasites of insect pests1 aGuedes, R.N.C.1 aMatioli, A.L.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2000 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.53-63x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02573naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014600128300001400274500002400288520110000312650001801412650002501430650001301455650002501468650002701493650001001520650001601530650002501546650001601571650002401587650002201611650001501633650001501648650002001663650002101683650002901704650001601733650001201749650001201761650001101773650001301784700002101797700001601818700002101834700002301855700002401878773007101902852000901973856007301982655001202055IND4458498720221121222555.0110531s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445849872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasavaraj, M.10aEffect of Dietary Supplementation of Curcuma Longa on the Biochemical Profile and Meat Characteristics of Broiler Rabbits under Summer Stress  ap. 15-18.  aIncludes references  aEighteen four week's old weaned broiler rabbits of comparable body weights were allotted to three dietary treatment groups of six rabbits in each group namely T0 (basal control diet, T1 (basal diet added with turmeric rhizome powder, TRP, at the ratio of 150mg)and T2 (basal diet added with TRPat the ratio of 300micrograms/100g diet).

To evaluate the release of FA and the transformation to 4-VG, the levels of FA and 4-VG were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrum (GC- MS), respectively. During rice wine brewing, the concentrations of FA and 4-VG increased as fermentation time prolonged, with a rapid rise in days 1 to 5 of the main fermentation and followed by a slower rise from the 6th day post inoculation. FA and 4-VG levels in mashes, fermented by yeast with wheat Qu, were significantly higher than those in mashes fermented by yeast using commercial enzyme additions. The release of FA from rice by wheat Qu involves an enzymatic release mechanism. The levels of FA and 4-VG from rice flour by wheat Qu rose gradually during the first 24 h and then tended to stabilize. The capacity of yeasts to decarboxylate phenolic acids (Pof+ phenotype) was absent in most rice wine brewing yeasts. These results suggest that the production of FA and 4-VG originated from materials in the wheat Qu rather than by the yeast during Chinese rice wine brewing and fermentation. 3abrewers yeast 3adecarboxylation 3afermentation 3aferulic acid 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amash 3aphenotype 3arice 3arice flour 3arice wines 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aXu, Yan0 tJournal of the Institute of Brewing.g2010, v. 116, no. 3 p.304-311x0046-97507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.scientificsocieties.org/jib/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01520naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008700161300001600248520064400264592002800908653001800936653001600954653002800970700002000998700002901018773011101047856007501158852000901233655001201242IND60126443920221117001611.0151107e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012644392DNAL7 a10.1651/11-3480.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuoka, Takashi10aSetae for Gill-Cleaning of Six Species of Japanese Sentinel Crabs (Macrophthalmus)  ap. 598-605.  aThe setae involved in the gill-cleaning mechanism of six species of Japanese sentinel crabs are described.

New perspectives and approaches are required to be adopted by all members of the society, including the businesses for sustainable development. However, enabling such integration from an organisational management perspective is not straightforward, due to complexities and conflicts associated with balanced integration of economic, environmental and social agendas. Aimed towards addressing this important industrial and societal research requirement, a tailored framework is presented, constructed upon the deeply rooted management principles of quality management (QM) and supply chain management (SCM) to facilitate integration of triple bottom line sustainability into business management. The framework outlines the practical steps for implementation of such an approach, including the quantitative, current state maturity assessment as one of the key application steps. This framework is taken forward to an application step, at an organisation in Cyprus, undertaken through the action research study method that enabled demonstrating both its application, and its positive effects on the sustainable development of the participating organisation. Several contributions are made, including the formulation of a practical approach to organisational integration of triple bottom line sustainability through QM and SCM. Particularly, a new management perspective was introduced with implications to many organisational managers that adopt ISO 9001 and supply chain integration principles, setting a framework for extending these principles beyond their original QM and SCM agendas towards organisational sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness management 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3aCyprus 0aSustainability 0aQuality management 0aSupply chain management 0aSustainable supply chain quality management 0aISO 9001 0aSupply chain integration1 aLiyanage, Kapila0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2019 Oct., v. 20 p.207-229dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245007200180300001600252500000900268520172100277592002801998650001602026650002202042650001902064650001202083650000902095650001102104650001402115650000902129650002002138650001602158650001102174650000902185650001302194650002202207650001602229650001502245700001902260700001802279773014802297856009602445852000902541655001202550IND60667878820221119004302.0191125e196907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066787882DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1969.03615995003300040012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConyers, E.

X-ray diffractograms of the treated clays suggest the following effects on the mineral structures. Resin caused relatively minor changes compared to unweathered specimens. NaBPh₄ removed interlayer K from 10A and 10–14A interstratified components of illite, vermiculite, and Brookston soil clay resulting in partial expansion of 10–14A components as evidenced by diffractograms of glycolated samples. HNO₃ dissolved less stable components of the illite specimen and/or favored preferred orientation of aggregates as indicated by marked increases in the intensity of mica basal reflections. Estimations of K content of mica from 10:5A peak-intensity and area ratios indicated that mica remnants in acid-treated illite were lower in K than those in unweathered or NaBPh₄-treated illite. Treatment with HNO₃ severely altered the expansibility of vermiculite, transforming a part of the specimen into an expanding lattice structure and dissolving much of the remainder. The 10A and 14A components of Brookston soil clay were less altered by HNO₃ treatment; however, the 17–18A peak in the glycolated sample was sharper, and thermally stable interlayer components were less evident after acid treatment. HNO₃- and NaBPh₄-treated kaolinite and montmorillonite basal spacings remained essentially the same as untreated samples. These data are evaluated in terms of mechanisms of K-release from the weathered clays and subsequent K-content found in soybean plants (Glycine max L.) grown in the clay residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid treatment 3aboiling 3aclay 3aillite 3akaolinite 3amica 3amontmorillonite 3anitric acid 3asodium 3asoil 3asoybeans 3athermal stability 3avermiculite 3aweathering1 aWilding, L.

This was then functionalized by the APTMS group in order to produce NH₂-magMCM-41 as a novel and low–cost adsorbent. The XRD, VSM, N₂ adsorption–desorption, FT–IR, TGA, SEM and TEM analyses were utilized to characterize the produced materials. In order to optimize the adsorption of the Pb(II) ions, the RSM (response surface methodology) was applied by using the synthesized adsorbent in aqueous solutions. A rotatable CCD (central composite design) was adopted to carry out the experiments and RSM was used to analyze them. Three independent factors namely, initial solution pH (3–7), adsorbent dosage (0.1–2 g L⁻¹), and initial Pb(II) concentration (15–150 mg L⁻¹) were used to investigate the removal procedure. According to the obtained results, the initial solution pH of 5.22, adsorbent dosage of 0.1 g L⁻¹, and initial Pb(II) concentration of 150 mg L⁻¹ were considered as the optimum conditions with 64.32% removal of Pb(II) and an adsorption capacity of 540.64 mg g⁻¹. The maximum removal efficiency of Pb(II) ions was found to be 96.76%. The Sips isotherm model represents a better correlation with equilibrium data. It was reported by the kinetic study that data taken from the experiments fitted better to the pseudo–second–order model compared to the pseudo–first–order and intraparticle diffusion models. Finally, according to the thermodynamic study, the removal process strongly depends on temperature, which indicates an exothermic behavior and spontaneous nature of the adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3agreen chemistry 3aheat production 3aions 3alead 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aporous media 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice hulls 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aRice husk 0amagMCM-41 mesoporous silica 0aPb(II) adsorption 0aResponse surface methodology1 aGhorbani, Farshid1 aSanati, Ali Mohammad0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2019 Sept., v. 13 p.100153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2019.1001533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166300001600273520159900289536029301888592002802181596008702209596011202296596009802408650003702506650001502543650002102558650001102579650002902590650003702619650001702656650001702673650000902690650001102699650001302710650002202723650001502745650001402760651001002774653002202784653002902806653001602835653001402851653002602865700002102891700001502912700001502927700001502942700001802957773011702975856008503092852000903177655001203186IND60595858020221119170906.0180608e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059585802DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.12968932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chen10aInteractions between copper(II) and DOM in the urban stormwater runoff: modeling and characterizations  ap. 120-129.  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) can strongly interact with both organic and inorganic contaminants to influence their transportation, transformation, bioavailability, toxicity and even their ultimate fate. Within this work, DOM was extracted from urban stormwater runoff samples collected from a regular sampling site of a typical residential area in Beijing, China. Copper(II) ions were selected as model to investigate the interactions between DOM and typical heavy metals. Both ultraviolet (UV) absorbance and fluorescence titration methods were introduced to determine the complex capacities (CL) and conditional stability constants (log KM) of bonding between DOM and copper (II) ions, which revealed that the values of CL were 85.62 and 87.23 μmol mg⁻¹ and the log KM values were 5.37 and 5.48, respectively. The results suggested the successful complexation between DOM and copper(II) ions. Furthermore, morphology of the DOM binding to copper(II) ions was confirmed by both energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which can facilitate to clarify the corresponding mechanism. The Cu 2p₃/₂ peak at 933.7 eV and the characteristic shake-up peaks of Cu–O were found in the XPS spectra, implying that copper(II) ions might coordinate with hydroxyl (aliphatic or phenolic) or carboxyl groups. With these profitable results, it can be concluded that DOM in urban stormwater runoff has a strong binding affinity with copper(II) ions, which may further lead to potentially significant influence on their migration and transformation.  aWe thank the financial support from the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [grant number 8152013], the Importation & Development of High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions [CIT&CD201404076], and National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 51478026].  aPublisher supplied data  a8152013cBeijing Natural Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005089  aCIT&CD201404076cImportation & Developmentof High-Caliber Talents Project of Beijing Municipal Institutions  a51478026cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3abinding capacity 3acopper 3adissolved organic matter 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3aions 3amodels 3amoieties 3aresidential areas 3astormwater 3atitration 3aChina 0aStormwater runoff 0adissolved organic matter 0acopper ions 0atitration 0ainteraction mechanism1 aWang, Chong-Chen1 aLi, Jun-Qi1 aWang, Peng1 aOu, Jia-Qi1 aCui, Jing-Rui0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 39, no. 1 p.120-129dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.12968933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009500157300001300252500002000265520208000285592002802365650002302393650001602416650000902432650001402441650001202455650001802467650001502485650002402500650001402524650001302538650002202551650001202573700002002585700001702605700001302622700001602635700001502651700001702666700005402683700005602737773012102793856007502914852000902989655001202998IND60589210920221119003845.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058921092DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.123062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Mingsong10aClinical applications of IDDSI framework for texture recommendation for dysphagia patients  ap. 2-10.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDysphagia is a highly prevalent eating and swallowing disorder among elderly people, impacting negatively on the health and well‐being of those afflicted. With increasing populations of elderly people, food industries are under growing pressure to produce appropriately texture‐modified food for safe consumption by these vulnerable populations. Recently published International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) framework provides a new global guideline on texture modification and standardization for dysphagia patients. This work was designed to test the feasibility of IDDSI framework for clinical applications by assessing the correlation between swallowing capability of dysphagia patients and the IDDSI texture levels. Altogether 26 elderly subjects were recruited and assessed for their dysphagia grades using the Water Drinking Test. Subjects were provided with fluid samples constituted at different consistencies from a commercial product and swallowing performance (time of swallowing, number of swallows, and number of coughs) was monitored and recorded. Correlations among swallowing capability parameters were observed. Most importantly, results from this work clearly demonstrated that the severity of dysphagia by water‐based swallow tests correlates positively with the IDDSI fluid thickness aimed at reducing dysphagia symptoms in those patients, confirming the reliability and feasibility of IDDSI framework for clinical applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Swallowing disorder or dysphagia occurs commonly among many elderly people and imposes negative impacts on their health and well‐being. Medical professionals can diagnose eating and swallowing capability in a qualitative manner, but have difficulty in making diet recommendation because of the lack of texture guidance. This work confirmed the feasibility of IDDSI framework for clinical and bedside applications. The correlation between the capability grades of swallowing and IDDSI texture levels established in this work provides a useful measure for such applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3adeglutition 3adiet 3adysphagia 3aelderly 3afood industry 3aguidelines 3ahealth care workers 3aingestion 3apatients 3apopulation growth 3atexture1 aZheng, Gangying1 aChen, Yanqiu1 aXie, Hua1 aHan, Weijia1 aYang, Qing1 aSun, Jianqin1 aLv, Zhihong1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-34041 aChen, Jianshe1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7000-14690 tJournal of texture studies.g2018 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.2-10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl372x0022-49017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.123063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245007600179300001800255500000900273520158900282592002801871650001201899650001601911650000901927650001801936650001401954650002701968650001301995650001502008650001402023650001602037650001802053650001402071650001102085650000902096650001902105650001802124650001602142651001102158700001402169700002002183773015102203856009602354852000902450655001202459IND60667879020221119004142.0191125e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066787902DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600050015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimard, R.

The objective of this work was to investigate K and Mg release from silt and clay fractions of four Québec soils. All soils were characterized by a mixed clay mineralogical composition; feldspars and quartz dominated the silt and vermiculite and hydrous micas the clay fractions. Fifteen sequential extractions with 5 × 10⁻⁴ M citric acid, through a period of 3200 h, and a single extraction with boiling 1.0 M HNO₃ were conducted. The kinetics of slowly exchangeable K and Mg release were described using a parabolic diffusion equation. Among particle-size fractions, the largest amounts and rate of release were in the fine silt for K, and in the fine and medium silt for Mg. Citric acid extraction resulted in the dissolution of trioctahedral phyllosilicates from the soil fractions of the two Laurentidian soils and to the transformation of dioctahedral micas to vermiculite in the Appalachian soils. The amounts of K released from the soil fractions in diluted citric acid solutions were significantly related to their amounts of HNO₃-extractable forms (r = 0.76, P ≤ 0.01) but not to the structural or total forms. These results extend to soil minerals the results of previous studies on the resistance of pure species to hydrolysis and complexation reactions by citric acid. This study also suggests that information about silt fractions must be included in mineralogical classifications of soils for K and Mg management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acitric acid 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aequations 3aexchangeable potassium 3afeldspar 3ahydrolysis 3amagnesium 3anitric acid 3aparticle size 3apotassium 3aquartz 3asilt 3asoil fertility 3asoil minerals 3avermiculite 3aQuebec1 aZizka, J.1 aDe Kimpe, C.

This process was carried out via mechanochemical pretreatment in AGO-2 high intensity planetary mill. Highest yield of rutin was obtained by grinding H. mutabilis with Na₂CO₃ (15.0wt.%) and Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O (1.5wt.%) for 4min, extraction temperature at 25°C, total extraction time of 15min (two cycles of 10min and 5min), acidification pH 5.0 and solvent/material ratio of 25mL/g. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and diffuse-reflectance UV–Vis spectrum were applied to identify the physicochemical property changes. These changes mainly included the enhanced diffusivity and water solubility of rutin resulting from the breakage of cell walls and its transformation into a water-soluble salt form by the mechanochemical pretreatment. Compared with heat reflux and superfine grinding extraction, MCAE showed the advantages of efficiency, no organic solvent consumption and much lower extraction temperature. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: In this study, mechanochemical-assisted extraction of rutin from H. mutabilis was developed and the physicochemical changes in this process were supervised. Owing to its great potential to transform the target compounds into water-soluble forms, MCAE provided a good alternative for efficient aqueous extraction of bioactive compounds, especially some poorly water-soluble natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidification 3acell walls 3adiffusivity 3aextraction 3aheat 3apH 3arutin 3asalts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aShi, Lixia1 aZhu, Xingyi1 aWang, Ping1 aZhao, Yi1 aSu, Weike0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2011 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.146-152dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2010.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012100180300001600301520110700317536023701424592002801661596002701689596010301716650001601819650001801835650002401853650001101877650001701888650001601905650001101921650001201932650001201944650001401956650001701970650001501987650001902002650001602021650001202037650002302049650001502072650001902087650001702106650001502123653002402138653002002162653001102182653001402193653001402207700001602221700002002237773011702257856008502374852000902459655001202468IND60595858220221119170751.0180608e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059585822DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13084392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrümpel, Johannes Hagen10aIntrinsic gas production kinetics of selected intermediates in anaerobic filters for demand-orientated energy supply  ap. 558-565.  aAs a consequence of a growing share of solar and wind power, recent research on biogas production highlighted a need for demand-orientated, flexible gas production to provide grid services and enable a decentralized stabilization of the electricity infrastructure. Two-staged anaerobic digestion is particularly suitable for shifting the methane production into times of higher demand due to the spatio-temporal separation of hydrolysis and methanogenesis. To provide a basis for predicting gas production in an anaerobic filter, kinetic parameters of gas production have been determined experimentally in this study. A new methodology is used, enabling their determination during continuous operation. An order in methane production rate could be established by comparing the half lives of methane production. The order was beginning with the fastest: acetic acid>ethanol>butyric acid>iso-butyric acid>valeric acid>propionic acid>1,2propanediol>lactic acid. However, the mixture of a natural hydrolysate from the acidification tank appeared to produce methane faster than all single components tested.  aThis study originates from the project ‘Methanoquant’ [FKZ 03SF0423B] and is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) and the Projektträger Jülich (PtJ).  aPublisher supplied data  cProjektträger Jülich  aFKZ 03SF0423BcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347 3aacetic acid 3aacidification 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abutyric acid 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afilters 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainfrastructure 3alactic acid 3amethane 3amethane production 3aprediction 3apropionic acid 3avaleric acid 3awind power 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aVFA degradation 0abiogas 0atwo stage 0atwo phase1 aIlli, Lukas1 aLemmer, Andreas0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 39, no. 5 p.558-565dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13084393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009300161520160400254592002801858650001201886650001001898650002101908650002301929650001801952650002301970650001801993650001602011650001402027650002102041650001502062650003102077650001102108650002202119650001202141650000902153700001802162700002602180700002002206700001902226773012202245856007502367852000902442655001202451IND60769780020221120223044.0220310e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978002DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140510172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatto, Zuhair S.10aFood and Nutrient Displacement by Walnut Supplementation in a Randomized Crossover Study  aThe aim of this article is to evaluate the effect of a daily supplement of walnuts on the overall daily diet and nutrient profile of healthy adults. A randomized controlled trial with crossover design was conducted for two 6-month diet periods in southeast Californian communities. Subjects were randomized to receive a control diet or a walnut-supplemented diet, then switched. The walnut supplement represented approximately 12% of their daily energy intake. Trained nutritionists collected seven 24 h dietary recalls from each participant (a total of 14 recalls for both periods). Ninety participants were able to complete the study, including 50 females and 40 males. The average age of the participants was 54.3 years. Diets in the walnut period had significantly higher vegetable protein, total fat, total PUFA, PUFA 18:2, PUFA 22:6, and total dietary fiber (p < 0.05), while also exhibiting significantly lower PUFA 20:5. All mineral levels were higher on the walnut-supplemented diet. Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc were, particularly, significantly higher among the walnut-supplemented group (p < 0.05). Displacement occurred in more than one-third of the entire nuts and seeds group; four-fifths of the non-alcoholic beverages and desserts groups; and the majority of the candy, sugar, and sweets group. Walnut supplementation can lead to favorable modifications in nutrient and food intake profiles that may contribute to chronic disease prevention. Nutrient and food displacement may be a mechanism to explain the favourable association between walnut intake and improved diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acandy 3achronic diseases 3across-over studies 3adietary fiber 3adisease prevention 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3arandomized clinical trials 3asugars 3avegetable protein 3awalnuts 3azinc1 aSiapco, Gina 1 aJaceldo-Siegl, Karen 1 aHaddad, Ella H.1 aSabaté, Joan,0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140510173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245011600216300001600332520133000348592002801678650001901706650001401725650001101739650002201750650002401772650002501796650000901821650001401830650001501844650001101859650001601870650002101886653001601907653002001923653002201943653003101965653002301996700002402019773011502043856008602158852000902244655001202253IND60610768220221119173439.0190725e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061076822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFellah Jahromi, Arash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8409-546210aElectrokinetically assisted oil-water phase separation in oily sludge with implementing novel controller system  ap. 434-440.  aUpstream and downstream petroleum industry generate of significant amounts of oily sludge per day. On the other hand, a disposal of such sludge requires expensive pre-treatments following local regulations. Conventional processes, like centrifugal separation provide sludge volume reduction and water extraction. However, water-in-oil emulsion requires extra stages for phase separation, which overall increases the costs. Therefore, electrokinetically (EK) assisted oil-water phase separation method was considered. In this study, a novel implemented controller, installed into the EK system, permitted to increase the length of exposure time to electrical field, while a significant decrease of energy consumption was observed. The controller, implemented based on Percolation Theory and applied to a linear horizontal EK system, showed enhanced sludge demulsification and improvement the quality of separated fractions. TGA analysis showed a superior quality of liquids extracted by EK with controller comparing to liquids without controller or generated by centrifuging process. A reaction rate with respect to temperature to assess the presence of water in the oil was also defined. The method, shown in this paper, advances the oil-water phase separation and permits for better oil recovery and sludge volume reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3aexposure duration 3amathematical theory 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aseparation 3asludge 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aOily sludge 0aElectrokinetics 0aController theory 0aOil-water phase separation 0aPercolation theory1 aElektorowicz, Maria0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 358 p.434-440dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245003900193300001600232520176800248592002802016650001502044650002202059650002102081650002402102650001102126650001102137650001602148650000902164650001502173650001002188650001202198650001102210650001102221650000902232650001602241650001502257650003202272650001202304650001602316651001002332651001202342651001202354700002902366773011402395856004802509852000902557655001202566IND50063060420221121035833.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006306042DNAL7 a226100822pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-012-0549-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEludoyin, Oyenike Mary14aThe physiologic climate of Nigeria  ap. 241-264.  aThis study describes the spatial and temporal variations in the physiologic climate of Nigeria for 1951–2009 in terms of effective temperature (ET), temperature-humidity index (THI), relative strain index (RSI) and perception of 3,600 sampled populations. The main hypotheses are that (i) the existing vegetation-based ecological region could adequately elucidate the physiologic climate of the country, and (ii) physiologic stress has significantly increased over the years (1951–2009). Trends and changes in the selected indices (ET, THI and RSI) were examined over two time slices: 1951–1980 and 1981–2009. The results show that (1) the montane region was the most comfortable physiologic climate in Nigeria, and the regions around the Rivers Niger and Benue troughs were the most uncomfortable in most parts of the year, (2) physiologic stress in most parts of Nigeria has significantly increased in 1981–2009 over 1951–1980 (p ≤ 0.05), (3) coping strategies to the uncomfortably hot and cold climate in Nigeria are limited to dressing mode, clothing materials and use of air conditioners or fan, (4) ET, THI and RSI results could be similar, and complementary; but each is with its strengths and weaknesses for annual or seasonal representations, which the others complemented for the interpretation of the physiologic climate of Nigeria. The study concluded that the relationship between the ecological classification of Nigeria and physiologic climate is rather complex, and the former could not elucidate the latter. The study cited inadequate meteorological data, especially on wind chill, and health records as limiting factors of studies on the Nigerian physiologic climates and the effect of extreme thermal conditions on the people.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold zones 3acoping strategies 3afans (equipment) 3ameteorological data 3apeople 3arivers 3atemperature 3awind 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aClimate 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aWeather 2aYoung Adult 3aNiger 3aNigeria 0aNigeria1 aAdelekan, Ibidun Onikepo0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2013 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.241-264dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-012-0549-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010000154300001800254500002000272520131000292592002801602650001601630650001601646650001401662650001501676650001701691650001701708650003301725650001801758650001601776650002401792650001101816650003401827650001401861650001801875650001601893700001901909700001901928700001601947700005101963700001702014700001402031773014802045856007402193852000902267655001202276IND60589211320221119004159.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058921132DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.86112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haixia10aApplication of biopolymers for improving the glass transition temperature of hairtail fish meat  ap. 1437-1443.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Glass transition temperature (Tg) and food moisture content are closely related, especially in foods with a high moisture content, such as surimi products. In order to improve storage condition and maintain food quality, the influence of six biopolymers on the Tg of hairtail fish meat paste was investigated by differential scanning colorimetry. RESULTS: Samples were stored at −8 °C (>Tg), −14 °C (Tg) and −18 °C (<Tg) for 105 days. The results showed that trehalose, maltodextrin and xanthan could obviously improve the Tg of the hairtail fish meat paste. Trehalose at 4.1% (w/w), maltodextrin at 5.0% and xanthan at 0.41% were determined as the optimum amounts, with the predicted value of Tg to be −14.1 °C. The total viable counts (TVC) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB‐N) of samples stored at −14 and −18 °C were much lower and the gel strength and whiteness maintained much better than those of −8 °C. CONCLUSION: Addition of biopolymers could effectively restrain the increase in TVC and TVB‐N, as well as the dropping of gel strength and whiteness of fish meat paste during storage. A mixture of the biopolymers could improve Tg and showed great potential in the preservation of hairtail meat products. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acolorimetry 3afish meat 3afish paste 3afood quality 3agel strength 3aglass transition temperature 3amaltodextrins 3aplate count 3astorage temperature 3asurimi 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atrehalose 3awater content 3axanthan gum1 aYang, Shuibing1 aYuan, Chunhong1 aHu, Qinglan1 aLi, Yuan1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1626-437X1 aChen, Shiguo1 aHu, Yaqin0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Mar., v. 98, no. 4 p.1437-1443dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.86113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245018400169300001800353500001900371500002000390520203000410592002802440596007602468596002302544650001502567650001802582650002402600650001502624650001802639650002302657650001302680650001102693651001102704700003102715700002402746700007202770773010902842856007302951852000903024655001203033IND60712161220221122020709.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071216122DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.128302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega‐Álvarez, Rubén10aAssessing the effects of habitat characteristics and co‐occurrence with closely related species on occupancy of resident ‘wood‐warblers’ in a Neotropical working landscape  ap. 1262-1278.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe simultaneous effects of habitat traits and interspecific interactions determine the occurrence and habitat use of wildlife populations. However, little research has been devoted to examining spatial co‐occurrence among closely related species while considering the effect of habitat variation and imperfect detectability of species in the field. In this study, we focused on migratory and resident 'wood‐warblers' that coexist during the winter in a Neotropical working landscape in southern Mexico to understand if habitat occupancy of resident wood‐warblers is influenced by habitat characteristics and by the presence of other species of resident and migratory wood‐warblers. For this purpose, we implemented two‐species occupancy models, which account for the imperfect detectability of these birds in the field. Our results revealed that habitat occupancy of resident wood‐warblers was positively influenced by the presence of other closely related species (both migratory and resident). These positive relationships may be explained by the fact that different species of wood‐warblers frequently participate in mixed‐species flocks. However, these patterns of species co‐occurrence were more evident among resident species than between migratory and resident species, which may be explained by micro‐habitat segregation and differences in behaviours between resident and migratory wood‐warblers. We also found that some habitat characteristics may mediate the observed patterns of species co‐occurrence. Specifically, sites with larger trees were associated with the co‐occurrence of some species of resident wood‐warblers. In addition, we discuss the possibility that species co‐occurrence might be the result of shared preferences for environmental factors that we did not consider. Our study highlights the importance of the interplay between species co‐occurrence and habitat traits in determining the presence and habitat use of resident birds in Neotropical working landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  aSPSBcComisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad  cRufford Foundation 3aNeotropics 3aPasseriformes 3ahabitat preferences 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3amigratory behavior 3awildlife 3awinter 3aMexico1 aBerrones Benítez, Esteban1 aMedina Mena, Israel1 aZúñiga‐Vega, José Jaime1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9661-15210 tIbis.g2020 Oct., v. 162, no. 4 p.1262-1278dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.128303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01552naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010500153300001800258520040600276592002800682650002700710650002300737650002300760700001800783700002100801700002300822700001200845700001600857700001500873700001400888700002100902700001900923700002000942773013300962856007401095852000901169655001201178IND60659610920221120063518.0190823e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065961092DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc33780k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Na10aBenzothiazolium-functionalized tetraphenylethene: an AIE luminogen with tunable solid-state emission  ap. 8637-8639.  aMelding a benzothiazolium unit with tetraphenylethene generates a new hemicyanine luminogen with aggregation-induced emission characteristics; the luminogen exhibits crystochromism and its solid-state emission can be repeatedly tuned from yellow or orange to red by grinding–fuming or grinding–heating processes due to the transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous state and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions1 aYang, Zhiyong1 aLam, Jacky W.

Phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare disorder causing high blood and brain phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations, is associated with neurocognitive disability. Lifelong treatment is mainly dietetic with a Phe-restricted diet, supplemented with a low-Phe protein substitute. Treatment adherence commonly decreases in adolescence, with some adults ceasing dietary treatment. In maternal PKU, elevated blood Phe is harmful to the fetus so a strict Phe-restricted diet must be re-established preconception, and this is particularly difficult to achieve. A woman’s reproductive years introduces an opportunity to adopt healthier behaviours to prepare for successful pregnancies and positive health outcomes for both themselves and their children. Several factors can influence the health status of women with PKU. Political, socioeconomic, and individual food and lifestyle choices affect diet quality, metabolic control, and epigenetics, which then pre-condition the overall maternal health and long-term health of the child. Here, we reflect on a comprehensive approach to treatment and introduce practical recommendations to optimize the wellbeing of women with PKU and the resultant health of their children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3ablood 3abrain 3achildren 3adiet 3aepigenetics 3afetus 3afood quality 3ahealth status 3alifestyle 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylketonuria 3apolitics 3apregnancy 3awomen1 aPinto, Alex 1 aDaly, Anne 1 aRocha, Julio César,1 aMacdonald, Anita,0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140510213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245004700210300001600257520086900273592002801142650001801170650001301188650001401201650002001215650001401235650001101249650001401260650001701274650001301291650001501304700002101319700002401340700002501364773010101389856008101490990002301571852000901594655001201603IND60094175220221121024449.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009417522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coi.2012.06.0042doi7 aPMC36225512pmcid7 a228189422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurtle, Cameron J10aEngineered T cells for anti-cancer therapy  ap. 633-639.  aRecent advances enabling efficient delivery of transgenes to human T cells have created opportunities to address obstacles that previously hindered the application of T cell therapy to cancer. Modification of T cells with transgenes encoding TCRs or chimeric antigen receptors allows tumor specificity to be conferred on functionally distinct T cell subsets, and incorporation of costimulatory molecules or cytokines can enable engineered T cells to bypass local and systemic tolerance mechanisms. Clinical studies of genetically modified T cell therapy for cancer have shown notable success; however, these trials demonstrate that tumor therapy with engineered high avidity tumor-reactive T cells may be accompanied by significant on-target toxicity, necessitating careful selection of target antigens and development of strategies to eliminate transferred cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3achimerism 3aclinical trials 3acytokines 3ahumans 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atransgenes1 aHudecek, Michael1 aJensen, Michael C.,1 aRiddell, Stanley R.,0 tCurrent Opinion in Immunology.g2012 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.633-639dElsevier Ltdx0952-79157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006900210300001600279520186600295592002802161650002702189650002402216650002102240650001402261650001702275651001802292700002602310700002402336700001902360700002002379773013102399856008302530852000902613655001202622IND60726548620221117012009.0210622e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072654862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-020-02377-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffen, Blaine D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8126-632310aComparing methods for predicting the impacts of invasive species  ap. 491-505.  aWith the accelerating spread of invasive species around the globe, there is an urgent need to predict where invaders are likely to have the largest impacts and what those impacts will be. Predicting the impacts of individual invasive species a priori has proven to be a problematic endeavor, and several possible methods for doing this have been proposed. In this study we use a model system to compare the different predictive methods that have been proposed to determine which provides the most accurate predictions. Community composition in this system was measured at two separate sites in the Gulf of Maine 20 years ago, just before the arrival of the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. We repeated the community assessment at each site and determined the overall impacts of this invader over the last two decades. We then predicted the likely impacts based on the historical community composition using 3 methods: the invasion history of this species at sites further south along the mid-Atlantic, scaling up per capita consumption rates that have been measured on individual species in the recipient community, and using mesocosm experiments that used a range of experimental approaches. We show that the invader has had clear, but moderate impacts on the invaded sites since its arrival. We further show that for this omnivorous consumer, predictions based on invasion history and on long term field mesocosm experiments performed much better than predictions based on scaling up from consumption on individual species or based on short term mesocosm experiments conducted in the lab or field. These results highlight potential biases that can be produced by some mesocosm approaches and by scaling up from per capita consumption on individual prey species measured in isolation to predict consumer impacts under more natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemigrapsus sanguineus 3acommunity structure 3ainvasive species 3aomnivores 3aprey species 3aGulf of Maine1 avan den Akker, Danika1 aDiNuzzo, Eleanor R.1 aAnderson, Lars1 aVernier, Ashley0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.491-505dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02377-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012000170300001400290520163900304592002801943650002201971650001201993650001702005650001102022650001802033650001402051650001202065650001402077650002202091650001502113650000902128650001402137650001602151650001302167650001102180651001102191651001402202651001302216653002202229653002602251653001502277653001302292653001402305653001802319700001802337700001902355773010902374856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60524512420221121015938.0190417e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052451242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2016.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiettinen, Jukka10aLand cover distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 with changes since 1990  ap. 67-78.  aInsular Southeast Asian peatlands have experienced rapid land cover changes over the past decades inducing a variety of environmental effects ranging from regional consequences on peatland ecology, biodiversity and hydrology to globally significant carbon emissions. In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and small-holder dominated areas) cover 50% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3aforests 3ahydrology 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aplantations 3apulpwood 3aswamps 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 0aPeat swamp forest 0aIndustrial plantation 0aKalimantan 0aOil palm 0aPulp wood 0aDeforestation1 aShi, Chenghua1 aLiew, Soo Chin0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2016 Apr., v. 6 p.67-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2016.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245014100212520135800353592002801711650002201739650002101761650001301782650001901795650001501814650001301829650001101842650001901853650001201872650002601884650002301910650001801933650002101951653001801972653002101990653001302011653001602024653002302040653002202063700005902085700002402144773009002168856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60744556520221119170409.0211009e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074455652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1214572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasileiadou, Agapi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7069-398710aBiofuel potential of compost-like output from municipal solid waste: Multiple analyses of its seasonal variation and blends with lignite  aThe biodegradable fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is commonly composted to be used as fertilizer, but it also contains high value products in terms of energy content. The study of compost of MSW as a potential fuel, has rarely been reported in the literature while the study of its seasonal variation, in terms of fuel characteristics, has never been reported. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the compost-like output of MSW as potential fuel for a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) practice. In order to perform a representative evaluation, the seasonal variation of compost was also studied. More specifically, the combustion behavior of compost-like output (CLO) of the four different seasons and the co-combustion of CLOs blends with lignite were examined via several techniques: calorific value determination, thermogravimetric analysis, proximate and ultimate analysis. The emission factors and the empirical chemical formulas were calculated. Kinetics and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The results showed that the CLOs, despite its considerable seasonal variation, can be utilized as a sustainable fuel and is characterized by higher than lignite calorific value, lower ash production, lower sulfur oxide content and carbon dioxide emissions. During co-combustion, lower activation energy was found, suggesting a synergy effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiodegradability 3abiofuels 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acomposts 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3alignite 3amunicipal solid waste 3aseasonal variation 3asulfur oxides 3athermogravimetry 0aCo-combustion 0aEmission factors 0aKinetics 0aMSW Compost 0aThermal techniques 0aWaste utilization1 aZoras, Stamatis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6331-17791 aIordanidis, Andreas0 tEnergy.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 236 p.121457-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1214573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009600165300001600261520115800277592002801435653001601463653001201479653002401491653001501515653001301530700002101543700002201564773011101586856008201697852000901779655001201788IND60126445520221117001608.0151107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012644552DNAL7 a10.1163/193724011X6154062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakui, Keiichi10aPhylogenetic Position of Arctotanais in the Suborder Tanaidomorpha (Peracarida: Tanaidacea)  ap. 127-139.  aLack of an ischium on pereiopods 1–6 was previously considered a synapomorphy for the tanaidacean superfamily Tanaoidea, although descriptions of Arctotanais alascensis (Richardson, 1899), the sole species in Arctotanais, indicated presence or absence of the ischium. To resolve this ambiguity, we examined newly collected specimens of A. alascensis (including males, which had not previously been described) from Hokkaido, Japan, using light and scanning electron microscopy. We also conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene to examine the phylogenetic position of A. alascensis. Here we describe in detail the morphology of the male of A. alascensis, which proved to be similar to that of the females. This species bears an ischium on pereiopods 1–6, which contradicts the current diagnoses of Tanaoidea and Tanaidae, although other synapomorphies remain valid. Molecular phylogenetic analyses strongly supported the placement of A. alascensis in Tanaoidea, and consequently we amended the diagnoses for Tanaoidea and Tanaidae to include either presence or absence of the ischium on the pereiopods.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArctotanais 0aischium 0amolecular phylogeny 0aTanaidacea 0a18S rRNA1 aKobayashi, Norio1 aKajihara, Hiroshi0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2012 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.127-139dThe Crustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163%2F193724011X6154063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012800168300001400296520183400310592002802144650001502172650001802187650001002205650001602215650001702231650002102248650002302269650002002292650001902312650002902331650002602360650002202386700002402408700002302432700002302455773009602478856008302574852000902657655001202666IND60082647520221119222623.0141101e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008264752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Indu. S.14aThe zinc finger transcription factor Jing is required for dendrite/axonal targeting in Drosophila antennal lobe development  ap. 17-27.  aAn important role in olfactory system development is played by transcription factors which act in sensory neurons or in their interneuron targets as cell autonomous regulators of downstream effectors such as cell surface molecules and signalling systems that control neuronal identity and process guidance. Some of these transcriptional regulators have been characterized in detail in the development of the neural elements that innervate the antennal lobe in the olfactory system of Drosophila. Here we identify the zinc finger transcription factor Jing as a cell autonomously acting transcriptional regulator that is required both for dendrite targeting of projection neurons and local interneurons as well as for axonal targeting of olfactory sensory neurons in Drosophila olfactory system development. Immunocytochemical analysis shows that Jing is widely expressed in the neural cells during postembryonic development. MARCM-based clonal analysis of projection neuron and local interneuron lineages reveals a requirement for Jing in dendrite targeting; Jing loss-of-function results in loss of innervation in specific glomeruli, ectopic innervation of inappropriate glomeruli, aberrant profuse dendrite arborisation throughout the antennal lobe, as well as mistargeting to other parts of the CNS. ey-FLP-based MARCM analysis of olfactory sensory neurons reveals an additional requirement for Jing in axonal targeting; mutational inactivation of Jing causes specific mistargeting of some olfactory sensory neuron axons to the DA1 glomerulus, reduction of targeting to other glomeruli, as well as aberrant stalling of axons in the antennal lobe. Taken together, these findings indicate that Jing acts as a key transcriptional control element in wiring of the circuitry in the developing olfactory sensory system in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aantennal lobe 3aaxons 3ainnervation 3ainterneurons 3aneurodevelopment 3asensory evaluation 3asensory neurons 3asensory system 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aRodrigues, Veronica1 aReichert, Heinrich1 aVijayraghavan, K.,0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 381, no. 1 p.17-27dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245012500167520111000292592002801402650001801430650001301448650002001461650001901481650001401500650001401514650000901528650001401537700001701551700002101568700002401589700002801613700002501641773012201666856007501788852000901863655001201872IND60769780720221120233305.0220310e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978072DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140509252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoumeliotis, Stefanos 10aVitamin K Supplementation for Prevention of Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: Are We There Yet?  aChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients are at high risk of presenting with arterial calcification or stiffness, which confers increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In recent years, it has become evident that VC is an active process regulated by various molecules that may act as inhibitors of vessel mineralization. Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), one the most powerful naturally occurring inhibitors of arterial calcification, requires vitamin K as a co-factor in order to undergo post-translational γ-carboxylation and phosphrorylation and become biologically active. The inactive form of MGP (dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated dp-ucMGP) reflects vitamin K deficiency and has been repeatedly associated with surrogate markers of VC, stiffness, and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD populations. As CKD is a state of progressive vitamin K depletion and VC, research has focused on clinical trials aiming to investigate the possible beneficial effects of vitamin K in CKD and dialysis patients. In this study, we aim to review the current evidence regarding vitamin K supplementation in uremic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcification 3adialysis 3akidney diseases 3amineralization 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arisk 3avitamin K1 aDuni, Anila 1 aVaios, Vasilios 1 aKitsos, Athanasios 1 aLiakopoulos, Vassilios 1 aDounousi, Evangelia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140509253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245009600187300001600283520143100299592002801730650001401758650001101772650001201783650005201795650001201847650003101859651001201890651001201902651001201914651001201926700002001938700002201958700002001980773009502000856008102095852000902176655001202185IND50090133220221118043124.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009013322DNAL7 a248590202pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-014-1183-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Michael J.12aA new chasmosaurine from northern Laramidia expands frill disparity in ceratopsid dinosaurs  ap. 505-512.  aA new taxon of chasmosaurine ceratopsid demonstrates unexpected disparity in parietosquamosal frill shape among ceratopsid dinosaurs early in their evolutionary radiation. The new taxon is described based on two apomorphic squamosals collected from approximately time equivalent (approximately 77 million years old) sections of the upper Judith River Formation, Montana, and the lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta. It is referred to Chasmosaurinae based on the inferred elongate morphology. The typical chasmosaurine squamosal forms an obtuse triangle in dorsal view that tapers towards the posterolateral corner of the frill. In the dorsal view of the new taxon, the lateral margin of the squamosal is hatchet-shaped with the posterior portion modified into a constricted narrow bar that would have supported the lateral margin of a robust parietal. The new taxon represents the oldest chasmosaurine from Canada, and the first pre-Maastrichtian ceratopsid to have been collected on both sides of the Canada–US border, with a minimum north–south range of 380 km. This squamosal morphology would have given the frill of the new taxon a unique dorsal profile that represents evolutionary experimentation in frill signalling near the origin of chasmosaurine ceratopsids and reinforces biogeographic differences between northern and southern faunal provinces in the Campanian of North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3arivers 2aAnimals 2aDinosaursxanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aFossils 2aSkullxanatomy & histology 3aAlberta 3aMontana 0aAlberta 0aMontana1 aEvans, David C.1 aCurrie, Philip J.1 aLoewen, Mark A.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2014 June, v. 101, no. 6 p.505-512dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-014-1183-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245011100167520150000278592002801778650002001806650002401826650001001850650002901860650001201889650001101901700002301912700002401935700002401959700002301983700002102006700001902027700002702046700002102073700002202094773012202116856007502238852000902313655001202322IND60769780820221120233318.0220310e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978082DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140510242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBélanger, Véronique 10aEarly Nutritional Intervention to Promote Healthy Eating Habits in Pediatric Oncology: A Feasibility Study  aThis study aims to describe the feasibility of a nutritional intervention that promotes healthy eating habits early after cancer pediatric diagnosis in patients and their parents. Participants were recruited 4 to 12 weeks after cancer diagnosis as part of the VIE study. The one-year nutritional intervention included an initial evaluation and 6 follow-up visits every 2 months with a registered dietician. The feasibility assessment included rates of retention, participation, attendance, completion of study measures, and participants’ engagement. A preliminary evaluation of the intervention's impact on the participants’ dietary intakes was conducted. A total of 62 participants were included in the study (51.6% male, mean age = 8.5 years, mean time since diagnosis = 13.2 weeks). The retention and attendance rates were 72.6% and 71.3%, respectively. Attendance to follow-up visits declined over time, from 83.9% to 48.9%. A majority of participants had high participation (50.8%) and high engagement (56.4%). Measures of body-mass-index or weight-for-length ratio and dietary 24-h recalls were the procedures with the highest completion rates. Participants with refractory disease or relapse were less likely to complete the intervention. Post-intervention, participants (n = 21) had a lower sodium intake compared to the initial evaluation. These results suggest that a nutritional intervention that involves patients and parents early after a pediatric cancer diagnosis is feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3afeasibility studies 3amales 3anutritional intervention 3arelapse 3asodium1 aDelorme, Josianne 1 aNapartuk, Mélanie 1 aBouchard, Isabelle 1 aMeloche, Caroline 1 aCurnier, Daniel 1 aSultan, Serge 1 aLaverdière, Caroline 1 aSinnett, Daniel 1 aMarcil, Valérie 0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140510243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014000198300001800338500001900356500001100375520195100386592002802337596001202365596003702377650001502414650002102429650001102450650001402461650002902475650001802504650000902522650001302531650002402544651001102568651001802579700002202597700006602619773010902685856007302794852000902867655001202876IND60712162020221122002243.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071216202DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.128652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlaza, Pablo I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6226-272510aImplications of bacterial, viral and mycotic microorganisms in vultures for wildlife conservation, ecosystem services and public health  ap. 1109-1124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe effects that microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi) have on their hosts remain unexplored for most vulture species. This is especially relevant for vultures, as their diet consists of carcasses in various stages of decomposition, which are breeding grounds for potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Here we review current knowledge of bacterial, viral and mycotic microorganisms present in wild vultures. We consider their potential to cause disease in vultures and whether this poses any population‐level threats. Furthermore, we address the question of whether vultures may act as disease spreaders or mitigators. We found 76 articles concerning bacterial, viral and mycotic microorganisms present in 13 vulture species, 57 evaluating bacteria, 13 evaluating viruses and six evaluating mycotic microorganisms. These studies come from all continents where vultures are present, but mainly from Europe and North America, and the most studied species was the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus. We found that vultures are colonized by zoonotic pathogens, and even host‐specific human pathogens. Some recorded bacteria showed multi‐antibiotic resistance, especially those that can be associated with anthropogenic food subsides such as supplementary feeding stations. We found evidence that vulture health can be affected by some microorganisms, producing a wide array of clinical alterations that have the potential to influence mortality risk and fitness. We did not find clear scientific evidence that vultures play an epidemiological role spreading microorganisms to humans and other species. However, there is evidence that vultures could prevent the spread of infectious diseases through their removal of decomposing organic material. The evaluation of vulture exposure to microorganisms is of fundamental importance to design better conservation policies for this threatened group, which may serve a key role as ecosystem cleaners.  aPublisher supplied data  cCONICET  cUniversidad Nacional del Comahue 3aecosystems 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3amortality 3amultiple drug resistance 3apublic health 3arisk 3avultures 3awildlife management 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aBlanco, Guillermo1 aLambertucci, Sergio A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2624-21850 tIbis.g2020 Oct., v. 162, no. 4 p.1109-1124dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.128653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245018600161520255900347592002802906653006802934653000803002653001103010653000903021653001103030700001703041700001803058700001503076700001503091700001803106700001303124773011603137856008203253852000903335655001203344IND60683628820221121013404.0200330e20200424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068362882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1126372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Diao10aAstragalus propinquus Schischkin and Panax notoginseng (A&P) compound relieved cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting the mincle maintained macrophage inflammation  aAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common disease in hospitalized patients, especially in critically ill patients. It is characterised with high morbidity and mortality, and is also an important cause of chronic kidney disease and chronic renal failure. Astragalus propinquus Schischkin and Panax notoginseng (A&P) compound, a famous traditional Chinese medicine, consists of Astragalus propinquus Schischkin, Panax notoginseng, Angelica sinensis, Achyranthes bidentata, and Ecklonia kurome, has been widely used for the treatment of various kidney diseases in the southwest of China. However, the effects of A&P on treatment of AKI and its underlying mechanism are needed to be uncovered.Recent researches reported that Mincle (Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin) plays a key role in renal injury of AKI by regulating the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines on macrophage through modulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we aimed to investigate the renoprotective effect of A&P on AKI and whether by inhibiting Mincle.We established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophage (BMDM) inflammatory cell model and a cisplatin-induced mouse AKI model in vitro and in vivo. Renal histopathology staining was performed to observe kidney morphology. The expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were detected by real-time PCR and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels and Flow cytometry performed to detect polarization of macrophage.The results showed that A&P significantly reduced the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated BMDM cells, and secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 in supernatant. The same results were found in Cisplatin-induced AKI kidney and serum after treatment with A&P. The data also showed that A&P strongly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Mincle in vitro and vivo, and also inhibited the activation of Syk and NF-κB. Notably, A&P down-regulated the M1 macrophage marker iNOS, which may relate to the inhibition of Mincle. Interestingly, both overexpression of Mincle by transfection of pcDNA3.1-Mincle plasmid and administration of TDB (a ligand of Mincle) can significantly abolished the A&P-inhibited inflammation in BMDM, suggesting Mincle pathway play a key role in macrophage inflammation in AKI.Our findings indicated that A&P protected kidney from inhibiting inflammation through down-regulating of Mincle pathway in macrophage in AKI. It provides a potential medicine compound for the treatment of AKI.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAstragalus propinquus schischkin and panax notoginseng compound 0aAKI 0aMincle 0aBMDM 0aNF-κB1 aRui-Zhi, Tan1 aJian-Chun, Li1 aXia, Zhong1 aWinn, Dan,1 aJun-Ming, Fan1 aLi, Wang0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Apr. 24, v. 252 p.112637-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1126373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011300174300001600287520149500303592002801798650001601826650001601842650002201858650002501880650001001905650002001915650001501935650001001950650002101960650001301981700001801994700002602012700002302038700002202061700002202083773009802105856008302203852000902286655001202295IND60082647720221119222601.0141101e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008264772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothschild, Sarah C.10aCaMK-II activation is essential for zebrafish inner ear development and acts through Delta–Notch signaling  ap. 179-188.  aZebrafish inner ear development is characterized by the crystallization of otoliths onto immotile kinocilia that protrude from sensory “hair” cells. The stereotypical formation of these sensory structures is dependent on the expression of key patterning genes and on Ca²⁺ signals. One potential target of Ca²⁺ signaling in the inner ear is the type II Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK-II), which is preferentially activated in hair cells, with intense activation at the base of kinocilia. In zebrafish, CaMK-II is encoded by seven genes; the expression of one of these genes (camk2g1) is enriched in hair cells. The suppression of camk2g1 expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides or inhibition of CaMK-II activation by the pharmacological antagonist, KN-93, results in aberrant otolith formation without preventing cilia formation. In fact, CaMK-II suppression results in additional ciliated hair cells and altered levels of Delta–Notch signaling members. DeltaA and deltaD transcripts are increased and DeltaD protein accumulates in hair cells of CaMK-II morphants, indicative of defective recycling and/or exocytosis. Our findings indicate that CaMK-II plays a critical role in the developing ear, influencing cell differentiation through extranuclear effects on Delta–Notch signaling. Continued expression and activation of CaMK-II in maculae and cristae in older embryos suggests continued roles in auditory sensory maturation and transduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantagonists 3acalcium signaling 3acell differentiation 3acilia 3acrystallization 3aexocytosis 3agenes 3aoligonucleotides 3aotoliths1 aLahvic, Jamie1 aFrancescatto, Ludmila1 aMcLeod, Jamie J.A.1 aBurgess, Shawn M.1 aTombes, Robert M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 381, no. 1 p.179-188dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011600168520124400284592002801528650001501556650001101571650002401582650001701606650001501623650002401638650000901662650001501671650001801686653002501704653003401729653001901763653002501782700002001807773009001827856008501917852000902002655001202011IND60744557120221119170420.0211009e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074455712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1214762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrović, A.10aGenetic algorithm based optimized model for the selection of wind turbine for any site-specific wind conditions  aThe paper presents a practical mathematical model for determining the optimal wind turbine (WT) design based on the known wind statistics at WT location and wind shear exponent. The basic WT optimization parameters are hub height (HH), WT rotor diameter (RD) and WT rated power (RP). The proposed model varies WT parameters and calculates the total actualized WT costs as well as the annual energy production (AEP). The optimal values of WT parameters are those at which the minimum levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is achieved. Firstly, the LCOE model is built up and WT optimization problem is defined. Then, genetic algorithm is presented and improved. A quantitative assessment of the drop in LCOE, had the unoptimized WT been used is done. Lastly, the practical applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated on real examples of WTs installed at locations with different wind conditions. It is indicated that by optimization of WT parameters, LCOE can be reduced effectively. The developed algorithm and mathematical model have a general character and can be used to optimize utilization of wind potential at a particular location and also provide maximization of the profit generated by the wind power plant within its life-span.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3apower plants 3astatistics 3asystem optimization 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aOnshore wind turbine 0aLevelized cost of electricity 0aOptimal design 0aSensitivity analysis1 aĐurišić, Ž.0 tEnergy.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 236 p.121476-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1214763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245018200205300001800387520206500405592002802470650001502498650001602513650001002529650001002539650001102549650002102560650002602581650002902607650001502636650001202651650001302663650001502676650000902691650001802700650002902718650001202747700005302759700002302812700001702835700001802852700002102870700001802891773012802909856008403037852000903121655001203130IND60630063820221121165317.0190206e20190107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063006382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Huidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1643-784310aIn-Sample Calibration Curve Using Multiple Isotopologue Reaction Monitoring of a Stable Isotopically Labeled Analyte for Instant LC-MS/MS Bioanalysis and Quantitative Proteomics  ap. 2536-2543.  aA novel methodology of in-sample calibration curves (ISCC) using multiple isotopologue reaction monitoring (MIRM) of multiple naturally occurring isotopologue transitions of a stable isotopically labeled (SIL) analyte for instant liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalysis of biomarkers, biotherapeutics, and small-molecule compounds is proposed and demonstrated for the first time. The theoretical isotopic abundances of the SIL analyte in its MIRM channels can be accurately calculated based on the isotopic distributions of its daughter ion and neutral loss. The isotopic abundances in these MIRM channels can also be accurately measured with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. By spiking a known amount of a SIL analyte into each study sample, an ISCC can be established based on the relationship between the calculated theoretical isotopic abundances (analyte concentration equivalents) in the selected MIRM channels of the SIL analyte and the measured MS/MS peak areas in the corresponding MIRM channels in each individual study sample. The analyte concentration of each study sample can then be calculated individually with the ISCC instantly without using an external calibration curve. The MIRM–ISCC–LC-MS/MS methodology was evaluated and demonstrated in this work with the examples of quantitation of a protein biomarker in human and monkey serum processed with immunocapture and trypsin digestion; three surrogate peptides in trypsin-digested human colon tissue homogenates; and a small-molecule drug in human and rat plasma extracted with liquid–liquid extraction. The potential applications of the MIRM–ISCC–LC-MS/MS methodology in quantitative proteomics, clinical laboratories, and other areas are also discussed in this paper. Without the need for using external calibration curves, this novel MIRM–ISCC–LC-MS/MS methodology can provide accurate and reliable bioanalysis in many potential applications, especially for cases where authentic matrices for external calibration curves are not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acolon 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3amonkeys 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3arats 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atrypsin1 aZhao, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0814-01341 aDeMichele, Marissa1 aZheng, Naiyu1 aZhang, Yan J.1 aPillutla, Renuka1 aZeng, Jianing0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 07, v. 91, no. 3 p.2536-2543dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013300165300001600298520097600314592002801290650001901318650001101337650002601348700001901374700002001393700001801413773009501431856008101526990002301607852000901630655001201639IND60096351720221121181813.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Bong-Kee12aA simple fabrication and integration technique of microlens for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip by overflow of UV resin through holes  ap. 909-913.  aIn the present study, a simple fabrication technique for microlens or microlens array is proposed based on an overflow of a UV curable resin through micro-holes followed by photopolymerization of the resin. As a first step of the present technique, a micro-hole is precisely drilled on a flat plastic sheet. A UV curable resin is carefully spread over another plastic sheet, and then an overflow process is carried out by compressing the spread resin with the holed sheet. The overflowed resin through the hole is then cured by irradiation with UV light and consequently, the microlens is formed from the overflowed resin on the holed sheet. By utilizing the present fabrication technique, microlenses of 600 and 750 μm in diameter were successfully manufactured. The fabricated microlens was also characterized by measuring its detailed dimensions and focal length. The microlens of 750 μm in diameter showed a smooth convex surface and the focal length of 2.11 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolymerization 3aresins 3aultraviolet radiation1 aPark, Jang Min1 aKim, Dong-sung,1 aKwon, Tai Hun0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.909-913dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005800188245004100246300001600287506007600303520106300379592002801442506003701470650001601507650001201523650001901535650000901554650001401563650001401577650001401591650001101605650002001616650002401636650001301660650001701673700002101690700002201711700001601733700002001749700002201769700002001791700002001811700002101831700002501852773010301877856008101980852000902061655001202070IND60627836820221207134625.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062783682DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1060-92doi7 aPMC63465992pmcid7 a298455762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillen, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3705-225310aGlobal seafood consumption footprint  ap. 111-122.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo ensure food security and nutritional quality for a growing world population in the face of climate change, stagnant capture fisheries production, increasing aquaculture production and competition for natural resources, countries must be accountable for what they consume rather than what they produce. To investigate the sustainability of seafood consumption, we propose a methodology to examine the impact of seafood supply chains across national boundaries: the seafood consumption footprint. The seafood consumption footprint is expressed as the biomass of domestic and imported seafood production required to satisfy national seafood consumption, and is estimated using a multi-regional input output model. Thus, we reconstruct for the first time the global fish biomass flows in national supply chains to estimate consumption footprints at the global, country and sector levels (capture fisheries, aquaculture, distribution and processing, and reduction into fishmeal and fish oil) taking into account the biomass supply from beyond national borders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3afish 3afish meal 3afish oils 3afisheries 3amodels 3anutritive value 3aseafood consumption 3aseafoods 3asupply chain1 aNatale, Fabrizio1 aCarvalho, Natacha1 aCasey, John1 aHofherr, Johann1 aDruon, Jean-Noël1 aFiore, Gianluca1 aGibin, Maurizio1 aZanzi, Antonella1 aMartinsohn, Jann Th.0 tAmbio.g2019 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.111-122dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1060-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245009000208300001800298520120300316592002801519650001201547650002501559650001001584650001301594650002201607700006001629700001901689700001701708700001801725700002001743700001901763700002001782700006001802700001801862773012901880856008402009852000902093655001202102IND60744418620221120105613.0210713e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074441862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c054032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuriya, Mutsuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5689-822210aAlkyne-Tagged Dopamines as Versatile Analogue Probes for Dopaminergic System Analysis  ap. 9345-9355.  aThe dopaminergic system is essential for the function of the brain in health and disease. Therefore, detailed studies focused on unraveling the mechanisms involved in dopaminergic signaling are required. However, the lack of probes that mimic dopamine in living tissues, owing to the neurotransmitter’s small size, has hampered analysis of the dopaminergic system. The current study aimed to overcome this limitation by developing alkyne-tagged dopamine compounds (ATDAs) that have a minimally invasive and uniquely identifiable alkyne group as a tag. ATDAs were established as chemically and functionally similar to dopamine and readily detectable by methods such as specific click chemistry and Raman scattering. The ATDAs developed here were verified as analogue probes that mimic dopamine in neurons and brain tissues, allowing the detailed characterization of dopamine dynamics. Therefore, ATDAs can act as safe and versatile tools with wide applicability in detailed studies of the dopaminergic system. Furthermore, our results suggest that the alkyne-tagging approach can also be applied to other small-sized neurotransmitters to facilitate characterization of their dynamics in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aanalytical chemistry 3abrain 3adopamine 3aneurotransmitters1 aAshikari, Yosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7145-61421 aIino, Takanori1 aAsai, Takuya1 aShou, Jingwen1 aKarasawa, Keiko1 aNakamura, Kaho1 aOzeki, Yasuyuki1 aFujimoto, Yukari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5320-31921 aYasui, Masato0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 01, v. 93, no. 27 p.9345-9355dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c054033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002000168245017100188300001600359520159000375592002801965650002401993650002002017650002002037650000902057650000902066650001902075650000902094650000902103650001502112650001302127650001102140650001402151650001202165650000902177650003402186650002502220650001902245650001702264650002102281650001202302650003502314650006302349650005502412650002902467650001102496650002102507650000902528650006402537650005202601650001402653650004102667650000902708700001902717700002002736700002102756700002102777773009402798856008502892852000902977655001202986IND4459073720221119215924.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445907372DNAL7 a216583592pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrrego, Rodrigo10aComparative embryotoxicity of pulp mill extracts in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), American flagfish (Jordanella floridae) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)  ap. 299-307.  aThis study evaluated the effects of Chilean pulp mill effluent extracts (untreated, primary and secondary treated pulp mill effluents), along with steroid standards (testosterone and 17β-estradiol) and a wood extractive standard (beta-sitosterol) on developing post-fertilized fish embryos. Our study included a cold freshwater species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and two warm freshwater species American flagfish (Jordanella floridae) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Embryotoxicity results included delay in time to hatch and decreased hatchability but no significant egg and larvae mortality was observed in the pulp mill extract exposed embryos. By contrast, significant early hatching and increased hatchability were observed in beta-sitosterol exposed embryos, along with high mortality of testosterone exposed embryos across species. Teratogenic responses were observed in medaka embryos in all treatments. Abnormalities were detected starting at development stages 19–20 (2–4 somite stages) and included optical deformities (micro-opthalmia, 1 or 2 eyes) and lack of development of brains and hearts. Additionally, phenotypic sex identification of surviving offspring found female-biased sex-ratios in all treatments except testosterone across species. Overall, our study indicated that Chilean pulp and paper mill extractives caused embryotoxicity (post-fertilized embryos) across species and irrespective of the effluent treatment. The effects were mainly associated with delayed time to hatch, decreased hatchability, and species-specific teratogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOryzias latipes 3abeta-sitosterol 3acold 3aeggs 3aembryotoxicity 3aeyes 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahatching 3alarvae 3amortality 3aprogeny 3apulp 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3apulp and paper mills 3ateratogenicity 3atestosterone 3awood extractives 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCyprinodontiformesxabnormalitiesxembryologyxphysiology. 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxabnormalitiesxdrug effects. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMale 2aOncorhynchus mykissxabnormalitiesxembryologyxphysiology. 2aOryziasxabnormalitiesxembryologyxphysiology. 2aSex Ratio 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aWood1 aGuchardi, John1 aBeyger, Lindsay1 aKrause, Rachelle1 aHoldway, Douglas0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Aug., v. 104, no. 3-4 p.299-307dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008300165300001600248520128100264592002801545650002201573650001101595650002201606650000901628650000901637650001701646650001601663650002301679650003701702700001701739700001601756773009501772856008101867990002301948852000901971655001201980IND60096351920221121020448.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Geeta10aThermoluminescence characteristics of CaS doped with rare earth ions Ce and Sm  ap. 921-925.  aCaS:Ce, Sm nanophosphors have been synthesized using solid state diffusion method with an aim to study the thermoluminescence characteristics of CaS:Ce,Sm system with varying concentrations of cerium and smarium in CaS host. The structural characterization of nanophosphors was done using XRD and TEM spectroscopy. We have investigated the effect of different concentrations of cerium and smarium in CaS host on the TL intensity. TL intensity is found to be maximum for CaS:Ce₀.₄Sm₀.₆. The effect of different heating rates on the TL glow curves recorded after a UV exposure of 560 mJ/cm² has been investigated. Peak of the TL glow curve shifts toward higher temperature as the heating rate increases and the TL intensity decreases. Effect of different doses of UV on the TL glow curve of CaS:Ce₀.₄Sm₀.₆ at a heating rate of 10 K/s has been studied and all the glow curves show a single peak around 440 K. With increasing dose the TL intensity increases linearly upto 560 mJ/cm² of the dose and afterward saturation region is obtained upto 13.5 J/cm². Beyond it a fall is recorded upto 80 J/cm² of the exposure. Analysis of the TL glow curve and calculation of the trapping parameters has been done with the help of Glow curve deconvolution software.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acerium 3acomputer software 3aheat 3aions 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3athermoluminescence 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLochab, S.P.1 aSingh, Nafa0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.921-925dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245015400212300001400366506007600380520150000456592002801956506003701984650001802021650002102039650002302060650002002083650001502103650001102118650000902129650002502138650001902163650001402182650000902196650002202205700002602227700002602253773010702279856008202386852000902468655001202477IND60590893320221207130724.0210707e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059089332DNAL7 a293568972pmid7 aPMC58516992pmcid7 a10.1007/s00335-017-9732-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVellers, Heather L.10aInter-individual variation in adaptations to endurance and resistance exercise training: genetic approaches towards understanding a complex phenotype  ap. 48-62.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExercise training which meets the recommendations set by the National Physical Activity Guidelines ensues a multitude of health benefits towards the prevention and treatment of various chronic diseases. However, not all individuals respond well to exercise training. That is, some individuals have no response, while others respond poorly. Genetic background is known to contribute to the inter-individual (human) and -strain (e.g., mice, rats) variation with acute exercise and exercise training, though to date, no specific genetic factors have been identified that explain the differential responses to exercise. In this review, we provide an overview of studies in human and animal models that have shown a significant contribution of genetics in acute exercise and exercise training-induced adaptations with standardized endurance and resistance training regimens, and further describe the genetic approaches which have been used to demonstrate such responses. Finally, our current understanding of the role of genetics and exercise is limited primarily to the nuclear genome, while only a limited focus has been given to a potential role of the mitochondrial genome and its interactions with the nuclear genome to predict the exercise training-induced phenotype(s) responses. We therefore discuss the mitochondrial genome and literature that suggests it may play a significant role, particularly through interactions with the nuclear genome, in the inherent ability to respond to exercise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3achronic diseases 3agenetic background 3agenetic factors 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amice 3amitochondrial genome 3anuclear genome 3aphenotype 3arats 3astrength training1 aKleeberger, Steven R.1 aLightfoot, J.

However, alternative and powerful techniques have appeared in recent years that complement the information extracted from a tissue section. One of the most promising techniques is imaging mass spectrometry applied to lipidomics. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of this technique to highlight the architectural features of the human kidney at a spatial resolution of 10 μm. Our data demonstrate that up to seven different segments of the nephron and the interstitial tissue can be readily identified in the sections according to their characteristic lipid fingerprints and that such fingerprints are maintained among different individuals (n = 32). These results set the foundation for further studies on the metabolic bases of the diseases affecting the human kidney.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ahistology 3ahumans 3akidneys 3alipidomics 3alipids 3amass spectrometry1 aMosteiro, Lorena1 aSolano-Iturri, Jon D.1 aRueda, Yuri1 aMartín-Allende, Javier1 aImaz, Igone1 aOlano, Iván1 aOchoa, Begoña1 aFresnedo, Olatz1 aFernández, José A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7315-23261 aLarrinaga, Gorka0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 June 30, v. 93, no. 27 p.9364-9372dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c006493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011000166300001600276520138200292592002801674650001901702650002201721650000901743650002201752650001101774650001201785650001601797650000901813650002101822650001101843651001001854651001801864700001801882700002301900773007801923856008302001852000902084655001202093IND60096893020221118013543.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009689302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiren,10aChina's coal price disturbances: Observations, explanations, and implications for global energy economies  ap. 720-727.  aSince China decontrolled coal prices, its coal price has risen steadily and been unusually volatile. In 2011 in particular, high coal prices and capped electricity prices in China discouraged coal-fired power generation, triggering widespread power shortages. We suggest that these coal-price disturbances could be symptomatic of a major change in pricing dynamics of global fossil-fuel markets, with increasing correspondence between coal and oil prices globally. Historically, global coal prices have been more stable and lower than oil and natural gas prices on a per-heat basis. In recent years, however, coal prices have been increasingly volatile worldwide and have tracked other fossil fuel prices more closely. Meanwhile, the recent development of unconventional gas has substantially decoupled US natural gas and oil prices. Technically, low US natural gas prices, with potential fuel switching, could drive US domestic coal prices lower. However, this effect is unlikely to counteract the overall trend in increasing coal consumption globally. China's market size and unique, partially-controlled energy system make its reform agenda a key force in the global economy. Policymakers in the US, E.U. and elsewhere should monitor China's economic reform agenda to anticipate and respond to changes accompanying China's increasing importance in the global energy economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aalternative fuels 3acoal 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apower generation 3aprices 3aChina 3aUnited States1 aXuan, Xiaowei1 aJackson, Robert B.0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Dec., v. 51 p.720-727dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245007000244300001600314506007600330520112900406592002801535506003701563650002201600650001801622650001201640773010301652856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60627837020221207122519.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062783702DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1065-42doi7 aPMC63466022pmcid7 a299490782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJepson, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-998110aRecoverable Earth: a twenty-first century environmental narrative  ap. 123-130.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRewilding may signify the emergence of a new environmental narrative. Discussion of underlying policy narratives is important because they shape understandings of the state of world and how society should act. I summarise the origins of twentieth century environmental narratives and argue that their influence derives from components telling of the dire state of nature, the catastrophic consequences of this and the need for competent authorities to act to govern the perpetrators of harm. Reflecting on my engagements with rewilding science and practice, I posit that stories of rewilding are adopting a quite different narrative structure: one that involves components telling of feelings of despondency and processes of awakening, action, and reassessment leading to the recovery of natural and social well-being. These components align with the narrative structure of accounts of mental health. I label this emerging narrative ‘Recoverable Earth’ and suggest that it signifies action by grassroot conservationists to reassert their ability to lead change locally and produce better outcomes for nature and society.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aissues and policy 3amental health 3asociety0 tAmbio.g2019 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.123-130dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1065-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245010300212300001600315506007600331520109600407592002801503506003701531650001801568650002001586650002401606650001501630650001301645650001801658650001201676650000901688650002201697653001501719653002501734653002101759653002101780653001301801653002901814653001501843653001801858700002301876773012101899856008502020852000902105655001202114IND60519032420221207061937.0160420e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903242DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2016.11427482doi7 aPMC48666142pmcid7 a270151392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Ellen T.10aSystematic review and meta-analysis of glyphosate exposure and risk of lymphohematopoietic cancers  ap. 402-434.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis systematic review and meta-analysis rigorously examines the relationship between glyphosate exposure and risk of lymphohematopoietic cancer (LHC) including NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), and leukemia. Meta-relative risks (meta-RRs) were positive and marginally statistically significant for the association between any versus no use of glyphosate and risk of NHL (meta-RR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0–1.6, based on six studies) and MM (meta-RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0–1.9; four studies). Associations were statistically null for HL (meta-RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.7–1.6; two studies), leukemia (meta-RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6–1.5; three studies), and NHL subtypes except B-cell lymphoma (two studies each). Bias and confounding may account for observed associations. Meta-analysis is constrained by few studies and a crude exposure metric, while the overall body of literature is methodologically limited and findings are not strong or consistent. Thus, a causal relationship has not been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of LHC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aHodgkin disease 3aconfidence interval 3aglyphosate 3aleukemia 3ameta-analysis 3amyeloma 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aGlyphosate 0anon-Hodgkin lymphoma 0aHodgkin lymphoma 0amultiple myeloma 0aleukemia 0ahematologic malignancies 0aherbicides 0ameta-analysis1 aDelzell, Elizabeth0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 June 2, v. 51, no. 6 p.402-434dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2016.11427483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013600159300002000295520149000315592002801805650001701833650001301850650001001863650001101873650001901884650001901903650001201922650002301934650002101957700001601978700001401994700001402008700001902022700001502041700001702056773012402073856007402197852000902271655001202280IND60679388420221122220532.0191228e20191218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067938842DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra08968c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmood, Awais10aUnidirectional transport of water nanodroplets entrapped inside a nonparallel smooth surface: a molecular dynamics simulation study  ap. 41984-41992.  aThe unidirectional transport of liquid nanodroplets is an important topic of research in the field of drug delivery, labs on chips, micro/nanofluidics, and water collection. Inspired by nature a nonparallel surface (NPS) is modelled in this study for pumpless water transport applications. The dynamics of water transport is analyzed with the aid of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. There were five different types of NPSs namely A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 utilized in this study, with separation angles equal to 5°, 7°, 9°, 11°, and 13° respectively. The water droplet was placed at the beginning of the open end of the NPS and it moved spontaneously towards the cusp of the surface in all cases except for the 13° NPS. The size of the water droplet, too, was altered and four different sizes of water droplets (3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 molecules) were utilized in this study. Furthermore, the surface energy parameter of the NPS was also changed and four different values, i.e. 7.5 eV, 17.5 eV, 27.56 eV, 37.5 eV were assigned to the surface in order to represent a surface with hydrophobic to hydrophilic characteristics. In addition the importance of water bridge formation for its spontaneous propulsion with the influence of surface energy and droplet size is also discussed in this study. Moreover, a unique design is modelled for the practical application of water harvesting and a large size water droplet is formed by combining two water droplets placed inside a NPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aenergy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3awater harvesting1 aChen, Shuai1 aChen, Lei1 aLiu, Dong1 aChen, Chaolang1 aWeng, Ding1 aWang, Jiadao0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 9, no. 72 p.41984-41992dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra08968c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245015600162300002000318500001900338520167900357592002802036650001802064650001502082650001302097650002002110650001302130650002102143650001502164650001602179650000902195650001302204650001302217650000702230650001502237650001802252650002102270650003702291650001402328650001602342700002502358700002802383773012402411856007402535852000902609655001202618IND60679388520221122220741.0191228e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067938852DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09046k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervini, Priscila10aDeveloping a screen-printed graphite–polyurethane composite electrode modified with gold nanoparticles for the voltammetric determination of dopamine  ap. 42306-42315.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA screen-printed electrode (SPGPUE) was prepared with graphite–polyurethane composite ink containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), resulting in a screen-printed graphite–polyurethane composite electrode modified with gold nanoparticles (SPGPUE–AuNPs). Gold nanoparticles were prepared by the citrate method and extracted from the water medium since polyurethane is not compatible with humidity. After extraction to chloroform, they were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The presence of gold on the SPGPUE–AuNP surface was confirmed via SEM and EDX analyses, while thermogravimetry revealed the presence of approximately 3.0% (m/m) gold in the composite. An electrochemical pretreatment in 0.10 mol L⁻¹ phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with successive cycling between −1.0 V and 1.0 V (vs. pseudo-Ag/AgCl) under a scan rate of 200 mV s⁻¹ and 150 cycles was required in order to provide a suitable electrochemical response for the voltammetric determination of dopamine. After the optimization of the parameters of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), an analytical curve was obtained within a linear dynamic range of 0.40–60.0 μmol L⁻¹ and detection limit (LOD) of 1.55 ×10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹ for dopamine at the SPGPUE–AuNP. A non-modified SPGPUE was used for comparison and a linear range was obtained between 2.0 and 10 μmol L⁻¹ with an LOD of 2.94 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹. During the dopamine determination in cerebrospinal synthetic fluid (CSF), recoveries between 89.3 and 103% were achieved. There were no significant interferences from ascorbic acid and uric acid, but some from epinephrine due to the structural similarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3achloroform 3acitrates 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aepinephrine 3agold 3ahumidity 3ananogold 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolyurethanes 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auric acid 3avoltammetry1 aMattioli, Isabela A.1 aCavalheiro, Éder T.

This study aimed to clarify the combined aortic NO-mediated effects of chronic Chlorella intake and aerobic exercise training on endothelial vasorelaxation in aged mice. In this study, 38-week-old male senescence-accelerated mouse prone 1 (SAMP1) mice were divided into aged sedentary control (Con), aerobic exercise training (AT; voluntary wheel running for 12 weeks), Chlorella intake (CH; 0.5% Chlorella powder in normal diet), and AT and CH combined (AT+CH) groups. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by addition of acetylcholine to the isolated mouse aortic rings was significantly higher in the AT, CH, and AT+CH groups than in the Con group; a significantly greater effect was seen in the AT+CH group than in the AT and CH groups. Similarly, plasma and arterial nitrite/nitrate levels and arterial endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation were significantly higher in the AT, CH, and AT+CH groups than in the Con group; the AT+CH group had higher values than the AT and CH groups. Thus, chronic Chlorella intake combined with aerobic exercise training had pronounced effects on endothelial vasorelaxation in aged mice via an additive increase in arterial NO production. Novelty: Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was improved by Chlorella intake and exercise. Chlorella intake and exercise increased arterial Akt/eNOS/NO signaling. This combination approach further improved vasorelaxation via arterial NO production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aacetylcholine 3adiet 3aexercise 3amales 3ametabolism 3amice 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aphosphorylation 3avasodilation 0aaerobic exercise training 0aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 0aendothelial function 0aaging 0avasorelaxation1 aHasegawa, Natsuki1 aHorii, Naoki1 aInoue, Kenichiro1 aUchida, Masataka1 aIemitsu, Motoyuki0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2021, v. 46, no. 5 p.479-484dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2020-05433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05003naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245020600167300001600373520242200389592002802811650002502839650002102864650001802885650003102903650001802934650001602952650001902968650001402987650001103001650001503012650002503027650000903052650001803061650001403079650002103093650002403114650002503138650001703163650003803180650001803218650003003236650001203266650001603278650002203294650002003316650002203336650000903358650001903367650002503386650003803411650001003449653000903459653000703468653000703475653000803482653000703490653001203497653000803509653000803517653000803525653000803533653000903541653000903550653000903559653001003568653001103578653000703589653000703596653000703603653001803610653000903628653001703637653002503654653000903679700001603688700001703704700001603721700001503737700001903752700001903771700001303790700001803803773013003821856008103951852000904032655001204041IND60600530420221120211824.0180703e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060053042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ming-hua14aThe anti-inflammation effect of Moutan Cortex on advanced glycation end products-induced rat mesangial cells dysfunction and High-glucose–fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy rats  ap. 591-600.  aMoutan Cortex (MC, family: Paeonia suffruticosa Andr.) is a well-known traditional herbal medicine that has been shown to hold a protective effect on inflammation in several diseases. However, its anti-inflammatory activity on diabetic nephropathy (DN) has been less reported. The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential attenuation activities of MC on inflammation in AGEs-induced rat mesangial cells dysfunction and high-glucose–fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rats and explore the possible mechanism underlying its DN effect.The inflammation in mesangial cells (HBZY-1) was induced by 200μg/ml advanced glycation end products (AGEs). DN rats model was established by an administration high-glucose–fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) level in cell supernatant and rats serum were detected by appropriate kits. A co-culture system of mesangial cells and macrophages was performed to evaluate the migration of macrophages. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1), IL-6, MCP-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in kidney tissues of rats. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine TGF-β1, IL-6, MCP-1, ICAM-1 and RAGE protein expressions in mesangial cells.Pretreatment with MC could significantly inhibit AGEs-induced migration of macrophages in the co-culture system of mesangial cell and macrophage. MC could decrease IL-6 and MCP-1 levels in serum of DN rats in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MC also improved the blood glucose, serum creatinine and urine protein levels. Both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that MC decreased significantly the over-expression of IL-6, MCP-1, TGF-β1, ICAM-1 and RAGE in mesangial cells or kidney tissues. Additionally, the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokine could also be down-regulated by the pretreatment of RAGE-Ab (5μg/ml).These findings indicated that the extract of MC had an amelioration activity on the inflammation in AGEs-induced mesangial cells dysfunction and high-glucose–fat diet and STZ-induced DN rats. The protective effect might be associated with the intervention of MC via target of RAGE. These findings suggested that MC might be a benefit agent for the prevention and treatment of DN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia suffruticosa 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3achemokine CCL2 3acoculture 3acortex 3acreatinine 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adiet 3adose response 3aglycation 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-6 3aintraperitoneal injection 3akidneys 3amacrophages 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3atraditional medicine 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aurine 0aAGEs 0aMC 0aDN 0aSTZ 0aAG 0aTGF-β1 0aPBS 0aROS 0aFBS 0aBSA 0aDMEM 0aRAGE 0aIL-6 0aMCP-1 0aICAM-1 0aOD 0aSD 0aOS 0aMoutan cortex 0aAGEs 0aInflammation 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aRage1 aFeng, Liang1 aZhu, Mao-mao1 aGu, Jun-fei1 aJiang, Jun1 aCheng, Xu-dong1 aDing, Shu-ming1 aWu, Chan1 aJia, Xiao-bin0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.591-600dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017500165300001600340520155100356592002801907650001501935650002001950650001301970650001501983650001301998650001502011650001602026650001402042650002302056650001002079650001002089650004202099650003302141650002002174650001802194650002002212650001602232650001802248650001802266650002002284650001402304650000902318650002402327700001902351700001602370700001202386700001302398700001802411700001602429773013402445856008102579852000902660655001202669IND60590893920221117212956.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059089392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-018-1265-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xingang10ap-Coumaric can alter the composition of cucumber rhizosphere microbial communities and induce negative plant-microbial interactions [Errata: July 2018, v. 54 (5), p. 683]  ap. 363-372.  aPhenolics from root exudates or decaying residues are usually referred as autotoxins of several plant species. However, how phenolics affect soil microbial communities and their functional significances are poorly understood. Rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings treated with p-coumaric acid, an autotoxin of cucumber, were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicons. Then, feedback effects of the rhizosphere biota on cucumber seedlings were evaluated by inoculating non-sterilized and sterilized rhizosphere soils to sterilized background soils. p-Coumaric acid decreased the bacterial diversity of rhizosphere but increased fungal diversity and altered the compositions of both the bacterial and fungal communities. p-Coumaric acid increased the relative abundances of microbial taxa with phenol-degrading capability (such as Chaetomium, Humicola, and Mortierella spp.) and microbial taxa which contained plant pathogens (such as Fusarium spp.). However, p-coumaric acid inhibited the relative abundances of Lysobacter, Haliangium, and Gymnoascus spp., whose species can have pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant-growth-promoting effects. The positive effect of cucumber rhizosphere microbiota on cucumber seedling growth was reduced by p-coumaric acid. Overall, our results showed that, besides its direct phytotoxicity, p-coumaric acid can inhibit cucumber seedling growth through generating negative plant-soil microbial interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomium 3aCucumis sativus 3aFusarium 3aGymnoascus 3aHumicola 3aLysobacter 3aMortierella 3acucumbers 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant pathogens 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot exudates 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms1 aZhang, Jianhui1 aPan, Dandan1 aGe, Xin1 aJin, Xue1 aChen, Shaocan1 aWu, Fengzhi0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2018 Apr., v. 54, no. 3 p.363-372dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-018-1265-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014600167300001000313520194000323592002802263596003602291650001402327650002802341650001302369650002402382650001402406650001202420650002902432650001102461650001502472650001402487650001902501650001302520650001402533650002302547650001902570650001202589650001302601650001102614651001102625651002102636700001402657773010602671856008202777852000902859655001202868IND60627837520221120075404.0191202e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062783752DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-018-0136-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYonten Jamtsho,10aLivestock depredation by snow leopard and Tibetan wolf: Implications for herders’ livelihoods in Wangchuck Centennial National Park, Bhutan  ap. 1.  aHuman-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a serious problem in many parts of the world, and Bhutan’s Wangchuck Centennial National Park (WCNP) is no exception. Located in the remote alpine areas of the eastern Himalaya, wildlife species such as snow leopard (SL) and Tibetan wolf (TW) are reported to kill livestock in many parts of the Park. Such depredation is believed to have affected the livelihoods of high-altitude herding communities, resulting in conflicts between them. This study provides analysis on the extent of livestock depredation by wildlife predators such as SL and TW and examines its implications for the livelihoods of herding communities of Choekhortoe and Dhur regions of WCNP. Using semi-structured questionnaires, all herders (n = 38) in the study area were interviewed. The questions pertained to livestock population, frequency of depredation and income lost due to depredation in the last five years from 2012 to 2016. This study recorded 2,815 livestock heads in the study area, with an average herd size of 74.1 stock. The average herd size holding showed a decreasing trend over the years, and one of the reasons cited by the herders is depredation by SL and TW and other predators. This loss equated to an average annual financial loss equivalent to 10.2% (US$837) of their total per capita cash income. Such losses have resulted in negative impacts on herders’ livelihood; e.g. six herders (2012-2016) even stopped rearing livestock and resorted to an alternate source of cash income. The livestock intensification programmes, including pasture improvement through allowing controlled burning, and financial compensation, may be some potential short-term solutions to reduce conflict between herders and predators. Issuing permits for cordyceps (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) collection only to the herders and instilling the sense of stewardship to highland herders may be one of the long-term solutions.  aPublisher supplied data  aID0EVSAE252cRufford Foundation 3aCordyceps 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aaltitude 3afinancial economics 3aherd size 3aherding 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3aincome 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3anational parks 3apastures 3apredators 3aprescribed burning 3aquestionnaires 3arearing 3awildlife 3awolves 3aBhutan 3aHimalayan region1 aKatel, Om0 tPastoralism.g2019 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.1-1dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2262x2041-71367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-018-0136-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001400287500001400301520038100315592002800696650001600724650001600740650001100756650001600767650001400783650002200797651002300819653001800842653001900860653002200879653001400901653001300915700002200928700002000950700001900970773009300989856008201082852000901164655001201173IND60697382920221117192440.0210303e20180516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069738292DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.34.253712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVizzini, Alfredo10aDiversity of polypores in the Dominican Republic: Pseudowrightoporia dominicana sp. nov.

Our aim was to study the effects of Zibu Piyin Recipe (ZBPYR) fractions on scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in the mouse.Crude extracts were prepared using various solvents, and individual fractions produced following D101 macroporous resin column chromatography. The passive avoidance task, step down test and Morris water maze test were then performed in mice for the evaluation of learning and memory alterations. The effective fractions were then analyzed using GC–MS and polysaccharide measurement methods, respectively.The treatment group latency for the alcohol precipitation from water part (EP) and 95% ethanol part (95%E) following D101 macroporous resin column chromatography was significantly prolonged when compared to that of the scopolamine treated groups for both the passive avoidance task and step down test. In the Morris water maze tests, treatment with EP and 95%E resulted in a significantly shorter escape latency time (from the fourth day and the second day) and swimming distance (on the third day and from the third day) in scopolamine-induced mice. In the memory retention test, treatment with EP and 95%E dramatically shortened the latency to cross platform location and increased the numbers of platform location crosses in the scopolamine-induced mice. The polysaccharide content in EP was determined to be 69.79%. The 95%E was found to mainly contain asarone, α-cadinol, isocalamendiol, 2,4,7,14-tetramethyl-4-vinyl-tricyclo[5.4.3.0(1,8)]tetradecan-6-ol, 3-isopropyl-6,7-dimethyltricyclo[4.4.0.0(2,8)]decane-9,10-diol, 2-methyl-9-(prop-1- -en-3-ol-2-yl)-bicyclo[4.4.0]dec-2-ene-4-ol, diepicedrene-1-oxide, 7-methoxy-6-(3- -methyl-2-oxobutyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one and diisooctyl phthalate when assessed using GC–MS analysis.These findings suggest that the polysaccharide and volatile oil present in ZBPYR exhibit ameliorating effects on scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aamnesia 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amemory 3amice 3aphthalates 3apolysaccharides 3aporous media 3ascopolamine 3asolvents 3aswimming 0aCognitive performance 0aDementia 0aZBPYR 0aEssential oil 0aPolysaccharides1 aZhang, Lin1 aZhan, Libin1 aLu, Xiaoguang1 aPeng, Jinyong1 aLiang, Lina1 aLiu, Yu1 aZheng, Luping1 aZhang, Fuliang1 aLiu, Qigui0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.576-582dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012600168300001600294520048700310592002800797650001700825650001900842650001600861650001900877650001200896650001400908650001900922651001100941653000800952653002200960653003400982653002501016653001301041700001901054773011401073856008201187852000901269655001201278IND60130207020221121215507.0151127e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013020702DNAL7 a10.1600/036364413X6704762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukaya, Hirokazu10aTwo New Species of Sciaphila Blume (Triuridaceae) from Kalimantan, Borneo, with a New Record of S. thaidanica from Borneo  ap. 600-605.  aBorneo is one of the richest areas for mycoheterotrophic plants, and six species including one endemic have been recorded for the genus Sciaphila Blume, Triuridaceae.

Label incorporation into metabolites can be quantified using a broad range of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods, but in general, no single approach can completely cover isotopic space, even for small metabolites. The number of quantifiable isotopic species could be increased and the coverage of isotopic space improved by integrating measurements obtained by different methods; however, this approach has remained largely unexplored because no framework able to deal with partial, heterogeneous isotopic measurements has yet been developed. Here, we present a generic computational framework based on symbolic calculus that can integrate any isotopic data set by connecting measurements to the chemical structure of the molecules. As a test case, we apply this framework to isotopic analyses of amino acids, which are ubiquitous to life, central to many biological questions, and can be analyzed by a broad range of MS and NMR methods. We demonstrate how this integrative framework helps to (i) clarify and improve the coverage of isotopic space, (ii) evaluate the complementarity and redundancy of different techniques, (iii) consolidate isotopic data sets, (iv) design experiments, and (v) guide future analytical developments. This framework, which can be applied to any labeled element, isotopic tracer, metabolite, and analytical platform, has been implemented in IsoSolve (available at https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoSolve and https://pypi.org/project/IsoSolve), an open-source software that can be readily integrated into data analysis pipelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achemical structure 3adata collection 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atopology1 aSokol, Serguei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5674-33271 aKohlstedt, Michael1 aWittmann, Christoph1 aLétisse, Fabien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1490-01521 aLippens, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8236-09011 aPortais, Jean-Charles0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 01, v. 93, no. 27 p.9428-9436dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c010643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007800166300001800244500001500262520099900277592002801276650001801304650001501322650001601337650002201353650001701375650002601392650001901418650001401437653001001451700002901461700002001490773008901510856004801599852000901647655001201656IND4487515920221118024527.0120927e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448751592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-012-0406-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolkmann, Dieter10aEduard Strasburger (1844â1912): founder of modern plant cell biology  ap. 1163-1172.  a2019-12-04  aEduard Strasburger, director of the Botany Institute and the Botanical Garden at the University of Bonn from 1881 to 1912, was one of the most admirable scientists in the field of plant biology, not just as the founder of modern plant cell biology but in addition as an excellent teacher who strongly believed in âeducation through science.â He contributed to plant cell biology by discovering the discrete stages of karyokinesis and cytokinesis in algae and higher plants, describing cytoplasmic streaming in different systems, and reporting on the growth of the pollen tube into the embryo sac and guidance of the tube by synergides. Strasburger raised many problems which are hot spots in recent plant cell biology, e.g., structure and function of the plasmodesmata in relation to phloem loading (Strasburger cells) and signaling, mechanisms of cell plate formation, vesicle trafficking as a basis for most important developmental processes, and signaling related to fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplasmodesmata 3aembryo sac 3acytokinesis 3abotanical gardens 3apollen tubes 3acytoplasmic streaming 3aphloem loading 3aeducation 0aAlgae1 aBaluÅ¡ka, FrantiÅ¡ek1 aMenzel, Diedrik0 tProtoplasma.g2012 Oct., v. 249, no. 4 p.1163-1172dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-012-0406-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011100152300002000263520129500283592002801578650001401606650001301620650001301633650000901646650002501655700001701680700001301697700001401710700001701724700001401741700001801755700001501773700001601788773012401804856007401928852000902002655001202011IND60679389120221121033819.0191228e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067938912DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09201c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Hui10aGraphene as a nanofiller for enhancing the tribological properties and thermal conductivity of base grease  ap. 42481-42488.  aDuring mechanical processes, violent friction and wear between the friction contact surfaces not only causes wear to mechanical components, reducing the instrument life, but also causes friction heat, reducing the working efficiency of machines during operation. The addition of graphene-reinforced grease to the mechanical friction surface can effectively reduce the friction coefficient and improve the thermal conductivity. In this work, the tribological properties and thermal conductivity of base grease with graphene were investigated systematically. The tribological results showed that the grease with 2 wt% graphene had the best tribological properties among all these greases. The wear scar diameter and average friction coefficient of graphene grease with 2 wt% graphene reached 0.43 mm and 0.10 (the values for base grease are 0.50 mm and 0.118), respectively. In addition, the average friction coefficient and wear scar diameter increased proportionally with the increasing load and frequency. The thermal conductivity of the grease with 4 wt% graphene reached 0.28 W (m K)⁻¹, an increase of 55.5% in comparison with the base grease. It is proposed that the addition of graphene into the base grease effectively enhanced the tribological properties and thermal conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3afriction 3agraphene 3aheat 3athermal conductivity1 aYan, Guoping1 aLi, Meng1 aWang, Hao1 aChen, Yapeng1 aYan, Chao1 aLin, Cheng-Te1 aJiang, Nan1 aYu, Jinhong0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 9, no. 72 p.42481-42488dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09201c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520087600300592002801176650002201204650002301226650002301249650001201272650001601284650001501300700001801315700001901333700001901352700001901371700002001390700001801410773009501428856008101523990002301604852000901627655001201636IND60096353220221121062229.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTark, Sung Ju10aCharacterization of hydrogenated Al-doped ZnO films prepared by multi-step texturing for photovoltaic applications  ap. 362-367.  aIn this study, we investigated the effect of the multi-step texturing process on the electrical and optical properties of hydrogenated Al-doped zinc oxide (HAZO) thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering.

L.10aMechanism of Catalytic Oxidation of Styrenes with Hydrogen Peroxide in the Presence of Cationic Palladium(II) Complexes  ap. 12495-12503.  aKinetic studies, isotope labeling, and in situ high-resolution mass spectrometry are used to elucidate the mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of styrenes using aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and the cationic palladium(II) compound, [(PBO)Pd(NCMe)₂][OTf]₂ (PBO = 2-(pyridin-2-yl)benzoxazole). Previous studies have shown that this reaction yields acetophenones with high selectivity. We find that H₂O₂ binds to Pd(II) followed by styrene binding to generate a Pd-alkylperoxide that liberates acetophenone by at least two competitive processes, one of which involves a palladium enolate intermediate that has not been previously observed in olefin oxidation reactions. We suggest that acetophenone is formed from the palladium enolate intermediate by protonation from H₂O₂. We replaced hydrogen peroxide with t-butyl hydroperoxide and found that, although the palladium enolate intermediate was observed, it was not on the major product-generating pathway, indicating that the form of the oxidant plays a key role in the reaction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetophenones 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3areaction mechanisms 3astyrene1 aDornan, Laura M.1 aZare, Richard N.1 aWaymouth, Robert M.1 aMuldoon, Mark J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 139, no. 36 p.12495-12503dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b054133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245011900206300001800325520158700343592002801930650000801958650002201966650002501988650003502013650001602048650002002064650001702084650001102101650002202112650004302134650001402177650001702191700002002208700005102228700005102279773012902330856008402459852000902543655001202552IND60744419920221122180300.0210713e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074441992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c011802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Beibei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7772-517110aElemental Mass Spectrometry and Fluorescence Dual-Mode Strategy for Ultrasensitive Label-Free Detection of HBV DNA  ap. 9454-9461.  aThis work reported a simple and ultrasensitive label-free method for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by combining hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) with dual-mode detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and fluorescence using ruthenium complex [Ru(bpy)₂dppz]²⁺ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido [3,2-a:2′,3′-c] phenazine) as a dual functional probe. An HBV DNA-initiated HRCA system was designed to realize the highly efficient amplification of HBV DNA with the generation of a mass of dsDNA. Also, the [Ru(bpy)₂dppz]²⁺ probe was then added to intercalate into the dsDNA products, resulting in strong fluorescence recovery of the probe for fluorescence detection. Meanwhile, using a biotin-modified primer in HRCA, the dsDNA-[Ru(bpy)₂dppz]²⁺ complexes could be captured by the avidin-coated 96-well plates, and the captured [Ru(bpy)₂dppz]²⁺ probe was later desorbed by acid for ICP-MS detection. The linear range of the proposed method was 3.5–200 amol L–¹ and the limit of detection (LOD) was 1 amol L–¹ for ICP-MS detection, while the linear range was 20–500 amol L–¹ and the LOD was 9.6 amol L–¹ for fluorescence detection. The developed method was applied to human serum sample analysis, and the analytical results coincided very well with those obtained by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The developed dual-mode label-free detection method was ultrasensitive, simple, and accurate, showing great potential for therapeutic monitoring of HBV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHepatitis B virus 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aruthenium 3atherapeutics1 aXiao, Guangyang1 aHe, Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2009-80981 aHu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2171-22020 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 June 28, v. 93, no. 27 p.9454-9461dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c011803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011800207300001600325506007600341520183300417592002802250506003702278650001302315650001902328650001002347650001502357650001702372650001402389650002902403650001302432650001302445650001502458700002002473700002102493700001902514773013502533856008202668852000902750655001202759IND60590894520221207125827.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059089452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-016-1342-62doi7 aPMC58456262pmcid7 a278171282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenzel, Daniel12aL-Arginine and B vitamins improve endothelial function in subjects with mild to moderate blood pressure elevation  ap. 557-568.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: The aim of this trial was to investigate the influence of a dietetic product consisting of a unique combination of L-arginine with the vitamins B₆, folic acid and B₁₂ (Telcor® Arginin plus) on endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Subjects aged 40–65 years with mild to moderate blood pressure (BP) elevation not treated with anti-hypertensive drugs were randomly assigned to either the dietetic product (n = 40) or a matching placebo (n = 41) for 3 months with open follow-up for a further 3 months. Postprandial change in endothelial function was assessed using the validated reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) at 3 months compared to the study onset (RHI post–pre, visit 3–visit 1; ΔΔRHI). Secondary parameters included BP and plasma homocysteine concentration. RESULTS: The primary efficacy analysis revealed superiority of the nutritional intervention over placebo (p = 0.0349) in reducing the deterioration of endothelial function. While in the active group ΔΔRHI increased (0.371 ± 0.122), almost no change could be detected in the placebo group (0.031 ± 0.100), thus demonstrating a significant improvement in vascular function in the intervention group. Moreover, the intervention reduced BP and homocysteine levels. Non-serious adverse events were equally distributed in both groups, and none of the events were assessed as possibly intervention-related by the investigators. CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed the effective and safe use of dietary management with L-arginine in combination with B vitamins. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated a statistically significant superiority of the combination of L-arginine with B vitamins over placebo in improving and restoring impaired endothelial function and lowering BP in patients with mild to moderate blood pressure elevation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarginine 3ablood pressure 3adrugs 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3ahyperemia 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3aplacebos 3apyridoxine1 aHaller, Hermann1 aWilhelm, Manfred1 aRobenek, Horst0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.557-568dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-016-1342-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245014500179300001800324520253000342592002802872650001302900650002002913650001202933650003902945650001702984650001203001650001103013650001903024650001703043650002003060650001403080650001503094650001303109700002503122700002103147700002003168700002703188773011903215856005503334852000903389655001203398IND4510096220221118024312.0150730e20020301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451009622DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02806.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Gorp, Roosje M. A.10aIrregular spiking in free calcium concentration in single, human platelets: Regulation by modulation of the inositol trisphosphate receptors  ap. 1543-1552.  aFluorescence ratio imaging indicates that immobilized, aspirinâtreated platelets, loaded with Furaâ2, respond to inositol 1,4,5âtrisphosphateâ (InsP3)âgenerating agonists such as thrombin by highâfrequency, irregular rises in cytosolic [Ca2+]i with spikes that vary in peak level and peakâtoâpeak interval. This differs from the regular [Ca2+]i oscillations observed in other, larger cells. We found that the thiolâreactive compounds thimerosal (10âÂµm) and U73122 (10âÂµm) evoked similar irregular Ca2+ responses in platelets, but in this case in the absence of InsP3 generation. Thrombinâinduced spiking was acutely abolished by inhibiting phospholipaseâC or elevating intracellular cAMP levels, while spiking with sulfhydryl reagents was only partially blocked by cAMP elevation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluoâ3âloaded platelets indicated that, with all agonists or conditions, the irregular spikes were almost instantaneously raised in various regions within a single platelet. When using saponinâpermeabilized platelets, we found that InsP3âinduced Ca2+ release from stores was stimulated by modest Ca2+ concentrations, pointing to a mechanism of InsP3âdependent Ca2+âinduced Ca2+ release (CICR). This process was completely inhibitable by heparin. The Ca2+ release by InsP3, but not the CICR sensor, was negatively regulated by cAMP elevation. Thimerosal treatment did not release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, but markedly potentiated the stimulatory effect of InsP3. In contrast, U73122 caused a heparin/cAMPâinsensitive Ca2+ leak from stores that differed from those used by InsP3. Taken together, these results demonstrate that InsP3 receptor channels play a crucial role in the irregular, spiking Ca2+ signal of intact platelets, even when induced by agents such as thimerosal or U73122 which do not stimulate InsP3 formation. The irregular Ca2+ release events appear to be subjected to extensive regulation by: (a) InsP3 level, (b) the potentiating effect of elevated Ca2+ on InsP3 action via CICR, (c) InsP3 channel sensitization by sulfhydryl (thimerosal) modification, (d) InsP3 channelâindependent Ca2+ leak with U73122, and (e) downâregulation via cAMP elevation. The observation that individual Ca2+ peaks were generated in various parts of a platelet at similar intervals and amplitudes points to effective cooperation of the various stores in the Ca2+ârelease process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3ablood platelets 3acalcium 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3aheparin 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amyo-inositol 3aphospholipase C 3areceptors 3athimerosal 3athrombin1 aFeijge, Marion A.

In this work, mesoporous photoanodes were fabricated based on the composites of anatase TiO₂ nanoparticles and carbon spheres. The holes were left after calcination thus serving as the light scattering centers in the photoanode. The size and the amounts of the holes were adjusted by changing the size (250, 500 and 700 nm) and concentration (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of the TiO₂ nanocrystallines) of the carbon spheres in the slurry. The light scattering ability and the dye adsorption of the photoanodes with holes of varied size and contents were investigated. The holes left by calcinating the carbon spheres increased the light scattering of the photoanode. However, the increased light scattering ability offset the dye adsorption ability of the photoanode by high amounts of carbon spheres modification. The performances of the DSSCs are investigated under the simulated sunlight and the incident light (400–780 nm). The DSSC with photoanode made from the slurry with 500 nm and 15 wt% carbon spheres exhibited the opitimized performance (Jsc = 14.8 mA cm⁻², Voc = 0.657 V, FF = 0.703 and η = 7.2%), much better than the DSSCs with photoanode made by the pure TiO₂ nanocrystalline (Jsc = 11.7 mA cm⁻², Voc = 0.645V, FF = 0.699 and η = 5.55%) and other photoanodes, indicating it best balanced the controversy of the enhanced light scattering ability and the decreased dye adsorption. The incident-photo-to-electric conversion efficiency test indicated the highest LHE of the 500 nm and 15 wt% carbon spheres modified photoanode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3alight scattering 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aslurries 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhang, Jing1 aWang, Peiqing1 aSun, Qiang1 aZheng, Jun1 aZhu, Yuejin0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.376-381dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.08.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019600163500001900359520111600378592002801494650001701522650001301539650001101552650001301563650001501576650001201591650001801603650001301621651001101634653001701645653001401662653003201676653001201708653001701720653001101737653002301748700001801771700005701789773010601846856008101952852000902033655001202042IND60736692820221120122328.0210510e20210507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669282DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X210001582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, P.V.10aCo-occurrence of Eutrombicula alfreddugesi and Oswaldofilaria chabaudi in Tropidurus torquatus and first report of microfilariae in the chigger mite: possible evidence of a lifecycle pathway?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile much attention has been paid to vector-borne filariasis, diseases that threaten millions of people in tropical and subtropical countries, the literature on host–parasite associations and transmission strategies of filarial nematodes in wildlife is scarce. Here, we report the co-occurrence of chigger mites (Eutrombicula alfreddugesi) and onchocercid nematodes (Oswaldofilaria chabaudi) parasitizing the lizard Tropidurus torquatus in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Examination of chiggers established, for the first time, the occurrence of microfilariae in trombiculid mites (Trombiculidae). These larvae were morphologically similar to those recovered from adult females of O. chabaudi. The current evidence suggests that chiggers do not play a role in the transmission of filarioid nematodes, but rather act as accidental or dead-end hosts. Nevertheless, considering the polyphagous nature of trombiculid mites, similar to blood-sucking insects involved in the transmission of several infectious diseases, further studies may shed light on the potential role of chiggers as vectors of filarioids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEutrombicula 3aNematoda 3aadults 3achiggers 3afilariasis 3alizards 3amicrofilariae 3awildlife 3aBrazil 0aendoparasite 0afilarioid 0ahost–parasite association 0abiology 0aectoparasite 0alizard 0aNeotropical region1 aGomides, S.C.1 aPereira, F.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7921-59650 tJournal of helminthology.g, v. 95 p.e25-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X210001583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009700191300001600288520119800304592002801502650002201530650001401552650001001566650001001576650001301586650001401599650003001613650002401643650002201667650003501689650004801724650001701772650001201789650002001801650001101821650002401832650001301856650002901869650002501898650003701923650000901960650004201969650004602011650002702057650003902084700002102123700002202144773011602166856005502282852000902337655001202346IND4478919520221118225532.0120711e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447891952DNAL7 a220230262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01918.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Mu‐Tzu14aThe SNP Genotypes of Growth Hormone Gene Associated with Reproductive Traits in Tsaiya Ducks  ap. 568-573.  aOur previous cDNA microarray study showed that the growth hormone (GH) gene may involve in the duck egg formation process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between GH genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and reproductive traits of Tsaiya ducks. Primer pairs for the coding region in the GH were designed based on the duck genomic sequence. Polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐single strand polymorphism (SSCP) and were verified by DNA sequencing. Nineteen SNPs were identified in the duck GH gene, of which three coding SNPs (C3169T, C3700T and C5058G) were genotyped to investigate the associations with reproductive traits. The results showed that each SNP was associated with at least one duck fertility‐related trait (p < 0.05). Haplotypes constructed on these three SNPs were associated with fertility rate (FR) and maximum duration of fertility (MDF) (p < 0.05). In particular, diplotype H1H1 was dominant for FR and MDF. This suggested that GH gene polymorphisms are associated with duck fertility‐related traits. The SNPs in this gene may be used as potential markers for marker‐assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplementary DNA 3aduck eggs 3aducks 3agenes 3agenotype 3aoogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproductive traits 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3asomatotropin 2aAnimals 2aDucksxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aGrowth Hormonexgenetics 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aLinkage Disequilibriumxgenetics 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxveterinary1 aCheng, Yu‐Shin1 aHuang, Mu‐Chiou0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2012 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.568-573dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01918.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014300154520187300297592002802170650001102198650001302209650001202222650001202234650002502246650002302271650001502294650001602309650001102325650001302336650002402349650001902373650001502392650001802407650001602425650001502441651001002456700001602466700001902482700002002501700002002521700001702541773012902558856007402687852000902761655001202770IND60745603420221119054106.0210723e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074560342DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131426722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin 10aImproved Understanding of Groundwater Storage Changes under the Influence of River Basin Governance in Northwestern China Using GRACE Data  aGroundwater is crucial for economic development in arid and semiarid areas. The Shiyang River Basin (SRB) has the most prominent water use issues in northwestern China, and overexploited groundwater resources have led to continuous groundwater-level decline. The key governance planning project of the SRB was issued in 2007. This paper synthetically combines remote-sensing data from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, land use, and in situ groundwater-level data to evaluate groundwater storage variations on a regional scale. Terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA), in addition to their influencing factors in the SRB since the implementation of the key governance project, are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of governance. The results show that GRACE-derived GWS variations are consistent with in situ observation data in the basin, with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. The GWS in the SRB had a slow downward trend from 2003 to 2016, and this increased by 0.38 billion m³/year after 2018. As the meteorological data did not change significantly, the changes in water storage are mainly caused by human activities, which are estimated by using the principle of water balance. The decline in GWS in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB has been curbed since 2009 and has gradually rebounded since 2014. GWS decreased by 2.2 mm EWH (equivalent water height) from 2011 to 2016, which was 91% lower than that from 2007 to 2010. The cropland area in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB also stopped increasing after 2011 and gradually decreased after 2014, while the area of natural vegetation gradually increased, indicating that the groundwater level and associated ecology significantly recovered after the implementation of the project.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acropland 3adecline 3aecology 3aeconomic development 3aevapotranspiration 3agovernance 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3awater storage 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aHu, Litang 1 aSun, Kangning 1 aYang, Zhengqiu 1 aSun, Jianchong 1 aYin, Wenjie 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 July 07, v. 13, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131426723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016700164300001300331500001400344520107400358592002801432650002101460650001701481650001901498650001601517650001601533650001401549651001001563651001501573651000901588653002901597653001601626653001301642653002701655700001801682700001901700700002001719773009301739856008201832852000901914655001201923IND60697380520221117191226.0210303e20180112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069738052DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.29.212502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Li-Wei10aResolution of phylogenetic position of Nigrofomitaceae within Hymenochaetales (Basidiomycota) and Nigrofomes sinomelanoporus sp. nov.

However, no molecular evidence supports this taxonomic opinion. For the first time, Nigrofomitaceae is included in a phylogenetic analysis, which shows that this family is separated from Polyporales and nested within Hymenochaetales as a distinct lineage from four well-known families, viz. Hymenochaetaceae, Neoantrodiellaceae, Oxyporaceae and Schizoporaceae. Therefore, Nigrofomitaceae is treated as the fifth family of Hymenochaetales. Nigrofomes melanoporus, the type species of Nigrofomitaceae, was considered to have a pantropical distribution. However, from both morphological and phylogenetic perspectives, the Chinese specimens labelled as N. melanoporus are found not to be conspecific with the specimens of N. melanoporus from Costa Rica, close to the type locality in Cuba. These Chinese specimens are thus described as a new species Nigrofomes sinomelanoporus. The species diversity of Nigrofomes in pantropical region is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenochaetaceae 3aPolyporaceae 3aSchizoporaceae 3aexhibitions 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aChina 3aCosta Rica 3aCuba 0apantropical distribution 0aPolyporales 0ataxonomy 0awood-inhabiting fungus1 aWang, Xue-Wei1 aVlasák, Josef1 aRen, Guang-Juan0 tMycoKeys.g2018 Jan. 12, v. 29 p.1-13dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.29.212503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04059naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001300179245007900192300001600271506007600287520213700363592002802500506003702528650002502565650001902590650003802609650001202647650001502659650002202674650001402696650001402710650002002724650001902744650001502763650000902778650002202787650001702809650002202826650002102848650001102869650001402880650002102894650001402915650001302929650001302942650001602955650001402971650001002985650001402995650002603009650002903035650002303064650002803087700001303115700001603128700001503144700001403159700001203173773010103185856007803286852000903364655001203373IND4464663320221207081908.0120419e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446466332DNAL7 a218135632pmid7 aPMC31586842pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcr1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNepi, M.10aXylan-degrading enzymes in male and female flower nectar of Cucurbita pepo  ap. 521-527.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nectar is a very complex mixture of substances. Some components (sugars and amino acids) are considered primary alimentary rewards for animals and have been investigated and characterized in numerous species for many years. In contrast, nectar proteins have been the subject of few studies and little is known of their function. Only very recently have detailed studies and characterization of nectar proteins been undertaken, and then for only a very few species. This current work represents a first step in the identification of a protein profile for the floral nectar of Cucurbita pepo. In this regard, the species studied is of particular interest in that it is monoecious with unisexual flowers and, consequently, it is possible that nectar proteins derived from male and female flowers may differ. METHODS: Manually excised spots from two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis were subjected to in-gel protein digestion. The resulting peptides were sequenced using nanoscale LC–ESI/MS-MS (liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry). An MS/MS ions search was carried out in Swiss-Prot and NCBInr databases using MASCOT software. KEY RESULTS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a total of 24 spots and a different protein profile for male and female flower nectar. Four main proteins recognized by 2-D electrophoresis most closely resemble β-D-xylosidases from Arabidopsis thaliana and have some homology to a β-D-xylosidase from Medicago varia. They were present in similar quantities in male and female flowers and had the same molecular weight, but with slightly different isoelectric points. CONCLUSIONS: A putative function for xylosidases in floral nectar of C. pepo is proposed, namely that they may be involved in degrading the oligosaccharides released by the nectary cell walls in response to hydrolytic enzymes produced by invading micro-organisms. Several types of oligosaccharides have been reported to increase the pathogenic potential of micro-organisms. Thus, it is possible that such a mechanism may reduce the virulence of pathogens present in nectar.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCucurbita pepo 3aMedicago sativa nothosubsp. varia 3aanimals 3acell walls 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adigestion 3aelectrophoresis 3afemale flowers 3aionization 3aions 3aisoelectric point 3amale flowers 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anectar 3anectaries 3aoligosaccharides 3apathogens 3apeptides 3aproteins 3asugar acids 3avirulence 3axylan 3axylanases 2aCucurbitaxenzymology 2aPlant Nectarxmetabolism 2aXylansxmetabolism 2aXylosidasesxmetabolism1 aBini, L.1 aBianchi, L.1 aPuglia, M.1 aAbate, M.1 aCai, G.0 tAnnals of botany.g2011 Sept., v. 108, no. 3 p.521-527dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcr1653Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015400166300001600320500001500336520123000351592002801581650001801609650001801627650002701645650001901672650002301691650003401714650003101748650001901779650002801798650001501826650001701841650001501858650001201873650002101885650002501906653003001931653002501961653002901986653002002015653001702035653001702052700001902069700001502088700001802103700001902121700001602140700001802156773009502174856008502269852000902354655001202363IND60519030620221122063108.0160420e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903062DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2015.10819312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Qingli10aEffects of three conventional drying methods on the lipid oxidation, fatty acids composition, and antioxidant activities of walnut (Juglans regia L.)  ap. 822-829.  a2019-12-06  aThree walnut (Juglans regia L.) drying methods (sun drying, direct oven drying, and intermittent oven drying) were employed, and the consequent changes in lipid oxidation attributes, such as acid value (AV), peroxide value (POV), saponification value (SV), fatty acid composition, and antioxidant activity [including reducing power, superoxide anion scavenging activity, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, total phenols content (TPC), and total flavonoids content (TFC)] were investigated in this study. Sun drying resulted in the highest AV, POV, and SV, followed by direct oven drying and intermittent oven drying. Antioxidant activities and related compounds, TPC and TFC, were initially increased and then declined during drying, and a significant correlation was found between antioxidant activity and TPC and TFC. The LOX activities of all samples showed an increasing trend, although those of the sun-dried samples were the lowest. The walnuts dried with the intermittent oven drying method contained more linoleic acid than those dried by direct oven drying. Overall, intermittent oven drying appears to be a promising strategy for fresh walnut drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinoleic acid 3aJuglans regia 3afatty acid composition 3aperoxide value 3alipid peroxidation 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3asaponification 3afree radical scavengers 3aacid value 3asolar drying 3aflavonoids 3awalnuts 3asuperoxide anion 3aantioxidant activity 0awalnut (Juglans regia L.) 0aAntioxidant activity 0aintermittent oven drying 0alipid oxidation 0alipoxygenase 0aLOX activity1 aYang, Xiaoying1 aFu, Maorun1 aChen, Qingmin1 aZhang, Xiaohui1 aHe, Zhiping1 aQiao, Xingguo0 tDrying technology.g2016 May 18, v. 34, no. 7 p.822-829dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2015.10819313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015400173300001100327520147500338592002801813650002201841650002001863650002501883650003501908650001101943650001501954650001901969650001401988650002202002650001802024650002302042650001802065650001502083651001002098700002002108700002402128700002002152773012602172856008102298852000902379655001202388IND60627835120221120191851.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062783512DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-019-0893-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Ravindra Kumar10aDevelopment of simplified WQIs for assessment of spatial and temporal variations of surface water quality in upper Damodar river basin, eastern India  ap. 21.  aIn this study, four surface water quality datasets of upper Damodar river basin (DRB) covering three seasons; pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and annual, for years 2007–2010 were generated by analyzing 280 grab water samples. Each dataset consist of water quality constituents of 35 monitoring stations and sample of each station was evaluated by 17 critical parameters (total 4760 observations). Furthermore, each dataset was treated using six water quality indices (WQIs): four developed simplified indices (WQIₘ, WQIₘᵢₙ, WQIDO, and WQIₚcₐ) and two existing extended indices (WQIₒbⱼ and WQIₛᵤb), to assess spatiotemporal variations and suitability for human use and aquatic life. Results revealed that developed indices show on an average similar spatiotemporal variations as compared to WQIₒbⱼ at a lower analytical cost at most of sampling sites comes under good to medium categories of water quality. Geographical information system (GIS) technique was also used for generation of temporal pollution potential maps of DRB. Consequently, this study also presents the necessity and usefulness of developed indices over extended indices especially for the developing countries, because the cost of monitoring and expenses associated with the implementation is less compared to extended methods and generated maps may also facilitate the decision-making processes under various scenarios considering spatial and temporal variability in DRB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3apollution 3aspatial variation 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aMurthy, Shankar1 aTiwary, Rajani Kant1 aVerma, Sangeeta0 tApplied water science.g2019 Feb., v. 9, no. 1 p.21-21dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-019-0893-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245006600203300001600269500001100285506007600296520074300372592002801115506003701143650002001180650001601200650001901216650001601235650001901251650001001270650001101280650001401291650001201305700001901317700001601336700002501352700001901377700002101396773012001417856008201537852000901619655001201628IND60590891820221207125156.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059089182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00294-017-0754-z2doi7 aPMC58495312pmcid7 a289836602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, James10aSynthetic genome recoding: new genetic codes for new features  ap. 327-333.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFull genome recoding, or rewriting codon meaning, through chemical synthesis of entire bacterial chromosomes has become feasible in the past several years. Recoding an organism can impart new properties including non-natural amino acid incorporation, virus resistance, and biocontainment. The estimated cost of construction that includes DNA synthesis, assembly by recombination, and troubleshooting, is now comparable to costs of early stage development of drugs or other high-tech products. Here, we discuss several recently published assembly methods and provide some thoughts on the future, including how synthetic efforts might benefit from the analysis of natural recoding processes and organisms that use alternative genetic codes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aamino acids 3abiocontainment 3achromosomes 3acost estimates 3adrugs 3agenome 3asynthesis 3aviruses1 aStirling, Finn1 aLau, YuHeng1 aShulgina, Yekaterina1 aWay, JeffreyC.1 aSilver, PamelaA.0 tCurrent genetics.g2018 Apr., v. 64, no. 2 p.327-333dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl32278x0172-80837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-017-0754-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001400303500001400317520101200331536005401343592002801397650001901425650001501444650001401459650001901473650001601492650001401508650001301522650001901535651001201554653003501566653002701601653001501628653002301643653001301666700002001679700001901699700002101718700001901739773009401758856008201852852000901934655001201943IND60697380620221117191208.0210303e20180112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069738062DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.29.229782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKušan, Ivana13aAn overview of the genus Coprotus (Pezizales, Ascomycota) with notes on the type species and description of C. epithecioides sp. nov.  ap. 15-47.  aNAL-light  aIn a mycological research performed in the Sjeverni Velebit National Park, Croatia, a new species of Coprotus was discovered, described here as C. epithecioides.

From the five consequent surveys, 137 seaweed species belonging to 32 families and 17 genera were recorded in the Gulf of Mannar islands. Among 137 seaweed species, green algae (48) was the highest, followed by red (48) and brown (41) were observed. A comparative study among all three seasons revealed that a higher number of seaweed species and diversity indices were recorded in post-monsoon and monsoon seasons, whereas a lower value was recorded in summer months. 30 species were commonly found in the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve islands and 44 species are found with restricted occurrence. The genus Caulerpa appeared as the most diversified genera (18 species) followed by Sargassum (14 species), Dictyota (8 species), Gracilaria (6 species), Turbinaria (4 species), and Hypnea (6 species). While comparing all 19 islands, the maximum number of species recorded in Appa and Hare island (n = 76) and minimum species recorded in Manaliputti island (n = 25). There were 10 seaweed species abundantly present in all 19 islands. Dictyota dichotoma, Halimeda gracilis, Padina pavonica, Sargassum polycystum, Turbinaria ornata were common. Both the indices clearly pointed out greater seaweeds diversity in all the islands except Manaliputti island and higher diversity value indicated the healthy nature of the seaweed ecosystems and islands of the Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve. HIGHLIGHTS: 1. First attempt to systematic document of the seaweed diversity exclusively in inter-tidal region of islands of Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve 2.

Moench) is an important coarse cereal crop grown for grain and fodder in the semi‐arid Tropics, mainly in Asian and African countries. In India sorghum is consumed as human food and poultry feed. Sorghum grain grown in the rainy season (kharif) is becoming severely affected by grain moulds, the major fungi involved being Aspergillus, Fusarium and Curvularia. If the extent of mould is severe, the grain is unsafe for consumption owing to contamination by mycotoxins. RESULTS: This paper presents a multi‐centre study conducted in sorghum to evaluate natural contamination of aflatoxin B1 in India. A total of 1606 grain sorghum samples were collected during the rainy (kharif) season across 4 years from seven states of India, representing different geographical regions of the country. Aflatoxin B1 contamination during 2007–08 was the highest (13.1%), followed by samples from the year 2004–05 (2.85%). The samples collected in years 2005–06 and 2006–07 showed contamination below 1%. The number of samples (35) showing aflatoxin B1 contamination above the safety limit was also highest during 2007–08 as compared to samples from the other years. CONCLUSION: This study, conducted for 4 years, showed that natural contamination of aflatoxin B1 in sorghum grown in India is within safety limits (20 µg kg−1) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Committee and 73% of samples were positive for toxin. However, 0.75% (12) of total samples contained aflatoxin above the safety limit. The overall occurrence of toxin from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan was below 5 µg kg−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aCurvularia 3aFusarium 3aSorghum bicolor 3aaflatoxin B1 3acommittees 3afeeds 3afoods 3aforage 3afungi 3agrain crops 3agrain sorghum 3agrowing season 3ahumans 3apoultry 3atropics 2aAflatoxin B1xanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Safety 2aFungi 2aHumans 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSeedsxmicrobiology 2aSorghumxmicrobiology 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aKomala, Vadabalija Venkata1 aKumar, Bathula Swaroop Vijay1 aDas, Indra Kanta1 aPatil, Jagannath Vishnu0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Sept., v. 92, no. 12 p.2416-2420dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5646  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520061800283592002800901650002200929650001400951650001700965650001100982650002200993650001101015650001201026650001601038773009501054856008101149990002301230852000901253655001201262IND60096350020221123020846.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Jong-Hwan10aOxygen-passivated enhancement of photoluminescence from SiO₂ films containing Si nanocrystals  ap. 827-829.  aSiO₂ films containing Si nanocrystals were exposed to atomic oxygen (O) plasma at different temperatures. The photoluminescence intensity from the films increases with increasing exposure time, and then saturates at a level that depends on the exposure temperature. There are no significant changes in the PL spectrum shapes and the O-induced PL is fully recovered to its original state by thermal annealing. The results are likely to be due to a balance between defect passivation and depassivation, with the activation energy for the passivation reaction being larger than that for the depassivation reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aannealing 3ananocrystals 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3asilica 3asilicon 3atemperature0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.827-829dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.1123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01307naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009000162300001800252520032000270592002800590650001400618650002700632650001300659700001700672700001800689700002000707700002500727700002600752773013200778856007400910852000900984655001200993IND60736690020221120102148.0210510e20210506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669002DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc00740h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaranjo, Cristina10aChain-capper effect to bias the amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymers  ap. 4500-4503.  aThe kinetically controlled amplification of asymmetry experienced in the co-assembly of chiral tribiphenylaminetricarboxamides (S)-1 and (R)-1 is investigated.

Hypocotyl explants induced hairy roots at a higher frequency (53.2 ± 0.3 %) than cotyledons (32.1 ± 0.2 %) when infected with the most virulent strain TR105. The explants co-cultivated 48 h in half-strength salts and vitamins of Murashige and Skoog basal medium (half-MSB) induced hairy roots either directly from the wounds or followed by the formation of gall like structures. Irrespective of the explants, the strain MTCC 532 induced callus alone. The root initials on the galls proliferated vigorously and elongated more rapidly when they were segmented and subcultured on half-MSB medium than the proliferation and elongation of directly emerged roots. The established hairy roots showed intermittent gall formation which was the active sites for hairy roots induction. The molecular evidence of rol A and rol C gene integration was confirmed by PCR amplification and southern blot hybridization. Growth of the hairy roots was undertaken by measuring root growth unit after culturing root tips in half-MSB solid medium and determined fresh weight/dry weight/conductivity during time-course study in shake flask cultures. The maximum biomass and accumulation of the root specific compound, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzaldehyde (MBALD) (0.22 % dry weight), was recorded at the 6th week of growth, which was more than that observed in normal root cultures (0.16 % dry weight).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aSouthern blotting 3aactive sites 3abenzaldehyde 3abiomass production 3acallus 3acotyledons 3aexplants 3agenes 3amedicinal plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroot galls 3aroot growth 3aroot tips 3asalts 3avitamins1 aSherina, T.

Recognizing this disparity is particularly important when the best data available are sparse and therefore lack statistical power, because hypothesis tests that use data sets with low statistical power are likely to commit type II errors, thereby denying necessary protection to threatened and endangered species. Equivalence tests can alleviate this problem, and ensure that imperiled species receive the benefit of the doubt, by switching the null and alternative hypotheses. These points are illustrated by critiquing a recent review of ESA requirements for endangered fishes in Upper Klamath Lake (southern Oregon).  aPublisher supplied data 0ahypothesis test 0aequivalence test 0astatistical power 0aburden of proof 0atype I and type II error0 tBioScience.g2007 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.65-70dAmerican Institute of Biological Sciencesx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008900161300001800250500001900268520054500287592002800832650001400860650001700874650002000891650002200911700001800933700001800951700001400969700001900983700001201002700001401014700001301028700001601041700001701057700001601074773013201090856007401222852000901296655001201305IND60736690120221120102257.0210510e20210506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669012DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc00769f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Ŭi-wŏn,10aPalladium-catalyzed one-pot phosphorylation of phenols mediated by sulfuryl fluoride  ap. 4588-4591.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report a general palladium-catalyzed one-pot procedure for the synthesis of phosphonates, phosphinates and phosphine oxides from phenols mediated by sulfuryl fluoride.

A major difference from many model organisms is that standard husbandry practices in zebrafish are designed to maintain population diversity. While this diversity is attractive for translational applications in human and ecological health, it raises critical questions on how interindividual genetic variation might contribute to chemical exposure or disease susceptibility differences. Findings from pooled samples of zebrafish support this supposition of diversity yet cannot directly measure allele frequencies for reference versus alternate alleles. Using the Tanguay lab Tropical 5D zebrafish line (T5D), we performed whole genome sequencing on a large group (n = 276) of individual zebrafish embryos. Paired-end reads were collected on an Illumina 3000HT, then aligned to the most recent zebrafish reference genome (GRCz10). These data were used to compare observed population genetic variation across species (humans, mice, zebrafish), then across lines within zebrafish. We found more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in T5D than have been reported in SNP databases for any of the WIK, TU, TL, or AB lines. We theorize that some subset of the novel SNPs may be shared with other zebrafish lines but have not been identified in other studies due to the limitations of capturing population diversity in pooled sequencing strategies. We establish T5D as a model that is representative of diversity levels within laboratory zebrafish lines and demonstrate that experimental design and analysis can exert major effects when characterizing genetic diversity in heterogeneous populations.  aPublisher supplied data  aES027294cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aES005948cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aES025128cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aES019764cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aES016465cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aES007329cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  a835168cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  a835796cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  aDGE1252376cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aalleles 3adatabases 3adisease resistance 3aearly development 3aexperimental design 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aTruong, Lisa1 aScholl, Elizabeth H.1 aTanguay, Robert L.1 aReif, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7815-67670 tMammalian genome.g2018 Feb., v. 29, no. 1-2 p.90-100dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870068x0938-89907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-018-9735-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009000158520177000248592002802018650001202046650002002058650001502078650001902093650001102112650001602123650001602139650001802155650002502173700001702198700002302215700002202238773012902260856007402389852000902463655001202472IND60745603820221119054324.0210723e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074560382DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131426752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayr, Stefan 10aSystematic Water Fraction Estimation for a Global and Daily Surface Water Time-Series  aFresh water is a vital natural resource. Earth observation time-series are well suited to monitor corresponding surface dynamics. The DLR-DFD Global WaterPack (GWP) provides daily information on globally distributed inland surface water based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images at 250 m spatial resolution. Operating on this spatiotemporal level comes with the drawback of moderate spatial resolution; only coarse pixel-based surface water quantification is possible. To enhance the quantitative capabilities of this dataset, we systematically access subpixel information on fractional water coverage. For this, a linear mixture model is employed, using classification probability and pure pixel reference information. Classification probability is derived from relative datapoint (pixel) locations in feature space. Pure water and non-water reference pixels are located by combining spatial and temporal information inherent to the time-series. Subsequently, the model is evaluated for different input sets to determine the optimal configuration for global processing and pixel coverage types. The performance of resulting water fraction estimates is evaluated on the pixel level in 32 regions of interest across the globe, by comparison to higher resolution reference data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8). Results show that water fraction information is able to improve the product’s performance regarding mixed water/non-water pixels by an average of 11.6% (RMSE). With a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.61, the model shows good overall performance. The approach enables the systematic provision of water fraction estimates on a global and daily scale, using only the reflectance and temporal information contained in the input time-series.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aprobability 3areflectance 3asurface water 3atime series analysis1 aKlein, Igor 1 aRutzinger, Martin 1 aKuenzer, Claudia 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 July 07, v. 13, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131426753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245012900203300001400332500001100346506007600357520180100433592002802234596006902262506003702331650001502368650001202383650001802395650002202413650001602435650001502451650001002466650003002476650001402506650001502520650002302535650002102558650001102579650000902590650002002599650001302619700001302632700001802645700001802663700001902681700001602700700001502716700005102731773010702782856008202889852000902971655001202980IND60590892120221207125108.0210707e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059089212DNAL7 a294291262pmid7 aPMC61913112pmcid7 a10.1007/s00335-018-9736-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Liang,10aIndividual susceptibility to arsenic-induced diseases: the role of host genetics, nutritional status, and the gut microbiome  ap. 63-79.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArsenic (As) contamination in water or food is a global issue affecting hundreds of millions of people. Although As is classified as a group 1 carcinogen and is associated with multiple diseases, the individual susceptibility to As-related diseases is highly variable, such that a proportion of people exposed to As have higher risks of developing related disorders. Many factors have been found to be associated with As susceptibility. One of the main sources of the variability found in As susceptibility is the variation in the host genome, namely, polymorphisms of many genes involved in As transportation, biotransformation, oxidative stress response, and DNA repair affect the susceptibility of an individual to As toxicity and then influence the disease outcomes. In addition, lifestyles and many nutritional factors, such as folate, vitamin C, and fruit, have been found to be associated with individual susceptibility to As-related diseases. Recently, the interactions between As exposure and the gut microbiome have been of particular concern. As exposure has been shown to perturb gut microbiome composition, and the gut microbiota has been shown to also influence As metabolism, which raises the question of whether the highly diverse gut microbiota contributes to As susceptibility. Here, we review the literature and summarize the factors, such as host genetics and nutritional status, that influence As susceptibility, and we also present potential mechanisms of how the gut microbiome may influence As metabolism and its toxic effects on the host to induce variations in As susceptibility. Challenges and future directions are also discussed to emphasize the importance of characterizing the specific role of these factors in interindividual susceptibility to As-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01ES024950cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aarsenic 3aascorbic acid 3abiotransformation 3acarcinogens 3afolic acid 3agenes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alifestyle 3ametabolism 3anutritional status 3aoxidative stress 3apeople 3arisk 3astress response 3atoxicity1 aGao, Bei1 aTu, Pengcheng1 aLiu, Chih-Wei1 aXue, Jingchuan1 aLai, Yunjia1 aRu, Hongyu1 aLu, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8125-23940 tMammalian genome.g2018 Feb., v. 29, no. 1-2 p.63-79dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870068x0938-89907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-018-9736-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011300182300001600295520094500311592002801256650002301284650001901307650002201326650001401348650001801362650001101380650001101391650002001402650001401422650001501436653001101451653003701462653001101499653001301510700003201523700002701555700003101582773012101613856008501734852000901819655001201828IND60519031020221121221058.0160420e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903102DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2016.11416192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Aguilar, Eduardo10aDevelopment of energy efficient mixing strategies in egg-shaped anaerobic reactors through 3D CFD simulation  ap. 536-543.  aThis work describes a 3D computational fluid dynamic model, which characterizes the hydrodynamic behavior of a mixing strategy applied to egg-shaped reactors that lack a mechanical stirring device. The model is based on Navier-Stokes and material balance equations without a chemical reaction. To describe the behavior of mixing, initial water feed flows of 6, 7.5 and 9 mL s ⁻¹ were used. An experimental validation was subsequently carried out using a pulse technique, with NaCl as a tracer. The residence time distributions were quantitatively determined. Then, the degradation process of the wastewater sludge was characterized by studying the time dependence of the dynamic viscosity, the concentration of volatile solids and the density of wastewater sludge. The data resulting were introduced into the validated model, and five feed flows from 9 to 13 mL s ⁻¹, the best performance found was with feed flow of 11 mL s ⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3adynamic models 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3amixing 3asludge 3asodium chloride 3aviscosity 3awastewater 0a3D CFD 0aegg-shaped reactor hydrodynamics 0amixing 0arheology1 aAlvarado-Lassman, Alejandro1 aOsorio-Mirón, Anselmo1 aMéndez-Contreras, Juan M.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 June 6, v. 51, no. 7 p.536-543dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2016.11416193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012000171300001400291520152500305592002801830650001201858650003101870650002601901650001801927650003001945650001201975650001701987650001602004650001202020650001502032650002102047650001802068650002102086650002802107650002502135650001402160650003402174650001502208650002502223651002002248653001002268653000902278653000802287653000702295653000802302653000802310653000802318653001002326653000802336653000802344653000902352653000902361653000902370653000802379653000702387653000702394653000802401653001102409653000802420653000802428653000802436653002202444653001802466653002002484653001902504653001602523653001502539700002302554700002502577773012802602856008102730852000902811655001202820IND60600529120221120075350.0180703e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060052912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasondo, Nqobile A.10aPharmacological potential and conservation prospect of the genus Eucomis (Hyacinthaceae) endemic to southern Africa  ap. 44-53.  aThe genus Eucomis (Hyacinthaceae) consists of 10 species that are extensively used in African traditional medicine. This review is an appraisal of current information on the distribution and morphology, traditional uses, pharmacology, toxicology and approaches devised to enhance the conservation of the genus.A systematic and comprehensive literature search using electronic searches such as Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science and ethnobotanical books was conducted.Evidence from traditional medicine usage shows wide utilization of this genus for ailments such as respiratory, venereal diseases, rheumatism as well as kidney and bladder infections. Pharmacological screening reported antimicrobial, antiplasmodial, antitumor, cytotoxic, phytotoxic and anti-inflammatory properties.The potential of the genus Eucomis especially in terms of pharmacology cannot be overemphasized. Apart from the anti-inflammatory properties, the antifungal activity of Eucomis remains a valuable reservoir with potential application in the agriculture sector as a source of an affordable biocontrol agent. Based on the speculated toxic constituents in the genus Eucomis, it will be valuable to conduct detailed toxicological studies. Extensive utilization of members of the genus Eucomis is causing severe strain on wild populations. Although conventional propagation has been relatively effective in the alleviation of the declining status, micropropagation of members may be vital to guarantee the conservation of wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucomis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantifungal properties 3aantimalarials 3abiological control agents 3abladder 3acytotoxicity 3aethnobotany 3akidneys 3aliterature 3amicropropagation 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant morphology 3apopulation distribution 3arheumatoid arthritis 3ascreening 3asexually transmitted diseases 3atoxicology 3atraditional medicine 3aSouthern Africa 0a2,4-D 0a2-iP 0aABA 0aBA 0aCOX 0aDCM 0aGA3 0aGA4+7 0aIAA 0aIBA 0aIUCN 0aMeJa 0aMeOH 0aMIC 0aMS 0amT 0aNAA 0aNSAIDs 0aPAA 0aPBZ 0aTPA 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aAntimicrobial 0aMedicinal plant 0aPineapple lily 0aPropagation 0aToxicology1 aFinnie, Jeffrey F.1 aVan Staden, Johannes0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.44-53dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01639naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011600162300001800278500001900296520045900315592002800774650003200802650001200834650001900846650001900865700001900884700001900903700002100922700002400943700001900967700003000986700001601016700001801032773013201050856007401182852000901256655001201265IND60736690320221120091338.0210510e20210506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669032DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc00819f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavascuez, Marcos10aInterfacial activity of modified dextran polysaccharide to produce enzyme-responsive oil-in-water nanoemulsions  ap. 4540-4543.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we report the evaluation of dextran (DXT) derivatives bearing hydrophobic or hydrophilic functional groups as stabilisers of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions.

Two new varieties are distinguished within F. virens, var. dispersa and var. matthewii. Ficus lecardii and L. salicifolia, formerly subspecies of F. cordata, are again reinstated to the species level. Typical characters for the subsection are monoecy, monostaminate flowers, red(-brown) colored ovaries and cystoliths on only the abaxial leaf surface. Ficus amplissima and F. rumphii (section Leucogyne) were formerly part of subsection Urostigma, and they have been added here to the key and descriptions because of their morphological resemblance with the species in F. subsection Urostigma. Molecular based phylogenetic analyses showed that at least F. rumphii is unrelated to subsection Urostigma. The two species only differ from subsect. Urostigma in their whitish ovaries and cystoliths at both sides of the leaf blade and they are pollinated by a different group of wasps, species of Eupristina subg.

This study was designed to isolate the bioactive constituents from the seed extracts of Raphanus sativus and evaluate their anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.Bioassay-guided fractionation and chemical investigation of a methanolic extract of the seeds of Raphanus sativus led to the isolation and identification of seven 4-methylthio-butanyl derivatives. Structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was carried out using 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques (¹H, ¹³C, COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments) and mass spectrometry.The isolated compounds were characterized as in the following: three new 4-methylthio-butanyl derivatives, sinapoyl desulfoglucoraphenin (1), (E)-5-(methylsulfinyl)pent-4-enoxylimidic acid methyl ester (2), and (S)-5-((methylsulfinyl)methyl)pyrrolidine-2-thione (3), together with four known compounds, 5-(methylsulfinyl)-4-pentenenitrile (4), 5-(methylsulfinyl)-pentanenitrile (5), sulforaphene (6), and sulforaphane (7). Full NMR data assignments of the three known compounds 4–6 were also reported for the first time. We evaluated the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of 1–7 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine microglia BV2 cells. Compound 1 significantly inhibited nitrite oxide production with IC50 values of 45.36μM. Moreover, it also reduced the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. All isolates were also evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against four human tumor cell lines (A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, and HCT-15), and all of them showed antiproliferative activity against the HCT-15 cell, with IC50 values of 8.49–23.97μM.4-Methylthio-butanyl derivatives were one of the main compositions of Raphanus sativus seeds, and activities demonstrated by the isolated compounds support the ethnopharmacological use of Raphanus sativus seeds (Brassicaceae) as anti-cancer and/or anti-inflammatory agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaphanus sativus 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantineoplastic activity 3acarbon 3afractionation 3ahuman cell lines 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aneuroglia 3anitrites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein synthesis 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 3astable isotopes 3asulforaphane 3atraditional medicine 0aNMR 0aSRB 0aNO 0aLPS 0aIR 0aUV 0aHR 0aESI 0aMS 0aCOSY 0aHMQC 0aHMBC 0aHPLC 0aRP 0aLPLC 0aTLC 0aCC 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aNCI 0aMTT 0aL-NMMA 0aNOS 0aSDS-PAGE 0aiNOS 0aHRP 0aECL 0aRaphanus sativus 0aBrassicaceae 0a4-Methylthio-butanyl derivatives 0aAnti-inflammation 0aNitric oxide 0aCytotoxicity 0aSulforaphene (PubChem CID: 6433206) 0aSulforaphane (PubChem CID: 5350) 0aNG-monomethyl-L-arginine (PubChem CID: 135242) 0aDoxorubicin (PubChem CID: 31703)1 aMoon, Eunjung1 aKim, Sun Yeou1 aChoi, Sang Un1 aLee, Jei Hyun1 aLee, Kang Ro0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.503-508dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007400168300002000242520144100262592002801703650001501731650002201746650002201768650001701790650001401807650001001821650001901831650001901850650001901869650002101888650002101909700002201930773011101952856008502063852000902148655001202157IND60580204320221120160941.0170913e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058020432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosaka, Yoshio10aGeneration and Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species in Photocatalysis  ap. 11302-11336.  aThe detection methods and generation mechanisms of the intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., superoxide anion radical (•O₂–), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), singlet oxygen (¹O₂), and hydroxyl radical (•OH) in photocatalysis, were surveyed comprehensively. Consequently, the major photocatalyst used in heterogeneous photocatalytic systems was found to be TiO₂. However, besides TiO₂ some representative photocatalysts were also involved in the discussion. Among the various issues we focused on the detection methods and generation reactions of ROS in the aqueous suspensions of photocatalysts. On the careful account of the experimental results presented so far, we proposed the following apprehension: adsorbed •OH could be regarded as trapped holes, which are involved in a rapid adsorption–desorption equilibrium at the TiO₂–solution interface. Because the equilibrium shifts to the adsorption side, trapped holes must be actually the dominant oxidation species whereas •OH in solution would exert the reactivity mainly for nonadsorbed reactants. The most probable routes of generating intrinsic ROS at the surfaces of two polymorphs of TiO₂, anatase and rutile, were discussed along with some plausible rational reaction processes. In addition to the four major ROS, three ROS, that is organic peroxides, ozone, and nitric oxide, which are less common in photocatalysis are also briefly reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aozone 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asinglet oxygen 3asuperoxide anion 3atitanium dioxide1 aNosaka, Atsuko Y.0 tChemical Reviews.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 117, no. 17 p.11302-11336dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.7b001613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012300170300001600293520102400309592002801333650001401361650001101375650001501386650001701401650002001418650002001438650001401458650001901472653001301491653001701504653001501521653001901536653002301555653002901578700002201607773011401629856008201743852000901825655001201834IND60130204920221122040710.0151127e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013020492DNAL7 a10.1600/036364413X6702502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillespie, Emily L.10aMolecular Phylogenetic Relationships and Morphological Evolution within the Tribe Phyllodoceae (Ericoideae, Ericaceae)  ap. 752-763.  aThe tribe Phyllodoceae is comprised of seven genera (Bejaria, Elliottia, Epigaea, Kalmia, Kalmiopsis, Phyllodoce, and Rhodothamnus). A clade within this tribe, comprised of all genera except Bejaria, was the subject of a phylogenetic study using six molecular markers. The goal of the study was to reconstruct a species-level phylogeny for the purpose of examining the evolution of morphological characters and to provide a framework for future studies in historical biogeography. Twenty-nine of 31 Phyllodoceae species were included in the molecular dataset of sequences from four plastid and two nuclear regions, and the remaining two species were included in a small morphological analysis. Most nodes were strongly supported using combined molecular data and four analytical approaches. Potential morphological synapomorphies were identified for some clades within the group. Evolutionary patterns in some morphological characters are apparent, which provide a basis for future anatomical and developmental studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElliottia 3aKalmia 3aPhyllodoce 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3agenetic markers 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 0aBayesian 0abiogeography 0alikelihood 0amolecular data 0amorphological data 0aphylogeny reconstruction1 aKron, Kathleen A.0 tSystematic botany.g2013 Oct., v. 38, no. 3 p.752-763dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600%2F036364413X6702503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245008700134300001600221520123600237592002801473653001901501653002301520653003001543653001701573773011201590852000901702655001201711IND60125286020221120174308.0151103e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012528602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGILLIAM, FRANK S.14aThe Ecological Significance of the Herbaceous Layer in Temperate Forest Ecosystems  ap. 845-858.  aDespite a growing awareness that the herbaceous layer serves a special role in maintaining the structure and function of forests, this stratum remains an underappreciated aspect of forest ecosystems. In this article I review and synthesize information concerning the herb layer's structure, composition, and dynamics to emphasize its role as an integral component of forest ecosystems. Because species diversity is highest in the herb layer among all forest strata, forest biodiversity is largely a function of the herb-layer community. Competitive interactions within the herb layer can determine the initial success of plants occupying higher strata, including the regeneration of dominant overstory tree species. Furthermore, the herb layer and the overstory can become linked through parallel responses to similar environmental gradients. These relationships between strata vary both spatially and temporally. Because the herb layer responds sensitively to disturbance across broad spatial and temporal scales, its dynamics can provide important information regarding the site characteristics of forests, including patterns of past land-use practices. Thus, the herb layer has a significance that belies its diminutive stature.  aPublisher supplied data 0aforest ecology 0avegetation science 0aherbaceous-layer dynamics 0abiodiversity0 tBioScience.g2007 Nov., v. 57, no. 10 p.845-858dAmerican Institute of Biological Sciencesx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018000168300001600348520185900364592002802223650001702251650002502268650001102293650002002304650001902324650002302343650001702366650002202383650001802405650001102423650001602434650002602450650002202476650002402498650002302522650001602545650002502561651001002586651001402596653002802610653001702638653001902655653002202674653001602696653002202712700002102734700001902755700001802774700002002792700002302812700001902835700001702854773013002871856008103001852000903082655001203091IND60600529320221120075253.0180703e20140203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060052932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNapagoda, Mayuri10aInhibition of 5-lipoxygenase as anti-inflammatory mode of action of Plectranthus zeylanicus Benth and chemical characterization of ingredients by a mass spectrometric approach  ap. 800-809.  aThe perennial herb Plectranthus zeylanicus Benth is extensively used in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka and South India for treating inflammatory conditions, but pharmacological features of Plectranthus zeylanicus are hardly explored in order to understand and rationalize its use in ethnomedicine. As 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is a key enzyme in inflammatory disorders such as asthma or atherosclerosis, we investigated 5-LO inhibition by Plectranthus zeylanicus extracts and analyzed relevant constituents.We applied cell-free and cell-based assays to investigate suppression of 5-LO activity. Cell viability, radical scavenger activities, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation (ROS) in neutrophils were analysed to exclude unspecific cytotoxic or antioxidant effects. Constituents of the extracts were characterized by bioassay-guided fractionation and by analysis using gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric (Orbitrap) analysis.Extracts of Plectranthus zeylanicus prepared with n-hexane or dichloromethane potently suppressed 5-LO activity in stimulated human neutrophils (IC50=6.6 and 12µg/ml, respectively) and inhibited isolated human recombinant 5-LO (IC50=0.7 and 1.2µg/ml, respectively). In contrast, no significant radical scavenging activity or suppression of ROS formation was observed, and neutrophil viability was unaffected. Besides ubiquitously occurring ingredients, coleone P, cinncassiol A and C, and callistric acid were identified as constituents in the most active fraction.Together, potent inhibition of 5-LO activity, without concomitant anti-oxidant activity and cytotoxic effects, rationalizes the ethnopharmacological use of Plectranthus zeylanicus as anti-inflammatory remedy. Modern chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis reveals discrete chemical structures of relevant constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlectranthus 3aantioxidant activity 3aasthma 3aatherosclerosis 3acell viability 3achemical structure 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme inhibition 3afractionation 3ahexane 3aingredients 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amethylene chloride 3aneutrophils 3atraditional medicine 3aIndia 3aSri Lanka 0aPlectranthus zeylanicus 0aInflammation 0a5-Lipoxygenase 0aRadical scavenger 0aNeutrophils 0aMass spectrometry1 aGerstmeier, Jana1 aWesely, Sandra1 aPopella, Sven1 aLorenz, Sybille1 aScheubert, Kerstin1 aSvatoš, Aleš1 aWerz, Oliver0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Feb. 03, v. 151, no. 2 p.800-809dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009400157520179800251592002802049650002002077650005202097650001502149650001602164650001102180650002002191650002502211650001502236650000902251650001602260650002202276650001402298650001502312650000902327650001502336700002202351700001802373700002602391700003002417700002402447700001902471700002002490773012902510856007402639852000902713655001202722IND60745604220221119054312.0210723e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074560422DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131426772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachs, Liam 10aFine-Tuning Heat Stress Algorithms to Optimise Global Predictions of Mass Coral Bleaching  aIncreasingly intense marine heatwaves threaten the persistence of many marine ecosystems. Heat stress-mediated episodes of mass coral bleaching have led to catastrophic coral mortality globally. Remotely monitoring and forecasting such biotic responses to heat stress is key for effective marine ecosystem management. The Degree Heating Week (DHW) metric, designed to monitor coral bleaching risk, reflects the duration and intensity of heat stress events and is computed by accumulating SST anomalies (HotSpot) relative to a stress threshold over a 12-week moving window. Despite significant improvements in the underlying SST datasets, corresponding revisions of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window are still lacking. Here, we fine-tune the operational DHW algorithm to optimise coral bleaching predictions using the 5 km satellite-based SSTs (CoralTemp v3.1) and a global coral bleaching dataset (37,871 observations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). After developing 234 test DHW algorithms with different combinations of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window, we compared their bleaching prediction ability using spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models and sensitivity–specificity analyses. Peak DHW performance was reached using HotSpot thresholds less than or equal to the maximum of monthly means SST climatology (MMM) and accumulation windows of 4–8 weeks. This new configuration correctly predicted up to an additional 310 bleaching observations globally compared to the operational DHW algorithm, an improved hit rate of 7.9%. Given the detrimental impacts of marine heatwaves across ecosystems, heat stress algorithms could also be fine-tuned for other biological systems, improving scientific accuracy, and enabling ecosystem governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aalgorithms 3aclimatology 3acorals 3adata collection 3aecosystem management 3agovernance 3aheat 3aheat stress 3amarine ecosystems 3amortality 3aprediction 3arisk 3asatellites1 aBythell, John C.,1 aEast, Holly K1 aEdwards, Alasdair J.,1 aMumby, P.

The hole current injection of the device was improved and the performance of the blue OLED was enhanced. We have observed that the insertion of such double layer leads to a striking improvement in chromaticity and electrical characteristics. This device showed much better chromaticity and less current-induced color shift as compared to the corresponding single hole injection layer counterparts. Using this strategy, a striking improvement in the electrical properties with lower driving voltage, higher power efficiency and a weak current-induced fluorescence quenching was achieved. This could be explained by the fact that an interlayer of Ag₂O//MoOₓ provided a stepped energy level which greatly facilitated hole injection and hence enhanced injection current. The result is verified by using the J–V curves of ‘only’ devices and further explained with the help of Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aelectrical properties 3aenergy 3afluorescence1 aZhou, Fan1 aZhang, Xiao-Wen1 aYu, Dong-Bin1 aLi, Jun1 aZhang, Liang1 aJiang, Xue-Yin1 aZhang, Zhi-Lin0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.853-859dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245004800153300001600201520159000217592002801807650002101835650002301856650002401879650001901903650001701922650001301939650002501952650004301977650002402020650001502044650003502059650001302094653001602107653001202123653001202135653002802147653000802175653001202183653000802195700001102203700001602214700001702230700001502247700001602262700001502278700001402293700001702307700005702324773011302381856007202494852000902566655001202575IND60744417920221120135519.0210713s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074441792DNAL7 a10.1071/CP210042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Maolin10aQTL mapping of lodging tolerance in soybean  ap. 426-433.  aLodging is an important agronomic trait that affects soybean seed yield.

Among these QTL, qldg-1 was stable for 3 years and qldg-2 was stable for 2 years. QTL by environment interactions (QEI) mapping was also used to detect QTL. A total of 14 QTL were detected, which could explain 2.62–11.28% of the phenotypic variation. The constructed residual heterozygous lines (RHL) were used for the verification of qldg-1 and qldg-2, and the results showed that these two QTL could significantly improve lodging resistance. In addition, genes in the confidence interval of qldg-1 and qldg-2 were designed to predict the candidates. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verification of five genes revealed that two genes (Glyma.17G048100 and Glyma.09G239000) were expressed differentially during the dynamic stages between the parents, demonstrating that these two were the candidates associated with soybean lodging. The QTL and candidate genes related to soybean lodging identified in this study will be of great significance to the future soybean molecular-assisted breeding for lodging resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3achromosome mapping 3aconfidence interval 3aheterozygosity 3ainbred lines 3apastures 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative traits 3aseed yield 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 0aGlycine max 0asoybean 0alodging 0aquantitative trait loci 0aQTL 0aqRT-PCR 0aSNP1 aLi, Na1 aYu, Kuanwei1 aZhan, Yuhang1 aYuan, Ming1 aTeng, Weili1 aLi, Wenbin1 aZhao, Xue1 aXiao, Jialei1 aHan, Yingpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9829-65880 tCrop & pasture science.g2021, v. 72, no. 6 p.426-433dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl4206942x1836-09477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP210043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009800167300001400265520113700279592002801416650001401444650001801458650002201476650001601498651001001514700001501524700002601539700001901565773007601584856008301660852000901743655001201752IND60096892020221118013258.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009689202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Shiyan10aBiofuels development in China: Technology options and policies needed to meet the 2020 target  ap. 64-79.  aChina promulgated the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in 2007, which included sub-targets of 2010 and 2020 for various renewable energy technologies. Almost all the 2010 sub-targets have been met and even surpassed except non-grain fuel ethanol. There is debate surrounding the questions of whether and how the country will be able to meet the 2020 biofuels target. This paper provides the assessment of potential technology pathways to achieve the 2020 target regarding their respective resource potential and supply cost. Barriers and policy options are identified based on broad literatures review. And an overview of biofuels projections is presented to provide insight into the comparison of various policy scenarios. The study shows that China can potentially satisfy non-grain fuel ethanol target by 2020 from technology perspective. But she will probably fall far short of this target if current situations continue. Additional policy efforts are needed. Meanwhile, the target of biodiesel production has high probability to be achieved. However, if given support policies, it will develop better.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3aethanol fuels 3aissues and policy 3aprobability 3aChina1 aZhao, Lili1 aTimilsina, Govinda R.1 aZhang, Xiliang0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Dec., v. 51 p.64-79dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01605naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008400162300001600246520075200262592002801014650001201042650001301054650001201067650001101079700001701090773009501107856008101202990002301283852000901306655001201315IND60096351020221121145630.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoy, S.H.10aNonlinear behavior of BNT-based lead-free piezoceramics under various ac fields  ap. 869-877.  aIn this study, two different bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, BNKBT-5 and BNKLBT-1.5, were fabricated and their nonlinear piezoelectric behaviour were compared.

One of the most important and emergent classes of multidrug-resistant bacteria is extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-positive = ESBL⁺). Due to widespread and continuous evolution of ESBL-producing bacteria, they become increasingly resistant to many of the commonly used antibiotics, leading to an increase in the mortality associated with resulting infections. Timely detection of ESBL-producing bacteria and rapid determination of their susceptibility to appropriate antibiotics can reduce the spread of these bacteria and the consequent complications. Routine methods used for the detection of ESBL-producing bacteria are time-consuming, requiring at least 48 h to obtain results. In this study, we evaluated the potential of infrared spectroscopic microscopy, combined with multivariate analysis for rapid detection of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from urinary-tract infection (UTI) samples. Our measurements were conducted on 837 samples of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), including 268 ESBL⁺ and 569 ESBL-negative (ESBL–) samples. All samples were obtained from bacterial colonies after 24 h culture (first culture) from midstream patients’ urine. Our results revealed that it is possible to detect ESBL-producing bacteria, with a 97% success rate, 99% sensitivity, and 94% specificity for the tested samples, in a time span of few minutes following the first culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aantibiotics 3abeta-lactamase bacteria 3aevolution 3amicroscopy 3amortality 3amultiple drug resistance 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3arapid methods 3aspectroscopy 3aurinary tract 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli1 aRodriguez-Diaz, Eladio1 aSagi, Orli1 aRiesenberg, Klaris1 aLapidot, Itshak1 aSegal, Yoram1 aBigio, Irving J.1 aHuleihel, Mahmoud1 aSalman, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4953-86480 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 91, no. 3 p.2525-2530dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b054973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005500165300001400220500001900234520193200253592002802185650001402213650002002227650001202247651001602259651001202275651001102287651001202298651001002310651001802320651001102338651001302349651001602362653001102378653001702389653002102406653001002427653001302437700001902450700001502469700002002484700002302504700002302527700002302550773009402573856008202667852000902749655001202758IND60697381620221117191830.0210303e20180312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069738162DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.31.235682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNimis, P. L.,14aThe lichens of the Alps – an annotated checklist  ap. 1-634.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis is the first attempt to provide an overview of the lichen diversity of the Alps, one of the biogegraphically most important and emblematic mountain systems worldwide. The checklist includes all lichenised species, plus a set of non- or doubtfully lichenised taxa frequently treated by lichenologists, excluding non-lichenised lichenicolous fungi. Largely based on recent national or regional checklists, it provides a list of all infrageneric taxa (with synonyms) hitherto reported from the Alps, with data on their distribution in eight countries (Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland) and in 42 Operational Geographic Units, mostly corresponding to administrative subdivisions within the countries. Data on the main substrates and on the altitudinal distribution are also provided. A short note points to the main ecological requirements of each taxon and/or to open taxonomic problems. Particularly poorly known taxa are flagged and often provided with a short description, to attract the attention of specialists. The total number of infrageneric taxa is 3,163, including 117 non- or doubtfully lichenised taxa. The richness of the lichen biota fairly well corresponds with the percent of the Alpine area occupied by each country: Austria (2,337 taxa), Italy (2,169), France (2,028), Switzerland (1,835), Germany (1,168), Slovenia (890) and Lichtenstein (152), no lichen having ever been reported from Monaco. The number of poorly known taxa is quite high (604, 19.1% of the total), which indicates that, in spite of the Alps being one of the lichenologically most studied mountain systems worldwide, much work is still needed to reach a satisfactory picture of their real lichen diversity. Thirteen new combinations are proposed in the genera Agonimia, Aspicilia, Bagliettoa, Bellemerea, Carbonea, Lepra, Miriquidica, Polysporina, Protothelenella, Pseudosagedia and Thelidium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspicilia 3aProtothelenella 3alichens 3aAlps region 3aAustria 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aLiechtenstein 3aMonaco 3aSlovenia 3aSwitzerland 0aEurope 0abiodiversity 0alichenised fungi 0afungi 0ataxonomy1 aHafellner, J.,1 aRoux, Cl.,1 aClerc, Philippe1 aHelmut Mayrhofer, 1 aMartellos, Stefano1 aBilovitz, Peter O.0 tMycoKeys.g2018 Mar. 12, v. 31 p.1-634dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.31.235683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245020200202300001800404520138600422592002801808650001901836650001901855650001501874650002801889650001201917650001801929650002101947650002001968650001601988650002202004700005202026700005202078700005402130700005302184773012102237856008202358852000902440655001202449IND60588914320221119214046.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058891432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1944-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Gangwei1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3500-084710aPolylactide fibers with enhanced hydrolytic and thermal stability via complete stereo-complexation of poly(L-lactide) with high molecular weight of 600000 and lower-molecular-weight poly(D-lactide)  ap. 5490-5500.  aOne-hundred percent stereo-complexation in poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)/poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) fibers with non-equivalent molecular weights could be achieved via thermal treatment. Stereo-complexed polylactide (sc-PLA) fibers exhibited excellent hydrolysis resistance and thermal resistance. Till now, preparation of sc-PLA fibers with satisfactory qualities required both PLLA and PDLA with equivalently high molecular weights. Moreover, the high-molecular-weight PDLAs are expensive, restricting industrial-scale production and applications of sc-PLA products. In this study, equal-weight mixtures of low-molecular-weight PDLA (L-PDLA) and high-molecular-weight PLLA (H-PLLA) were melt spun into sc-PLA fibers and then completely stereo-complexed via thermal treatment. The hydrolysis resistance of L3/D1 fibers [PLLA (Mᵥ = 3.0 × 10⁵)/PDLA (Mᵥ = 1.0 × 10⁵)] was similar to that of L3/D3 fibers [PLLA (Mᵥ = 3.0 × 10⁵)/PDLA (Mᵥ = 3.2 × 10⁵)], but much higher than that of L3 fibers [PLLA (Mᵥ = 3.0 × 10⁵)]. Melting temperature and softening temperature of L3/D1 fibers (223 and 126 °C) were also similar to those of L3/D3 fibers (224 and 131 °C), but higher than that of L3 fibers (172 and 72 °C). Utilizing H-PLLA and L-PDLA to prepare sc-PLA fibers with excellent performance is conducive to the wide industrial application of sc-PLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrial applications 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3apolylactic acid 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aXu, Helan1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5354-70911 aMa, Bomou1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3620-02101 aWizi, Jakpa1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3002-69251 aYang, Yiqi1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8153-41590 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Apr., v. 53, no. 7 p.5490-5500dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1944-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009800170300001600268520168900284592002801973650002302001650002002024650003002044650001402074650002402088650001402112650001302126650001702139650001102156650001802167650001102185650001302196650001902209650003102228650000902259653000902268653000902277653000802286653000902294653002002303653001102323653001402334653002302348653001402371700003002385700002702415700002702442700002602469773013002495856008102625852000902706655001202715IND60600529720221120085229.0180703e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060052972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKongkeaw, Chuenjid10aMeta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on cognitive effects of Bacopa monnieri extract  ap. 528-535.  aBacopa monnieri has a long history in Ayurvedic medicine for neurological and behavioral defects.

The reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed. Randomized, placebo controlled human intervention trials on chronic ≥12 weeks dosing of standardized extracts of Bacopa monnieri without any co-medication were included in this study. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias assessment and Jadad's quality scales. The weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were performed using the random-effects model of the Dersimonian–Laird method.Nine studies met the inclusion criteria using 518 subjects. Overall quality of all included trials was low risk of bias and quality of reported information was high. Meta-analysis of 437 eligible subjects showed improved cognition by shortened Trail B test (−17.9ms; 95% CI −24.6 to −11.2; p<0.001) and decreased choice reaction time (10.6ms; 95% CI −12.1 to −9.2; p<0.001).This meta-analysis suggests that Bacopa monnieri has the potential to improve cognition, particularly speed of attention but only a large well designed ‘head-to-head’ trial against an existing medication will provide definitive data on its efficacy on healthy or dementia patients using a standardized preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aBacopa monnieri 3aWorld Health Organization 3acognition 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adementia 3adrug therapy 3amemory 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apatients 3aplant extracts 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 0aAVLT 0aADHD 0aMCI 0aMMSE 0aBacopa monnieri 0aBrahmi 0aCognition 0aSpeed of attention 0aNootropic1 aDilokthornsakul, Piyameth1 aThanarangsarit, Phurit1 aLimpeanchob, Nanteetip1 aNorman Scholfield, C.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 151, no. 1 p.528-535dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011500159300001600274520148800290592002801778650001701806650001401823650001401837650002601851650001401877650001901891650001401910653001901924653001701943653003001960653002101990653002402011653002002035700002502055700002902080700002202109700001902131700002202150773013202172856008002304852000902384655001202393IND60130205420221122030934.0151127e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013020542DNAL7 a10.1600/036364413X6703042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ying10aEvidence for Rampant Homoplasy in the Phylogeny of the Epiphyllous Liverwort Genus Cololejeunea (Lejeuneaceae)  ap. 553-563.  aRampant homoplasy can be a major challenge in the classification of land plants that have limited morphological differences and/or ecological diversity, such as liverworts and mosses. Here we present the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the derived liverwort genus Cololejeunea and its close relatives. We used three markers (trnL—F, rbcL, and nrITS) and 116 accessions representing the geographic range as well as the morphological diversity of this predominantly epiphyllous genus. The molecular data support three major lineages: Colura, Myriocoleopsis, and Cololejeunea. Myriocoleopsis species were resolved in a clade with Cololejeunea minutissima. Aphanolejeunea and Chondriolejeunea were both resolved as putative monophyletic groups, and nested in the Cololejeunea clade. Cololejeunea angustiflora was found to be sister to the clade comprising the remaining Cololejeunea species. Currently accepted subgenera of Cololejeunea were paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Six out of 30 species with multiple accessions were not supported as natural taxa. The current classifications of Cololejeunea have been influenced by frequent homoplasy of morphological characters and do not accurately reflect species relationships. A new classification for this genus is outlined. Our data did not provide evidence for ancient vicariance events where major clades and continents are associated, instead some evidence was recovered for recent intercontinental species range expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryophytes 3aepiphytes 3amonophyly 3amosses and liverworts 3aparaphyly 3aplant taxonomy 3apolyphyly 0aAphanolejeunea 0abiogeography 0achloroplast sequence data 0aChondriolejeunea 0amolecular phylogeny 0aMyriocoleopsis.1 aPócs, T.q(Tamás),1 aSchäfer-Verwimp, Alfons1 aHeinrichs, Jochen1 aZhu, Rui-Liang1 aSchneider, Harald0 tSystematic botany.g2013 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.553-563dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364413X6703043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008800180300001600268520140000284650001501684650001201699650002401711650001401735650001501749650002401764650001901788650001001807650002201817650001201839650002101851650001401872650002701886650002201913651002201935651001001957653001101967653001201978653002101990653002602011700002302037700002202060700001602082773011402098852000902212856006902221930003302290946001102323655001202334IND4387946820221120210827.0070218e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438794682DNAL7 a171199072pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-006-0185-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoulay, R. 10aGeographic variations in seed dispersal by ants: are plant and seed traits decisive  ap. 242-246.  aThe effect of local ant species on the dispersal success of a myrmecochorous plant, Helleborus foetidus, was analyzed in two populations of the Iberian Peninsula (Caurel and Cazorla, respectively). The contribution of the various local ant species to dispersal was very unequal. While 5 and 19 ant taxa visited the plants of Caurel and Cazorla, respectively, most removal activity (67 and 80%) was performed by two species only (Formica lugubris and Camponotus cruentatus, respectively). Visits by dispersers were also unequally distributed between neighboring plants. While some plants were always visited during the period of seed release, others were never visited. A regression model indicated that this pattern might be explained by two plant traits: ants preferred to visit plants that released more seeds and whose elaiosomes were richer in oleic acid. Although it has long been known that this compound triggers removal by ants, it is the first demonstration that quantitative variations in elaiosome traits contribute to variation in dispersal success. Finally, other variables being equal, morphological traits (seed size, elaiosome size, and elaiosome/seed size ratio) did not affect ant behavior. Although myrmecochory has long been considered a diffuse interaction, our results support the idea that, at local scale, a limited number of ant species may be decisive to its evolution. 3aCamponotus 3aFormica 3aHelleborus foetidus 3aevolution 3aoleic acid 3aregression analysis 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3aspecies dispersal 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aHelleborusxphysiology 2aSeedsxphysiology 3aIberian Peninsula 0aSpain 0aCaurel 0aCazorla 0aFormica lugubris 0aCamponotus cruentatus1 aColl-Toledano, J. 1 aManzaneda, A.

We studied this shift in reproductive strategy by comparing two Mystrium species from Madagascar using morphometry, allometry and dissections. Mystrium rogeri has a single dealate queen in each colony with a larger thorax than workers and similar mandibles that allow these queens to hunt during non-claustral foundation. In contrast, Mystrium 'red' lacks winged queens and half of the female adults belong to a wingless 'intermorph' caste smaller and allometrically distinct from the workers. Intermorphs have functional ovaries and spermatheca while those of workers are degenerate. Intermorphs care for brood and a few mate and reproduce making them an all-purpose caste that takes charge of both work and reproduction. However, their mandibles are reduced and inappropriate for hunting centipedes, unlike the workers' mandibles. This together with their small thorax disallow them to perform independent colony foundation, and colonies reproduce by fission. M. rogeri workers have mandibles polymorphic in size and shape, which allow for all tasks from brood care to hunting. In M. 'red', colonial investment in reproduction has shifted from producing expensive winged queens to more numerous helpers. M. 'red' intermorphs are the first case of reproductives smaller than workers in ants and illustrate their potential to diversify their caste system for better colonial economy. 3aChilopoda 3aFormicidae 3aadults 3aallometry 3abrood rearing 3afemales 3amorphometry 3areproduction 3areproductives 3aspermatheca 3athorax 2aAnimals 2aAntsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aNesting Behavior 2aOvaryxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSocial Behavior 2aWingxanatomy & histologyxphysiology 3aMadagascar 0aIntermorph 0aCaste1 aPeeters, Christian 1 aFisher, Brian L. 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2007 Apr., v. 94, no. 4 p.280-287dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-006-0190-23electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02575naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001400138245014400152300001800296520127600314650004401590650002301634650004401657650002301701650001901724650001301743650002001756650001401776650002201790650001401812700001701826700001701843700001501860700001501875700001801890700001601908773014101924852000902065856007802074946001302152655001202165IND4444418520221120210852.0101029e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444441852DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.243582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aSynthesis and nonlinear optical properties of polyacetylenes containing oxadiazole and thiophene pendant groups with high thermal stability  ap. 5498-5504.  aA series of random copolymers poly(3‐ethynylthiophene)‐copoly(2‐(4‐decyloxyphenyl)‐5‐(4‐ethynylphenyl)‐1,3,4‐oxadiazole) with different oxadiazole content (P2-P4) and homopolymer poly(3‐ethynylthiophene) (P1) as well as poly(2‐(4‐decyloxyphenyl)‐5‐(4‐ethynylphenyl)‐1,3,4‐oxadiazole) (P5) were prepared. The copolymers (P2-P4) are completely soluble in common organic solvents. The structures and properties of all polymers were characterized and evaluated by FTIR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, TGA, UV, PL, GPC, and nonlinear optical (NLO) analyses. The incorporation of diaryl‐oxadiazole into polyacetylene‐containing thiophene significantly endows copolymers with higher thermal stability, which may origin from the synergetic effect of the “jacket effect” of diaryl‐oxadiazole units and the effect of retarding or eliminating a few 6π‐electrocycliaztion proceeds of oxadiazole‐containing polyacetylene due to the hindrance of thiophene units. When the copolymer (P3) posses more regular alternating thiophene pendants and oxadiazole pendants arrangement along the polymer backbone, it shows good thermal stability (Td up to 388 °C) and larger third‐order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(3) up to 11.0 × 10⁻¹¹ esu). 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acomposite polymers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical properties 3apolyacetylenes 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3asynergism 3athermal stability 3athiophene1 aYan, Yongxin1 aLiu, Tianbao1 aSu, Xinyan1 aQian, Liwu1 aSong, Yinglin1 aXu, Hongyao0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 48, no. 23 p.5498-5504dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.243583Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01716naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245015100155300001600306500002400322500002300346500001500369520034600384650001600730650002800746650001800774650002600792650002400818650001000842650002000852650001600872650001400888650002200902650001800924653001000942653001000952773012700962852000901089856009101098930003301189945002501222946001101247655001201258IND4390279120221120210745.0070409e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439027912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL1001 aThacker, P.A.10aNutrient digestibility, performance and carcass traits of growing-finishing pigs fed diets containing dried wheat distiller's grains with solubles  ap. 527-529.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aSeventy-two pigs were fed graded levels of wheat distiller's grains with solubles (DDGS).

The addition of microbial phytase to field peas also reduced (P < 0.01) the excretion of P in the feces (from 5.77 to 4.09 g/5 d). 3aswine 3apeas 3aswine feeding 3afeeds 3adigestibility 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3adietary minerals 3aphytases 3afeed additives 3afeces1 aBoersma, M.G.1 aPedersen, C.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2006 Dec., v. 86, no. 4 p.523-525dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02506naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100003000138245016600168300001800334520135200352650001501704650001301719650001101732650002301743650001301766650001301779650001601792650002101808650001601829700002001845700001901865700001901884773014101903852000902044856007802053946001302131655001202144IND4444418720221120210748.0101029e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444441872DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.243602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamilavan, Vellaiappillai10aSynthesis of three new 1‐(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)‐2,5‐di(2‐thienyl) pyrrole‐based donor polymers and their bulk heterojunction solar cell applications  ap. 5514-5521.  aA series of three new 1‐(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)‐2,5‐di(2‐thienyl)pyrrole‐based polymers such as poly[1‐(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)‐2,5‐di(2‐thienyl)pyrrole] (PTPT), poly[1,4‐(2,5‐bis(octyloxy)phenylene)‐alt‐5,5'‐(1‐(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)‐2,5‐di(2‐thienyl)pyrrole)] (PPTPT), and poly[2,5‐(3‐octylthiophene)‐alt‐5,5'‐(1‐(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)‐2,5‐di(2‐thienyl)pyrrole)] (PTTPT) were synthesized and characterized. The new polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents and the thermogravimetric analysis showed that the three polymers are thermally stable with the 5% degradation temperature >379 °C. The absorption maxima of the polymers were 478, 483, and 485 nm in thin film and the optical band gaps calculated from the onset wavelength of the optical absorption were 2.15, 2.20, and 2.13 eV, respectively. Each of the polymers was investigated as an electron donor blending with PC₇₀BM as an electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. BHJ solar cells were fabricated in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC₇₀BM/TiOx/Al configurations. The BHJ solar cell with PPTPT:PC₇₀BM (1:5 wt %) showed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.35% (Jsc = 7.41 mA/cm², Voc = 0.56 V, FF = 33%), measured using AM 1.5G solar simulator at 100 mW/cm² light illumination. 3aabsorption 3alighting 3amixing 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awavelengths1 aSong, Myungkwan1 aJin, Sung‐Ho1 aHyun, Myung Ho0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 48, no. 23 p.5514-5521dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.243603Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02239naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245010100160300001800261520111400279650001201393650001701405650001401422650002301436650001501459650002101474650006601495650002401561650001301585650002601598700002401624773014101648852000901789856007801798946001301876655001201889IND4444418820221120210842.0101029e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444441882DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.243622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurzhals, Steffen10aTelechelic polynorbornenes with hydrogen bonding moieties by direct end capping of living chains  ap. 5522-5532.  aWe present two novel symmetric olefins bearing hydrogen bonding moieties for the direct capping of living ring opening metathesis polymerization‐chains using Grubbs catalyst 1st‐ and 3rd‐generation. The symmetric olefins are generated via homo metathesis of the corresponding α‐olefins under aid of microwave irradiation and are used to prepare polynorbornene‐chains (Mn = 4,000-10,000 g/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.1-1.4) bearing barbiturate and thymine‐moieties. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the generated polymers is done via MALDI‐TOF MS proving the introduction of hydrogen‐bonding moieties into the polymer chain and revealing the strong dependence of the desorption on the chemical structure of the different polymer species and high efficiencies for the end group introduction (90-99%). The efficiency of this process depends strongly on the reaction time and the equivalents of terminating agent with respect to the living end. The best results for the end group introduction are achieved by reacting the living chains with an excess of the terminating agent (5-20 equiv) for 100 h. 3aalkenes 3abarbiturates 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3adesorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amicrowave radiation 3apolymers 3aquantitative analysis1 aBinder, Wolfgang H.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 48, no. 23 p.5522-5532dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.243623Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02747naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245016500171300001600336520171000352650002402062650001302086650001802099650001102117650001102128650000902139651002102148700002402169700002602193700002002219773012702239856004602366852000902412655001202421IND60589802220221120194915.0180228e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058980222DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v121i2.4382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkinson, Shannon F.14aThe Rumsfeld Paradigm: Knowns and Unknowns in Characterizing Habitats Used by the Endangered Sharp-tailed Snake, Contia tenuis, in Southwestern British Columbia  ap. 142-149.  aThe Sharp-tailed Snake, Contia tenuis, has a small and highly fragmented range in British Columbia, where it is considered  endangered. Known sites are few in number and generally small in spatial extent; numbers of snakes apparently are correspondingly  low. Furthermore, most known sites for the species are on private lands in areas that are fairly heavily developed or being  developed. Thus, the species is under serious threat of habitat alteration or loss. Although land stewardship has been a valuable  conservation tool in this case, we also need to identify the key habitat requirements of Sharp-tailed Snakes to identify potential  new sites, modify former or potential ones, or even create new ones. In this study, we compared sites known to harbour Sharptailed  Snakes with those that seemed subjectively similar and therefore potentially suitable. We also compared these known and  potential sites with randomly chosen nearby locations. Variability of most measured features was high, both within and among  site/location categories. Nonetheless, we found significant differences between known and potential sites and between those  locations and random ones. Overall, locations known to be used by snakes had a more southerly aspect, more rock cover, shallower  soil and litter, and less shrub cover than other sites. This study was constrained by the small number of known sites for  Sharp-tailed Snakes in southwestern British Columbia, making our conclusions suggestive rather than definitive. Future work  should incorporate additional variables. It also might be useful to undertake comparative habitat studies elsewhere in the range  of the Sharp-tailed Snake where it is more common. 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aprivate lands 3ashrubs 3asnakes 3asoil 3aBritish Columbia1 aGregory, Patrick T.1 aEngelstoft, Christian1 aNelson, Kari J.0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2007 , v. 121, no. 2 p.142-149dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v121i2.438  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009700164300001600261520148800277650003001765650002601795650001301821650001501834650003001849650001301879650002201892650000901914650001401923651001201937773012701949856004602076852000902122655001202131IND60589802120221120194854.0180228e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058980212DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v121i2.4372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Dyke, Fred10aColonization of Non-Traditional Range in Dispersing Elk, Cervus elaphus nelsoni, Populations  ap. 133-141.  aAs ungulate populations increase in density on traditional range, resulting increases in intraspecific competition can encourage  dispersal of some individuals to new areas. Such areas, although lower in density of conspecifics, might present unfamiliar  arrays and types of habitat that could require altered patterns of home range and habitat use by dispersers. However, the  specific adaptations employed by dispersers in such circumstances are not well documented or understood. I investigated  three cases of range expansion by Elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) populations experiencing population growth on traditional  ranges in south-central Montana, USA. Each source population produced a group that dispersed to non-traditional areas.  Compared to source populations, dispersing groups increased average size of home ranges, changed patterns of use in core  areas of home ranges, and used habitats differently than Elk on traditional range. Dispersing groups demonstrated fidelity to  new ranges equal to that of source populations, but their seasonal tenure on non-traditional range was strongly linked to environmental  conditions, especially rainfall. Dispersal of groups increased the overall range of the population and its range of  habitat use. In growing populations of Elk, managers should determine if dispersing groups exist and whether they should be  protected to establish new populations in marginal areas or be reduced to limit potential Elk-landowner conflicts. 3aCervus canadensis nelsoni 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3aintraspecific competition 3amanagers 3apopulation growth 3arain 3aungulates 3aMontana0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2007 , v. 121, no. 2 p.133-141dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v121i2.437  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245015800171300001400329500002400343520114800367650002501515650001701540650001601557650001801573650002301591650001601614650001701630650001201647650001601659650001301675650001401688650000701702650001001709650001801719700001501737700001701752700002201769700002201791773009901813852000901912856005501921655001201976IND4450008220221120194906.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445000822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-697X.2010.00203.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouma, Kousaku10aInfluences of combination feeding of high moisture low quality grass-dominant mixture silage with corn silage on nutritive value and feed intake in sheep  ap. 18-22.  aIncludes references  aCombination feeding of high moisture low quality grass-dominant mixture silage (GS) with corn silage (CS) was evaluated in terms of the nutritive value and feed intake in sheep at three mixture levels (dry matter [DM] ratio) of 100:0 (GS100), 75:25 (GS75) and 35:65 (GS35). The two silages showed contrasting fermentation qualities; high pH and butyric acid content and low V-score in GS, and low pH and high lactic acid content and V-score in CS. The digestibilities of crude protein, acid and neutral detergent fibers (ADF and NDF) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in GS100 than in GS35, whereas the nitrogen free extract (NFE) digestibility was highest in GS35. The content of total digestible nutrients (TDN) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in GS35 than in the other two treatments. There was no significant difference in the DM intake among the three treatments. The TDN intake was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in GS35 than in GS100. The results show that the TDN intake of animals can be increased by combining high moisture low quality GS with CS, but the proportion of GS should be limited to no more than 35% (on DM basis). 3aacid detergent fiber 3abutyric acid 3acorn silage 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3agrasses 3alactic acid 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apH 3asheep 3awater content1 aWang, Peng1 aKanda, Fumie1 aIgarashi, Hiroaki1 aMasuko, Takayoshi0 tGrassland science.g2011 Mar., v. 57, no. 1 p.18-22dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1744-69617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-697X.2010.00203.x 7aarticle01698naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009100166300001600257520089600273650001001169650001901179650001201198651002001210700002001230773012701250856004601377852000901423655001201432IND60589801720221120195103.0180228e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058980172DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v121i2.4342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlough, Brian G.10aDiversity and Distribution of the Terrestrial Mammals of the Yukon Territory: A Review  ap. 119-127.  aThe diversity and distribution of the terrestrial mammals of the Yukon has not been systematically reviewed since 1975, a time  when the occurrences of many species were not well known.

Taxonomic studies have  resulted in some additional species. We provide an update on the diversity and distribution of recent land mammals of the  Yukon, including previously unreported range extensions, and include a revised checklist. Research in adjoining jurisdictions  has contributed more hypothetical species for the Yukon. The mammalian fauna of the Yukon is in a relatively dynamic state,  and human-induced changes, particularly climate warming, will undoubtedly influence mammalian diversity and distributions  in the coming decades. 3afauna 3aglobal warming 3amammals 3aYukon Territory1 aJung, Thomas S.0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2007 , v. 121, no. 2 p.119-127dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v121i2.434  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245007000209300001800279500002400297506007600321520178100397506003702178650005302215650001102268650001502279650002002294650001702314650002302331650001802354650002402372650001602396650002502412700002702437700002202464700002102486700002202507700001702529700002302546700001802569700002102587700002902608700002202637700001702659700002702676700002502703700002402728700002102752700002102773700002002794700002002814700002002834700001502854700002102869700001802890700002402908700001702932700001902949700002002968700002202988700002103010700002103031700002003052700002503072700002703097773013903124852000903263856008303272655001203355IND4459314620221207085232.0110625e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445931462DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0132432doi7 aPMC31275272pmcid7 a215935122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYetley, Elizabeth A.10aBiomarkers of vitamin B-12 status in NHANES: a roundtable summary  ap. 313S-321S.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA roundtable to discuss the measurement of vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) status biomarkers in NHANES took place in July 2010. NHANES stopped measuring vitamin B-12-related biomarkers after 2006. The roundtable reviewed 3 biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status used in past NHANES--serum vitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total homocysteine (tHcy)--and discussed the potential utility of measuring holotranscobalamin (holoTC) for future NHANES. The roundtable focused on public health considerations and the quality of the measurement procedures and reference methods and materials that past NHANES used or that are available for future NHANES. Roundtable members supported reinstating vitamin B-12 status measures in NHANES. They noted evolving concerns and uncertainties regarding whether subclinical (mild, asymptomatic) vitamin B-12 deficiency is a public health concern. They identified the need for evidence from clinical trials to address causal relations between subclinical vitamin B-12 deficiency and adverse health outcomes as well as appropriate cutoffs for interpreting vitamin B-12-related biomarkers. They agreed that problems with sensitivity and specificity of individual biomarkers underscore the need for including at least one biomarker of circulating vitamin B-12 (serum vitamin B-12 or holoTC) and one functional biomarker (MMA or tHcy) in NHANES. The inclusion of both serum vitamin B-12 and plasma MMA, which have been associated with cognitive dysfunction and anemia in NHANES and in other population-based studies, was preferable to provide continuity with past NHANES.

The virus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pet cats worldwide. As such an effective vaccine is desirable both for its use in veterinary medicine and also as a model for the development of an HIV vaccine. A large number of candidate vaccines have been tested against feline immunodeficiency virus. These include inactivated virus and infected cell vaccines, DNA and viral vectored vaccines, subunit and peptide vaccines and vaccines using bacterial vectors. Ultimately, the development of inactivated virus and infected cell vaccines led to the release of the first licensed vaccine against FIV, in 2002. This review highlights some of the difficulties associated with the development of lentiviral vaccines and some of the lessons that have been learned in the FIV model that are of particular relevance to the development of HIV vaccines. 3aDNA 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3acats 3ahumans 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccine development 3aveterinary medicine 3aviruses0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2006 July 15, v. 112, no. 1-2 p.67-77dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.03.013 7aarticle02898naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245007500210300001800285500002400303506007600327520157900403506003701982650002502019650002202044650001202066650001702078650001602095650001602111650001902127650001002146650002202156700002702178700003102205700002702236773013602263852000902399856008002408655001202488IND4460525320221207084227.0110729e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446052532DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02070-102doi7 aPMC31474432pmcid7 a217055432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjornsdottir, Snaedis H.10aGeneration of Targeted Deletions in the Genome of Rhodothermus marinus  ap. 5505-5512.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this work was to develop an approach for chromosomal engineering of the thermophile Rhodothermus marinus. A selection strategy for R. marinus had previously been developed; this strategy was based on complementing a restriction-negative trpB strain with the R. marinus trpB gene. The current work identified an additional selective marker, purA, which encodes adenylosuccinate synthase and confers adenine prototrophy. In a two-step procedure, the available Trp⁺ selection was used during the deletion of purA from the R. marinus chromosome. The alternative Ade⁺ selection was in turn used while deleting the endogenous trpB gene. Since both deletions are unmarked, the purA and trpB markers may be reused. Through the double deletant SB-62 (ΔtrpB ΔpurA), the difficulties that are associated with spontaneous revertants and unintended chromosomal integration of marker-containing molecules are circumvented. The selection efficiency in R. marinus strain SB-62 (ΔtrpB ΔpurA) was demonstrated by targeting putative carotenoid biosynthesis genes, crtBI, using a linear molecule containing a marked deletion with 717 and 810 bp of 5' and 3' homologous sequences, respectively. The resulting Trp⁺ transformants were colorless rather than orange-red. The correct replacement of an internal crtBI fragment with the trpB marker was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis of the transformants. Thus, it appears that target genes in the R. marinus chromosome can be readily replaced with linear molecules in a single step by double-crossover recombination.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodothermus marinus 3aSouthern blotting 3aadenine 3abiosynthesis 3achromosomes 3aengineering 3agene targeting 3agenes 3asequence homology1 aFridjonsson, Olafur H.1 aHreggvidsson, Gudmundur O.1 aGuðmundur Eggertsson.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 77, no. 15 p.5505-5512dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02070-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02721naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245013100162300001600293500002400309520142700333650002301760650001201783650001101795650001301806650001401819650001201833650001301845650001201858650001301870650002601883650002401909650001101933650001201944650002701956650001801983650001202001650001002013650001102023650001302034650001902047700002602066773010202092852000902194856004802203655001202251IND4449527520221120170236.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444952752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0548-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Sonali10aPlant growth regulators, adenine sulfate and carbohydrates regulate organogenesis and in vitro flowering of Anethum graveolens  ap. 305-311.  aIncludes references  aIn vitro regeneration protocol for Anethum graveolens (Apiaceae) was developed using leaf explants. MS basal medium used in experiments was augmented with various hormones for caulogenic and rhizogenic response. The optimum callus induction (100%) was obtained by leaf explants on MS media fortified with BA (0.5 mg l⁻¹) singly and in combination with NAA (0.1 and 0.2 mg l⁻¹). BA at 0.5 mg l⁻¹, KN at 1.0 mg l⁻¹ and NAA at 0.1 mg l⁻¹ induced highest number of multiple shoots (10.0 ± 0.25) per explant and they also showed in vitro flowering within 3 weeks of culture. Influence of adenine sulfate on regeneration frequency of callus was evaluated. The highest frequency of rooting (100%) with 6.0 ± 0.25 roots per explants was obtained in one-fourth strength MS medium supplemented with 1/4 MS + IBA 0.5 mg l⁻¹ within 4 weeks of transfer to the rooting medium. In vitro flowering (35%) was obtained with MS fortified with BA alone and also in combination with KN and NAA (5.3 ± 0.42 flowers per explants). In vitro flowering response was tested with different carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, mannose and sorbitol) and optimized. Hardening was successfully attained under controlled conditions inside the plant tissue culture room. The proposed method could effectively be applied for the conservation and clonal propagation to meet the pharmaceutical demands of this medicinally important species. 3aAnethum graveolens 3aadenine 3acallus 3aexplants 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahormones 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3amannose 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorganogenesis 3arooting 3aroots 3ashoots 3asorbitol 3atissue culture1 aShekhawat, Gyan Singh0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.305-311dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0548-0 7aarticle01931naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008900165300001600254520095600270650001101226650001101237650002001248650001401268650001201282650001401294650001201308650001001320650002401330650001201354651001301366700002001379773012701399856004601526852000901572655001201581IND60589812920221120113226.0180301e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058981292DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v117i4.8272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoons, David N.10aHave Lesser Scaup, Aythya affinis, Reproductive Rates Declined in Parkland Manitoba?  ap. 582-588.  aLong-term surveys indicate that the scaup populations have declined over the past 20 years, and that this is probably the  result of decreases in Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) rather than Greater Scaup (Aythya marila) numbers. To identify factors  possibly related to the decline, we estimated demographic parameters for a local population of Lesser Scaup at Erickson,  Manitoba, that was well studied before declines occurred and compared these estimates to historic rates. On average, nests  were initiated later than in the past, and recent estimates of nesting success and duckling survival were lower than historical  estimates. Breeding-season survival of adult females was estimated as 72.6%, with most (83%) mortality occurring during  nesting. Current estimates of demographic rates at Erickson are too low to maintain a stable local population, and suppressed  reproductive rates might be the proximate cause of the local population decline. 3aAythya 3aadults 3abreeding season 3aducklings 3afemales 3amortality 3anesting 3anests 3apopulation dynamics 3asurveys 3aManitoba1 aRotella, Jay J.0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2003 , v. 117, no. 4 p.582-588dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v117i4.827  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011800168300001600286520040300302650003000705650001900735650002300754650001200777650001000789650001400799650001400813651001200827700002300839700002100862700002500883773012700908856004601035852000901081655001201090IND60589812120221120113159.0180301e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058981212DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v117i3.8142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, Quinn E.10aNorthern Harrier, Circus cyaneus, Attacks on Greater Sage-Grouse, Centerocercus urophasianus, in Southern Alberta  ap. 479-480.  aThe Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is an endangered species in Canada, making it critical to understand all known causes of mortality.

In situ observations onboard the  manned submersible PISCES IV and color videos have provided information on the vertical distribution, density and habitat  of the species. Maximum abundances of about 15 large individuals/m2 occurred on sheltered rock outcrops at depth ranging  from 550 to 775 m, where warm (6°C) continental slope water is found. Differences in shape and thickness between the  valves of the two specimens appear to be related to the degree of exposure to rock falls (i.e., sheltered versus exposed  habitat). Prior to this account, the European Giant File Clam had never been encountered west of the Azores Islands in the  North Atlantic. 3aLimidae 3aclams 3acoasts 3ahabitats 3aislands 3arockfalls 3aspatial distribution 3aAzores 3aNorthwest Atlantic1 aHaedrich, R.

In addition, the influence of two different locations on the quantitative protein composition was evaluated. The results showed that Fusarium infection changed the content of gliadins and glutenins in emmer and wheat. The wheat glutenin fractions and types were found to be more strongly affected by the Fusarium spp. infection than the glutenin fractions and types in emmer cultivars in spite of the wheat's lower degree of infection. The nitrogen supply at the two locations was associated with an increase in the gliadin content in emmer and an increase in the glutenin content in emmer and wheat. Nitrogen availability, a factor which promotes gene expression, resulted here in a species-specific effect on the gliadin/glutenin ratio. 3aFusarium graminearum 3acultivars 3aFusarium culmorum 3aglutenins 3aalbumins 3anitrogen 3agliadin 3awheat 3agene expression 3aprotein content 3aglobulins 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccon 0aGibberella zeae1 aWieser, Herbert1 aPawelzik, Elke0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2010 Apr., v. 230, no. 6 p.837-847dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-010-1229-3 7aarticle01677naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245009300171300001600264520083200280650002101112650001201133650001101145650001101156650001501167650003501182773012701217856004601344852000901390655001201399IND60589813420221120093632.0180301e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058981342DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v117i4.8322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, John E.

The use of trained bear hounds is particularly suited to recapturing specific bears. However, in certain situations, hounds may not be used safely  or bears may seek refuge in difficult locations. Effectiveness of two methods to capture bears via remote darting and chemical immobilization are described: (1) stalking and rushing females with cubs; and (2) allowing treed bears to descend. Both methods rely on assumptions about Black Bear behavior. Nine captures of eight individual bears are discussed; one bear drowned after  being immobilized, and all others survived >5 months after capture. 3aUrsus americanus 3afemales 3ahounds 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aradio frequency identification0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2003 , v. 117, no. 4 p.621-625dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v117i4.832  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014500184300001600329500002400345520169100369650001702060650001002077650001002087650001902097650001202116650001602128650001002144650001302154650001802167650002402185650001402209650001502223650001302238650001202251650002902263650005202292650002802344650002102372650001402393650002502407650001102432650005002443650004002493650000902533650005202542650002902594650003802623700002102661700003502682700001802717700003102735700002802766700002302794700002002817700002002837700001702857773008502874852000902959856004802968655001203016IND4434264820221120093552.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443426482DNAL7 a199373482pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1510-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Cerro, Sara10aCarotenoid-based plumage colouration is associated with blood parasite richness and stress protein levels in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)  ap. 825-835.  aIncludes references  aCarotenoids are molecules that birds are not able to synthesize and therefore, must be acquired through their diet. These pigments, besides their function of giving birds red and yellow colouration when deposited in feathers, seem to act as immune-stimulators and antioxidants in the organism. Hence, only the healthiest individuals would be able to express carotenoid-based ornaments to a larger extent without compromising the physiological functions of carotenoids. Various studies have reported that birds infected by parasites are paler than those uninfected, but, to our knowledge, none of them has assessed the possible effect of multiple infections by blood parasites on plumage colour. By comparing the yellow colour in the breast plumage of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, between birds infected by different numbers of blood parasite genera, we found that those birds infected by more than one genus were paler than those parasitized just by one. In addition, we examined the potential role of carotenoid-based plumage colour of blue tits as a long-term indicator of other parameters of health status, such as body condition and immunoglobulin and heat shock protein (HSP) levels. Our results indicate that more brightly coloured birds had lower HSP70 levels than paler birds, but we did not find any significant association between colour and body condition or immunoglobulin levels. In addition, we found a positive significant association between Haemoproteus density of infection and HSP60 levels. Overall, these results support the role of carotenoid-based colours as indicators of health status in blue tits and show detrimental effects of parasitism on this character. 3aHaemoproteus 3abirds 3ablood 3abody condition 3abreasts 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3afeathers 3ahealth status 3aheat shock proteins 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apigments 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBird Diseasesxbloodxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aEcosystem 2aFeathersxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aImmunoglobulinsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPasseriformesxbloodxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPigmentationxphysiology 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology1 aMerino, Santiago1 aMartínez-de la Puente, Josué1 aLobato, Elisa1 aRuiz-de-Castañeda, Rafael1 aRivero-de Aguilar, Juan1 aMartínez, Javier.1 aMorales, Judit.1 aTomás, Gustavo1 aMoreno, Juan0 tOecologia.g2010 Apr., v. 162, no. 4 p.825-835dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1510-y 7aarticle03038naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245018100171300001800352520162800370650002501998650002902023650002302052650001602075650001302091650002002104650001102124650001502135650002002150650001602170650001202186650001602198650001402214650001202228650001502240650002202255650002702277700002202304700002202326700002002348773010002368852000902468856009202477946001102569655001202580IND4444467220221120093718.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444446722DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07871.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Ajay K.10aImprovement of ecdysone receptor gene switch for applications in plants: Locusta migratoria retinoid X receptor (LmRXR) mutagenesis and optimization of translation start site  ap. 4640-4650.  aGene switches have potential applications for the regulation of transgene expression in plants and animals. Recently, we have developed a two‐hybrid ecdysone receptor (EcR) gene switch using chimera 9 [CH9, a chimera between helices 1-8 of Homo sapiens retinoid X receptor (HsRXR) and helices 9-12 of Locusta migratoria RXR (LmRXR)] as a partner for Choristoneura fumiferana EcR (CfEcR). As CH9 includes a region of human RXR, public acceptance of this gene switch for use in genetically modified crops may be an issue. The current studies were conducted to identify an LmRXR mutant that could replace CH9 as a partner for CfEcR. The amino acid identity between LmRXR and HsRXR is fairly high. However, there are a few amino acid residues that are different between these two proteins. LmRXR mutants were produced by changing the amino acids in the helices 1-8 that are different between LmRXR and HsRXR to HsRXR residues. Screening of these mutants in tobacco protoplasts identified a triple mutant, A62S:T81H:V123I (SHILmRXR), that performed as well as CH9. The performance of the EcR gene switch was further improved by optimizing the translational start site (Kozak sequence, AACAATGG) of the transgene. The EcR gene switch containing SHILmRXR and the modified translation start site supported very low background activity in the absence of a ligand and a higher induced activity in the presence of a ligand in tobacco protoplasts, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants. At 16-80 nm methoxyfenozide, the induction of luciferase activity was better than that observed with the CfEcR:CH9 switch. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aLocusta migratoria 3aamino acids 3aecdysone 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amethoxyfenozide 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprotoplasts 3ascreening 3atobacco 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3atranslation (genetics)1 aTavva, Venkata S.1 aCollins, Glenn B.1 aPalli, Subba R.0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Nov., v. 277, no. 22 p.4640-4650dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07871.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245011500180300001800295520177700313650002702090650001302117650001902130650001902149650002402168650001502192650002202207650001402229650001702243700002102260700002002281700001902301700002202320700003402342773010002376852000902476856009202485939003302577946001102610655001202621IND4444468220221120093738.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444446822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07881.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelattre, Anne‐Sophie10aFunctional importance of a conserved sequence motif in FhaC, a prototypic member of the TpsB/Omp85 superfamily  ap. 4755-4765.  aIn Gram‐negative bacteria, the two‐partner secretion pathway mediates the secretion of TpsA proteins with various functions. TpsB transporters specifically recognize their TpsA partners in the periplasm and mediate their transport through a hydrophilic channel. The filamentous haemagglutinin adhesin (FHA)/FhaC pair represents a model two‐partner secretion system, with the structure of the TpsB transporter FhaC providing the bases to decipher the mechanism of action of these proteins. FhaC is composed of a β‐barrel preceded by two periplasmic polypeptide‐transport‐associated (POTRA) domains in tandem. The barrel is occluded by an N‐terminal helix and an extracellular loop, L6, folded back into the FhaC channel. In this article, we describe a functionally important motif of FhaC. The VRGY tetrad is highly conserved in the TpsB family and, in FhaC, it is located at the tip of L6 reaching the periplasm. Replacement by Ala of the invariant Arg dramatically affects the secretion efficiency, although the structure of FhaC and its channel properties remain unaffected. This substitution affects the secretion mechanism at a step beyond the initial TpsA-TpsB interaction. Replacement of the conserved Tyr affects the channel properties, but not the secretion activity, suggesting that this residue stabilizes the loop in the resting conformation of FhaC. Thus, the conserved motif at the tip of L6 represents an important piece of two‐partner secretion machinery. This motif is conserved in a predicted loop between two β‐barrel strands in more distant relatives of FhaC involved in protein transport across or assembly into the outer membranes of bacteria and organelles, suggesting a conserved function in the molecular mechanism of transport. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadhesins 3ahemagglutinins 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanism of action 3aorganelles 3aprotein transport 3asecretion 3atransporters1 aClantin, Bernard1 aSaint, Nathalie1 aLocht, Camille1 aVilleret, Vincent1 aJacob‐Dubuisson, Françoise0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Nov., v. 277, no. 22 p.4755-4765dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07881.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110802  aNon-US 7aarticle02935naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001200166245012800178300001500306500002400321500001500345520131900360650001601679650001301695650002201708650002701730650001801757650001701775650001901792650000901811650001601820650001901836650001701855650002001872650002001892650001801912650002701930650004401957650002102001653002302022653001002045700001302055700001502068700001802083773011402101852000902215856008802224930003302312945002502345946001102370655001202381IND4390261520221120084105.0070409e20070315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439026152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL2001 aZhu, Y.10aProinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in mammary tissue of sows following intramammary inoculation with Escherichia coli  ap. 98-103.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNAs was determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of biopsies from the mammary glands of sows. The biopsies were collected before and 24 h after intramammary inoculation of 12 pregnant sows with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Four of the sows developed clinical signs of mastitis and these animals displayed significantly lower levels of IL-1β mRNA before inoculation than those that remained clinically healthy. There was a significant increase in IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α mRNA expression in the inoculated mammary glands of sows that developed clinical signs of mastitis (affected group) 24 h postinoculation. This was also true for IL-8 and TNF-α mRNA expression in the inoculated mammary glands of sows that did not develop clinical signs of mastitis (non-affected group). No significant differences were found in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA expression in the inoculated mammary glands between groups (affected versus non-affected) 24 h postinoculation. Thus, a local production of proinflammatory cytokines in the mammary gland of sows was indicated by the induced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α mRNAs after intramammary inoculation with E. coli. 3acorrelation 3amastitis 3aprotein synthesis 3atumor necrosis factors 3amessenger RNA 3ainterleukins 3aswine diseases 3asows 3aparturition 3amammary glands 3ainflammation 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aEscherichia infections 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aEscherichia coli 0amolecular genetics 0aswine1 aBerg, M.1 aFossum, C.1 aMagnusson, U.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Mar. 15, v. 116, no. 1-2 p.98-103dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03040naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137072000900146072000900155100001900164245009900183300001600282500002400298500002300322500001500345520136400360650000901724650001801733650001301751650001601764650001401780650002001794650002201814650001701836650000901853650003501862650001001897650002001907650001901927650001701946650001601963650001001979650001201989650001402001650001002015653002402025700001702049700002202066700001602088700001402104773012702118852000902245856009102254930003302345945002502378946001102403655001202414IND4390278420221120084200.0070409e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439027842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aR300 0aL100 0aL600 0aL810 0aQ5021 aCustodio, M.G.10aGrowth, pork quality, and excretion characteristics of pigs fed Bt corn or non-transgenic corn  ap. 461-469.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aTwo experiments (exp. 1 and exp. 2, respectively) were conducted to compare performance, pork quality, and excretion characteristics of pigs fed diets containing Bt 11 (Bt) or control corn (C: non-transgenic inbred lines for exp. 1, and a non-transgenic isoline for exp. 2). Experiment 1 involved barrows and gilts (total n = 64; initial BW = 64 kg and 60 kg), while in exp. 2, 120 barrows were used (initial BW = 17 kg). Pigs were allocated to pens, blocked by sex and BW. Isocaloric, isolysinic diets contained an indigestible marker in exp. 1. Feed disappearance and weight gain data, and excreta samples were collected weekly in exp. 1. Feed disappearance and weight gain data were collected weekly in exp. 2. No difference in ADG was observed, however, feed efficiency was greater for pigs fed the C diet. No corn effects were observed for hot carcass weight, loin eye area, or backfat depth. Hunter color 'b' values and values for chroma were significantly greater for pigs fed C diets (P = 0.02, < 0.01, respectively) in exp. 1. In contrast, Hunter color 'b' values were significantly lower for pigs fed C diets (P = 0.05) in exp. 2. No corn effects were observed for proximate analyses of meat samples, N or P content of fecal and urine samples, nor N digestibility.

Therefore, the effects of vaccination on MAP serum Ab and skin-test responses to MAP and Bovis PPD were compared in 25 ewes vaccinated against MAP with 24 control ewes in an infected flock 3 years post-vaccination. MAP-specific Ab levels were higher (P < 0.001) in vaccinated ewes than in control ewes. All increases in skinfold-thickness from 0 to 48 h were greater (P < 0.0001) than zero while increases in skinfold-thickness from 48 to 72 h were greater (P < 0.05) than zero for Johnin but not for Bovis PPD. The Vaccine x PPD x Time interaction for skinfold-thickness was significant (P < 0.001) with greater increases to Johnin than to Bovis, but with much greater increases in vaccinated ewes. These data suggest that administration of vaccines against MAP developed from whole organisms increase the likelihood that animals will be classified as “responders” to a Bovis screening test and negative by the follow-up comparative cervical tuberculin test, but they also show that vaccination initiates both humoral and cell-mediated MAP-specific responses. 3ascreening 3askinfold thickness 3adisease detection 3aserodiagnosis 3aantibody formation 3ainactivated vaccines 3ahumoral immunity 3acell-mediated immunity 3aparatuberculosis 3avalidity 3asheep diseases 3ameasurement 3askin tests 3aewes 3avaccination 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 0amycobacterial diseases 0aimmune response 0adisease diagnosis1 aGavalchin, J.1 aSmith, M.C.1 aStehman, S.M.1 aMaul, J.K.1 aMcDonough, S.P.1 aThonney, M.L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Mar. 15, v. 116, no. 1-2 p.109-112dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02800naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245017200207300001800379500002400397500001500421506007600436520120300512506003701715650002201752650001901774650001801793650000901811650001301820650002001833650003001853650001501883650003301898650001001931650001401941650001601955650001301971650001801984653001502002700002102017700002402038700001902062773013602081852000902217856008002226655001202306IND4449074120221207074549.0110211e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444907412DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02032-102doi7 aPMC30672462pmcid7 a211694332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelendrez, Melanie C.10aInfluence of Molecular Resolution on Sequence-Based Discovery of Ecological Diversity among Synechococcus Populations in an Alkaline Siliceous Hot Spring Microbial Mat  ap. 1359-1367.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious research has shown that sequences of 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer regions may not have enough genetic resolution to define all ecologically distinct Synechococcus populations (ecotypes) inhabiting alkaline, siliceous hot spring microbial mats. To achieve higher molecular resolution, we studied sequence variation in three protein-encoding loci sampled by PCR from 60°C and 65°C sites in the Mushroom Spring mat (Yellowstone National Park, WY). Sequences were analyzed using the ecotype simulation (ES) and AdaptML algorithms to identify putative ecotypes. Between 4 and 14 times more putative ecotypes were predicted from variation in protein-encoding locus sequences than from variation in 16S rRNA and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. The number of putative ecotypes predicted depended on the number of sequences sampled and the molecular resolution of the locus. Chao estimates of diversity indicated that few rare ecotypes were missed. Many ecotypes hypothesized by sequence analyses were different in their habitat specificities, suggesting different adaptations to temperature or other parameters that vary along the flow channel.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3anational parks 3aribosomal RNA 3aloci 3aecotypes 3asprings (water) 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aalgorithms 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3agenes 3amushrooms 3atemperature 3ahabitats 3aSynechococcus 0aadaptation1 aLange, Rachel K.1 aCohan, Frederick M.1 aWard, David M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 77, no. 4 p.1359-1367dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02032-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03154naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245011100178300001600289500001500305520151100320650001801831650003001849650002201879650001601901650001301917650002501930650002001955650001401975650001101989650001702000650002302017650001802040650001702058650001802075650002102093650002102114650001502135650002102150651001002171653002802181653002702209653002202236653002202258700001802280700002402298700002002322700002602342700003202368773007202400852000902472930003302481945002502514946001302539655001202552IND4444482420221120084012.0101102e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444448242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In places where the microclimate is reasonably moist, the value of mushrooms may be clearly higher than the value of timber production. This study examines the optimal economic management for both timber and mushrooms in even-aged Scots pine and Black pine stands in Catalonia. Empirical mushroom yield models were integrated in a stand growth simulator, which was linked with an optimization algorithm to find the optimal management schedule for Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra stands on different sites and with different mushroom prices. The results showed that on sites where the potential mushroom yield is high, mushrooms should be taken into account in stand management. Thinning treatments, which usually are unprofitable, were included in the optimal management schedule when mushroom production was included in the analysis. Although thinnings have a negative short-term effect on mushroom yields, their long-term effect is often positive because they reduce stand density to a level that is favorable for mushrooms. At elevations that are suitable for P. sylvestris (900-1,500 m above sea level), the soil expectation value (SEV) of mushroom yields was commonly 4-10 times higher than the SEV of timber production. At somewhat lower elevations, where P. nigra dominates, the effect of mushrooms on the optimal stand management was smaller because mushroom yields are typically lower in P. nigra stands. 3aprofitability 3anontimber forest products 3atemperate forests 3aPinus nigra 3aaltitude 3aeven-aged management 3aforest thinning 3amushrooms 3ayields 3aforest trees 3asoil water content 3aforest yields 3amicroclimate 3astand density 3aPinus sylvestris 3acommodity prices 3awild foods 3aeven-aged stands 3aSpain 0asilvicultural practices 0asoil expectation value 0aeconomic analysis 0aforest management1 aPukkala, Timo1 aBonet, Jose Antonio1 aColinas, Carlos1 aFischer, Christine R.1 aMartinez de Aragon, Juan R.0 tForest science.g2009 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.503-511x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/28  aOther US 7aarticle02539naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245009300184300001600277500001500293520128200308650001501590650001301605650002201618650001101640650001501651650001401666650002501680650001101705650001801716650001701734650002101751650001901772650001401791650001301805653001501818653002601833653002801859700001801887773007201905852000901977930003301986945002502019946001302044655001202057IND4444484720221120084002.0101102e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444448472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In recent years, foresters have developed methods to extract information on forest attributes, such as stand density and size distribution of the trees, from laser data for forest inventory purposes. These methods are based on empirical relationships rather than on theory about how observations are generated by tree canopies. We recover the relationship between canopy height and forest attributes, based on assumptions about the shape of a single tree crown, the distribution of tree height, and the spatial distribution of tree locations. This work improves our understanding of how stand characteristics are related to observations collected by airborne laser scanners and links the problem to the theory of germ-grain models and random closet sets in spatial statistics. Furthermore, we use the derived relationship to develop a model-based approach for estimating stand density and distribution of tree heights using observations of canopy height. A simulation study showed that the method is capable of producing fairly accurate estimates for the number of stems and mean tree height, yielding only slight biases in mean tree height and stand density. 3aestimation 3adiameter 3ameasuring devices 3alasers 3atree crown 3aequations 3aspatial distribution 3aheight 3astand density 3aspatial data 3aforest inventory 3aremote sensing 3aoverstory 3aaccuracy 0alaser data 0astand characteristics 0aairborne laser scanning1 aNyblom, Jukka0 tForest science.g2009 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.411-422x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/03  aOther US 7aarticle02715naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245015700169300001800326520147200344650002101816650001901837650001401856650001801870650002301888650001801911650001601929650002101945650001101966650002801977650002402005650002602029650002002055700001702075700001302092773010002105852000902205856009202214946001102306655001202317IND4444468520221120084153.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444446852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07884.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xuegang14aThe reactive oxygen species-Src-Stat3 pathway provokes negative feedback inhibition of apoptosis induced by high‐fluence low‐power laser irradiation  ap. 4789-4802.  aHigh‐fluence low‐power laser irradiation (HF‐LPLI) can induce apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial oxidative stress. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is an important transcription factor in the modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, using real‐time single‐cell analysis and western blotting analysis, we investigated the changes in activities of Stat3 in COS‐7 cells upon HF‐LPLI (633 nm, 80 and 120 J·cm⁻²) and the underlying mechanisms involved. We found that Stat3 was significantly activated by HF‐LPLI in a time‐dependent and dose‐dependent manner. Stat3 activation attenuated HF‐LPLI‐induced apoptosis, as shown by the fact that both dominant negative Stat3 (Y705F) and Stat3 small interfering RNA expression enhanced cellular apoptosis induced by HF‐LPLI. Moreover, we also found that Src kinase was the major positive regulator of Stat3 activation induced by HF‐LPLI. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was essential for Stat3 and Src activation upon HF‐LPLI, because scavenging of ROS by vitamin C or N‐acetylcysteine totally abrogated the activation of Stat3 and Src. Taken together, these findings show that the ROS-Src-Stat3 pathway mediates a negative feedback inhibition of apoptosis induced by HF‐LPLI in COS‐7 cells. Our research will provide new insights into the mechanism of apoptosis caused by HF‐LPLI, and also extend the functional study of Stat3. 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcysteine 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3acell proliferation 3adose response 3airradiation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransactivators1 aWu, Shengnan1 aXing, Da0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Nov., v. 277, no. 22 p.4789-4802dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07884.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03471naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151100002200160245012700182300001600309500002400325520188800349650002502237650001602262650001502278650001402293650002302307650001602330650002002346650001102366650002302377650002002400650001402420650001702434650001902451650002102470650001602491650001302507650002902520650001102549650001602560651001702576653002102593700001702614700001902631773011002650852000902760856009102769930003302860945002502893946001102918655001202929IND4390260220221120074133.0070409e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439026022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aConstable, J.V.H.10aTemporal and light-based changes in carbon uptake and storage in the spring ephemeral Podophyllum peltatum (Berberidaceae)  ap. 112-120.  aIncludes references  aThe single leaf of the spring ephemeral Podophyllum peltatum (Berberidaceae), emerges in the spring, when forest over-story leaf area index (LAI) is low (approximately 0.8) and senesces approximately 12 weeks later when LAI is high (approximately 4.0). This study characterized (i) seasonal changes in gas exchange characteristics (maximum light-saturated photosynthetic rate, foliar dark respiration rate, apparent quantum efficiency, light saturation point and light compensation point) and carbohydrate storage in field populations and (ii) examined the hypothesis that observed seasonal changes in photosynthetic characteristics represent photosynthetic acclimation to maximize photosynthetic carbon gain as light availability declined. In field populations, as LAI increased, total chlorophyll concentration increased while declines occurred in all gas exchange characteristics except apparent quantum efficiency. Over the same period, soluble sugar content of the rhizome declined and starch content increased rapidly during the first 4 weeks after which it stabilized. Foliar tissue exhibited little change in carbohydrate pool over the season. Laboratory populations grown at high and low light levels differed in all gas exchange parameters except light saturation point, but illustrated similar seasonal changes in gas exchange characteristics to both each other and the field population. The similarity of temporal changes in gas exchange characteristics of field (seasonal decline in light availability) and laboratory (no seasonal decline in light availability) suggests that P. peltatum possesses limited ability to photosynthetically acclimate to declining light availability. It appears that seasonal carbon gain in P. peltatum may be primarily controlled by leaf lifespan and the fraction of lifespan occurring under high illumination conditions early in the season. 3aPodophyllum peltatum 3awild plants 3aunderstory 3aphenology 3atemporal variation 3aphotoperiod 3alight intensity 3aleaves 3aseedling emergence 3aleaf area index 3aoverstory 3agas exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3arhizomes 3acarbohydrate composition 3astarch 3aacclimation 3aPennsylvania 0aephemeral plants1 aPeffer, B.J.1 aDeNicola, D.M.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2007 May, v. 60, no. 1 p.112-120dPergamon Pressx0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2006.09.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03414naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011300187300001600300520153800316650002401854650001101878650002601889650001201915650000901927650001201936650001901948650001601967650001201983650002801995650004802023650003102071650001202102650000902114650003602123650002302159650003802182653003702220653004902257653004402306653004302350653001602393653001602409700001702425700002202442700001902464700001902483700002102502700001702523700002002540773011402560852000902674856008502683930003302768946001102801655001202812IND4399872120221120045305.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439987212DNAL7 a177137502pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-007-0300-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Baeckkyoung 10aMeasurement of flow speed in the channels of novel threadlike structures on the surfaces of mammalian organs  ap. 117-124.  aThere have been several reports on novel threadlike structures (NTSs) on the surfaces of the internal organs of rats and rabbits since their first observation by Bonghan Kim in 1963. To confirm this novel circulatory function, it is necessary to observe the flow of liquid through the NTS as well as the structurally corroborating channels in the NTS. In this article, we report on the measurement of the flow speed of Alcian blue solution in the NTSs on the organ surfaces of rabbits, and we present electron microscopic images depicting the cribrous cross-section with channels. The speed was measured as 0.3 ± 0.1 mm/s, and the flow distance was up to 12 cm. The flow was unidirectional, and the phase contrast microscopic images showed that the NTSs were strongly stained with Alcian blue. The ultrastructure of the NTSs revealed by cryo-scanning electron microscopy and high-voltage electron microscopy showed that (1) there were cell-like bodies and globular clumps of matter inside the sinus of the channel with thin strands of segregated zones which is a microscopic evidence of the liquid flow, (2) the sinuses have wall structures surrounded with extracellular matrices of collagenous fibers, and (3) there exists a cribriform structure of sinuses. To understand the mechanism for the circulation, a quantitative analysis of the flow speed has been undertaken applying a simplified windkessel model. In this analysis, it was shown that the liquid flow through the NTSs could be due to peristaltic motion of the NTS itself. 3aelectron microscopy 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3arabbits 3arats 3asinuses 3aultrastructure 2aAlcian Blue 2aAnimals 2aCryoelectron Microscopy 2aDigestive Systemxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Phase-Contrast 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aSkinxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aSurface Properties 2aThoraxxcytologyxultrastructure. 0aNovel threadlike structure (NTS) 0aCryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) 0aHigh-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) 0aBonghan duct (BHD) and corpuscle (BHC) 0aAlcian blue 0aCirculation1 aKim, Min-su.1 aLee, Byung-Cheon 1 aYoo, Jung Sun 1 aLee, Sang-Hee 1 aKim, Youn-Joong 1 aKim, Ki-Woo 1 aSoh, Kwang-Sup 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2008 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.117-124dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0300-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245006300186300001600249520160600265650001201871650001601883650001501899650001201914650001001926650001401936650001201950650001001962650002101972650002201993650001602015650001902031650001602050650001202066650002102078650001102099650003002110650000902140650003002149650002802179653002502207653002202232700002102254773011502275852000902390856008502399930003302484946001102517655001202528IND4393958920221120045319.0070812e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439395892DNAL7 a174792342pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-007-0249-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOppelt, Angelika 10aDynamics of sperm transfer in the ant Leptothorax gredleri  ap. 781-786.  aMating tactics differ remarkably between and within species of social Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants) concerning, e.g., mating frequencies, sperm competition, and the degree of male sperm limitation. Although social Hymenoptera might, therefore, potentially be ideal model systems for testing sexual selection theory, the dynamics of mating and sperm transfer have rarely been studied in species other than social bees, and basic information needed to draw conclusions about possible sperm competition and female choice is lacking. We investigated sperm transfer in the ant Leptothorax gredleri, a species in which female sexuals attract males by “female calling.” The analysis of 38 female sexuals fixed immediately or up to 7 days after copulation with a single male each revealed that the sperm is transferred into the female bursa copulatrix embedded in a gelatinous mass, presumably a spermatophore. Sperm cells rapidly start to migrate from the tip of the spermatophore towards the spermatheca, but transfer is drastically slowed down by an extreme constriction of the spermathecal duct, through which sperm cells have to pass virtually one by one. This results in the spermatheca being filled only between one and several hours after mating. During this time, the posterior part of the spermatophore seals the junction between bursa copulatrix and spermathecal duct and prevents sperm loss. The prolonged duration of sperm transfer might allow female sexuals to chose between ejaculates and explain previously reported patterns of single paternity of the offspring of multiply mated queens. 3aApoidea 3aLeptothorax 3acopulation 3afemales 3amales 3apaternity 3aprogeny 3aseals 3asexual selection 3asperm competition 3aspermatheca 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aMale 2aSpermatogoniaxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0aReproductive biology 0aSpermathecal duct1 aHeinze, Jürgen.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2007 Sept., v. 94, no. 9 p.781-786dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0249-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01664naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001200138245016600150300001800316520057000334650002300904650003300927650002000960650001900980650001200999700001301011700001501024700001401039700001401053700001801067773014101085852000901226856007801235946001301313655001201326IND4444419220221120045419.0101029e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444441922DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.243672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xin14aThe improvement of electro‐optical properties of polymer‐dispersed liquid crystals using copolymer macroinitiator with different glass transition temperature  ap. 5557-5561.  aIn this article, copolymer macroinitiators prepared with styrene and iso‐octyl acrylate by reversible additional‐fragmental chain transfer polymerization were used to prepare polymer‐dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs) with methyl acrylate.

Studies with honeybees showed that recruitment precision is not a fixed feature, but it may be enhanced by factors like experience and distance. However, little is known regarding the recruitment precision of stingless bees. Hence, in this study, we examined the effects of experience and spatial distance on the precision of the food communication system of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana. We conducted the experiments by training bees to a three-dimensional artificial patch at several distances from the colony. We recorded the choices of individual recruited foragers, either being newcomers (foragers without experience with the advertised food source) or experienced (foragers that had previously visited the feeder). We found that the average precision of newcomers (95.6 ± 2.61%) was significantly higher than that of experienced bees (80.2 ± 1.12%). While this might seem counter-intuitive on first sight, this “loss” of precision can be explained by the tendency of experienced recruits to explore nearby areas to find new rewarding food sources after they had initially learned the exact location of the food source. Increasing the distance from the colony had no significant effect on the precision of the foraging bees. Thus, our data show that experience, but not the distance of the food source, affected the patch precision of S. mexicana foragers. 3aScaptotrigona 3acommunications technology 3aforaging 3asocial adjustment 3astingless bees 2aAcclimatization 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBiological Specimen Banks 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aReproducibility of Results 0aMexico 0aCommunication system 0aThree-dimensional precision1 aKraus, F.

Both groups were trained to search for two hidden food depots in a rectangular sand-filled arena without obvious visual cues; for the experimental birds, these depots were also marked with three 1.15 x 10⁶ μT bar magnets. During the tests, there were two food depots, one marked with the magnets, the other unmarked; their position within the arena was changed from test to test. The experimental birds searched within 10 cm of the magnetically marked depot in 49% of the test sessions, whereas the control birds searched there in only 11% of the sessions. Both groups searched near the control depot in 11 and 13% of the sessions, respectively. The significant preference of the magnetically marked food depot by the experimental birds shows that homing pigeons cannot only detect a magnetic anomaly but can also use it as a cue for locating hidden food in an open arena. 3aColumba livia 3abirds 3amagnetic materials 2aAnimals 2aAppetitive Behaviorxphysiology 2aColumbidaexphysiology 2aCues 2aDiscrimination Learning 2aMagnetics 2aPattern Recognition, Visual 0aConditioning1 aHoltkamp-Rötzler, Elke 1 aFleissner, Gerta 1 aWiltschko, Wolfgang 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2007 Oct., v. 94, no. 10 p.813-819dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0259-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03212naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008500184300001600269520178300285650002202068650001202090650001202102650001202114650001302126650001002139650001302149650001102162650001002173650001002183650001502193650001602208650001202224650002102236650000902257650002102266650001702287650001402304650002702318650001102345653001502356653002702371653001402398700001802412773011402430852000902544856008502553930003302638946001102671655001202682IND4399872520221120035504.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439987252DNAL7 a177245722pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-007-0298-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilms, Jessica 10aForaging scent marks of bumblebees: footprint cues rather than pheromone signals  ap. 149-153.  aIn their natural habitat foraging bumblebees refuse to land on and probe flowers that have been recently visited (and depleted) by themselves, conspecifics or other bees, which increases their overall rate of nectar intake. This avoidance is often based on recognition of scent marks deposited by previous visitors. While the term 'scent mark' implies active labelling, it is an open question whether the repellent chemicals are pheromones actively and specifically released during flower visits, or mere footprints deposited unspecifically wherever bees walk. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we presented worker bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) with three types of feeders in a laboratory experiment: unvisited control feeders, passive feeders with a corolla that the bee had walked over on its way from the nest (with unspecific footprints), and active feeders, which the bee had just visited and depleted, but which were immediately refilled with sugar-water (potentially with specific scent marks). Bumblebees rejected both active and passive feeders more frequently than unvisited controls. The rate of rejection of passive feeders was only slightly lower than that of active feeders, and this difference vanished completely when passive corollas were walked over repeatedly on the way from the nest. Thus, mere footprints were sufficient to emulate the repellent effect of an actual feeder visit. In confirmation, glass slides on which bumblebees had walked on near the nest entrance accumulated hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes, C23 to C31), which had previously been shown to elicit repellency in flower choice experiments. We conclude that repellent scent marks are mere footprints, which foraging bees avoid when they encounter them in a foraging context. 3aBombus terrestris 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3acorolla 3aforaging 3aglass 3ahabitats 3anectar 3anests 3aodors 3apheromones 3aworker bees 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aCues 2aFeeding Behavior 2aHydrocarbons 2aOdorants. 2aPheromonesxphysiology 2aReward 0aFootprints 0aCuticular hydrocarbons 0aRepellent1 aEltz, Thomas 0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2008 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.149-153dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0298-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02735naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245012800173300001800301520122000319650001001539650001101549650002101560650001401581650001701595650001501612650002301627650001301650650001001663650001701673650002901690650003301719650003301752650001101785650005001796650001101846650000901857650002401866650001001890650001901900653003401919700001701953773010201970852000902072856007702081930003302158945001302191946001302204655001202217IND2204541820221122135605.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220454182DNAL7 a105526502pmid7 a10.1021/jf98137902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscudero, A.10aEffect of antioxidants on the flavor characteristics and the gas chromatography/olfactometry profiles of champagne extracts  ap. 3303-3308.  aThis paper aims to investigate the possibility of oxidation of the flavor active constituents of champagne wines during the critical steps of the extraction for analytical purposes and to estimate its consequences on the extract's aroma characteristics. The investigation uses conventional sensory and GC/O analyses. Triangle and similarity sensory tests carried out on champagne samples and on their extracts show that the absence of antioxidants implies a deterioration of the aroma quality. Conversely, the use of 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol (BHA) as antioxidant gives an extract with an odor judged to be more similar to the original odor of the champagne. The alteration in the odor of the unprotected extracts is explained, from GC/O and CC/MS analyses, as three types of uncontrolled reactions. These are, first, the chemical oxidation of the fusel alcohols and the amino acids; second, the oxidation of sensitive flavor compounds such as enolic lactones and monoterpenic alcohols; and, third, the hydrolysis of fatty acid esters and saturated gamma-lactones. A systematic use of BHA during flavor extraction is therefore advisable, in particular when oxidation phenomena such as wine aging are under study. 3aodors 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3aoxidation 3aantioxidants 3aextraction 3agas chromatography 3aextracts 2aAdult 2aAntioxidants 2aButylated Hydroxyanisole 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aTaste 2aWinexanalysis 0achampagne and sparkling wines1 aEtievant, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3303-3308x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf98137903Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02480naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245009500170300001800265520098400283650001701267650001401284650001401298650002201312650001901334650002101353650001901374650002401393650003001417650003301447650001301480650002201493650002101515650002401536650003001560650003501590653001601625653002201641653003201663700001601695700001601711773010201727852000901829856007701838930003301915945001301948946001301961655001201974IND2204543320221122135602.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220454332DNAL7 a105526532pmid7 a10.1021/jf99024942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, G.X.10aReactivity of ferulic acid and its derivatives toward hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid  ap. 3325-3331.  aThe reactions of ferulic acid and its derivatives with hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid in lignin-retaining bleaching conditions have been investigated to determine their susceptibility to oxidative degradation. The conjugated side chain of ferulic acid and its etherified or esterified derivative was shown to be fairly stable, especially to hydrogen peroxide. The major reaction was trans-cis isomerization that possibly involved a radical mechanism but did not cause bond cleavage. The peracetic acid reaction increased the rate of trans-cis isomerization and was also accompanied by a minor cleavage of the side chain. Esterification did not have a substantial effect on the reactivity of ferulic acid, but 4-O-etherification significantly stabilized it against these two oxidants. By contrast, aldehyde substitution tremendously enhanced the susceptibility of the cinnamyl side chain to oxidative degradation, as evidenced by an intensive degradation of coniferaldehyde. 3aferulic acid 3aoxidation 3ableaching 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperacetic acid 3ableaching agents 3aesterification 3areaction mechanisms 2aCoumaric Acidsxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aKinetics 2aLigninxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeracetic Acidxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0aderivatives 0areaction products 0aligning-retaining bleaching1 aSpencer, L.1 aLeary, G.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3325-3331x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf99024943Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02428naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245008400172300001800256520124200274650000901516650001101525650001001536650001701546650001301563650002701576650003901603650000901642650001901651650001301670650002201683653001301705653002201718700001901740773010201759852000901861856007701870930003301947945001301980946001301993655001202006IND2204546420221122135614.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220454642DNAL7 a105526582pmid7 a10.1021/jf981249r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, F.B.10aEffect of salts on the gelatinization and rheological properties of sago starch  ap. 3359-3366.  aThe effects of various salts on the gelatinization and rheological properties of sago starch have been studied using differential scanning calorimetry, small deformation oscillation, and large deformation techniques. The presence of salts affected the gelatinization peak temperature, T(p), gelatinization enthalpy, deltaH, swelling properties, storage modulus, G', gel strength, GS, and gelation rate constants, k, depending on the type of salt and the concentration. Their influence followed the Hofmeister series, and the effect of anions was more pronounced than that of cations. Sulfate ions increased T(p), G', GS, and k and reduced the swelling properties, whereas iodide and thiocyanate ions reduced T(p), G', GS, and k but increased the swelling properties. For all of the salts studied except for Na(2)SO(4), T(p) increased to a maximum and then decreased again at higher salt concentrations while deltaH reduced with concentration. In the presence of MgCl(2), CaCl(2), and LiCl complex behavior was observed such that at approximately 3.5 M MgCl(2) and CaCl(2) and 8 M LiCl the starch samples were gelatinized at room temperature, whereas at much higher concentration T(p) increased again and the transition became exothermic. 3asago 3astarch 3asalts 3aelectrolytes 3agelation 3arheological properties 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aGels 2aPlants, Edible 2aRheology 2aStarchxchemistry 0aswelling 0ahofmeister series1 aWilliams, P.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3359-3366x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf981249r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02720naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245009700171300001800268500001500286520132300301650001601624650001501640650001201655650001001667650000701677650001501684650001301699650001601712650001201728650002601740650001501766650002801781650001301809650002401822650004201846650002501888650002701913653001501940700002401955773010201979852000902081856007702090930003302167945001302200946001302213655001202226IND2204546720221122135622.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220454672DNAL7 a105526592pmid7 a10.1021/jf980885m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, A.10aKinetics and hydrolysis of fenamiphos, fipronil, and trifluralin in aqueous buffer solutions  ap. 3367-3371.  a2019-12-04  aHydrolyses of fenamiphos, fipronil, and trifluralin were studied in aqueous buffer solutions of pH 4.1, 7.1, and 9.1 at different temperatures, 5, 22 +/- 1, 32 +/- 1, and 50 +/- 1 degree C. Fenamiphos, fipronil, and trifluralin were found to be more stable in acidic and neutral buffer solutions at temperatures of 5 and 22 +/- 1, and dissipation is rapid at 50 +/- 1 degree C. In basic buffer and at higher temperature, degradation of fenamiphos was found to be very rapid when compared with fipronil and trifluralin. The rate constants calculated at 32 degrees C for fenamiphos were 2349.4 x 10(-8) (pH 4.1), 225.2 x 10(-8) (pH 7.1), and 30476.0 x 10(-8) (pH 9.1); for fipronil 1750.0 x 10(-8) (pH 4.1), 3103.0 x 10(-8) (pH 7.1), and 3883.0 x 10(-8) (pH 9.1); and for trifluralin 2331.0 x 10(-8) (pH 4.1), 2360.0 x 10(-8) (pH 7.1), and 3188.0 x 10(-8) (pH 9.1). On the basis of rate constant values, these pesticides appeared to be more susceptible to hydrolysis than synthetic organophosphorus compounds such as chlorpyriphos, diazinon, malathion, and ronnel.

Decreasing orders against NDBA and NPIP were, respectively, kiwi > onion > licorice = garlic > green pepper > carrot and licorice > garlic > pineapple > carrot. 3avegetables 3adiet 3anitrosamines 3amutagenicity 3acytotoxicity 3aextracts 2aAntimutagenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aFruit 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aMutagensxpharmacology 2aNitrosaminesxpharmacology 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxdrug effects 2aVegetables 0ainhibition 0afruit1 aMorales, P.1 aMartinez, A.1 aMartin, M.L.1 aHaza, A.I.1 aCambero, M.I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3257-3264x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990166n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02846naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001100156245014100167300001800308500001500326520112500341650002001466650002001486650001901506650002301525650002001548650001301568650001601581650002301597650003501620650001201655650001901667650000901686650001101695650001101706650001101717650002001728650001401748650002701762650002201789650002301811650003901834651001201873651001201885653002401897653001801921653002301939700001701962700001801979773010201997852000902099856007702108930003302185945001302218946001302231655001202244IND2204538920221122104917.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220453892DNAL7 a105526422pmid7 a10.1021/jf990268d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, F.10aDetermination of selenium in human milk by hydride cold-trapping atomic absorption spectrometry and calculation of daily selenium intake  ap. 3265-3268.  a2019-12-04  aA technique of hydride cold-trapping atomic absorption spectrometry following microwave digestion was developed and optimized for the determination of selenium in human milk. The method was validated by the analysis of two standard reference materials (CRM milk powder). The detection limit was 0.5 ng mL(-1). The method was then used to analyze 78 milk samples from 38 Austrian mothers throughout their first 10 months of lactation. The mean concentration of selenium in the mother's milk decreased with the days postpartum from 23.9 +/- 12.0 micrograms L(-1) in colostrum to a plateau of 11.4 +/- 3.0 micrograms L(-1) in mature milk. On the basis of the milk selenium concentrations, the selenium intakes of the fully breast-fed infants and the lactating mothers were calculated. The selenium intake of the infants during their first 3 months of life was >8.2 micrograms day(-1). The selenium intake of the lactating mothers was 48 micrograms day(-1). Compared to the recommended dietary allowance, the fully breast-fed infants received sufficient selenium but the lactating mothers obtained less than the recommended. 3anutrient intake 3alactating women 3abreast feeding 3anutritional status 3alactation stage 3aselenium 3abreast milk 3amaternal nutrition 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ainfants 2aBreast Feeding 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLactation 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aPostpartum Period 2aSeleniumxanalysis 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomicxmethods 3aAustria 0aAustria 0amicrowave digestion 0adetermination 0aanalytical methods1 aRossipal, E.1 aIrgolic, K.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3265-3268x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990268d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02392naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245014000176300001800316500001500334520072300349650001101072650001301083650001301096650001101109650002301120650002201143650001001165650002101175650001701196650001001213650002601223650003401249650002101283650002701304650002801331650002201359650002201381650002601403650001901429653001201448653001701460653001901477653002201496653001201518700001701530700002001547773010201567852000901669856007701678930003301755945001301788946001301801655001201814IND2204534420221122104911.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220453442DNAL7 a105526342pmid7 a10.1021/jf980856b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, J.A.10aDifferential pulse polarographic determination of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds in foodstuffs after derivatization with o-phenylenediamine  ap. 3219-3222.  a2019-12-04  aA differential pulse polarographic method has been developed for the indirect determination of diacetyl and other vicinal diketones in foodstuffs, based on the quantitative derivatization of the diketones with o-phenylenediamine to give quinoxalines. The method allows the identification of diacetyl and methylglyoxal in brandy, vinegar, wine, and butter samples. The polarographic reduction peaks of the quinoxalines formed are sufficiently separate, in some cases, to allow the simultaneous determination of these two compounds. The polarographic method is not affected by the presence of sulfite ion, probably because the o-phenylenediamine is capable of dislodging the alpha-diketones from their sulfite complexes. 3abutter 3adiacetyl 3asulfites 3abrandy 3achemical reactions 3achemical analysis 3awines 3aflavor compounds 3aquinoxalines 3aodors 2aAcetic Acidxanalysis 2aAlcoholic Beveragesxanalysis 2aButterxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aKetonesxanalysis 2aPhenylenediamines 2aPolarographyxmethods 2aWinexanalysis 0avinegar 0apolarography 0amethylglycoxal 0avicinal diketones 0aketones1 aBarros, A.A.1 aRodrigues, P.G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3219-3222x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf980856b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02552naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245012700174300001800301520108500319650001701404650001201421650001401433650001701447650001501464650001801479650003601497650002401533650002901557650001801586650002001604650001701624650004401641653002101685653001701706653001801723653001101741653002301752653001901775700001701794773010201811852000901913856007701922930003301999945001302032946001302045655001202058IND2204535420221122104906.0000512e199908  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220453542DNAL7 a105526372pmid7 a10.1021/jf990288f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalcott, S.T.10aDetermination and distribution of 6-methoxymellein in fresh and processed carrot puree by a rapid spectrophotometric assay  ap. 3237-3242.  aIsocoumarin or 6-methoxymellein (6-MM) was extracted from carrot tissue using alkali saponification to solubilize the lactone portion of its structure into an aqueous phase. Acidification and subsequent organic solvent extraction allowed isolates to be quantified and verified as 6-MM by spectrophotometric determination. 6-Methoxymellein was analyzed in carrot cross sections, as a function of depth and before and after thermal processing. A natural propensity for 6-MM accumulation was observed in root tip sections exposed to ethylene, and levels increased as a result of wounding. Consecutive layer peeling demonstrated that small-diameter roots accumulated greater amounts of 6-MM in periderm tissue compared to large roots. Processing carrots into a puree resulted in 10-25% greater extraction of 6-MM than grinding fresh carrot samples, whereas steam-cooked and thermally processed purees had 15% greater extraction than unheated purees. This analytical technique will allow carrot processors to accurately estimate raw and processed products for the bitter compound 6-MM. 3aspectroscopy 3acarrots 3acoumarins 3aphytoalexins 3abitterness 3arapid methods 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysis 2aCoumarinsxanalysis 2aDaucus carotaxchemistry 2aFood Handling 2aHot Temperature 2aIsocoumarins 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultravioletxmethods 0aquality controls 0adistribution 0adetermination 0astress 0aprocessed products 0afresh products1 aHoward, L.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.3237-3242x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990288f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01952naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010800125300001600233520108600249650002801335650002601363650002001389650001301409650001901422700001601441700002101457700001901478773007301497852000901570930003301579945001301612946001301625655001201638IND2199461020221121234332.0990624s1998    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219946102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmilda, T.10aBinding of inhibiting adducts of ketones and NAD+ to alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 233-243.  aDrosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (DADH) can be converted with NAD+ and ketone into more negatively charged isoforms. Completely modified ADH isoforms are inactive but activity is regained after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis depending on the ketone used. When unmodified ADH is incubated with NAD+ and acetylacetone, more negatively charged bands appear. Modified ADH isoforms bind to a Mono-Q column, while unmodified ADH and NAD+ do not. A covalently bound adduct is also formed between NAD+ and ketone in the absence of the enzyme. These adducts can be purified by ion-exchange FPLC and have been characterized by mass spectrometry and UV spectrometry and also form inactive isoforms after incubation with unmodified enzyme. The effect of temperature increase on unmodified and modified Drosophila melanogaster variants was determined by circular dichroism experiments. Unfolding temperatures (Tm) of the modified ADH isoforms were 5 to 20 degrees higher than those of the unmodified ones, indicating that the enzyme molecule becomes more compact upon adduct binding. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3akinetics 3aheat stability1 aJekel, P.A.1 aBruining, M.A.M.1 aBeintema, J.J.0 tBioorganic chemistry.g1998, v. 26, no. 5 p.233-243x0045-20687nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01729naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245019500124300001600319500001500335520067000350650002101020650001101041650001801052650002201070650001401092650001101106653001701117653002401134653000801158700001601166700001301182700001401195773007801209852000901287930003301296945001301329946001301342655001201355IND2042040920221121234302.0940915e199406  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204204092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaust, T.10aSynthesis of uridine 5'-(alpha-D-fucopyranosyl diphosphate) and (digitoxigenin-3 beta-yl)-beta-D-fucopyranoside and enzymatic beta-D-fucosylation of cardenolide aglycones in Digitalis lanata  ap. 140-149.  a2019-12-05  aThe phosphorylation of 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-D-fucopyranose with o-phenylene phosphochloridate yielded alpha-D-fucopyranosyl phosphate which was used for condensation with uridine 5'-monophosphomorpholidate to give uridine 5'-(alpha-D-fucopyranosyl diphosphate) (UDP-alpha-D-fucose).

The substrate analogs were tested on dihydroxy-acid dehydratase from both spinach and Escherichia coli. One modification of the substrate that led to as much as a 1000-fold increase in binding affinity was replacement of the 3-hydroxyl group with a thiol. It has been shown previously that the 3-hydroxyl group of the substrate becomes a ligand for one Fe of the Fe-S clusters of these enzymes on binding to their active sites. It seems likely then that the tighter binding of the thiol containing analogs is due to the thiol group becoming a ligand to an iron of the Fe-S clusters of these enzymes. A second modification in substrate that led to as much as 1000-fold increase in binding affinity was the addition of a large lipophilic group. This suggests there is a large hydrophobic pocket or hydrophobic surface near the active site of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase. A modification in substrate that led to as much as a 50-fold increase in binding was the replacement of the carboxyl group of the substrate with phosphonate; however, this increase was limited to substrate analogs without a polar functionality on the carbon beta to the phosphonate group. Bromopyruvate was found to irreversibly inactivate dihydroxy-acid dehydratase. Each good inhibitor we found was active on spinach dihydroxy-acid dehydratase and E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase to a similar extent suggesting the active sites of the enzymes from these two organisms are similar.

Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) was applied in maize fields to control the Western Corn Rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Establishment and persistence of two strains of M. anisopliae were investigated after application as ‘fungal colonized barley kernels' (FCBK) into the soil and as a spore suspension on maize leaves and on the soil surface in 2006 and 2007 at two locations in Hungary. The applied fungal strains were able to establish at both locations and a long-term persistence of at least 15 months could be recorded in the soil. A positive correlation between density of colony forming units (CFU) in the soil and the soil inhabiting stages of the host insect D. v. virgifera could be found. M. anisopliae spores applied on maize leaves were able to survive for no longer than 3 days after application, whereas on the soil surface a noticeably increase of fungus densities were found after treatments. Molecular markers were used to identify the applied M. anisopliae strains before and after application of FCBK into the soil of the maize field. 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3abarley 3aseeds 3aspores 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3ahosts 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3acorn 3acorn soils 3aleaves 3ainsects 3agenetic markers 3aHungary 0aClavicipitaceae1 aEnkerli, J.1 aWegensteiner, R.1 aKeller, S.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2011 July, v. 135, no. 6 p.393-403dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2010.01566.x 7aarticle02768naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013400174300001600308500002400324520130400348650001801652650001501670650001201685650001101697650001101708650001301719650002001732650001001752650001301762650001401775650002101789650001101810650001101821650001201832650001601844650003201860650001701892650001001909650001501919650001001934650001901944700002201963700002001985700002302005700001902028700002102047773010602068852000902174856005502183655001202238IND4393096420221121095201.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439309642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00902.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovisolo, Claudio10aExpression of PIP1 and PIP2 aquaporins is enhanced in olive dwarf genotypes and is related to root and leaf hydraulic conductance  ap. 543-551.  aIncludes references  aThe expression of OePIP1.1 and OePIP2.1 aquaporins in root, stem and leaf was higher in Olea europaea L. (olive) plants carrying a dwarfing (D) clone as rootstock, than in plants carrying a vigorous (M) clone as rootstock. The highest difference of expression between plants with D and M rootstocks was detected in the root and for the PIP2 gene, the transcripts of which show a high water channel activity in oocytes. Compared with plants with M rootstock, plants with D rootstock showed reduced root and canopy biomass and reduced hydraulic conductance of the bulk root system (Kroot). Hydraulic conductance of D roots was higher than that of M roots when Kroot was scaled by root DW, in agreement with a higher expression of PIP genes. Leaf hydraulic conductance scaled by unit leaf surface area was almost twice as high in leaves from D plants compared with that in leaves from M plants. Modification of root growth imposed by grafting M onto D and D onto M slightly changed expression levels of root OePIP1.1 gene, the transcripts of which show almost null water channel activity in oocytes, suggesting a role less evident for OePIP1.1 in root hydraulic reequilibration. The role of PIP aquaporin gene expression in partially compensating reductions of plant hydraulic conductance is discussed. 3aOlea europaea 3aaquaporins 3abiomass 3acanopy 3aclones 3adwarfing 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3aleaf area 3aleaf conductance 3aleaves 3aolives 3aoocytes 3aroot growth 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3aroot systems 3aroots 3arootstocks 3astems 3awater activity1 aSecchi, Francesca1 aNardini, Andrea1 aSalleo, Sebastiano1 aBuffa, Rosalia1 aSchubert, Andrea0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2007 Aug., v. 130, no. 4 p.543-551dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00902.x 7aarticle01913naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013300164300001300297500002400310520106600334650002601400650001201426650001701438651001001455700002201465773009101487852000901578856004801587655001201635IND4432509120221121064717.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443250912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-009-9649-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazol, Antonio10aVariation of plant diversity in a temperate unmanaged forest in northern Spain: behind the environmental and spatial explanation  ap. 1-11.  aIncludes references  aSpatial patterns of vascular plant diversity were studied in an unmanaged temperate forest in northern Spain. Diversity in 102 plots of 400 m² was analyzed against environmental and spatial variables. The Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices method was used to create spatial variables that represent spatial structures on multiple scales. Variation partitioning on multiple regression was used to discover pure environmental and spatial fractions and their joint effects on diversity. Additionally, we created maps of the response and some explanatory variables to interpret their patterns. The results show that diversity is heterogeneously distributed in the basin and is explained mainly by environmental factors. Leaf litter cover proved the most important environmental factor. The spatial variables play an important role in structuring the environment but the low amount of variance explained by these when the effect of the environment is removed points to the lesser importance of neighborhood relations to the distribution of diversity values. 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3aplant litter 3aSpain1 aIbáñez, Ricardo0 tPlant ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 207, no. 1 p.1-11dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9649-5 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012700171300001600298500002400314520118600338650002601524650001101550650002101561650002301582650001401605650001301619650001301632650001401645650001201659650001001671650001101681650001601692650001201708650001301720700001401733773012901747852000901876856005701885655001201942IND4456309420221121045235.0110408e199405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445630942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01778.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajimura, H.10aReproduction and resource utilization of the ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus mutilatus, in field and experimental populations  ap. 121-132.  aIncludes references  aThe reproduction process of the ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus mutilatus (BLANDFORD) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), was examined by successive censuses of field populations and by artificial rearing experiments. The reproductive strategy is discussed in relation to utilization of fungal resources, the amount of which was evaluated by total gallery length (main gallery and side galleries) for the field populations or fungal area in the laboratory. Fecundity of mother adults increased with the expansion of gallery systems for cultivating their associated fungi. The number of offspring also depended on the amount of fungal resource, whereas the variation of female body size within a brood was not affected by the fungal amount. The body size apparently declined with delay in larval feeding period expressed as the order of pupation and eclosion in the field and with decreasing fungal area per larva in the laboratory. These results suggested that the combination of resource-dependent oviposition by a mother beetle and dominant resource utilization by earlier-hatched individuals in a brood can contribute to the efficient production of larger females when resources are limited. 3aXylosandrus mutilatus 3aadults 3aambrosia beetles 3aartificial rearing 3abody size 3acensuses 3aeclosion 3afecundity 3afemales 3afungi 3alarvae 3aoviposition 3aprogeny 3apupation1 aHijii, N.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1994 May, v. 71, no. 2 p.121-132dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26117x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01778.x 7aarticle01723naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006600128300001600194520099300210650002401203650001101227650002501238700001401263700001401277773008601291852000901377930003301386945001301419946001301432655001201445IND2197112020221121032928.0990219e199809  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219711202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrasier, G.W.10aTechnical note: Rainfall simulator runoff hydrograph analysis  ap. 531-535.  aRainfall simulators have been used more than 50 years to evaluate hydrologic parameters. The generated runoff hydrograph is a continuous integration of all factors that affect runoff flow. The complexity and interaction of site factors on runoff and infiltration processes makes it difficult to identify a single component of the hydrograph that accurately characterizes the entire runoff event. A technique was developed to separate the runoff hydrograph into segments representative of different portions of the flow event. Each segment grouping is analyzed for treatment and/or site factor differences or influences on the runoff. Comparing the treatment or site impacts on each hydrograph component allows a more detailed interpretation of the runoff and infiltration processes. This approach to runoff hydrograph analysis makes it possible to quantitatively assess differences in rainfall simulator runoff results and provide insight into why hydrographs may be similar or different. 3arainfall simulators 3arunoff 3astatistical analysis1 aWeltz, M.1 aWeltz, L.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.531-535x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02298naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006200125300001600187520128300203650002001486650001601506650002401522650001201546650001101558650001001569650001401579650002301593650002301616651001201639651002001651653002501671653001901696700001501715700001701730773008501747852000901832930003301841945001301874946001301887655001201900IND2196559420221121033008.0990121e199807  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219655942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, J.R.10aTemperature effects on regrowth of 3 rough fescue species  ap. 463-468.  aThree species of rough fescue, alpine rough fescue (Festuca altaica Trin.), mountain rough fescue (F. campestris Rydb.), and plains rough fescue (F. hallii (Vasey) Piper) were grown for 12 weeks under 5 temperature regimes -- 7:3, 12:8, 17:13, 22:18, and 27:23. C -- and defoliated 3 times to 3.5 cm at 4-weekly intervals in a growth cabinet study. Final plant dry mass and harvestable biomass production were greatest at 17:13. C for alpine rough fescue and plains rough fescue, and at 12:8. C for mountain rough fescue. Harvestable biomass plateaued or declined at the final harvest in all species for temperatures above 12:8.C. Tiller numbers increased at successive harvests. Biomass per tiller declined markedly at the final harvest of alpine rough fescue at all temperatures. Regrowth in alpine rough fescue was markedly reduced at temperatures either above or below the optimum. The results indicate that mountain rough fescue and plains rough fescue are better able to regrow following defoliation at temperatures below or equal to their optima, than at temperatures above their optima. This provides greater understanding of field responses in both species where frequent defoliations are more deleterious after the April/May period when temperatures are above optimal. 3aFestuca altaica 3adefoliation 3aambient temperature 3atillers 3ashoots 3aroots 3aleaf area 3aFestuca campestris 3abiomass production 3aAlberta 3aYukon Territory 0aharvesting frequency 0afestuca hallii1 aHill, M.J.1 aWillms, W.D.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.463-468x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02867naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007400127300001600201520180600217650001602023650002202039650001802061650002502079650001202104650001102116650002602127650002302153650002702176650002102203650002102224651001302245653002602258653001702284700001502301773008502316852000902401930003302410945001302443946001302456655001202469IND2196558520221121032934.0990121e199807  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219655852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillen, R.L.10aNitrogen fertilization of a native grass planting in western Oklahoma  ap. 436-441.  aNative warm-season grass mixtures have been established on the Southern Plains under the USDA Conservation Reserve Program. We studied responses to N fertilizer on such pastures in western Oklahoma over a 4-year period. Experimental pastures were previously cultivated fields with loamy soils seeded to a mixture of native warm-season grasses. Fertilizer treatments were 0 and 35 kg N ha-1 year-1 as ammonium nitrate. Pastures were intensively grazed from early June to early August over 4 years. Stocking rates averaged 52 and 104 AUD ha-1 for the 0 and 35 kg N ha-1 treatments, respectively. These stocking rates are heavy for seasonal grazing in this region. Responses measured included forage mass and nutritive value before and after grazing, plant basal area, and livestock performance. Precipitation was variable but generally favorable over the study period. Peak forage mass was increased by N fertilization (2,480 versus 4,030 kg ha-1; P < 0.01), producing 45 kg forage per kg N applied. Nitrogen fertilization increased crude protein concentration in June (8.2 versus 10.3%; P < 0.05) and August (4.1 versus 4.6%; P < 0.05), but had inconsistent effects on in vitro dry matter digestibility. Total vegetative cover and basal cover of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths) increased in the fertilized pastures. Average daily steer gain was not different between treatments (0.96 versus 1.02 kg hd-1 day-1) even though stocking rates were substantially higher on fertilized pastures. Steer gain ha-1 was increased by fertilization (83 versus 176 kg ha-1, P < 0.01). This resulted in a fertilizer N use efficiency of 2.7 kg steer gain per kg N applied. Nitrogen fertilization combined with intensive summer grazing provided a net return of $0.65 to $0.94 per kg N applied. 3abeef cattle 3agrazing intensity 3astocking rate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3abiomass 3aforage 3abotanical composition 3aBouteloua gracilis 3aBouteloua curtipendula 3arange management 3aapplication rate 3aOklahoma 0agrassland improvement 0aground cover1 aBerg, W.A.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.436-441x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03230naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008000126300001600206500002400222500001500246520172300261650001201984650001801996650001102014650001402025650001802039650002402057650002002081650001802101650001702119650002102136650001902157650002002176650002302196650001602219650001102235650001702246650001902263650002002282650000902302650001902311650001702330651001302347653002202360653001102382653001602393653002302409700001602432700002302448700001602471773008502487852000902572930003302581945001302614946001302627655001202640IND2202715720221121021942.0000224e199907  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220271572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLardy, G.P.10aFirst limiting nutrient for summer calving cows grazing autumn-winter range  ap. 317-326.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aTwo trials were conducted in 1994, 1995, and 1996 to determine the first limiting nutrient for summer calving cows grazing Sandhills range. In Trial 1, 48 lactating summer calving cows grazing native range during the breeding season were assigned to 1 of 4 supplement treatments: 1) control-no supplement, 2) energy, 3) degradable intake protein (DIP), and 4) DIP + undegraded intake protein (UIP). Cows were group-fed supplements in 8 pastures (2 pastures/treatment). The trial began 4 September and ended 4 November each year. Diet samples from esophageally fistulated cows averaged 7.5% crude protein and 54.5% in vitro organic matter digestibility. Supplemented cows lost less body condition compared to control cows (P = 0.04). Cow and calf weight gains were increased by supplemental DIP or DIP + UIP combination compared to energy supplement (P = 0.09 and 0.08, respectively). Forage intake and digestibility were not different among treatments (P > 0.20). Milk production was lower for non-supplemented than supplemented cows (P = 0.10). Trial 2 began 5 November and ended 10 January in 1994-1995, 1995-1996, and 1996-1997. Treatments and pastures were the same as described in Trial 1, however, only 40 cows were used. In Trial 2, diet samples from esophageally fistulated cows averaged 6.2% crude protein and 52.3% in vitro organic matter digestibility. No differences (P > 0.10) in body condition score were detected. Total organic matter intake was lower for control compared to supplemented treatments (13.5 vs.15.5 kg day(-1); P < 0.10). We concluded that DIP was the first limiting nutrient for summer calving cows during the breeding season and during autumn-winter lactation after the breeding season. 3agrazing 3adigestibility 3atallow 3abeef cows 3afiber content 3aambient temperature 3aliveweight gain 3asoybean hulls 3afeather meal 3afeed supplements 3abody condition 3abreeding season 3adigestible protein 3afeed intake 3acalves 3asoybean meal 3apregnancy rate 3adietary protein 3arain 3aprotein intake 3abirth weight 3aNebraska 0aprotected protein 0aforage 0abody weight 0amaize steep liquor1 aAdams, D.C.1 aKlopfenstein, T.J.1 aClark, R.T.0 tJournal of range management.g1999 July, v. 52, no. 4 p.317-326x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02403naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300001600203520144100219650002501660650001601685650001301701650002201714650001201736650001401748650002301762650000901785650002301794650001201817651001201829700001601841700001901857773008501876852000901961930003301970945001302003946001302016655001202029IND2180746020221121022021.0981030e199803  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218074602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuman, G.E.10aCultural methods for establishing Wyoming big sagebrush on mined lands  ap. 223-230.  aWyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) is one of the most widely distributed shrub species in Wyoming and the Rocky Mountain and Northern Plains region. Its reestablishment on mined lands has generally proven difficult however, because of low seedling vigor, an inability to compete with herbaceous species, poor seed quality, and altered edaphic conditions. Field research evaluating the effect of topsoil management, mulching practice, and plant competition have shown that all of these factors significantly influence initial sagebrush establishment. Greater sagebrush establishment occurred on fresh topsoil compared to 5-year-old stockpiled topsoil. Stubble, surface-applied mulch, and elimination of herbaceous competition also significantly increased establishment in the first growing season. A cool, wet second-year growing season (April-September) resulted in large increases in sagebrush seedling density across all treatments; however, soil management and competition treatment effects were still apparent in the second year. Mulch type had limited effects on sagebrush seedling density by the third year of the study. This research indicates that big sagebrush seed viability in the soil is longer than previously thought and that seed dormancy, safe site development, and climactic conditions play important roles in germination, establishment, and seedling survival of this species. 3aArtemisia tridentata 3amined soils 3amulching 3aplant competition 3atopsoil 3aseedlings 3asoil water content 3arain 3aseedling emergence 3adensity 3aWyoming1 aBooth, D.T.1 aCockrell, J.R.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.223-230x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03099naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010000175300001800275520187200293650002402165650001302189650001602202650001502218650001002233650001102243650002402254651001802278651001802296651001802314653001802332653001102350700002102361700002302382700002202405773011702427852000902544856009202553930003302645946001102678655001202689IND4405400220221121002319.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01992.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCLASEN, JESSICA L.10aEvidence that viral abundance across oceans and lakes is driven by different biological factors  ap. 1090-1100.  a1. Samples from 16 lakes in central (n = 145) and western (n = 12) North America, the coastal northeast Pacific (n = 302) and the western Canadian Arctic Oceans (n = 142) were collected and analysed for viral, bacterial and cyanobacterial abundances and chlorophyll-a concentration. 2. Viral abundance was significantly different among the environments. It was highest in the coastal Pacific Ocean and lowest in the coastal Arctic Ocean. The abundances of bacteria and cyanobacteria as well as chlorophyll-a concentrations also differed significantly among the environments, with both bacterial abundance and chlorophyll-a concentration highest in lakes. As a consequence, the association of these variables with viral abundance varied among the environments. 3. Discriminant analyses with the abundance data indicated that the marine and freshwater environments were predictably different from each other. Multiple-regression analysis included bacterial and cyanobacterial abundances, and chlorophyll-a concentration as significant variables in explaining viral abundance in lakes. In regression models for the coastal Pacific Ocean, bacterial and cyanobacterial abundances were significant variables, and for the coastal Arctic Ocean viral abundance was predicted by bacterial abundance and chlorophyll-a concentration. 4. The relationship of viral and bacterial abundance differed between the investigated freshwater and marine environments, probably because of differences in viral production and loss rates. However, freshwaters had fewer viruses compared to bacteria, despite previously documented higher burst sizes and frequencies of infected cells, suggesting that loss rates may be more important in lakes. 5. Together, these findings suggest that there are different drivers of viral abundance in different aquatic environments, including lakes and oceans. 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3achlorophyll 3afreshwater 3alakes 3aoceans 3aregression analysis 3aArctic region 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean 0achlorophyll-a 0amarine1 aBRIGDEN, SEAN M.1 aPAYET, JÉRÔME P.1 aSUTTLE, CURTIS A.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.1090-1100dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01992.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03418naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009800175300001800273520215600291650001302447650002102460650001502481650001002496650001002506650001802516650002102534650001802555650002302573650001102596650001102607650001202618653001802630653001102648653002302659700001902682700002102701773011702722852000902839856009202848930003302940946001102973655001202984IND4405400420221121002313.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01886.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFILIPPINI, MANUELA10aTemporal dynamics of freshwater bacterio- and virioplankton along a littoral-pelagic gradient  ap. 1114-1125.  a1. Viruses have been identified as an important component of plankton communities but their temporal dynamics remain poorly characterized, especially in littoral zones of lakes. Seasonal and diel dynamics of planktonic viruses and their main hosts (i.e. bacteria) were therefore assessed along four parallel transects of a lake, extending from within a littoral reed stand across the littoral shelf to the pelagic zone. 2. Viral abundance ranged from 1.9 to 9.7 x 10⁷ virus-like particles (VLP) mL⁻¹ with distinct seasonal peaks in spring at all locations. Seasonal variation in bacterial abundance varied more than 10-fold (0.85-12 x 10⁶ cells mL⁻¹) and was synchronized with changes in viral abundance. As a result, the ratio of viruses to bacteria (average of 12.5) varied much less over the year. 3. Bacterial production (0.11-0.98 μg C L⁻¹ h⁻¹) and growth rates (0.06-0.85 day⁻¹) also varied seasonally but, in contrast to abundances, high production rates in spring were maintained in mid-summer, particularly in the reed stand, where growth rates were highest. 4. Variation among locations was small in most measured parameters, probably due to extensive exchange between pelagic and littoral water masses. Nevertheless, average bacterial growth and production rates in all seasons were consistently highest in the reed stand. 5. In the August of an exceptionally warm summer, viral and bacterial abundance varied little over a diel cycle (1.23-1.75 x 10⁸ VLP mL⁻¹ and 0.78-1.90 x 10⁷ cells mL⁻¹, respectively) in spite of a trend towards higher values at night. Diel changes in bacterial production (0.23-0.69 μg C L⁻¹ h⁻¹) and growth rate (0.02-0.06 day⁻¹) were more pronounced, with higher values also occurring during the night, possibly indicating that bacterio- and phytoplankton production were not tightly coupled during our diel study. 6. Overall these results indicate that seasonal changes of virio- and bacterioplankton were mainly driven by high microbial activity in spring and were more pronounced than either diel changes on a hot summer day or spatial differences at a scale of 10-100 m. 3abacteria 3abacterioplankton 3afreshwater 3ahosts 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amicrobial growth 3aphytoplankton 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3aviruses 0alake littoral 0aseason 0avirus distribution1 aBUESING, NANNA1 aGessner, Mark O.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.1114-1125dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01886.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02735naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009300174300001600267520156300283653004401846653004501890653002501935653001501960653001401975700002101989700003102010700002102041700002302062773016702085852000902252856009202261930003302353946001102386655001202397IND4405399420221121002203.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440539942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-9876.2007.00614.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitcher, Brandon12aA multi-resolution census algorithm for calculating vortex statistics in turbulent flows  ap. 293-312.  aThe fundamental equations that model turbulent flow do not provide much insight into the size and shape of observed turbulent structures.

Rather than extract the coherent portion of the image from the background variation, as in the classical signal-plus-noise model, we present a model for individual vortices using the non-decimated discrete wavelet transform. A template image, which is supplied by the user, provides the features to be extracted from the vorticity field. By transforming the vortex template into the wavelet domain, specific characteristics that are present in the template, such as size and symmetry, are broken down into components that are associated with spatial frequencies. Multivariate multiple linear regression is used to fit the vortex template to the vorticity field in the wavelet domain. Since all levels of the template decomposition may be used to model each level in the field decomposition, the resulting model need not be identical to the template. Application to a vortex census algorithm that records quantities of interest (such as size, peak amplitude and circulation) as the vorticity field evolves is given. The multiresolution census algorithm extracts coherent structures of all shapes and sizes in simulated vorticity fields and can reproduce known physical scaling laws when processing a set of vorticity fields that evolve over time. 0aMultivariate multiple linear regression 0aNon-decimated discrete wavelet transform 0aPenalized likelihood 0aTurbulence 0aVorticity1 aLee, Thomas C.M.1 aWeiss, J.

As research in this area is somewhat limited and involves highly non-standardized light exposure conditions, the review includes, if deemed necessary, effects observed in other dairy products. Most of these effects may be explained by general lipid oxidation mechanisms combined with knowledge on the spectral balance between the singlet oxygen quencher, β-carotene, and the sensitizer, riboflavin. As determined by Lambert-Beer's law, β-Carotene absorbs light in a concentration-dependent manner, which would otherwise be absorbed by riboflavin, thereby inducing quality changes. Consequently, these processes may be prevented by total exclusion of light and by storage in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Unfortunately, quality changes are apparent at residual oxygen levels even as low as 0.5% in headspace, which is often considered an acceptable residual oxygen level in industry. For a given product composition, spectral distribution and photon flux of the light source determine the extent of quality changes, since photochemical processes have limited temperature dependence, in contrast to the consecutive lipid autoxidation process. Hence, precautionary measures include changes of light source and targeted prevention of photon flux relative to the cheese by use of creative packaging. In order to optimize packaging and display conditions, a substantial need exists for analytical methods, which reflect the sensory perception of the consumer. Once established, optimization to include marketing and consumer aspects will harbor no major obstacles. 3asinglet oxygen 3apackaging 3aindustry 3alipid peroxidation 3ariboflavin 3amarketing 3acheeses 3alipids 3aautoxidation 3aanalytical methods 3atemperature 3aoxygen 0aatmosphere1 aBertelsen, Grete1 aMortensen, Børge K.1 aStapelfeldt, Henrik0 tInternational dairy journal.g2004 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.85-102dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0958-6946(03)00169-9 7aarticle05346naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001800179245013000197300001600327500002400343506007600367520356400443506003704007650001904044650001704063650002004080650002104100650001904121650001004140650000904150650001804159650001904177650002504196650001404221650001604235650002004251650001804271650001204289650001304301650001804314650002504332650002904357650004104386650001404427650002304441650003004464700001804494700001804512700002004530700001904550773010004569852000904669856007804678655001204756IND4443952920221207075943.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444395292DNAL7 a209299002pmid7 aPMC29587842pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcq1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Joo-Hwan10aMolecular phylogenetics of Ruscaceae sensu lato and related families (Asparagales) based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences  ap. 775-790.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Previous phylogenetics studies of Asparagales, although extensive and generally well supported, have left several sets of taxa unclearly placed and have not addressed all relationships within certain clades thoroughly (some clades were relatively sparsely sampled). One of the most important of these is sampling within and placement of Nolinoideae (Ruscaceae s.l.) of Asparagaceae sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III, which subfamily includes taxa previously referred to Convallariaceae, Dracaenaaceae, Eriospermaceae, Nolinaceae and Ruscaceae. METHODS: A phylogenetic analysis of a combined data set for 126 taxa of Ruscaceae s.l. and related groups in Asparagales based on three nuclear and plastid DNA coding genes, 18S rDNA (1796 bp), rbcL (1338 bp) and matK (1668 bp), representing a total of approx. 4·8 kb is presented. Parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted to elucidate relationships of Ruscaceae s.l. and related groups, and parsimony bootstrap analysis was performed to assess support of clades. KEY RESULTS: The combination of the three genes results in the most highly resolved and strongly supported topology yet obtained for Asparagales including Ruscaceae s.l. Asparagales relationships are nearly congruent with previous combined gene analyses, which were reflected in the APG III classification. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yield identical relationships except for some slight variation among the core asparagoid families, which nevertheless form a strongly supported group in both types of analyses. In core asparagoids, five major clades are identified: (1) Alliaceae s.l. (sensu APG III, Amarylidaceae-Agapanthaceae-Alliaceae); (2) Asparagaceae-Laxmanniaceae-Ruscaceae s.l.; (3) Themidaceae; (4) Hyacinthaceae; (5) Anemarrhenaceae-Behniaceae-Herreriaceae-Agavaceae (clades 2-5 collectively Asparagaceae s.l. sensu APG III). The position of Aphyllanthes is labile, but it is sister to Themidaceae in the combined maximum-parsimony tree and sister to Anemarrhenaceae in the Bayesian analysis. The highly supported clade of Xanthorrhoeaceae s.l. (sensu APG III, including Asphodelaceae and Hemerocallidaceae) is sister to the core asparagoids. Ruscaceae s.l. are a well-supported group. Asparagaceae s.s. are sister to Ruscaceae s.l., even though the clade of the two families is weakly supported; Laxmanniaceae are strongly supported as sister to Ruscaceae s.l. and Asparagaceae. Ruscaceae s.l. include six principal clades that often reflect previously named groups: (1) tribe Polygonateae (excluding Disporopsis); (2) tribe Ophiopogoneae; (3) tribe Convallarieae (excluding Theropogon); (4) Ruscaceae s.s. + Dracaenaceae + Theropogon + Disporopsis + Comospermum; (5) Nolinaceae, (6) Eriospermum. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses here were largely conducted with new data collected for the same loci as in previous studies, but in this case from different species/DNA accessions and greater sampling in many cases than in previously published analyses; nonetheless, the results largely mirror those of previously conducted studies. This demonstrates the robustness of these results and answers questions often raised about reproducibility of DNA results, given the often sparse sampling of taxa in some studies, particularly the earliest ones. The results also provide a clear set of patterns on which to base a new classification of the subfamilies of Asparagaceae s.l., particularly Ruscaceae s.l. (= Nolinoideae of Asparagaceae s.l.), and examine other putatively important characters of Asparagales.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmaryllidaceae 3aAsparagaceae 3aBayesian theory 3aXanthorrhoeaceae 3afamily support 3agenes 3aloci 3anew subfamily 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplastid DNA 3areproducibility 3aribosomal DNA 3asisters 3atopology 2aBayes Theorem 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aLiliaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction1 aKim, Dong-Kap1 aForest, Felix1 aFay, Michael F.1 aChase, Mark W.0 tAnnals of botany.g2010 Nov., v. 106, no. 5 p.775-790dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq1673Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02738naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014400172300001600316520165900332650003301991653001902024653002002043653001202063653001502075700002302090700002102113773014502134852000902279856009202288930003302380946001102413655001202424IND4405392820221120220934.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440539282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01022.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakano, Takeshi10aNovel two-step Ca²⁺ increase and its mechanisms and functions at fertilization in oocytes of the annelidan worm Pseudopotamilla occelata  ap. 365-379.  aMature oocytes of the annelidan worm Pseudopotamilla occelata have a wide perivitelline space between the oocyte surface and the vitelline envelope and are arrested at the first metaphase (MI). We found a novel two-step Ca²⁺ increase in normally fertilized oocytes. The first Ca²⁺ increase originated at a cortex situated underneath a fertilizing sperm on the vitelline envelope, but failed to propagate beyond the center of the oocyte. The first localized Ca²⁺ increase was then followed by a larger Ca²⁺ increase starting from the whole oocyte cortex and spreading inwardly to the center. The first localized Ca²⁺ increase at fertilization was suppressed by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, and a similar Ca²⁺ change was induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃). On the other hand, the second global Ca²⁺ increase in fertilized oocytes was blocked by removal of external Ca²⁺ or the voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel blocker D-600, and a similar Ca²⁺ change could be mimicked by addition of excess K⁺ only when external Ca²⁺ was present. These results suggest that the first localized Ca²⁺ increase and the second global Ca²⁺ increase at fertilization are regulated by Ca²⁺ release from IP₃-sensitive stores and Ca²⁺ influx via voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, respectively. Our data also demonstrated that the localized Ca²⁺ increase induces the formation of large cytoplasmic protrusion, which helps the fertilizing sperm to enter the oocyte, whereas the following global Ca²⁺ increase is a prerequisite for the retraction of the cytoplasmic protrusion and the resumption of meiosis from MI. 3afertilization (reproduction) 0acalcium influx 0acalcium release 0aInsP₃ 0apolychaete1 aKyozuka, Keiichiro1 aDeguchi, Ryusaku0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2008 June, v. 50, no. 5 p.365-379dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01022.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245011200190300001600302520136900318650001801687650001201705650003001717650001401747650002301761650005101784650004801835650002501883650000901908650004501917650001901962650004401981650003202025650004402057650002602101653002502127653002202152653002502174653001702199700002202216700002002238700001902258700001602277700002002293700002602313773014502339852000902484856009202493930003302585946001102618655001202629IND4405392320221120221050.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440539232DNAL7 a184622002pmid7 a10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01034.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotoi, Natsuki10aIdentification and characterization of nucleoplasmin 3 as a histone-binding protein in embryonic stem cells  ap. 307-320.  aEmbryonic stem (ES) cells are thought to have unique chromatin structures responsible for their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. To examine this possibility, we sought nuclear proteins in mouse ES cells that specifically bind to histones using a pull-down assay with synthetic peptides of histone H3 and H4 tail domain as baits. Nuclear proteins preferentially bound to the latter. We identified 45 proteins associated with the histone H4 tail and grouped them into four categories: 10 chromatin remodeling proteins, five histone chaperones, two histone modification-related proteins, and 28 other proteins. mRNA expression levels of 20 proteins selected from these 45 proteins were compared between undifferentiated and retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiated ES cells. All of the genes were similarly expressed in both states of ES cells, except nucleoplasmin 3 (NPM3) that was expressed at a higher level in the undifferentiated cells. NPM3 proteins were localized in the nucleoli and nuclei of the cells and expression was decreased during RA-induced differentiation. When transfected with NPM3 gene, ES cells significantly increased their proliferation compared with control cells. The present study strongly suggests that NPM3 is a chromatin remodeling protein responsible for the unique chromatin structure and replicative capacity of ES cells. 3aretinoic acid 2aAnimals 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aCell Line 2aCell Proliferation 2aChromatin Assembly and Disassemblyxphysiology 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aMice 2aNuclear Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNucleoplasmins 2aPhosphoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Bindingxphysiology 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxphysiology 2aTretinoinxphysiology 0achromatin remodeling 0ahistone chaperone 0ahistone modification 0ahistone tail1 aSuzuki, Ken'ichi.1 aHirota, Ryuichi1 aJohnson, Penny1 aOofusa, Ken1 aKikuchi, Yutaka1 aYoshizato, Katsutoshi0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2008 June, v. 50, no. 5 p.307-320dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01034.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01684naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245006200171300001400233500002400247520075000271650002001021650001701041650001201058650001201070650001201082650001001094650001101104650001801115650001301133773014601146852000901292856005701301655001201358IND4456254420221120205710.0110408e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445625442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01383.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoisin, Yves10aQueen replacement in the termite Microcerotermes papuanus  ap. 83-90.  aIncludes references  aIn experimentally orphaned field nests of Microcerotermes papuanus Holmgren, 1911, large numbers of workers develop into replacement reproductives (ergatoids) in only one moult.

Over long time periods, these nymphoids completely replace the ergatoids and the females become physogastric. Although time-efficient, queen replacement seems energetically expensive for the society, suggesting that this process is under weak selective pressure in M. papuanus, compared with sympatric species such as Nasutitermes princeps. 3aMicrocerotermes 3aNasutitermes 3afemales 3ainstars 3amolting 3anests 3anymphs 3areproductives 3asympatry0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1990 July, v. 56, no. 1 p.83-90dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw36083wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01383.x 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013700174300001600311520132700327650001801654650002401672650002001696650001901716650001301735650004401748650001001792650001401802650003101816650003001847650001801877650001401895650001201909650001301921651002101934651001001955653001801965653002101983653002902004653003302033700001502066700002402081700002202105773012202127852000902249856009202258930003302350946001102383655001202394IND4405408820221120195856.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00483.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorador, Cristina10aCyanobacterial diversity in Salar de Huasco, a high altitude saline wetland in northern Chile: an example of geographical dispersion  ap. 419-432.  aThe diversity of Cyanobacteria in water and sediment samples from four representative sites of the Salar de Huasco was examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and analysis of clone libraries of 16S rRNA gene PCR products. Salar de Huasco is a high altitude (3800 m altitude) saline wetland located in the Chilean Altiplano. We analyzed samples from a tributary stream (H0) and three shallow lagoons (H1, H4, H6) that contrasted in their physicochemical conditions and associated biota. Seventy-eight phylotypes were identified in a total of 268 clonal sequences deriving from seven clone libraries of water and sediment samples. Oscillatoriales were frequently found in water samples from sites H0, H1 and H4 and in sediment samples from sites H1 and H4. Pleurocapsales were found only at site H0, while Chroococcales were recovered from sediment samples of sites H0 and H1, and from water samples of site H1. Nostocales were found in sediment samples from sites H1 and H4, and water samples from site H1 and were largely represented by sequences highly similar to Nodularia spumigena. We suggest that cyanobacterial communities from Salar de Huasco are unique - they include sequences related to others previously described from the Antarctic, along with others from diverse, but less extreme environments. 3aChroococcales 3aNodularia spumigena 3aOscillatoriales 3aPleurocapsales 3aaltitude 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aphylotype 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3astreams 3awetlands 3aAntarctic region 3aChile 0a16S rRNA gene 0aandean altiplano 0acyanobacterial diversity 0aathalassohaline water bodies1 aVila, Irma1 aImhoff, Johannes F.1 aWitzel, Karl-Paul0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2008 June, v. 64, no. 3 p.419-432dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00483.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009500192300001600287520062000303650002700923650001300950650002600963650002100989650001701010650001501027650002601042650001601068650000901084650007801093650002801171650004101199650004101240650003001281650001601311650002801327650001401355650002701369650002901396650003401425650002301459650002701482650003601509653001601545653001201561700002001573700002601593773012201619852000901741856009201750930003301842946001101875655001201886IND4405408520221120195924.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540852DNAL7 a183939902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00476.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Stuart E.10aPotential for atmospheric deposition of bacteria to influence bacterioplankton communities  ap. 388-394.  aBiogeographic patterns in microbial communities are an exciting but controversial topic in microbial ecology.

We evaluated the efficacy of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for marking round gobies and tracking their movements with a portable underwater antenna in shallow areas (=105 mm during the final sampling period. Nevertheless, tagging did not increase mortality regardless of size class, and tag retention was 100% for caged fish. Tagged round gobies in a 20 x 20-m² block net avoided detection by the portable underwater antenna, and a high proportion of fish probably escaped from the net, suggesting that round gobies may be more mobile than previously reported. In conclusion, PIT tags are a viable method for individually marking round gobies, but detecting tagged round gobies with a portable underwater antenna, given current technology, does not appear promising in shallow areas with low habitat complexity. 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3afish 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3atransponders 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0agrowth 0amovement 0aportable reader 0aPIT tag1 aRuetz III, C.R.0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2008 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.303-311dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895938x1600-06337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00282.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01724naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245012100174300001600295500002400311520062200335650002800957650001500985650003601000650001601036650002101052650002401073650002701097700002001124700002301144700002301167773013001190852000901320856005701329655001201386IND4451800720221120180210.0110401e199608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445180072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00954.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinan, Laurence10aCertain withanolides from Iochroma gesnerioides antagonize ecdysteroid action in a Drosophila melanogaster cell line  ap. 415-420.  aIncludes references  aSixteen withanolides isolated from Iochroma gesnerioides (Kunth) Miers (Solanaceae) have been assessed for their activities as ecdysteroid agonists and antagonists.

The survival of first instars of F. occidentalis was initially determined by themselves. Then the number of first instars that were killed by a single female adult of A. cucumeris was determined for the same density of thrips. The differences in the mortality between the two experiments were used to calculate the rate of predation by A. cucumeris under a range of temperature and VPD regimes. Rate of predation was expressed as the number of thrips killed per h to account for the different time periods that the trials lasted. A quadratic model was fitted to the data. At a constant temperature, the rate of predation decreased with increasing VPD for VPDs ≤ 1.24 to 1.44 kPa. Above these VPDs, the rate of predation started to increase again. At a constant VPD, the rate of predation decreased slightly at the lower temperatures and increased at the higher temperatures. The rate of change was dependent upon the VPD. By using the quadratic model, the rate of predation can be predicted for the range of hygrothermal conditions that would be encountered in the greenhouse. The optimal condition for maximum rate of predation by A. cucumeris on first instars of F. occidentalis in the greenhouse is a VPD ≤ 0.75 kPa at the recommended production temperatures and VPDs (17 to 25°C and ≤ 1.5 kPa). 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aNeoseiulus cucumeris 3agreenhouses 3aimagos 3ainstars 3amite control 3amodels 3amortality 3apredation 3apredatory mites 3atemperature 3avapor pressure1 aWard, K.I.1 aGillespie, T.J.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1996 Jan., v. 78, no. 1 p.31-38dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26097x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00762.x 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002200136245019200158300001300350500002400363500001500387520178900402650000902191650002302200650002902223650001402252650001702266650001502283650001602298650002302314650002202337653001202359700002002371700001802391700002202409700002502431700002102456700002102477773010502498852000902603856003902612655001202651IND4399325020221120170239.0071223e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439932502DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.66092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaghdadi, Nicolas10aOperational performance of current synthetic aperture radar sensors in mapping soil surface characteristics in agricultural environments: application to hydrological and erosion modelling  ap. 9-20.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are often used to characterize the surface of bare soils in agricultural environments. They enable the soil moisture and roughness to be estimated with constraints linked to the configurations of the sensors (polarization, incidence angle and radar wavelength). These key soil characteristics are necessary for different applications, such as hydrology and risk prediction.This article reviews the potential of currently operational SAR sensors and those planned for the near future to characterize soil surface as a function of users' needs. It details what it is possible to achieve in terms of mapping soil moisture and roughness by specifying optimal radar configurations and the precision associated with the estimation of soil surface characteristics.The summary carried out for the present article shows that mapping soil moisture is optimal with SAR sensors at low incidence angles (<35 ). This configuration, which enables an estimated moisture accuracy greater than 6% is possible several times a month taking into account all the current and future sensors. Concerning soil roughness, it is best mapped using three classes (smooth, moderately rough, and rough). Such mapping requires high-incidence data, which is possible with certain current sensors (RADARSAT-1 and ASAR both in band C). When L-band sensors (ALOS) become available, this mapping accuracy should improve because the sensitivity of the radar signal to Soil Surface Characteristics (SSC) increases with wavelength. Finally, the polarimetric mode of certain imminent sensors (ALOS, RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X, etc.), and the possibility of acquiring data at very high spatial resolution (metre scale), offer great potential in terms of improving the quality of SSC mapping. 3arisk 3aagricultural soils 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aroughness 3asoil surveys 3asoil water 3awavelengths 3aangle of incidence 3ahydrologic models 0asensors1 aCerdan, Olivier1 aZribi, Mehrez1 aAuzet, Véronique1 aDarboux, Frédéric.1 aEl Hajj, Mahmoud1 aKheir, Rania Bou0 tHydrological processes.g2008 Jan. 01, v. 22, no. 1 p.9-20dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6609 7aarticle03173naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002100161245006800182300001600250520179400266592002802060650002002088650001302108650001402121650002102135650002102156650001802177650001502195650001102210650001002221650001102231650003602242650002102278650001502299653001602314653001602330653003202346700001702378700001802395773012102413852000902534856010102543930003302644945001302677946001302690655001202703IND2051729620221120170330.0960617e199603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205172962DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHotchkiss, J. R.10aPersistance and Single-Plant Productivity in Nondormant Alfalfa  ap. 336-340.  aPlant mortality is generally substantial in alfalfa (L.) fields both at establishment and during the productive life of the stand. Most research has examined the effects of mortality on alfalfa yield per unit area. Consequences of mortality within a population on single*plant productivity have received relatively little attention. Understanding the basis for this mortality could affect management practices and the breeding and testing of alfalfa cultivars. The objective of this study was to describe agronomic, morphological, and physiological traits associated with persistence in nondormant alfalfa. This was accomplished by comparing two populations of S progenies derived from 60 surviving 6-yr-old plants from a commercial field of ‘CUF-101’ (=field-derived [FD] population) and 60 greenhouse-grown CUF-101 plants (=greenhouse-derived [GHD] population) in field and greenhouse trials at Tucson, AZ. In a field trial, crown mortality, as measured by the percent live stems, did not differ significantly between the populations. Total forage yield, yield in winter and spring, and stem elongation rates were significantly greater in the GHD population. Root weight, total plant weight, root/shoot weight ratio, and concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates in the root were significantly greater in the FD population in a greenhouse trial. Differences observed between the two populations are consistent with the elimination of presumably less competitive plants with smaller root systems and plants intolerant of grazing in the winter and early spring. This research suggests that mortality within stands of nondormant alfalfa is less likely for plants with larger roots and generally slower growth patterns that are typically associated with increased fall dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3adormancy 3acultivars 3aagronomic traits 3aplant morphology 3acarbohydrates 3acrop yield 3aforage 3aroots 3ashoots 3achemical constituents of plants 3aroot shoot ratio 3apopulation 0agrowth rate 0apersistence 0anonstructural carbohydrates1 aSmith, S.

For experiment 1, portions of fetal villi (200 mg) were incubated for 48 hours with 0, 10, 100, and 1,000 ng of cortisol/ml with [3H]androstenedione (3H-A) or [3H]pregnenolone (3H-P5). Villi were also incubated for 4, 28, and 52 hours with or without cortisol (500 ng/ml) and with 3H-A or 3H-P5 (experiment 2). The conversion of various [3H]steroid metabolites such as A, P5, 17 alpha-OH-pregnenolone (17 alpha-OH-P5), progesterone (P4), 17 alpha-OH-P4, cholesterol (chol), and chol plus lipoprotein (500 micrograms/ml) into estrogen was measured during a 4-hour incubation (experiment 3). In experiment 1, cortisol increased conversion of 3H-A and 3H-P5 into estrogen by 3 to 41% and 7 to 34%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). In experiment 2, times of incubation did not influence conversion of 3H-A into estrogen, which, however, was increased significantly (P < 0.05) over all times of incubation by administration of 500 ng of cortisol/ml. Conversion of 3H-P5 into estrogen increased over time of incubation and was stimulated by cortisol (P < 0.05). However, there was no interaction between cortisol treatment and time of incubation. In experiment 3, conversion of 3H-A, 3H-P5, and 3H-17 alpha-OH-P5 into estrogen was greater than the conversion of the other precursors tested. Mean conversion of 3H-A, 3H-P5, 3H-17 alpha-OH-P5, 3H-P, 3H-17 alpha-OH-P4, 3H-chol, and 3H-chol plus lipoprotein was 23%, 10.6%, 11.0%, 1.8%, 1.8%, 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Our results suggest that, in cows, the delta 5 pathway is the preferred pathway for placental estrogen synthesis and that cortisol directly stimulates estrogen production, probably by activating enzymes involved in this pathway. 3acows 3aplacenta 3acortisol 3abiochemical pathways 2aAndrostenedionexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aChorionic Villixdrug effects 2aCulture Techniques 2aEstrogensxbiosynthesis 2aFemale 2aHydrocortisonexpharmacology 2aPlacentaxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnenolonexmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0ain vitro 0aestrogen synthesis 0adelta 5 pathway 0adelta 4 pathway1 aWeston, P.G.1 aWagner, W.C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1990 July, v. 51, no. 7 p.1012-1015x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02731naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245011300199300001200312506007600324520131400400506003701714650002101751650002101772650001101793650001401804650001601818650001901834650002201853650001801875650003901893650002501932650002201957650001601979700002101995773008002016852000902096856007902105856005702184930003302241946001102274655001202285IND4390493720221207075300.0070416e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049372DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl11712doi7 aPMC18650672pmcid7 a172641222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandmann, Nina10aCombinatorial expression vector engineering for tuning of recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli  ap. e32.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complex and integrated nature of both genetic and protein level factors influencing recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli makes it difficult to predict the optimal expression strategy for a given protein. Here, two combinatorial library strategies were evaluated for their capability of tuning recombinant protein production in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Large expression vector libraries were constructed through either conservative (ExLib1) or free (ExLib2) randomization of a seven-amino-acid window strategically located between a degenerated start codon and a sequence encoding a fluorescently tagged target protein. Flow cytometric sorting and analyses of libraries, subpopulations or individual clones were followed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing analyses. For ExLib1, intracellular accumulation of soluble protein was shown to be affected by codon specific effects at some positions of the common N-terminal extension. Interestingly, for ExLib2 where the same sequence window was randomized via seven consecutive NN(G/T) tri-nucleotide repeats, high product levels (up to 24-fold higher than a reference clone) were associated with a preferential appearance of novel SD-like sequences. Possible mechanisms behind the observed effects are discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aWestern blotting 3aclones 3acytoplasm 3aengineering 3aflow cytometry 3amass spectrometry 3anucleic acids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arecombinant proteins 3asequence analysis 3astart codon1 aNygren, Per-Åke0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 5 p.e32-e32x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl11713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245008200200300001200282506007600294520147800370506003701848650000801885650002001893650001301913650001601926650002001942650003001962650002601992650001102018700001602029700001702045700002402062773008002086852000902166856007902175856005702254930003302311946001102344990002302355655001202378IND4390493120221207075419.0070416e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049312DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl11342doi7 aPMC18650592pmcid7 a172592132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrich, Mathias12aA new method for accurate assessment of DNA quality after bisulfite treatment  ap. e29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe covalent addition of methylgroups to cytosine has become the most intensively researched epigenetic DNA marker. The vast majority of technologies used for DNA methylation analysis rely on a chemical reaction, the so-called 'bisulfite treatment', which introduces methylation-dependent sequence changes through selective chemical conversion of non-methylated cytosine to uracil. After treatment, all non-methylated cytosine bases are converted to uracil but all methylated cytosine bases remain cytosine. These methylation dependent C-to-T changes can subsequently be studied using conventional DNA analysis technologies. The bisulfite conversion protocol is susceptible to processing errors, and small deviation from the protocol can result in failure of the treatment. Several attempts have been made to simplify the procedure and increase its robustness. Although significant achievements in this area have been made, bisulfite treatment remains the main source of process variability in the analysis of DNA methylation. This variability in particular impairs assays, which strive for the quantitative assessment of DNA methylation. Here we present basic mathematical considerations, which should be taken into account when analyzing DNA methylation. We also introduce a PCR-based assay, which allows ab initio assessment of the DNA quality after bisulfite treatment and can help to prevent inaccurate quantitative measurement resulting from poor bisulfite treatment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3acytosine 3aepigenetics 3agenetic markers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3auracil1 aZoll, Scott1 aSur, Sudipto1 aBoom, Dirk van den.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 5 p.e29-e29x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl11343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02629naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001400179245010000193300001800293506007600311520091100387506003701298650000801335650002501343650002101368650001701389650001201406650000901418650001401427650001401441650001201455700002401467700001801491700001801509700002201527700001601549700002901565700002501594700002101619700002501640700002901665700002201694700002101716700001601737773008201753852000901835856007801844856007401922930003301996946001102029990002302040655001202063IND4391139820221207075437.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439113982DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0492doi7 aPMC18746432pmcid7 a173896442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhong14aThe protein that binds to DNA base J in trypanosomatids has features of a thymidine hydroxylase  ap. 2107-2115.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrypanosomatids contain an unusual DNA base J (β-D-glucosylhydroxymethyluracil), which replaces a fraction of thymine in telomeric and other DNA repeats. To determine the function of base J, we have searched for enzymes that catalyze J biosynthesis. We present evidence that a protein that binds to J in DNA, the J-binding protein 1 (JBP1), may also catalyze the first step in J biosynthesis, the conversion of thymine in DNA into hydroxymethyluracil. We show that JBP1 belongs to the family of Fe²⁺ and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and that replacement of conserved residues putatively involved in Fe²⁺ and 2-oxoglutarate-binding inactivates the ability of JBP1 to contribute to J synthesis without affecting its ability to bind to J-DNA. We propose that JBP1 is a thymidine hydroxylase responsible for the local amplification of J inserted by JBP2, another putative thymidine hydroxylase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aTrypanosomatidae 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3airon 3atelomeres 3athymidine 3athymine1 aGenest, Paul-André1 ater Riet, Bas1 aSweeney, Kate1 aDiPaolo, Courtney1 aKieft, Rudo1 aChristodoulou, Evangelos1 aPerrakis, Anastassis1 aSimmons, Jana M.1 aHausinger, Robert P.1 avan Luenen, Henri G.A.M.1 aRigden, Daniel J.1 aSabatini, Robert1 aBorst, Piet0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.2107-2115x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0493Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02800naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245014300200300001800343506007600361520122900437506003701666650001501703650001501718650001901733650001101752650001801763650001501781650001301796650001301809650001501822650001401837650001101851700001601862700001901878700002801897700002501925700001901950700002001969700001801989773008202007852000902089856007802098856007402176930003302250946001102283655001202294IND4391143620221207080415.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114362DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1272doi7 aPMC18746552pmcid7 a173896482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrmann, Gernot10aConserved interactions of the splicing factor Ntr1/Spp382 with proteins involved in DNA double-strand break repair and telomere metabolism  ap. 2321-2332.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ligation of DNA double-strand breaks in the process of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is accomplished by a heterodimeric enzyme complex consisting of DNA ligase IV and an associated non-catalytic factor. This DNA ligase also accounts for the fatal joining of unprotected telomere ends. Hence, its activity must be tightly controlled. Here, we describe interactions of the DNA ligase IV-associated proteins Lif1p and XRCC4 of yeast and human with the putatively orthologous G-patch proteins Ntr1p/Spp382p and NTR1/TFIP11 that have recently been implicated in mRNA splicing. These conserved interactions occupy the DNA ligase IV-binding sites of Lif1p and XRCC4, thus preventing the formation of an active enzyme complex. Consistently, an excess of Ntr1p in yeast reduces NHEJ efficiency in a plasmid ligation assay as well as in a chromosomal double-strand break repair (DSBR) assay. Both yeast and human NTR1 also interact with PinX1, another G-patch protein that has dual functions in the regulation of telomerase activity and telomere stability, and in RNA processing. Like PinX1, NTR1 localizes to telomeres and associates with nucleoli in yeast and human cells, suggesting a function in localized control of DSBR.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3acell nucleolus 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3atelomerase 3atelomeres 3ayeasts1 aKais, Sanja1 aHoffbauer, Jan1 aShah-Hosseini, Kijwasch1 aBrüggenolte, Nicole1 aSchober, Heiko1 aFäsi, Margaret1 aSchär, Primo0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.2321-2332x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245004700198300001800245506007600263520101600339506003701355650000801392650001401400650003001414650001801444700001801462700001901480700001901499700001801518700001801536773008201554852000901636856007801645856007401723930003301797946001101830990002301841655001201864IND4391144320221207080404.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114432DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1432doi7 aPMC18746502pmcid7 a173896422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMironova, N.L.10aRNase T1 mimicking artificial ribonuclease  ap. 2356-2367.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecently, artificial ribonucleases (aRNases)--conjugates of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and peptide (LR)₄-G-amide--were designed and assessed in terms of the activity and specificity of RNA cleavage. The conjugates were shown to cleave RNA at Pyr-A and G-X sequences. Variations of oligonucleotide length and sequence, peptide and linker structure led to the development of conjugates exhibiting G-X cleavage specificity only. The most efficient catalyst is built of nonadeoxyribonucleotide of unique sequence and peptide (LR)₄-G-NH₂ connected by the linker of three abasic deoxyribonucleotides (conjugate pep-9). Investigation of the cleavage specificity of conjugate pep-9 showed that the compound is the first single-stranded guanine-specific aRNase, which mimics RNase T1. Rate enhancement of RNA cleavage at G-X linkages catalysed by pep-9 is 10⁸ compared to non-catalysed reaction, pep-9 cleaves these linkages only 10⁵-fold less efficiently than RNase T1 (kcat_RNase T₁/kcat_pep₋₉ = 10⁵).0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3acatalysts 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aribonucleases1 aPyshnyi, D.V.1 aShtadler, D.V.1 aFedorova, A.A.1 aVlassov, V.V.1 aZenkova, M.A.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.2356-2367x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1433Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02843naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245013200200300001800332506007600350520134000426506003701766650000801803650001501811650001901826650002301845650001701868650002501885650001301910650003001923700002501953700002901978700001902007700002502026700002402051773008202075852000902157856007802166856007402244930003302318946001102351990002302362655001202385IND4391144720221207080419.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114472DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1642doi7 aPMC18746592pmcid7 a173923422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukackaite, Rasa10aRestriction endonuclease BpuJI specific for the 5'-CCCGT sequence is related to the archaeal Holliday junction resolvase family  ap. 2377-2389.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aType IIS restriction endonucleases (REases) recognize asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands at fixed positions downstream of the recognition site. REase BpuJI recognizes the asymmetric sequence 5'-CCCGT, however it cuts at multiple sites in the vicinity of the target sequence. We show that BpuJI is a dimer, which has two DNA binding surfaces and displays optimal catalytic activity when bound to two recognition sites. BpuJI is cleaved by chymotrypsin into an N-terminal domain (NTD), which lacks catalytic activity but binds specifically to the recognition sequence as a monomer, and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which forms a dimer with non-specific nuclease activity. Fold recognition approach reveals that the CTD of BpuJI is structurally related to archaeal Holliday junction resolvases (AHJR). We demonstrate that the isolated catalytic CTD of BpuJI possesses end-directed nuclease activity and preferentially cuts 3 nt from the 3'-terminus of blunt-ended DNA. The nuclease activity of the CTD is repressed in the apo-enzyme and becomes activated upon specific DNA binding by the NTDs. This leads to a complicated pattern of specific DNA cleavage in the vicinity of the target site. Bioinformatics analysis identifies the AHJR-like domain in the putative Type III enzymes and functionally uncharacterized proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3abioinformatics 3acatalytic activity 3achymotrypsin 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3arestriction endonucleases1 aLagunavicius, Arunas1 aStankevicius, Kornelijus1 aUrbanke, Claus1 aVenclovas, Česlovas1 aSiksnys, Virginijus0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.2377-2389x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1643Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03380naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245011400194300001600308500002400324520180100348650002602149650001602175650001202191650000902203650001602212650002002228650001302248650001502261650001102276650002302287650001702310650001202327650005102339650002302390650002702413650002202440650001102462650002802473650004102501650004302542650001902585651000902604700002202613700002202635773011102657852000902768856008502777655001202862IND4463706020221122173203.0120727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446370602DNAL7 a219395762pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299110006902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajala-Schultz, Päivi J.10aMilk yield and somatic cell count during the following lactation after selective treatment of cows at dry-off  ap. 489-499.  aIncludes references  aSelective dry cow therapy (SDCT) has received increasing attention in recent years owing to global concerns over agricultural use of antimicrobial drugs and development of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of SDCT on milk yield and somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy herds in the USA. Cows in four Ohio dairy herds were categorized into two groups (low-SCC and high-SCC) at dry-off based on their SCC and clinical mastitis (CM) history during the lactation preceding the dry-off. Low-SCC cows were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive intramammary antibiotics at dry-off. Milk yield and SCC of these cows during the following lactation were compared using linear mixed effects models, adjusting for parity, calving season, stage of lactation, previous lactation milk yield and herd. Milk yield of untreated and treated low-SCC cows at dry-off did not differ significantly during the following lactation. Overall, treated low-SCC cows had 16% lower SCC (approximately 35 000 cells/ml, P=0·0267) than the untreated cows during the following lactation; however, the effect was variable in different herds. Moreover the impact of treatment, or the lack thereof, on milk yield varied considerably between herds. The results suggested that in some herds treating all cows at dry-off may be beneficial while in other herds leaving healthy cows without antibiotic dry cow treatment has no negative impact on milk yield or milk quality (SCC), and in fact, may be beneficial. Further studies are needed to identify characteristics of herds where treating all cows routinely at dry-off may be needed for maintaining good udder health and where switching to selective treatment of cows at dry-off would be the optimal approach to achieve best results. 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3acalving 3acows 3adairy herds 3alactation stage 3amastitis 3amilk yield 3amodels 3asomatic cell count 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMammary Glands, Animalxdrug effects 2aMastitis, Bovinexprevention & control 2aMilkxcytology 3aOhio1 aTorres, Audrey H.1 aDeGraves, Fred J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2011 Nov., v. 78, no. 4 p.489-499dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299110006903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02602naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245008900198300001800287506007600305520121700381506003701598650000801635650003201643650002301675650002101698650002201719650001101741650001401752650001101766650001301777650001901790650002001809700002001829700002101849773008101870852000901951856007801960856007402038930003302112946001102145655001202156IND4391717420221207074941.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171742DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1262doi7 aPMC18888162pmcid7 a174399622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, George C.10aLoop II of DNA polymerase beta is important for polymerization activity and fidelity  ap. 2924-2935.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe accurate replication and transmission of genetic information is critical in the life of an organism. During its entire lifespan, the genetic information is constantly under attack from endogenous and exogenous sources of damage. To ensure that the content of its genetic information is faithfully preserved for synthesis and transmission, eukaryotic cells have developed a complex system of genomic quality control. Key players in this process are DNA polymerases, the enzymes responsible for synthesizing the DNA, because errors introduced into the genome by polymerase can result in mutations. We use DNA polymerase beta (pol β) as a model system to investigate mechanisms of preserving fidelity during nucleotide incorporation. In the study described here, we characterized the role that loop II of pol β plays in maintaining the activity and fidelity of pol β. We report here that the absence or shortening of loop II compromises the catalytic activity of pol β. Our data also show that loop variants of a specific length have a lower fidelity when compared to the wild-type polymerase. Taken together, our results indicate that loop II is important for the catalytic activity and fidelity of pol β.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acatalytic activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3aexogenous sources 3agenome 3alongevity 3amodels 3amutation 3apolymerization 3aquality control1 aJaeger, Joachim1 aSweasy, Joann B.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.2924-2935x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1263Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02750naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245007900200300001800279506007600297520130000373506003701673650002101710650002701731650001101758650001001769650000901779650001301788650002101801700002101822700001701843700003201860700001701892700001901909700002301928700002001951773008101971852000902052856007802061856007402139930003302213946001102246990002302257655001202280IND4391717020221207075007.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171702DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0242doi7 aPMC18888272pmcid7 a174399652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrützfeldt, Jan10aSpecificity, duplex degradation and subcellular localization of antagomirs  ap. 2885-2892.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of 20-23-nt long regulators of gene expression. The study of miRNA function in mice and potential therapeutic approaches largely depend on modified oligonucleotides. We recently demonstrated silencing miRNA function in mice using chemically modified and cholesterol-conjugated RNAs termed 'antagomirs'. Here, we further characterize the properties and function of antagomirs in mice. We demonstrate that antagomirs harbor optimized phosphorothioate modifications, require >19-nt length for highest efficiency and can discriminate between single nucleotide mismatches of the targeted miRNA. Degradation of different chemically protected miRNA/antagomir duplexes in mouse livers and localization of antagomirs in a cytosolic compartment that is distinct from processing (P)-bodies indicates a degradation mechanism independent of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Finally, we show that antagomirs, although incapable of silencing miRNAs in the central nervous system (CNS) when injected systemically, efficiently target miRNAs when injected locally into the mouse cortex. Our data further validate the effectiveness of antagomirs in vivo and should facilitate future studies to silence miRNAs for functional analysis and in clinically relevant settings.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3acentral nervous system 3acortex 3aliver 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aoligonucleotides1 aKuwajima, Satoru1 aBraich, Ravi1 aRajeev, Kallanthottathil G.1 aPeña, John.1 aTuschl, Thomas1 aManoharan, Muthiah1 aStoffel, Markus0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.2885-2892x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0243Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01943naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003000149245009800179300001600277500002400293520080000317650001301117650000901130650001701139650001701156650003801173650001301211650001201224650002401236650001701260650002301277650001801300700003101318700003201349773009001381852000901471856008901480655001201569IND4463775420221122003920.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377542DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00149-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez del Angel, Sandra10aStudy of denaturation of corn proteins during storage using differential scanning calorimetry  ap. 531-540.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of storage temperature and grain moisture content on thermal properties of protein fractions of a commercial corn hybrid were studied by differential scanning calorimetry.

While yeast CAF1 displays deadenylase activity, this activity is not required for its deadenylation function in vivo, and CCR4 is the primary deadenylase in the complex. In order to identify CAF1-specific functional regions required for deadenylation in vivo, we targeted for mutagenesis six regions of CAF1 that are specifically conserved among CAF1 orthologs. Defects in residues 213-215, found to be a site required for binding CCR4, reduced the rate of deadenylation to a lesser extent and resulted in in vivo phenotypes that were less severe than did defects in other regions of CAF1 that displayed greater contact to CCR4. These results imply that CAF1, while affecting deadenylation through its contact to CCR4, has functions in deadenylation separate from its contact to CCR4. Synthetic lethalities of caf1Δ, but not that of ccr4Δ, with defects in DHH1 or PAB1, both of which are involved in translation, further supports a role of CAF1 separate from that of CCR4. Importantly, other mutations in PAB1 that reduced translation, while not affecting deadenylation by themselves or when combined with ccr4Δ, severely blocked deadenylation when coupled with a caf1 deletion. These results indicate that both CAF1 and factors involved in translation are required for deadenylation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCCR4 receptor 3amessenger RNA 3amutagenesis 3aphenotype 3atranslation (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aChiang, Yueh-Chin1 aLee, Darren J.1 aYao, Gang1 aZhang, Chongxu1 aDenis, Clyde L.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.3002-3015x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245008200154300001800236500002400254520154600278650001101824650001901835650002501854650002101879650001101900650001101911650001201922650002301934650002201957650001301979650002501992650001802017650001602035650001002051650001102061650002402072700002002096700001802116700001702134700001402151773014702165852000902312856007702321655001202398IND4463756420221121234114.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375642DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzyakov, Y.10aEffect of nitrogen fertilisation on below-ground carbon allocation in lettuce  ap. 1432-1441.  aIncludes references  aThe aims of this study were to investigate the effect of nitrogen (N) fertilisation on the below-ground carbon (C) translocation by lettuce and the CO2 efflux from its rhizosphere. Two N fertilisation levels (80 and 160 kg N ha−1) and two growth stages (43 and 60 days) were tested. 14C pulse labelling of shoots followed by 14C monitoring in the soil, roots, microbial biomass and CO2 efflux from the soil was used to distinguish between root-derived and soil organic matter-derived C. The 14C allocation in the below-ground plant parts was 1.5–4.6 times lower than in the leaves. The total quantity of C translocated into the soil was much lower than in the case of cereals and grasses, amounting to 120 and 160 kg C ha−1 for low and high N respectively. N fertilisation diminished the proportion of assimilated C translocated below ground. About 5–8% of the assimilated C was respired into the rhizosphere. Root-derived CO2 (the sum of root respiration and rhizomicrobial respiration) represented about 15–60% of the total CO2 efflux from the planted soil. Two peaks were measured in the 14CO2 efflux: the first peak (4–5 h after labelling) was attributed to root respiration, whilst the second peak (12 h after labelling) was attributed to microbial respiration of exudates. Twelve days after labelling, 0.15–0.25% of the assimilated C was found in the microbial biomass. The higher microbial activity in the lettuce rhizosphere doubled the soil organic matter decomposition rate compared with unplanted soil. 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adevelopmental stages 3afertilizer rates 3agrains 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic soils 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil organic matter1 aSiniakina, S.V.1 aRuehlmann, J.1 aDomanski, G.1 aStahr, K.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1432-1441dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02860naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002400137245010900161300001800270500002400288520144700312650001501759650002401774650001601798650001101814650001101825650001401836650002401850650001201874650001901886650001701905650002601922650002201948650001301970650001201983650002301995650001202018650002002030650001402050650001002064650002402074700002202098700002502120773014702145852000902292856007702301655001202378IND4463756820221121234057.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375682DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.11922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdebiyi, Abayomi P.10aEffects of processing conditions and packaging material on the quality attributes of dry-roasted peanuts  ap. 1465-1471.  aIncludes references  aFive different processing conditions of raw shelled unblanched peanuts were investigated. The first two treatments involved soaking the peanuts in tap water for 10 and 30 min respectively, then mixing thoroughly with dry NaCl before roasting. Another two treatments involved soaking the peanuts in saturated brine solution for 10 and 30 min respectively before roasting. Unsalted roasted peanuts served as the control. Packaging and storage studies were carried out by packaging the differently treated dry-roasted peanuts in four different packaging materials and storing them under three different relative humidities for 3 months at ambient temperature. Proximate composition, NaCl content, peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid value were determined and sensory evaluation tests were carried out. Salting was found to improve the taste, flavour and overall acceptability of dry-roasted peanuts but had no effect on shelf-life. Peanuts treated in saturated brine solution for 30 min before roasting were the most preferred. The control packaging material, 18 µm transparent polyethylene, was found to be inadequate for protecting the quality attributes of dry-roasted peanuts, with mould growth being observed on the 42nd day of storage at 80% relative humidity. However, acceptable results were obtained with 45 µm transparent polypropylene. The mean sensory scores and objective tests were found to be negatively correlated. 3aacid value 3aambient temperature 3acorrelation 3aflavor 3amixing 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apeanuts 3aperoxide value 3apolyethylene 3aproximate composition 3arelative humidity 3aroasting 3asalting 3asensory evaluation 3asoaking 3asodium chloride 3atap water 3ataste 3athiobarbituric acid1 aAdeyemi, Isaac A.1 aOlorunda, Ayodele O.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1465-1471dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.11923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02151naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100003000137245015200167300001800319500002400337520088500361650002101246650001701267650001001284650002301294650001101317650003401328650001101362650001001373650001701383650001301400650001201413650001501425700002601440700002701466700002701493773014701520852000901667856007701676655001201753IND4463757320221121234124.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375732DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.12092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoliva-Fortuny, Robert C.10aBrowning, polyphenol oxidase activity and headspace gas composition during storage of minimally processed pears using modified atmosphere packaging  ap. 1490-1496.  aIncludes references  aModified atmosphere packaging was used to prevent browning of minimally processed Conference pears, thus extending their shelf-life. Colour changes as well as PPO activity were strongly influenced by the package headspace gas composition, which was determined by the packaging conditions. The initial colour of minimally processed pears was preserved for several weeks under cold storage in plastic pouches of very low O2 permeability and an initial atmosphere of 100% N2. A fractional conversion kinetic model fitted the experimental browning data with high accuracy. Colour degradation (ΔE*) of minimally processed pears occurred exponentially (kΔE = 0.019–0.077 day−1) owing to changes in lightness (kL = 0.021–0.07 day−1). In contrast, PPO exhibited a linear increase in activity which could be related to the availability of O2 in the package headspace. 3acatechol oxidase 3acold storage 3acolor 3aheadspace analysis 3amodels 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxygen 3apears 3apermeability 3aplastics 3apouches 3ashelf life1 aBiosca-Biosca, Mireia1 aGrigelmo-Miguel, Nuria1 aMartín-Belloso, Olga.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1490-1496dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01995naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245011400151300001800265500002400283520094900307650001201256650002501268650001601293650002201309650002001331650001301351650001301364650004401377700001501421773014701436852000901583856007701592655001201669IND4463757220221121234034.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375722DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.12162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, S.K.10aAccumulation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in cured pork sausages treated with propolis extracts  ap. 1487-1489.  aIncludes references  aPropolis collected by bees has many components that possess antifungal, anticancer and antioxidant properties.

Chlorophyll pigments decreased and eventually disappeared from the red cultivars during ripening. In contrast, the green cultivar Negral, a chlorophyll-retaining variety, showed reduced disappearance of chlorophyll pigments, and the fully ripe fruits retained chlorophylls. Chlorophyllase activity followed a consistent pattern of variation in all the red cultivars which was concomitant with the disappearance of chlorophyll. In the ripe stage the six red cultivars preserved their chlorophyllase activity, reflecting a high rate of chloroplast-to-chromoplast transformation. The green cultivar (Negral) showed maximum chlorophyllase activity in the late stages of ripening. Thus increasing activity of chlorophyllase, a constitutive chloroplast enzyme, could be associated with a new genesis of both chloroplast (regreening) and chromoplast constituents. The coexistence of chlorophyll and a high level of chlorophyllase activity in ripe fruits of the Negral cultivar suggests that chlorophyll catabolism may be affected in several ways, eg by the presence of other chlorophyll-degrading enzymes, by restricted chlorophyll and chlorophyllase contact or by delayed degeneration of chloroplast structures. 3aCapsicum annuum 3achlorophyll 3achlorophyllase 3achloroplasts 3acultivars 3afruits 3ametabolism 3apigments 3aripening1 aMínguez Mosquera, Ma.

This paper deals with the free amino acid profile of Manchego cheese made with a defined starter culture, the same defined strain starter culture and an adjunct culture (Lactobacillus plantarum) or a commercial starter. Manchego cheeses made with the defined strain starter cultures reached higher concentrations of total free amino acids at the end of the ripening period than did cheeses made with the commercial starter culture. Principal components analysis (PCA) applied to the three types of Manchego cheeses at different ripening times divided the samples into two general groups: cheeses with a short ripening period (15 and 45 days), with low concentrations of Phe, Val, Leu, Cys and Tyr, and cheeses with higher ripening times (90 and 150 days), with higher contents of these free amino acids. The variable ripening time seemed to be more important than the variable starter culture for differentiating the samples on the basis of their free amino acid concentrations. 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aamino acids 3acheese ripening 3afree amino acids 3amanchego cheese 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteolysis 3asensory properties 3astarter cultures1 aCabezas, Lourdes1 aMcSweeney, Paul L.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2004, v. 84, no. 2 p.213-218dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00204-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245016300201300001800364506007600382520130800458506003701766650002501803650001101828650001601839650001201855650001801867650002301885650001401908700001601922700001701938700002401955700001601979700001901995700001502014700002902029700001702058773008202075852000902157856007802166856005702244930003302301946001102334990002302345655001202368IND4390491720221207075257.0070416e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049172DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0652doi7 aPMC18650522pmcid7 a173083452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Denise S.B.10aInteraction between trichosanthin, a ribosome-inactivating protein, and the ribosomal stalk protein P2 by chemical shift perturbation and mutagenesis analyses  ap. 1660-1672.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrichosanthin (TCS) is a type I ribosome-inactivating protein that inactivates ribosome by enzymatically depurinating the A⁴³²⁴ at the α-sarcin/ricin loop of 28S rRNA. We have shown in this and previous studies that TCS interacts with human acidic ribosomal proteins P0, P1 and P2, which constitute the lateral stalk of eukaryotic ribosome. Deletion mutagenesis showed that TCS interacts with the C-terminal tail of P2, the sequences of which are conserved in P0, P1 and P2. The P2-binding site on TCS was mapped to the C-terminal domain by chemical shift perturbation experiments. Scanning charge-to-alanine mutagenesis has shown that K173, R174 and K177 in the C-terminal domain of TCS are involved in interacting with the P2, presumably through forming charge-charge interactions to the conserved DDD motif at the C-terminal tail of P2. A triple-alanine variant K173A/R174A/K177A of TCS, which fails to bind P2 and ribosomal stalk in vitro, was found to be 18-fold less active in inhibiting translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that interaction with P-proteins is required for full activity of TCS. In an analogy to the role of stalk proteins in binding elongation factors, we propose that interaction with acidic ribosomal stalk proteins help TCS to locate its RNA substrate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3ahumans 3amutagenesis 3arabbits 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes1 aChu, Lai-On1 aLee, Ka-Ming1 aToo, Priscilla H.M.1 aMa, Kit-Wan1 aSze, Kong-Hung1 aZhu, Guang1 aShaw, P.-C.q(Pang-Chui)1 aWong, Kam-Bo0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 5 p.1660-1672x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02532naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245009500197300001800292506007600310520125400386506003701640650000801677650001201685650001701697650001201714650002501726650001901751650001401770650001401784650001401798700002301812773008201835852000901917856007801926856007402004930003302078946001102111655001202122IND4391148420221207080420.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114842DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0982doi7 aPMC18856472pmcid7 a173956392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCian, Anne De10aQuadruplex ligands may act as molecular chaperones for tetramolecular quadruplex formation  ap. 2483-2493.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aG-quadruplexes are a family of four-stranded DNA structures, stabilized by G-quartets, that form in the presence of monovalent cations. Efforts are currently being made to identify ligands that selectively bind to G-quadruplex motifs as these compounds may interfere with the telomere structure, telomere elongation/replication and proliferation of cancer cells. The kinetics of quadruplex-ligands interactions are poorly understood: it is not clear whether quadruplex ligands lock into the preformed structure (i.e. increase the lifetime of the structure by lowering the dissociation constant, koff) or whether ligands actively promote the formation of the complex and act as quadruplex chaperones by increasing the association constant, kon. We studied the effect of a selective quadruplex ligand, a bisquinolinium pyridine dicarboxamide compound called 360A, to distinguish these two possibilities. We demonstrated that, in addition to binding to and locking into preformed quadruplexes, this molecule acted as a chaperone for tetramolecular complexes by acting on kon. This observation has implications for in vitro and in vivo applications of quadruplexes and should be taken into account when evaluating the cellular responses to these agents.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acations 3adissociation 3aligands 3amolecular chaperones 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apyridines 3atelomeres1 aMergny, Jean-Louis0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.2483-2493x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0983Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245012700169300001600296500002400312520131600336650002301652650002001675650002701695650001601722650002001738650001801758650001401776650001301790650001501803650001301818650001201831650001501843650001201858700001801870700001701888700002101905700001601926700001701942700001501959773009001974852000902064856008902073655001202162IND4463752020221121055223.0120731s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375202DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00097-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlew, Robert H.10aChanges in sugars, organic acids and amino acids in medlar (Mespilus germanica L.) during fruit development and maturation  ap. 363-369.  aIncludes references  aThe contents of sugars, organic acids, and amino acids (after acid hydrolysis) were determined during development and maturation of medlar (Mespilus germanica L.) fruit from 39 days after full bloom (DAF) until 2 weeks after the beginning of fruit drop (161 DAF). Fructose, glucose and sucrose were identified as the principal sugars and their levels varied remarkably during development. The fructose level increased continually through development reaching its maximum by 161 DAF (1200 mg/100 g fresh weight) while the increase of sucrose reached maximum at 131 DAF and had decreased at 161 DAF. After some fluctations at 69 DAF, glucose level remained high (686 mg/100 g fresh weight) at 161 DAF, when compared with Stage IV (131 DAF). While the level of malic acid increased continually, the ascorbic acid level decreased dramatically through fruit development; both acids reached their maximum and minimum levels at 161 DAF, i.e. 428 and 8.4 mg/100 g fresh weight, respectively. The total amino acid composition also changed in decreasing trend throughout development and remained low at 161 DAF. In the ripe fruit, glutamate and aspartate were the major amino compounds identified. These changes in the identified compounds can be related to the metabolic activity during fruit development and maturation. 3aMespilus germanica 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aamino compounds 3aascorbic acid 3aflowering 3afructose 3afruit drop 3afruiting 3aglucose 3amalic acid 3asucrose1 aAyaz, Faik A.1 aSanz, Carlos1 aVanderJagt, D.J.1 aHuang, H.S.1 aChuang, L.T.1 aStrnad, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Nov., v. 83, no. 3 p.363-369dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00097-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02306naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002500179245010700204300001200311506007600323520098600399506003701385650001601422650001101438650001801449650003001467650003001497700002601527700002301553700002401576773008001600852000901680856007801689856007401767930003301841946001101874990002301885655001201908IND4391147720221207060408.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114772DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1062doi7 aPMC18746422pmcid7 a173896462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeu-Flores, Fernando10aUSER fusion: a rapid and efficient method for simultaneous fusion and cloning of multiple PCR products  ap. e55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present a method that allows simultaneous fusion and cloning of multiple PCR products in a rapid and efficient manner. The procedure is based on the use of PCR primers that contain a single deoxyuridine residue near their 5' end. Treatment of the PCR products with a commercial deoxyuridine-excision reagent generates long 3' overhangs designed to specifically complement each other. The combination of this principle with the improved USER cloning technique provides a simple, fast and very efficient method to simultaneously fuse and clone multiple PCR fragments into a vector of interest. Around 90% positive clones were obtained when three different PCR products were fused and cloned into a USER-compatible vector in a simple procedure that, apart from the single PCR amplification step and the bacterial transformation, took approximately one hour. We expect this method to replace overlapping PCR and the use of type IIS restriction enzymes in many of their applications.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA primers 3aclones 3anucleic acids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases1 aNour-Eldin, Hussam H.1 aNielsen, Morten T.1 aHalkier, Barbara A.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.e55-e55x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01895naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245006100175300001600236500002400252520089900276650001801175650001001193650001301203650001701216650002001233650002301253650001601276650000901292650002301301650001001324650002301334773009001357852000901447856008901456655001201545IND4463751020221121055222.0120731s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375102DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00050-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Audrey Chingzu14aThe effects of gamma irradiation on rice wine maturation  ap. 323-327.  aIncludes references  aRice wine was fermented with Saccharomyces sake and was matured using gamma irradiation (after fermentation) as an accelerated physical maturation method.

The relationship of the content levels of titratable acidity, alcohol, ester, volatile acids, and aldehyde to sensory evaluations was also studied, as well as the time of maturation. Results showed that the gamma irradiation, in a suitable dosage, appeared to be a suitable method for improving some rice wine defects and producing a higher taste quality in the rice wine, without the presence of irradiation residues.

In this study, the surface properties of the face and the edge surfaces of natural molybdenite (MoS₂) were investigated by direct surface force measurements using atomic force microscope (AFM). The interaction forces between the AFM tip (Si₃N₄) and face or edge surface of molybdenite were measured in 10 mM NaCl solutions at various pHs. The force profiles were well-fitted with classical DLVO (Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek) theory to determine the surface potentials of the face and the edge surfaces of molybdenite. The surface potentials of both the face and edge surfaces become more negative with increasing pH. At neutral and alkaline conditions, the edge surface exhibits more negative surface potential than the face surface, which is possibly due to molybdate and hydromolybdate ions on the edge surface. The point of zero charge (PZC) of the edge surface was determined around pH 3 while PZC of the face surface was not observed in the range of pH 3–11. The interaction forces between octadecyltrichlorosilane-treated AFM tip (OTS-tip) and face or edge surface of molybdenite were also measured at various pHs to study the wettability of molybdenite surfaces. An attractive force between the OTS-tip and the face surface was detected. The force profiles were well-fitted by considering DLVO forces and additional hydrophobic force. Our results suggest the hydrophobic feature of the face surface of molybdenite. In contrast, no attractive force between the OTS-tip and the edge surface was detected. This is the first study in directly measuring surface charge and wettability of the pristine face and edge surfaces of molybdenite through surface force measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3amolybdates 3apH 3asilicon nitride 3asodium chloride 3awettability1 aLiu, Qingxia1 aXu, Zhenghe1 aZeng, Hongbo0 tLangmuir.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 31, no. 42 p.11409-11418dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b026783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245012800159300001600287520165600303592002801959650002501987650002802012650003002040650002202070650001402092650001802106650001602124650001202140650001302152650001002165651001002175653003002185653001002215653002002225653001202245653001302257700002002270700002002290700001702310773011402327856008002441852000902521655001202530IND60478586520221122135521.0200514e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047858652DNAL7 a10.1556/168.2015.16.2.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmori, G.10aLong-term density fluctuations and microhabitat use of sympatric Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus in central Italy  ap. 196-205.  aThe role and importance of interspecific competition for rodent communities have been much debated issues, with some early authors suggesting that these are important, and several recent articles suggesting the contrary. In this paper, we studied, for 14 years at a mountainous locality in central Italy, the coexistence dynamics of a two-species system (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus) within a 1.44 ha trapping grid, by Capture-Mark-Recapture. Overall, we captured over 1000 rodents during the study period, with annual abundance ranging 2-7 individuals × ha⁻¹. However, the density of the two species varied substantially across years and between sectors of the study plot. Thus, the distributions of the two species on the scale of the study grid were not related to one another. Density of a given species did not affect the percentage of lactating females in either A. flavicollis or M. glareolus. Individual traps differed in their rate of capture such that about 40% of traps were associated more with a particular species. Considering the spatial distribution of traps, we determined that three areas were associated with high probability of capture for only one of the two study species, two of these areas being associated to A. flavicollis and one to M. glareolus. Our analyses suggest that interspecific competition may be present at the local micro-scale, as explained by the fact that in the great majority of the cases in which a given trap was highly successful in capturing one species, it was also very unsuccessful in capturing the other species. However, manipulation experiments are needed to confirm that suggestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus flavicollis 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3ainterspecific competition 3alactating females 3alactation 3amicrohabitats 3aprobability 3arodents 3atrapping 3atraps 3aItaly 0aInterspecific competition 0aItaly 0aLong-term study 0aRodents 0aTrapping1 aCastigliani, V.1 aLocasciulli, O.1 aLuiselli, L.0 tCommunity ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 16, no. 2 p.196-205dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000060x1588-27567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/168.2015.16.2.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011600166500001900282520162600301592002801927650002201955650001201977650001201989650001502001650001102016650001702027650001202044650001502056650000902071653000802080653000902088653002002097653002702117653003802144700001702182700001702199700001602216700001202232773010802244856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60727134120221118114949.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072713412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Youping10aExperimental and kinetic modeling study of ammonia addition on PAH characteristics in premixed n-heptane flames  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to concerns over pollutant emissions and ever-increasing energy crisis, ammonia is being considered as a promising alternative fuel to control soot particles and their precursors (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) emissions in combustion for diesel engines. This paper aims to investigate the chemical effects of NH₃ addition on PAH formation in n-heptane laminar premixed flames. The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique was used to measure the relative PAH fluorescence intensities qualitatively. A kinetic modeling study was performed to predict PAH concentrations by comparing with the experimental results, and then clarify the underlying effects of NH₃ on PAH formation. Both experimental and numerical results revealed that PAH concentrations decreased monotonically as ammonia fraction increased, suggesting a PAHs-inhibiting role for NH₃ in n-heptane baseline flames. Reaction pathway analysis revealed that the suppression of NH₃ on PAH formation could be attributed to the competition for H, OH and O radicals in fuels' decomposition, and chemical interactions of amine radicals with the C₁-C₂ species. For this reason, the NH₃ addition produced a relatively decreased C₂H₂, thereby inhibiting the formation of propargyl. As a result, benzene formation was inhibited through C₃H₃ self-recombination reaction, resulting sequentially in the suppression of PAH formation and growth. Besides, the decreased C₂H₂ yield in the post-flame region of NH₃ doping flames also inhibited the formation of PAHs through the hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition (HACA) mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3aammonia 3abenzene 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aheptane 3apollutants 3asoot 0aLIF 0aPAHs 0aChemical effect 0aLaminar premixed flame 0aOptical diagnostics in combustion1 aZhang, Yiran1 aZhan, Reggie1 aHuang, Zhen1 aLin, He0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 Apr., v. 214 p.106682-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520074700311592002801058650001801086650002901104650002601133650003001159650002701189650001601216650001201232700001801244700001801262700002301280700001601303700002401319773011901343856008101462852000901543655001201552IND60596703520221117172912.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059670352DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829180201412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapoyan, G.K.10aInfluence of Low-Intensity Electromagnetic Field on Some Biological Parameters of Freshwater Crustaceans Daphnia magna Straus  ap. 124-128.  aWe have studied the effects of a low-intensity electromagnetic field (EMF) with a frequency of 30 MHz in continuous-wave and amplitude-modulation modes on Daphnia magna in a laboratory culture. The exposure range is from 10 to 10000 s. We examine the parental generation (irradiated) and three subsequent (F₁–F₃) generations (nonirradiated). It is found that irradiation does not affect the total fertility of any specimen in four generations (P–F₃), except for continuous EMF exposure for 10000 s, which increases the total fertility in generations F₂ and F₃ by 23 and 43%, respectively. Electromagnetic radiation has a significant impact on offspring quality and causes fetal abnormalities in the offspring of all generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3acongenital abnormalities 3aelectromagnetic field 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3afreshwater crustaceans 3airradiation 3aprogeny1 aFilenko, O.F.1 aYusupov, V.I.1 aVorob’yeva, O.V.1 aZotov, K.V.1 aBagratashvili, V.N.0 tInland water biology.g2018 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.124-128dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000086x1995-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S19950829180201413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245015000205520157400355592002801929650001401957650001301971650001401984650001601998650001402014650001202028650001402040650001802054650001502072650001502087650002002102650002002122650002102142650002002163650002802183650001402211650001602225653002402241653002102265653001502286653001902301700001702320700001402337773013302351856005002484852000902534655001202543IND60793264820221118112515.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079326482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2022.1005922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dah-Sol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2103-310610aComparison of the nutritional composition of raw, boiled, roasted Macadamia (F. Muell. Macadamieae) and its application as an elder-friendly food  aThe purpose of this study is to establish an optimal pretreatment method that can improve the nutritional quality of Macadamia, and to develop viscous beverage products for the elderly with dysphagia to help prevent suffocation and improve nutritional imbalance. As a result, roasting Macadamia had a significant effect on increasing the unsaturated fatty acid and mineral content (p < 0.01) rather than raw and boiled. Next, a thickening agent was added to develop viscous nut breeze using roasted Macadamia for the elderly, who could easily choke even if they drank water due to weakened esophageal muscles. Therefore, it was confirmed that all thickening agents used in this study can be applied as elder-friendly foods suitable for Korean Industrial Standards, and the regression equation for viscosity change according to thickening agent concentration was ‘Y = 62,136X + 29.821 (R² = 0.9676)' for xanthan gum, ‘Y = 59,271X – 200.79 (R² = 0.9542)’ for locust bean gum, ‘Y = 4,069X – 7.4643 (R² = 0.9578)’ for carrageenan, and ‘Y = 900X + 3.6429 (R² = 0.9589)’ for gum arabic. In conclusion, this study can help prevent suffocation and improve nutritional imbalance by developing viscous nut breeze beverage products using roasted Macadamia for the elderly with dysphagia, and can be used as basic data for the elder-friendly food industry in the future. Meanwhile, as in this study, studies should be continuously conducted to reduce the nutritional imbalance of the elderly by changing the intake methods of various nuts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacadamia 3aasphyxia 3abeverages 3acarrageenan 3adysphagia 3aelderly 3aequations 3afood industry 3agastronomy 3agum arabic 3alocust bean gum 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 0aElder-friendly food 0aThickening agent 0aFatty acid 0aCooking method1 aIida, Fumiko1 aJoo, Nami0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2022 Dec., v. 30 p.100592-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2022.100592  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245008100190300001600271500002000287520171200307592002802019650001402047650002202061650001502083650002002098650002002118650001002138650001002148650002302158650001302181650003002194650003002224650001102254650001402265650001802279700002502297773013002322856010802452852000902560655001202569IND60587498920221119135651.0180319e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058749892DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0453:SAMOCB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardsley, Louise10aStrength and mechanisms of competition between common and endangered anurans  ap. 453-463.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe investigated the strength and mechanisms of asymmetric competition between the larvae of an endangered British anuran (Bufo calamita) and those of two competitive superiors (Bufo bufo and Rana temporaria). The former species is normally allotopic with the latter two but has recently suffered competition from them following successional changes on sand‐dune habitats that have rendered all three species syntopic. In a replicated cage experiment using natural densities of larvae, survivorship of B. calamita was reduced more strongly by interspecific than by intraspecific competitors. Predation did not relieve interspecific competition and in some treatments further increased the mortality of B. calamita. Survival was highly correlated with growth rate, and the negative effects of interspecific competition on growth were much stronger than those of intraspecific competition. Feeding‐niche overlaps among all three species were high, and growth rates of B. calamita were related to total algal cell numbers available in the treatment cages. However, larvae in treatments exhibiting interspecific competition also generated large numbers of Anurofeca (= Prototheca) richardsi. This unicellular organism is implicated in interference competition between anurans. B. calamita growth also correlated inversely with A. richardsi numbers. Taken together the data demonstrate strong adverse effects of interspecific competition on the endangered B. calamita and indicate that both resource and interference mechanisms were probably operative, though the former was more important than the latter. Methods for alleviating the destructive impact of competition on the endangered species are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufo bufo 3aEpidalea calamita 3aPrototheca 3aRana temporaria 3aadverse effects 3aalgae 3acages 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3aintraspecific competition 3alarvae 3apredation 3asurvival rate1 aBeebee, Trevor J.

While the identification of eco-innovation’s economic consequences has been widely investigated in the extant literature, many questions remain regarding its impact in the context of developing countries. This study investigates the effects of eco-innovation on the cost of equity capital and corporate financial performance as well as the role of political connections as a moderating variable in Indonesia as an emerging market. The samples are all nonfinancial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2016. The data are processed using the panel regression method. This study finds that eco-innovation does not affect the cost of equity capital or company performance. However, political connections do, and they moderate the association between eco-innovation and the cost of equity capital but in a positive direction. This implies that political connections cannot generate investor trust via the eco-innovation efforts of companies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acapital 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic impact 3afinance 3apolitics 3aregression analysis 3astock exchange 3asustainable technology 3aIndonesia 0aEco-innovation 0aCost of equity 0aFinancial performance 0aPolitical connections1 aAdhariani, Desi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 10, v. 258 p.120579-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1205793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245008300190300001600273520108800289592002801377650001901405650001701424650001901441650001401460650001401474650001401488650001401502650001701516650001701533650001601550651001501566700002601581700002001607700002001627773008901647856008601736961001301822852000901835655001201844IND4459987020221120175044.0141111e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445998702DNAL7 a252123222pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Zhenchang10aPolyphenolic profiles detected in the ripe berries of Vitis vinifera germplasm  ap. 940-950.  aPolyphenolic profiles in the berry samples of 344 European grape (Vitis vinifera) cultivars were evaluated for two consecutive years. These cultivars represent a diverse collection of V. vinifera germplasm maintained at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Vitis Clonal Repository in Davis of California, USA. A total of 36 polyphenolic compounds, including 16 anthocyanins, 6 flavonols, 6 flavanols, 6 hydroxycinnamic acids and 2 hydroxybenzoic acids, were identified via HPLC–MS and quantified by HPLC–DAD. The mean contents for anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acids and hydroxybenzoic acids were 0.946 (coloured cultivars), 0.147, 0.043, 0.195 and 0.016mgg⁻¹ FW, respectively. On average, wine grapes had higher concentrations than had table grapes for all of these compounds except hydroxycinnamic acids. Berry colours affected the total contents of anthocyanins, but not others. Positive correlations (0.151–0.535) were found among these groups of compounds. As expected, these groups of compounds were all negatively correlated with berry weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acoumaric acids 3acultivars 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3agermplasm 3asmall fruits 3atable grapes 3awine grapes 3aCalifornia1 aOwens, Christopher L.1 aZhong, Gan-Yuan1 aCheng, Lailiang0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 129, no. 3 p.940-950dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.0503Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010500169300001600274520161300290592002801903650001201931650002101943650002401964650001401988650001602002650001402018650001302032650001402045650001502059650001702074650002002091650001602111650002702127650003602154650002202190650001202212650002002224650001202244650000902256650003702265650001302302650001402315650002802329650002102357650001302378650002702391650002202418650004302440650005202483650002502535650003602560650003202596650001802628650001602646653002002662653002202682653002402704653002902728700001802757700001602775700001602791700001902807700001302826773010002839856008602939852000903025655001203034IND60643081920221116212027.0190620e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064308192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2019.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Liuqing10aNephroprotective effects of Lachnum melanin against acute kidney injury induced by cisplatin in mice  ap. 198-205.  aThe purpose of the present research was to discuss renoprotective effects of intracellular melanin from Lachnum YM156 (LIM) on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice and to explore its possible mechanisms. No cytotoxicity of LIM on the HSF and LO2 cells was found by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cisplatin treatment resulted in noticeable weight loss, raised kidney index, elevated levels of serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and increased platinum accumulation in kidneys. Additionally, renal oxidative stress was evidenced by the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione (GSH) levels after cisplatin administration. The result of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that cisplatin treatment significantly elevated the mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in kidneys. Furthermore, western blotting analysis demonstrated that cisplatin administration signiﬁcantly increased the protein expression levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), p-p38 MAPK, p53, caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3 and p38 MAPK, suggesting the inﬂammation and apoptosis response. However, all these changes were dose-dependently reversed by LIM. Overall, LIM may possess protective effects in cisplatin-induced AKI through suppression of oxidative stress, inﬂammation and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLachnum 3aWestern blotting 3aacute kidney injury 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acatalase 3acisplatin 3acreatinine 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akidneys 3amalondialdehyde 3amelanin 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3anephroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3aplatinum 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea nitrogen 3aweight loss 0aLachnum melanin 0aCisplatin-induced 0aAcute kidney injury 0aNephroprotective effects1 aYang, Qinghua1 aLi, Jinglei1 aHou, Gouhua1 aChen, Tingting1 aYe, Ming0 tProcess biochemistry.g2019 Aug., v. 83 p.198-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2019.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009500191300001600286500002000302520184500322592002802167650001902195650001502214650001302229650001102242650002302253650001602276650001102292650001602303650000902319650002102328650002302349650002402372650002202396650001502418651001702433700001502450773013002465856010802595852000902703655001202712IND60587499020221119135541.0180319e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058749902DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0559:TEOMRA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClanahan, T. R.14aThe effect of marine reserves and habitat on populations of east african coral reef fishes  ap. 559-569.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effects of fishing, the duration of protection from fishing, features of the reef habitat, including benthic cover and sea urchin abundance, and the distance between reefs were examined to determine the ability of these factors to predict ecological aspects of fish communities. Population density, species richness, and rarity were estimated for 127 species of coral reef fish on 22 patch and fringing reefs along ∼400 km of East African coastline. The reefs included five protected areas, of which three study sites were protected for more than 25 years, and four sites were protected less than 10 years. Habitat variables were often significantly associated with fish community variables in fringing reefs, but not in patch reefs. Fish diversity was positively correlated with hard coral and coralline algal cover, and negatively correlated with sea urchin and algal turf abundance. However, multiple regression analysis suggests that protection from fishing was the single strongest factor affecting fish abundance and diversity. Consequently, many of the habitat correlations were probably due to direct and indirect effects of fishing on reef ecology, where heavy fishing results in increases in sea urchin and algal turf abundance and reduces hard coral and coralline algal abundance. Protected areas had higher abundances and species richness of commercially important triggerfish, surgeonfish, and parrotfish. There was, however, no relationship between local rarity in our study sites with rarity at the level of the western Indian Ocean for three well known fish families of angelfish, butterflyfish, and damselfish. Older reserves had more and rarer species than young reserves or fished reefs; and, consequently, the maintenance of reserves older than 10 years may be needed to sustain the full local diversity of fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetodontidae 3aEchinoidea 3aScaridae 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3acorrelation 3afish 3afish communities 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3aspecies diversity 3aturf algae 3aIndian Ocean1 aArthur, R.0 tEcological applications.g2001 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.559-569dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011%5B0559:TEOMRA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245016300201300001600364500002000380520175600400592002802156650002302184650001102207650000902218650001602227700006002243700002202303773013302325856007302458852000902531655001202540IND60600901320221121035931.0180704e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060090132DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.126202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Sherry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3369-673X10aAdditional palmaroproximal–palmarodistal oblique radiographic projections improve accuracy of detection and characterization of equine flexor cortical lysis  ap. 387-395.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRadiographic flexor cortical lysis indicates advanced degenerative change and its earlier recognition may improve case outcome. Aims of this prospective, diagnostic accuracy study were to determine effects of radiographic beam angle and observer on accuracy of lesion detection. The sample included 36 limbs from 31 horses. Palmaroproximal–palmarodistal oblique (skyline) radiographs were acquired at standard (n = 38) and more shallow (alternate) angles (n = 58). Images were independently reviewed by four experience levels of five observers each (n = 20) for the presence and severity of flexor cortical lysis. Observers also reported their confidence in these answers. Responses were compared based on seeing a standard skyline or multiple projections. The definitive presence (or absence) and severity of lysis was based upon radiologist consensus agreement. When assessed by observer, the identification of lysis and the assessment of its severity was most similar to that of radiologists when observers of all levels of experience were able to view multiple skyline projections (P = 0.399, P = 0.174). Using multiple views to detect lysis resulted in improved sensitivity (85.3% vs. 97.2%, P < 0.001), decreased specificity (82.8% vs. 74.5%, P = 0.03), and improved interobserver agreement (86.0% vs. 90.2%, P = 0.21). On average, observers of all levels of experience became more confident viewing multiple projections (P < 0.001). Skyline radiographs using a flatter angle of incidence improve radiographic detection and characterization of flexor cortical lysis severity, may allow the beam to be tangential to the more distal portion of the navicular bone, and are recommended when flexor cortical lysis is suspected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3ahorses 3alegs 3aradiography1 aBarrett, Myra F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5060-60091 aFrisbie, David D.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2018 July, v. 59, no. 4 p.387-395dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.126203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170300001600257520199200273592002802265650002702293650001502320650001902335650001202354650002202366650003702388650003102425650001402456650001702470650001402487650001302501653001302514653000902527700002002536700002602556700002202582700001902604700002002623700003302643700002102676700002302697700002002720700002302740700006102763700002102824710002402845773009602869856008602965852000903051655001203060IND60760069020221121040149.0220124e20220131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076006902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiufrè, Maria10aNasopharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus influenzae among adults with co-morbidities  ap. 826-832.  aAfter the widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, H. influenzae invasive disease is now commonly due to non-encapsulated (NTHi), affecting mostly the youngest and the elderly. The objective of this study was to investigate H. influenzae nasopharyngeal carriage rate in adults with co-morbidities and possible associated risk factors.Patients aged >50 years with co-morbidities attending medical centres were examined. A nasopharyngeal swab was analysed for H. influenzae presence by cultural and molecular methods (RT-PCR). Univariable and multivariable analysis of risk factors for H. influenzae carriage were performed. Serotype of isolates was determined by PCR capsular genotyping. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by MIC gradient test and β-lactamase production was detected by the nitrocephin test. Genotyping was performed by Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Phylogenetic relationships among carriage and invasive NTHi strains were assessed.Among 248 enrolled patients (median age: 73 years), the carriage rate was 5.6% and 10.5% by cultural method or RT-PCR, respectively. Colonization with H. influenzae was significantly associated with the presence of acute respiratory symptoms (adjusted OR = 12.16, 95% CI: 3.05–48.58, p < 0.001). All colonizing isolates were NTHi. Three isolates (3/14, 21.4%) were resistant to ampicillin and beta-lactamase positive. MLST revealed a high degree of genetic diversity, with 11 different STs from 14 isolates. Eight out of the 11 (72.7%) STs were shared among carriage and invasive isolates.Adults ≥50 years old with co-morbidities are occasionally colonized by H. influenzae, even if the presence of co-morbidities is not a risk factor for colonization. The presence of acute respiratory symptoms is the only factor associated with H. influenzae colonization. Colonizing H. influenzae are all NTHi. Colonizing H. influenzae often belong to the same STs of invasive disease isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aampicillin 3abeta-lactamase 3aelderly 3agenetic variation 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aphylogeny 3arisk factors 3aserotypes 3avaccines 0aCarriage 0aMLST1 aDorrucci, Maria1 aLo Presti, Alessandra1 aFarchi, Francesca1 aCardines, Rita1 aCamilli, Romina1 aPimentel de Araujo, Fernanda1 aMancini, Fabiola1 aCiervo, Alessandra1 aCorongiu, Maria1 aPantosti, Annalisa1 aCerquetti, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6380-80101 aValdarchi, Catia2 aFIMMG Groupeauthor0 tVaccine.g2022 Jan. 31, v. 40, no. 5 p.826-832dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04703naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009900164300001300263520298900276592002803265596007203293650001403365650001603379650002503395650001303420650000903433650001203442650001803454650001603472650001603488650001303504650003303517650001603550650001103566650001303577650001803590650003003608650001303638650001803651650001803669650001103687650002403698650001603722650001303738650001103751650001203762650001503774651001003789700002003799700001703819700005203836700001303888773010803901856008304009852000904092655001204101IND60621923020221119140112.0181121e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062192302DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-18-0543-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, T.10aFirst Report of Ascochyta medicaginicola Causing Leaf Blight Disease of Pointed Gourd in India  ap. 2657.  aPointed gourd (Trichosanthes dioica Roxb.) is a popular summer vegetable in India. During April 2017, severe leaf blight symptoms were observed in many fields located in the sub-Himalayan region in West Bengal state of India (21.14 to 21.30°N, 78.82 to 79.02°E). Lesions initially appeared as yellow spots (4 to 5 mm in diameter) on leaf margins that gradually expanded to cover almost the whole leaf between the veins. As lesions aged, they turned brown and dry, ultimately leading to defoliation. Tiny black pycnidia were scattered throughout the dried lesions. Symptomatic leaves were collected, cut into small square pieces approximately 5 mm², surface sterilized with 1% NaOCl, and transferred to potato dextrose agar. The agar plates were incubated at 28°C for 7 days. After 5 days of incubation, compressed, white velvety mycelia appeared on the plates, and the colonies gradually turned gray after sporulation. Conidia were hyaline, two to three septate, 4 to 8 μm long, 1.5 to 3 μm wide, thin and smooth walled, ellipsoidal to cylindrical conidia with both rounded ends. Fifteen isolates having similar morphology were recovered from diseased leaf tissue. Morphological characteristics matched those of Ascochyta medicaginicola var. macrospora Q. Chen & L. Cai (Chen et al. 2015). To confirm identity, DNA was extracted from the mycelia of the representative isolate PGALD2. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the D1/D2 region of the 28S rRNA large subunit were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and NL1/NL4 (O’Donnell 1993), respectively. The sequences of the resulting polymerase chain reaction products were submitted to GenBank. BLAST analysis of the ITS region (accession no. MF447846) and D1/D2 region (accession no. MF447845) showed 99 and 100% nucleotide identity with ITS and D1/D2 regions of A. medicaginicola var. macrospora strain CBS 112.53 (ITS, GU237749; and D1/D2, GU238101), respectively. For pathogenicity testing, a conidial suspension (10⁶ spores/ml) of isolate PGALD2 was sprayed onto both surfaces of the leaves of 10 healthy 2-week-old potted pointed gourd plants until run-off. A set of 10 control plants was sprayed with sterile distilled water and maintained as a control. The plants were kept in a transparent and perforated polythene chamber for maintaining high humidity and aeration in the greenhouse for 15 days. Humidity was maintained by spraying sterile distilled water at 1-day intervals. The experiment was conducted three times. Three days after inoculation, yellow spots were visible on the inoculated leaves, which gradually expanded to cover a major part of the leaf. The controls remained symptomless. A. medicaginicola was successfully reisolated from symptomatic tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. medicaginicola var. macrospora causing leaf blight of pointed gourd. A. medicaginicola can cause severe yield losses of pointed gourd in India.  aPublisher supplied data  aF. 25-1/2013-14(BSR) dated 30.05.2014cUniversity Grants Commission 3aAscochyta 3aDNA primers 3aTrichosanthes dioica 3aaeration 3aagar 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adefoliation 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apycnidia 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3arunoff 3asodium hypochlorite 3asporulation 3aspraying 3asummer 3atissues 3avegetables 3aIndia1 aChakraborty, P.1 aKarmakar, A.1 aSaha, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5659-47711 aSaha, D.0 tPlant disease.g2018 Dec., v. 102, no. 12 p.2657-2657dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-18-0543-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245006800165300001400233520061400247592002800861650001400889650001300903650001200916650001300928653002900941653003200970653002201002700002001024700001801044773013401062856007801196852000901274655001201283IND60478587120221122135548.0200514e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047858712DNAL7 a10.1556/446.11.2015.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafranyik, Ferenc10aExperimental Method for Examination of State Dependent Friction  ap. 29-42.  aThe phenomenon of friction reduces efficiency of almost all machines in practice. In order to reduce the deficits, we have to understand this phenomenon and have to take it into consideration during design in all cases. Nevertheless, in certain cases describing of a friction process is very difficult, because it depends on a lot of parameters. In case of polymers, granular materials or in geology, the rate and state dependent friction have great importance. In this paper, velocity and time dependent friction is examined with the help of a direct shear apparatus, which was developed in our earlier work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3afriction 3ageology 3apolymers 0astate dependent friction 0avelocity dependent friction 0adirect shear test1 aCsatár, Attila1 aVarga, Attila0 tProgress in agricultural engineering sciences.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.29-42dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:2221x1787-03217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/446.11.2015.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245020600163300001800369520114700387592002801534650001501562650001301577650002101590650002101611650000901632650002601641650001301667650001501680650001601695650001501711650002901726700001601755700002601771773012901797856007301926852000901999655001202008IND60529467920221116155946.0160717e20130604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052946792DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400851x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotham, Victoria C.10aSelective 351 nm Photodissociation of Cysteine-Containing Peptides for Discrimination of Antigen-Binding Regions of IgG Fragments in Bottom-Up Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Workflows  ap. 5577-5585.  aDespite tremendous inroads in the development of more sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) strategies for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, there remains a significant need for enhancing the selectivity of MS/MS-based workflows for streamlined analysis of complex biological mixtures. Here, a novel LC–MS/MS platform based on 351 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) is presented for the selective analysis of cysteine–peptide subsets in complex protein digests. Cysteine-selective UVPD is mediated through the site-specific conjugation of reduced cysteine residues with a 351 nm active chromogenic Alexa Fluor 350 (AF350) maleimide tag. Only peptides containing the AF350 chromophore undergo photodissociation into extensive arrays of b- and y-type fragment ions, thus providing a facile means for differentiating cysteine–peptide targets from convoluting peptide backgrounds. With the use of this approach in addition to strategic proteolysis, the selective analysis of diagnostic heavy-chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of single-chain antibody (scAb) fragments is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acysteine 3afluorescent dyes 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3apeptides 3aphotolysis 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aWine, Yariv1 aBrodbelt, Jennifer S.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 June 04, v. 85, no. 11 p.5577-5585dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac400851x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015100173300002000324520113300344592002801477650001201505650002601517650002101543650001401564650002101578650002201599650001801621700001901639700002701658700002301685700002301708700003801731773010101769856008601870852000901956655001201965IND60577335620221120163621.0170808e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057733562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b027602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Hirak10aDepth-Dependent Organization and Dynamics of Archaeal and Eukaryotic Membranes: Development of Membrane Anisotropy Gradient with Natural Evolution  ap. 11591-11597.  aThe lipid composition of archaea is unique and has been correlated with increased stability under extreme environmental conditions. In this article, we have focused on the evolution of membrane organization and dynamics with natural evolution. Dynamic anisotropy along the membrane normal (i.e., gradients of mobility, polarity, and heterogeneity) is a hallmark of fluid phase diester or diether phospholipid membranes. We monitored gradients of mobility, polarity, and heterogeneity along the membrane normal in membranes made of a representative archaeal lipid using a series of membrane depth-dependent fluorescent probes, and compared them to membranes prepared from a typical diether lipid from higher organisms (eukaryotes). Our results show that the representative dynamic anisotropy gradient along the membrane normal is absent in membranes made from archaeal lipids. We hypothesize that the dynamic gradient observed in membranes of diester and diether phospholipids is a consequence of natural evolution of membrane lipids in response to the requirement of carrying out complex cellular functions by membrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aenvironmental factors 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3afluorescent dyes 3amembrane proteins 3aphospholipids1 aHaldar, Sourav1 aChong, Parkson Lee-Gau1 aKombrabail, Mamata1 aKrishnamoorthy, G.1 aCaṭṭopādhyāẏa, Amitābha,0 tLangmuir.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 31, no. 42 p.11591-11597dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b027603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015500173300001600328520183300344592002802177650001702205650005202222650001802274650001602292650002402308650001102332650002102343650001702364650002102381650001702402650001802419650001302437653001502450653001902465653001502484653001202499700002002511700005702531700001802588700005902606700002502665700002002690700001902710773009602729856008602825852000902911655001202920IND60760069120221121040010.0220118e20220128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076006912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Nai-Hsiang10aInduction of Th1 and Th2 in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 through mucosal delivery of an adenovirus vaccine expressing an engineered spike protein  ap. 574-586.  aA series of recombinant human type 5 adenoviruses that express the full-length or membrane-truncated spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 (AdCoV2-S or AdCoV2-SdTM, respectively) was tested the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal (i.n.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization in a rodent model. Mucosal delivery of adenovirus (Ad) vaccines could induce anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in the serum and in the mucosal, respectively as indicated by vaginal wash (vw) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG but not IgA in the vw and BALF was induced by AdCoV2-S s.c.. Administration of AdCoV2-S i.n. was able to induce higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody levels than s.c. injection. AdCoV2-SdTM i.n. induced a lower antibody responses than AdCoV2-S i.n.. Induced anti-S antibody responses by AdCoV2-S via i.n. or s.c. were not influenced by the pre-existing serum anti-Ad antibody. Novelty, S-specific IgG1 which represented Th2-mediated humoral response was dominantly induced in Ad i.n.-immunized serum in contrast to more IgG2a which represented Th1-mediated cellular response found in Ad s.c.-immunized serum. The activation of S-specific IFN-ɣ and IL-4 in splenic Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, was observed in the AdCoV2-S i.n. and s.c. groups, indicating the Th1 and Th2 immunity were activated. AdCoV2-S and AdCoV2-SdTM significantly prevented body weight loss and reduced pulmonary viral loads in hamsters. A reduction in inflammation in the lungs was observed in AdCoV-S via i.n. or s.c.-immunized hamsters following a SARS-CoV-2 challenge. It correlated to Th1 cytokine but no inflammatory cytokines secretions found in AdCoV-S i.n. -immunized BALF. These results indicate that intranasal delivery of AdCoV2-S vaccines is safe and potent at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-4 3avaccines 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aImmunogenicity 0aAdenovirus 0aVaccine1 aChen, Ying-Chin1 aYang, Shiu-Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8936-98561 aLin, Yu-Ching1 aDou, Horng-Yunn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8021-13391 aHui-Ching Wang, Lily1 aLiao, Ching-Len1 aChow, Yen-Hung0 tVaccine.g2022 Jan. 28, v. 40, no. 4 p.574-586dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245011800186300001600304520025500320592002800575653001600603653001900619653001300638653001100651653001100662653001200673653001700685653001700702773011200719856011700831852000900948655001200957IND60129388120221119192305.0151124e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012938812DNAL7 a10.1665/1082-6467(2002)011[0157:EJSNFT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTilmans, Jos10aEupholidoptera jacquelinae spec. nov. from the Greek island of Gavdos, south of Crete (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae)  ap. 157-161.  aDescription of a new species of the genus Eupholidoptera Maran.

In the investigated area, representatives of the genus Pterygoplichthys occur, and at present they have moved into all main river basins. During the last 2–5 years, alien species have entered into many water bodies isolated from the places of their first discovery by natural and manmade barriers.

The protective efficacy of recombinant Fi-TCTP (rFi-TCTP) was evaluated in F. indicus by intramuscular and oral administration. Intramuscular injection of rFi-TCTP to shrimps, on subsequent white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection exhibited 42% relative percent survival. To understand the mechanism of protection, immunological parameters such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), phenoloxidase and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed in early (24h) and late (60h) stages of infection. rFi-TCTP pretreatment significantly lowers the WSSV induced ROS generation and respiratory burst during early and late stages of infection. Further, WSSV induced apoptotic changes such as reduced haemocyte count, loss in MMP and DNA fragmentation were significantly reduced during early and late stage of infection upon rFi-TCTP administration. Hence, the immunomodulatory studies suggest that protective effect of rFi-TCTP in treated shrimps, might be due to the reduction in ROS and apoptosis, following decreased mitochondrial damage together with reduced phenoloxidase activity and respiratory burst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEscherichia coli 3aFenneropenaeus indicus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3ahemocytes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3aintramuscular injection 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3ashrimp 3atranslation (genetics) 0arFi-TCTP 0aFenneropenaeus indicus 0aWSSV 0aAntioxidant 0aApoptosis1 aKamalakannan, V.1 aNarayanan, R.B.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2014 July, v. 120 p.33-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009800172300002000270520142400290592002801714650001301742650001301755650001401768650001101782650002301793650001101816650001801827650001601845650001601861700002401877700002001901773010101921856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60577335920180109000000.0170808e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057733592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b028542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabartová, Alena10aInvestigation of Mixed Surfactant Films at Water Surface Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 11508-11515.  aMulticomponent Langmuir monolayers are important models of organic coatings of naturally occurring water–vapor interfaces such as the surfaces of oceans or aerosol particles. We investigated mixed monolayers comprised of palmitic acid, C₁₅H₃₁COOH (PA) and 1-bromoalkanes of different chain length (C₅, C₁₀, and C₁₆) at the air–water interface employing classical molecular dynamics simulations. Different composition ratios and lateral compression of the monolayers were considered. The structural parameters, such as density profiles, and deuterium order parameter, evaluated as functions of composition and the lateral film packing, provide microscopic information about organization and dynamics of the mixed monolayers. Simulations demonstrate that stable and well mixed monolayers are formed by the mixtures of PA and BrC₁₆H₃₃ (BrCl6), whereas the two considered shorter bromoalkanes, BrC₅H₁₁ (BrC5) and BrC₁₀H₂₁ (BrC10), do not form stable films. This is in accord with earlier experimental studies. Under high lateral pressures, in PA/BrC10 mixed systems molecules of the bromoalkane readily flip in the monolayer and subsequently leave the film, while the molecules of the longer BrC16 are expelled from the PA film but no flipping occurs. These results suggest that the film collapse under pressure is preceded by squeezing-out of bromoalkanes from the PA monolayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acoatings 3adeuterium 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoceans 3apalmitic acid 3asurfactants 3awater vapor1 aRoeselová, Martina1 aCwiklik, Lukasz0 tLangmuir.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 31, no. 42 p.11508-11515dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b028543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016300172300001600335520131400351592002801665650001501693650001401708650002001722650003301742650001401775700003101789700002601820700002401846773010001870856008101970852000902051655001202060IND60111921020221116164045.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011192102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavanmardi, Farahnaz10aMolecular phylogeny of Astragalus section Alopecuroidei (Fabaceae) and its allies based on nrDNA ITS and three cpDNAs, matK, trnT-trnY and trnH-psbA sequences  ap. 171-178.  aThe phylogeny of sect. Alopecuroidei and its closely related sections within Astragalus was reconstructed. A total of forty species of sect. Alopecuroidei and its related sections, as well as two species of Oxytropis as outgroups were included in the analyses using nrDNA ITS and three cpDNAs: matK, trnT-trnY and trnH-psbA, separately and in combination. The analyses revealed that sect. Alopecuroidei with the inclusion of sects. Laxiflori and Christianpohysa as well as, Astragalus caraganae of sect. Astragalus form a well-supported monophyletic group. Astragalus sect. Laxiflori and sect. Christianophysa should be reduced as a synonym of sect. Alopecuroidei. A. caraganae (sect. Astragalus) is nested within sect. Alopecuroidei and well allied with Astragalus turbinatus (sect. Alopecuroidei). Thus, this species should be transferred to sect. Alopecuroidei. The present results indicate that, the majority of the previously proposed subdivisions of sect. Alopecuroidei are not monophyletic. The phylogenetic study presented here does not support the monophyly of sect. Astragalus. It seems that the position of subsect. Chronopus as proposed within sect. Astragalus in some previous taxonomic treatments, is artificial. We suggest elevating the rank of this subsection to section, i.e. sect.

Cellulose triacetate and thin-film composite with aquaporin flat sheet membranes were tested for different feed solution, pH levels, and draw solution concentrations. The results indicated that the thin-film composite membrane had high boron and iodide rejections (98.4% and 98.3%, respectively) at a pH of 11; however, with a feed boron concentration of 600 mg/L, 9.8 mg/L boron was still present in the draw solution. Cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was used to enhance the iodide recovery and boron removal efficiencies. Both efficiencies increased to 99.9% with 0.5 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and only 0.64 mg/L boron was present in the draw solution. In addition, negligible flux reduction was observed for forward osmosis process in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. A membrane distillation system was used to concentrate and purify the MgCl₂ draw solution. Thus, the hybrid forward osmosis-membrane distillation process can be applied for iodide recovery and boron removal in the thin-film transistor liquid crystal display industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaporins 3aboron 3acationic surfactants 3acellulose 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adistillation 3afilms (materials) 3aindustry 3aiodides 3aliquid crystal display 3amagnesium chloride 3aosmosis 3apH 3athin film composite membranes 3atoxicity 3atransistors 3awastewater 3aTaiwan 0aForward osmosis 0aIodide 0aBoron 0aCetyltrimethylammonium bromide 0aMembrane distillation1 aChen, Shiao-Shing1 aCai, Zhi-Sheng1 aChang, Wen-Shing1 aRay, Saikat Sinha1 aNguyen, Nguyen Cong1 aLi, Chi-Wang1 aPaswan, Mithilesh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 10, v. 258 p.120587-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1205873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008100169300001600250520112500266592002801391650001701419650001001436650001901446650001101465650001401476650001301490650001401503650001701517650001201534700001901546700005801565700002501623700002001648700001701668700001901685700001901704773011801723856008101841852000901922655001201931IND60596704420221117172900.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059670442DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-018-0590-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipovy, Bretislav14aThe first isolation of Westerdykella dispersa in a critically burned patient  ap. 479-482.  aPatients with critical thermal trauma belong to one of the most high-risk groups for development of infectious complications. Fungal infections are not among frequent complications during therapy of patients with thermal trauma, yet their incidence dramatically aggravates the prognosis for patients with this disorder. In the case report, we present the case of a young man with a critical burn, where Westerdykella dispersa was isolated. Identification of the pathogen was provided with a combination of cultivation and molecular biological confirmation. In this case, the distinction between infection and colonization was very complicated. Histopathological examination for definitive diagnosis of infection was not performed because the material from unburned soft tissue sampling could further compromise the function of the hand. Repeated cultivation and molecular identification W. dispersa before and after the necrectomy is indicative of infection rather than colonization. It is the second documented case of positive cultivation with this pathogen in humans and the first such case in a non-neutropenic host.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afungi 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apatients 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics 3atissues1 aKocmanova, Iva1 aHoloubek, Jakub1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1240-79431 aHanslianova, Marketa1 aBezdicek, Matej1 aRihova, Hana1 aSuchanek, Ivan1 aBrychta, Pavel0 tFolia microbiologica.g2018 July, v. 63, no. 4 p.479-482dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl18090x0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-018-0590-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171300001300308520155200321592002801873650002601901650001101927650002101938650001301959650001701972650001801989650001302007650002302020650001102043650001102054650002302065650002002088653001302108653001902121653002002140653001702160653001402177653002102191700002102212700002302233773013402256856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60478587520221122135518.0160112e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047858752DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2015.11141052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠkute, Artūrs10aSource identification of nitrate by means of stable nitrogen isotopes in the river Daugava and loads of nitrogen to the Gulf of Riga  ap. 1-14.  aNitrogen isotope ratio of nitrate provides a powerful tool to investigate nitrate sources and cycling mechanisms. Although the use of an isotope ratio method for ¹⁵N/ ¹⁴N allows identifying the nitrate sources in rivers by estimating a seasonal variation of N-NO ₃ concentration, however, there are some restrictions. Nitrification, the conversion of NH ₄⁺ to NO ₃-, can proceed with significant nitrogen isotope fractionation, preferentially accumulating ¹⁴N in the produced NO ₃-, and can make it difficult to identify the nitrate source with a high proportion of the isotope δ ¹⁵N. However, the uptake and assimilation of NH ₄⁺ and NO ₃- have the capability of affecting isotopic compositions of riverine nitrogen compounds, and this may hinder the determination of whether the impact of the nitrate source with a high proportion of the isotope δ ¹⁵N reduces. In addition, this study demonstrates that nitrate nitrogen concentration may correlate with δ ¹⁵N NO₃ values both positively and negatively. Such correlations are the result of isotope effects during nitrogen transformation processes (e.g. nitrification and assimilation) and isotopic variability in the various nitrate sources. A comparison of NO ₃- concentration and δ ¹⁵N NO₃ can be used to further distinguish mixing from biological processing. However, in order to get a more precise answer regarding the nitrate sources, it would be useful to take both the data of nitrogen isotopes and data of oxygen isotopes present in nitrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisotope fractionation 3amixing 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3aoxygen 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 0aNitrates 0anitrate source 0astable isotopes 0aion exchange 0adischarge 0anutrient loading1 aOsipovs, Sergejs1 aVardanjans, Davids0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 96, no. 1 p.1-14dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2015.11141053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245011800201520199800319592002802317650002302345650002002368650001702388650002002405650003002425650001302455650001502468650001702483650002102500650001902521650001702540650001802557650001702575650001702592650001502609651001702624651001002641653002302651653001602674653001802690653003002708653002502738653002602763653003902789700001302828700005502841700001702896700001802913700005502931700001102986773011502997856008203112852000903194655001203203IND60727135220221118115021.0220606e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072713522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1138772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Shasha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4090-103612aA unique understanding of traditional medicine of pomegranate, Punica granatum L. and its current research status  aPomegranate, Punica granatum L., has been used in traditional medicine in China and several regions of the world including Ayurveda, Islamic, and Persian for the treatment of atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and several types of cancer, as well as for peptic ulcer and oral diseases for hundreds of years. Presently, pomegranate is treated as both a “medicine food homology” herbal medicine and a healthy food supplemental product. The aim of this work is to develop an overview of pomegranate in the context of the status of its traditional medicine theories, the spread along the Silk Road, ethnopharmacological uses, chemical compositions, pharmacological activities, toxicology, and the involved pathways. Information on P. granatum L. was acquired from published materials, including monographs on medicinal plants, ancient and modern recorded classical texts; and pharmacopoeias and electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI, and Wanfang Data). Pomegranate has been used in many traditional medical systems throughout history. It is widely cultivated in Central Asia and spread throughout China along the Silk Road. Many phytochemicals, such as tannins, organic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and volatile oils have been identified from different parts of pomegranate, these compounds have a wide range of activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-oncogenic properties, as well as conferring resistance to cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, A summary of the four promising pharmacological pathways is provided. The traditional uses, chemical compositions, pharmacological activities, and signaling pathways of pomegranate are summarized comprehensively in the review. It can be treated as a guidance for the future clinical and basic research. The information provided in this review will be very useful for further studies to develop novel therapeutic directions for application of pomegranate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aPunica granatum 3aantioxidants 3aatherosclerosis 3acerebrovascular disorders 3adiabetes 3aflavonoids 3ahealthy diet 3aherbal medicines 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3apeptic ulcers 3apomegranates 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 0aPunica granatum L. 0aPomegranate 0aThe silk road 0aEthnopharmacological uses 0aTraditional medicine 0aChemical compositions 0aPharmacological signaling pathways1 aDuo, Lan1 aWang, Junqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9398-47281 aGegenZhula, 1 aYang, Jingfan1 aLi, Zhiyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9720-59151 aTu, Ya0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 May 10, v. 271 p.113877-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1138773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017700156300001600333500002000349520079500369592002801164650001201192650001201204650000801216650001001224650002401234650000901258650001901267650001901286650001701305650001601322650001601338650002001354700001901374700001601393773013301409856007301542852000901615655001201624IND60600901920221121051115.0180704e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060090192DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.124762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jaehwan10aImaging diagnosis — radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography of a giant fecaloma causing stercoral perforation of the colon in a dog with a prostatic abscess  ap.

Previous studies have shown that wild-type (WT) SP-D can bind IAV but exhibits poor antiviral activities. However, a double mutant (DM) SP-D consisting of two point mutations (Asp325Ala and Arg343Val) inhibits IAV more potently. Presently, the structural mechanisms behind the point mutations’ effects on SP-D’s binding affinity with viral surface glycans are not fully understood. Here we use microsecond-scale, full-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the molecular mechanism of mutation-induced SP-D’s higher antiviral activity. We find that the Asp325Ala mutation promotes a trimannose conformational change to a more stable state. Arg343Val increases the binding with trimannose by increasing the hydrogen bonding interaction with Glu333. Free energy perturbation (FEP) binding free energy calculations indicate that the Arg343Val mutation contributes more to the increase of SP-D’s binding affinity with trimannose than Asp325Ala. This study provides a molecular-level exploration of how the two mutations increase SP-D binding affinity with trimannose, which is vital for further developing preventative strategies for related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGibbs free energy 3aInfluenza A virus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral properties 3abiotechnology 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3ainfluenza 3ainnate immunity 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation 3apolysaccharides 3asurfactant proteins 3asurfactants 0aSP-D 0aIAV 0aWT 0aDM 0aMD 0aFEP 0aPS 0aPAP 0aSP-B 0aSP-C 0aSP-A 0aHA 0aCRD 0aPME 0aRMSD 0aRMSF 0aλ-REMD 0aSurfactant Protein D 0aProtein-Glycan Complexes 0aMolecular Dynamics Simulation 0aFree Energy Perturbation1 aMinkara, Mona S.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.4984-5000dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245014100180300001400321520185100335592002802186650002202214650002802236650002502264650001402289650002002303650001402323650002002337650001202357650002002369650003102389650001002420650002702430650001402457650001902471650001802490650001702508650001202525650002502537650002002562650001802582650000902600650001902609650002102628650002202649650001202671650003202683650001602715653003102731653003102762653001502793700001902808700002002827700002802847700005702875773008502932856008603017852000903103655001203112IND60678256720221118041620.0200217e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067825672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Salah-Abbès, Jalila10aZearalenone nephrotoxicity: DNA fragmentation, apoptotic gene expression and oxidative stress protected by Lactobacillus plantarum MON03  ap. 28-35.  aThe present study was conducted to determine the abilities of the living Lactobacillus plantarum MON03 cells to degrade Zearalenone (ZEN) in liquid medium, and to elucidate the preventive effect in ZEN-contaminated balb/c mice showing kidney damage. The DNA fragmentation, Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression, caspase-3 activity, mRNA level of inflammation-regulating cytokines and histology of kidney tissues were examined. Female Balb/c mice were divided into four groups (10/group) and treated daily for 2 wk by oral gavage with lactic acid bacteria (L. plantarum MON03) 2 × 10⁹ CFU/L, ~2 mg/kg only, ZEN (40 mg/kg BW) only, ZEN (40 mg/kg BW) + lactic acid bacteria (L. plantarum MON03, 2 × 10⁹ CFU/L, ~2 mg/kg). Control group received vehicle. At the end of experiment, the kidney was collected for the determination of DNA fragmentation, Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression,caspase-3 activity, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) content, as well as for any alterations in expression of total antioxidant activity (TAC) and mRNA levels of inflammation-regulating cytokines (e.g., IL-10, IL-6, TNF-alpha).The results indicated that, kidney cells exposure to ZEN led to increased caspase-3 activity, MDA, and IL-10, IL-6, TNF-alpha and Bax mRNA levels, but decreased TAC content and down-regulated expression of GSH-Px and CAT and Bcl-2 mRNA. Co-treatment with ZEN plus LP suppressed the levels of DNA fragmentation; normalized kidney MDA and increased CAT levels, up-regulated expression of GSH-Px and CAT, and normalized mRNA levels of the analyzed cytokines. It's concluded that ZEN might have toxic effects in kidney. Further, it can be seen that use of LP induced protective effects against the oxidative stress and kidney toxicity of ZEN in part through adhesion (and so likely diminished bioavailability).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abioavailability 3acaspase-3 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistology 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azearalenone 0aPro-inflammatory cytokines 0aApoptotic genes expression 0aPrevention1 aBelgacem, Hela1 aEzzdini, Khawla1 aAbdel-Wahhab, Mosaad A.1 aAbbès, Samir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8466-50630 tToxicon.g2020 Feb., v. 175 p.28-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245012200185300001800307520117800325592002801503650002201531650002101553650001301574650001301587650001301600650001301613650002301626650003701649650001701686650002801703650001401731650001001745650001201755650001201767650002101779650001401800650001101814650002001825650001001845650001501855653001201870653001501882653002401897653002101921653001301942653001501955700002701970700003201997700003202029700002902061700002502090700003702115773010902152856008702261852000902348655001202357IND50067976820221117020049.0190402e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006797682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarabia-Sainz, Hector Manuel10aAdhesion of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains to neoglycans synthesised with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides  ap. 2727-2734.  aEnterotoxigenic (ETEC) Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes traveller’s diarrhoea and high mortality among baby animals. ETEC adhesion is mediated by lectins (adhesins) that bind to glycoconjugates on the surface of host cells. Glycans that compete for adhesion could be used for disease prevention. Neoglycans of porcine albumin (PSA) that were conjugated with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) were synthesised using the Maillard reaction. PSA glycation was confirmed by a reduction in the number of available free amino groups, decreased tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence, increased molecular mass and Ricinus communis lectin recognition. The adhesion of four ETEC strains (E. coli H10407, CFA+, K99 and K88) to PSA–GOS was examined by an enzyme-linked lectin assay. E. coli K88 bound to PSA–GOS with greater affinity (P<0.05) than did E. coli H10407, CFA+ and K99. In addition, PSA–GOS partially inhibited the adherence of the K88 strain to intestinal mucins. Pig ETEC strain was unable to ferment galactooligosaccharide–neoglycans. These results suggest that neoglycans obtained by the Maillard reaction may serve in the prophylaxis of ETEC K88 diarrhoea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aRicinus communis 3aadhesins 3aadhesion 3aalbumins 3adiarrhea 3adisease prevention 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3afluorescence 3agalactooligosaccharides 3aglycation 3ahosts 3ainfants 3alectins 3amolecular weight 3amortality 3amucins 3apolysaccharides 3aswine 3atryptophan 0aAlbumin 0aPrebiotics 0aMaillard-neoglycans 0aEscherichia coli 0aAdhesion 0aInhibition1 aArmenta-Ruiz, Carolina1 aSarabia-Sainz, Jose Andre-i1 aGuzmán-Partida, Ana María1 aLedesma-Osuna, Ana Irene1 aVázquez-Moreno, Luz1 aRamos-Clamont Montfort, Gabriela0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 141, no. 3 p.2727-2734dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010700172300001800279506011700297506007600414520160000490592002802090506003702118650001802155650001202173650001102185650002002196650001902216653004302235653002602278653002602304653001602330653001702346700002002363700002002383773012802403856004902531852000902580655001202589IND60793266020221207140734.0220914s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079326602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirqueira, Leonardo10aConcentration-dependent thermodynamic analysis of the partition process of small ligands into proteins  ap. 4885-4891.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the category of functional low-affinity interactions, small ligands may interact with multiple protein sites in a highly degenerate manner. Better conceived as a partition phenomenon at the molecular interface of proteins, such low-affinity interactions appear to be hidden to our current experimental resolution making their structural and functional characterization difficult in the low concentration regime of physiological processes. Characterization of the partition phenomenon under higher chemical forces could be a relevant strategy to tackle the problem provided the results can be scaled back to the low concentration range. Far from being trivial, such scaling demands a concentration-dependent understanding of self-interactions of the ligands, structural perturbations of the protein, among other molecular effects. Accordingly, we elaborate a novel and detailed concentration-dependent thermodynamic analysis of the partition process of small ligands aiming at characterizing the stability and structure of the dilute phenomenon from high concentrations. In analogy to an “aggregate” binding constant of a small molecule over multiple sites of a protein receptor, the model defines the stability of the process as a macroscopic equilibrium constant for the partition number of ligands that can be used to analyze biochemical and functional data of two-component systems driven by low-affinity interactions. Acquisition of such modeling-based structural information is expected to be highly welcome by revealing more traceable protein-binding spots for non-specific ligands.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiotechnology 3aligands 3amodels 3aprotein binding 3athermodynamics 0aNon-specific low-affinity interactions 0aPartition coefficient 0aFree energy stability 0aFlooding MD 0aCosolvent MD1 aStock, Letícia1 aTreptow, Werner0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.4885-4891dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.08.049  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016600159300001800325520174900343592002802092650001002120650002702130650002002157650001702177650002002194650002102214650002202235650001102257650001302268650001202281650001302293650001902306650001302325650002602338650001702364700001502381700001402396700001302410700001502423700001702438700001702455700001402472773011102486856007502597852000902672655001202681IND60529468520221116155807.0160717e20130604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052946852DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400994p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Tingting10aNanoarchitectured Electrochemical Cytosensors for Selective Detection of Leukemia Cells and Quantitative Evaluation of Death Receptor Expression on Cell Surfaces  ap. 5609-5616.  aThe variable susceptibility to the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment observed in various types of leukemia cells is related to the difference in the expression levels of death receptors, DR4 and DR5, on the cell surfaces. Quantifying the DR4/DR5 expression status on leukemia cell surfaces is of vital importance to the development of diagnostic tools to guide death receptor-based leukemia treatment. Taking the full advantages of novel nanobiotechnology, we have developed a robust electrochemical cytosensing approach toward ultrasensitive detection of leukemia cells with detection limit as low as ∼40 cells and quantitative evaluation of DR4/DR5 expression on leukemia cell surfaces. The optimization of electron transfer and cell capture processes at specifically tailored nanobiointerfaces and the incorporation of multiple functions into rationally designed nanoprobes provide unique opportunities of integrating high specificity and signal amplification on one electrochemical cytosensor. The high sensitivity and selectivity of this electrochemical cytosensing approach also allows us to evaluate the dynamic alteration of DR4/DR5 expression on the surfaces of living cells in response to drug treatments. Using the TRAIL-resistant HL-60 cells and TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat cells as model cells, we have further verified that the TRAIL susceptibility of various types of leukemia cells is directly correlated to the surface expression levels of DR4/DR5. This versatile electrochemical cytosensing platform is believed to be of great clinical value for the early diagnosis of human leukemia and the evaluation of therapeutic effects on leukemia patients after radiation therapy or drug treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3adeath domain receptors 3adetection limit 3adrug therapy 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3aligands 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis 3aradiotherapy1 aFu, Jia-Ju1 aHu, Lihui1 aQiu, Fan1 aHu, Minjin1 aZhu, Jun-Jie1 aHua, Zi-Chun1 aWang, Hui0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 June 04, v. 85, no. 11 p.5609-5616dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac400994p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245004400169300002000213520111600233592002801349650001301377650001301390650001201403650001501415700002401430773010101454856008601555852000901641655001201650IND60577336320221120143831.0170808e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057733632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b029522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSehgal, Ray M.10aEquilibrium Shape of Colloidal Crystals  ap. 11428-11437.  aAssembling colloidal particles into highly ordered configurations, such as photonic crystals, has significant potential for enabling a broad range of new technologies. Facilitating the nucleation of colloidal crystals and developing successful crystal growth strategies require a fundamental understanding of the equilibrium structure and morphology of small colloidal assemblies. Here, we report the results of a novel computational approach to determine the equilibrium shape of assemblies of colloidal particles that interact via an experimentally validated pair potential. While the well-known Wulff construction can accurately capture the equilibrium shape of large colloidal assemblies, containing O(10⁴) or more particles, determining the equilibrium shape of small colloidal assemblies of O(10) particles requires a generalized Wulff construction technique which we have developed for a proper description of equilibrium structure and morphology of small crystals.

At least six American crayfish species have been reported in the Netherlands but the presence of this pathogenic oomycete with substantial conservational impact has not yet been confirmed in the country. We evaluated A. astaci prevalence in Dutch populations of six alien crustaceans using species-specific quantitative PCR. These included three confirmed crayfish carriers (Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, Procambarus clarkii), two recently introduced but yet unstudied crayfish (Orconectes cf. virilis, Procambarus cf. acutus), and a catadromous crab Eriocheir sinensis. Moderate levels of infection were observed in some populations of O. limosus and P. leniusculus. Positive results were also obtained for E. sinensis and two Dutch populations of O. cf. virilis. English population of the latter species was also found infected, confirming this taxon as another A. astaci carrier in European waters. In contrast, Dutch P. clarkii seem only sporadically infected, and the pathogen was not yet detected in P. cf. acutus. Our study is the first confirmation of crayfish plague infections in the Netherlands and demonstrates substantial variation in A. astaci prevalence among potential hosts within a single region, a pattern possibly linked to their introduction history and coexistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanomyces astaci 3aEriocheir sinensis 3aPacifastacus leniusculus 3aProcambarus clarkii 3acrayfish 3ahosts 3amigratory species 3apathogens 3aplague 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3aNetherlands 0aCrayfish plague 0aAphanomyces astaci 0aHost range 0aOrconectes virilis 0aEriocheir sinensis 0aReal-time PCR1 aMrugała, A.1 aSvoboda, J.1 aEngelsma, M.Y.1 aPetie, M.1 aSoes, D.M.1 aNutbeam-Tuffs, S.1 aOidtmann, B.1 aRoessink, I.1 aPetrusek, A.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2014 July, v. 120 p.74-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013700167300001800304520111600322592002801438650001501466650001501481650000901496650001801505650001901523650002201542650002501564650001401589650002001603650002001623700001601643700001401659700001501673700001701688773012101705856008201826852000901908655001201917IND60575829620221119024928.0180619e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057582962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-0818-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Jianliang12al-cysteine-reduced graphene oxide/poly(vinyl alcohol) ultralight aerogel as a broad-spectrum adsorbent for anionic and cationic dyes  ap. 5807-5821.  aIt is a challenge to develop broad-spectrum, high-efficiency, easy-recyclable adsorbents for the removal of water contaminants. Herein, l-cysteine-reduced graphene oxide/poly(vinyl alcohol) (CRG/PVA) ultralight aerogels with good mechanical strength and reusability are prepared via a direct sol–aerogel transition strategy by freeze drying. At optimized composition, the aerogel shows high adsorption efficiency toward both cationic and anionic dyes, overcoming the defect of many traditional adsorbents that usually can only remove one type of organic dyes. The adsorption is proved to involve in π–π interaction between CRG and dyes, endowing the aerogel with universality in adsorbing a wide range of conjugated dyes. Moreover, a remarkable synergetic effect is observed for removal of two oppositely charged dyes from aqueous system, yielding exceptionally high total adsorption capacities surpassing all known adsorbents examined for removing binary dyes. Thus, the CRG/PVA aerogel demonstrates great potential for usage as reusable, high-efficiency, and broad-spectrum adsorbent in water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adyes 3afreeze drying 3agraphene oxide 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astrength (mechanics) 3asynergism 3awater pollution 3awater treatment1 aLv, Weiyang1 aXie, Zhou1 aSong, Yihu1 aZheng, Qiang0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 May, v. 52, no. 10 p.5807-5821dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-0818-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245011300181520248800294592002802782650001602810650001502826650001702841650002202858650001202880650001502892650001602907650001302923651001902936651001902955653001702974653001502991653001403006653001703020653001203037653001203049653002403061700001903085700002403104700002203128700001903150700002603169700002203195700002303217773009603240856008903336852000903425655001203434IND60760070020221122091153.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076007002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1059312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimengsi, Jude Ndzifon10aWhat do we (not) know on forest management institutions in sub-Saharan Africa? A regional comparative review  aWith growing concerns linked to the (un)sustainable management of forest resources, the role of institutions as mediators increasingly gains relevance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This is particularly so, as formal and informal institutions virtually compete for dominance – a yet-to-be-resolved colonial hangover. A large body of scientific knowledge exists on the role of institutions in regulating forest access, use, and management in SSA, albeit fragmented. Sub-regional variations in research on this subject further nuances our understanding of the breadth of conceptual and methodological issues in this field. This raises a central question: How can we advance knowledge on forest management institutions in SSA to enhance forest governance amidst the critical role of forests in addressing current global environmental challenges? We contribute answers to such interrogation by systematically reviewing more than three decades of scientific literature on institutions in forest use and management. Through a structured review of 100 empirical articles (involving 374 cases studies), and guided by the socio-ecological co-evolution framework, we derived two lessons. First, the conceptualization of forest-linked institutions is more skewed towards institutions as processes, than as structures. Second, the major determinants of institutional compliance are economic, ecological, political, socio-cultural, demographic, and geographical in nature. However, the weight of each determining factor varies in specific sub-regions. For instance, in East Africa, economic, ecological, socio-cultural, and geographic factors dominate while economic, demographic, and political factors dominate in Central Africa. Therefore, in crafting forest institutions in SSA, sub-regional disparities in factors that influence compliance (or otherwise) should be critically considered and addressed to improve effectiveness. Methodologically, qualitative approaches (e.g., key informant interviews and focus group discussions), conducted within short time spans, have been prioritized. However, observed knowledge fragmentation on the subject, including inconsistencies or mismatches, calls for combined, long term qualitative analyses with quantitative ones, in a robust mixed-methods approach. Future research should prioritize this methodological approach, with a focus on sub-regional, country-level specificities, to better inform understanding of forest-linked institutional dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoevolution 3acompliance 3afocus groups 3aforest management 3aforests 3agovernance 3aland policy 3apolitics 3aCentral Africa 3aEastern Africa 0aInstitutions 0aStructures 0aProcesses 0aDeterminants 0aForests 0aMethods 0aSub-Regional Africa1 aOwusu, Raphael1 aDjenontin, Ida N.S.1 aPretzsch, Jürgen1 aGiessen, Lukas1 aBuchenrieder, Gertrud1 aPouliot, Mariève1 aAcosta, Ana Nicole0 tLand use policy.g2022 Mar., v. 114 p.105931-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1059313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001600265520103600281592002801317650002101345650002101366650002601387650002201413650002701435651001001462700001701472700001901489700002001508700001401528700001701542773010001559856008101659852000901740655001201749IND60111921720221116163646.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011192172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chun-qiong10aExploring the genetic diversity of Cynodon radiatus (Poaceae) accessions using ISSR markers  ap. 218-223.  aInter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were applied to determine the genetic relationship among 29 Cynodon radiatus accessions from different regions of China. Fifty ISSR primers were screened, and 14 primers were selected for their capability to produce clear and reproducible patterns of multiple bands to amplify specific C. radiatus genomic sequences. A total of 189 ISSR fragments from 300 bp to 3000 bp were amplified, of which 98.94% were polymorphic. Genetic similarity coefficients among the 29 accessions ranged from 0.45 to 0.90, with an average of 0.68. Cluster analysis by 2 methods, unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages and principle coordinate analysis, showed that the C. radiatus accessions clustered into 4 distinct groups. A high level of variation exists in C. radiatus accessions. The present study shows that the ISSR technique is a powerful method for the identification and molecular classification of C. radiatus accessions, and for the determination of their genetic relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon radiatus 3acluster analysis 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aChina1 aLiu, Guo-dao1 aBai, Chang-jun1 aWang, Wen-qiang1 aTang, Jun1 aYu, Dao-geng0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2012 Dec., v. 45 p.218-223dElsevier Ltdx0305-19787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01081naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013100156300001300287520020900300592002800509650001400537650000900551650001500560650001700575773014000592856007400732852000900806655001200815IND60630229820221120153145.0190206e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063022982DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta90024a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeltie, Sam10aExpression of concern: Novel mesoporous amorphous B–N–O–H nanofoam as an electrode for capacitive dye removal from water  ap. 2920.  aExpression of concern for ‘Novel mesoporous amorphous B–N–O–H nanofoam as an electrode for capacitive dye removal from water’ by Ming Ming Chen et al., J.

Compared with cellulose and lignin, hemicellulose has been less studied. Some ionic liquids (ILs) have been proved to be excellent solvents for lignocellulosic pretreatment. However, screening of more efficient ILs is difficult due to numerous possible ILs. Computational chemistry has been proved effective in solvent screening, but a precise model is indispensable. In this work, we focused on building several appropriate models and selected the most suitable one. According to the structure of hemicellulose, six hemicellulose models were constructed and the mid-dimer of the xylan chain hemicellulose (MDXC) model was proved to be the best compared with the reported experimental results. Based on the MDXC model, 1368 ILs were screened to evaluate their ability to dissolve hemicellulose by Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). The activity coefficient (γ), excess enthalpy (Hᴱ), and σ-profile indicated that the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) played a vital role in the dissolution of hemicellulose. Anions played a more critical role than cations, where small anions with H-bond acceptor groups could enhance the molecular interactions with hemicellulose. This work provided a thermodynamic understanding of hemicellulose and IL solvent systems. It highlights the importance of building appropriate solute models, which may be necessary to predict of the other thermodynamic properties in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aenthalpy 3ahydrogen bonding 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3asolutes 3axylan1 aZhou, Yingnan,1 aFang, Timing1 aYing, Shengzhe1 aLiu, Xiaomin0 tRSC advances.g2022 June 06, v. 12, no. 26 p.16517-16529dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02001g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245010700177300001600284520143900300592002801739650002601767650001901793650001401812650001101826650002501837650001201862650001601874650001001890650001201900650001601912651001801928653003101946653002801977653002202005653001202027653002502039700002002064700006202084700001602146700001802162700002202180773013402202856008802336852000902424655001202433IND60597975020221121055806.0201111e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059797502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.4222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Philip J.10aAtmospheric impacts of a natural gas development within the urban context of Morgantown, West Virginia  ap. 406-416.  aThe Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory (MSEEL) in West Virginia provides a unique opportunity in the field of unconventional energy research. By studying near-surface atmospheric chemistry over several phases of a hydraulic fracturing event, the project will help evaluate the impact of current practices, as well as new techniques and mitigation technologies. A total of 10 mobile surveys covering a distance of approximately 1500 km were conducted through Morgantown. Our surveying technique involved using a vehicle-mounted Los Gatos Research gas analyzer to provide geo-located measurements of methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The ratios of super-ambient concentrations of CO₂ and CH₄ were used to separate well-pad emissions from the natural background concentrations over the various stages of well-pad development, as well as for comparisons to other urban sources of CH₄. We found that regional background methane concentrations were elevated in all surveys, with a mean concentration of 2.699 ± 0.006 ppmv, which simply reflected the complexity of this riverine urban location. Emissions at the site were the greatest during the flow-back phase, with an estimated CH₄ volume output of 20.62 ± 7.07 g/s, which was significantly higher than other identified urban emitters. Our study was able to successfully identify and quantify MSEEL emissions within this complex urban environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenergy 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amethane 3anatural gas 3ashale 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aWest Virginia 0aUnconventional oil and gas 0aVehicle-based surveying 0aUrban environment 0aMethane 0aWell-pad development1 aReeder, Matthew1 aPekney, Natalie J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3198-786X1 aRisk, David1 aOsborne, John1 aMcCawley, Michael0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 639 p.406-416dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.4223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008400160300002000244520152100264592002801785650001501813650002401828650001901852650003001871650001101901650001401912700001801926700002101944773012501965856007502090852000902165655001202174IND60779641120221120191040.0220613e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077964112DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02030k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahriar, Rifat10aAdsorption of gas molecules on buckled GaAs monolayer: a first-principles study  ap. 16732-16744.  aThe design of sensitive and selective gas sensors can be significantly simplified if materials that are intrinsically selective to target gas molecules can be identified. In recent years, monolayers consisting of group III–V elements have been identified as promising gas sensing materials. In this article, we investigate gas adsorption properties of buckled GaAs monolayer using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. We examine the adsorption energy, adsorption distance, charge transfer, and electron density difference to study the strength and nature of adsorption. We calculate the change in band structure, work function, conductivity, density of states, and optical reflectivity for analyzing its prospect as work function-based, chemiresistive, optical, and magnetic gas sensor applications. In this regard, we considered the adsorption of ten gas molecules, namely NH₃, NO₂, NO, CH₄, H₂, CO, SO₂, HCN, H₂S, and CO₂, and noticed that GaAs monolayer is responsive to NO, NO₂, NH₃, and SO₂ only. Specifically, NH₃, SO₂ and NO₂ chemisorb on the GaAs monolayer and change the work function by more than 5%. While both NO and NO₂ are found to be responsive in the far-infrared (FIR) range, NO shows better spin-splitting property and a significant change in conductivity. Moreover, the recovery time at room temperature for NO is observed to be in the sub-millisecond range suggesting selective and sensitive NO response in GaAs monolayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3amagnetism1 aHassan, Orchi1 aAlam, Md.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying systems energy responses (SERs) linked to sex differentiation of Drynaria roosii gametophytes in response to LS remains the enigma. Here, we used Red-LED-Light (RLL), Blue-LED-Light (BLL) and Fluorescent-Light (FL) regimes to treat D. roosii gametophytes to achieve the knowledge of global expression database. Compared with FL, transcriptional changes showed that RLL reduced mRNA levels of photosynthetic genes and improved mRNA levels of respiratory genes. Obviously, RLL decreased PSII/PSI activities with lower Y(II), Fv/Fm, Y(I) and ETR(I) values, and promoted mitochondria activity with higher respiratory rate. Combined with severer ROS stress, we suggested that RLL caused the energy deficit to gametophytes. However, the impacts of BLL were contrary to RLL. Exactly, 63.75 % of males was induced under RLL vs 12.70 % under FL, whilst 64.50 % of females under BLL vs 48.08 % under FL. Moreover, we applied the WGCNA to cluster LS-induced DEGs into eleven modules, and DEGs in five significant sample-specific modules mainly fell in energy metabolism categorization through KEGG pathway analysis. Networks proved the complicated ‘cross-talk’ between SER- and TF-associated genes, and revealed hub genes in response to LS. Based on previous experimental evidence, we supposed a link between LS-induced energy metabolism responses and sex differentiation in D. roosii gametophytes, showing that RLL contributed to male-biased sex ratios for less energy production than BLL and FL, while BLL contributed to a female-biased trend. Our work firstly shed light on SERs to LS in D. roosii gametophytes, and provided new insights for understanding the sex differentiation in ferns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrynaria 3adatabases 3afemales 3aferns and fern allies 3afluorescent lighting 3agametophytes 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3aphotosystem II 3asex allocation 3asex ratio 3asexual development 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBLL 0aDEG 0aESDS 0aET 0aFL 0aFPKM 0aJA 0aLHC 0aKEGG 0aLS 0aLSDS 0aMETC 0aMOA 0aNGS 0aROS 0aSDS 0aSEM 0aSER 0aSERG 0aRLL 0aTEM 0aTF 0aWGCNA 0aDrynaria roosii gametophyte 0aEnergy response 0aLight spectrum 0aSex differentiation 0aWGCNA1 aZhang, Xian-Chun1 aLi, Dong1 aSun, Mei-Yu1 aShi, Lei0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 Apr., v. 172 p.103996-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1039963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245013200177520149200309592002801801650002201829650001201851650001901863650001201882650002201894650002001916650001301936650002501949650002501974650001501999650001902014650001502033650001602048650001102064650001902075650001602094650001202110650001302122650001102135653001902146653002602165653002502191653002302216653001802239653002602257700002302283700002502306700002302331700002002354700002702374773012002401856008802521852000902609655001202618IND60682260920221122021316.0200320e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068226092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1039972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, Samantha J.10aElevated temperature and carbon dioxide alter resource allocation to growth, storage and defence in cassava (Manihot esculenta)  aRising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and global warming can alter how plants partition their resources. This is important for food crops through changes in resource allocation to edible tissues and toxic defence compounds. While research suggests elevated temperature and [CO₂] independently drive changes in plant metabolism and stress levels, and photosynthetic rates, respectively, it is less clear how these environmental changes impact plants when combined. Cassava is an important dietary staple for many developing nations. However, the safety of cassava depends on cyanogenic glucoside concentrations. In a climate-controlled greenhouse, the effects of elevated temperature in the presence and absence of elevated [CO₂] on the growth, physiology and chemical defence of cassava at two growth stages were examined. Growth in cassava was initially increased by elevated temperature. However, across time, simultaneous elevated [CO₂] led to an increasing biomass advantage over plants grown at ambient [CO₂] and temperature. Elevated temperature and [CO₂] also significantly increased tuber initiation and early tuber expansion. Tuber and leaf cyanide concentrations were significantly reduced under elevated temperature, while elevated temperature and [CO₂] produced tuber cyanide concentrations similar to the higher levels found in plants grown at ambient conditions. The findings highlight how future climate change may impact both cassava production and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acassava 3achemical defenses 3acrop production 3acyanides 3adeveloping countries 3adevelopmental stages 3afood crops 3aglobal warming 3aglucosides 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperature 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atubers 0aClimate change 0aCyanogenic glucosides 0aGlobal food security 0aMajor staple crops 0aPlant defence 0aResource partitioning1 aCernusak, Lucas A.1 aNorthfield, Tobin D.1 aGleadow, Roslyn M.1 aLambert, Smilja1 aCheesman, Alexander W.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 May, v. 173 p.103997-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1039973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008700169300002000256520148300276592002801759650004401787650002201831650002501853650002101878650002101899650001601920650001001936650001801946650001301964650001301977650001701990650001702007650001202024650002002036650001902056650001102075650001902086650002602105650001902131650002602150650001502176650001602191650001702207650003302224650002302257653001202280653001802292653001502310653002202325653002002347653002602367653002302393700002702416700002902443700002402472700002102496700001702517700002202534700001702556700002002573700002502593700002402618700002302642773012602665856008002791852000902871655001202880IND60580865020171121000000.0171004e20171004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058086502DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b131992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagarajan, Sakthivel10aDesign of Boron Nitride/Gelatin Electrospun Nanofibers for Bone Tissue Engineering  ap. 33695-33706.  aGelatin is a biodegradable biopolymer obtained by collagen denaturation, which shows poor mechanical properties. Hence, improving its mechanical properties is very essential toward the fabrication of efficient nontoxic material for biomedical applications. For this aim, various methods are employed using external fillers such as ceramics or bioglass. In this report, we introduce boron nitride (BN)-reinforced gelatin as a new class of two-dimensional biocompatible nanomaterials. The effect of the nanofiller on the mechanical behavior is analyzed. BN is efficiently exfoliated using the biopolymer gelatin as shown through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The exfoliated BN reinforces gelatin electrospun fibers, which results in an increase in the Young’s modulus. The Electrospun Mats (ESM) are stable after the glutaraldehyde cross-linking, and the fibrous morphology is preserved. The cross-linked gelatin/BN ESM is highly bioactive in forming bonelike hydroxyapatite as shown by scanning electron microscopy. Due to their enhanced mineralization ability, the cross-linked ESM have been tested on human bone cells (HOS osteosarcoma cell line). The cell attachment, proliferation, and biocompatibility results show that the ESM are nontoxic and biodegradable. The analysis of osteoblast gene expression and the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity confirm that these materials are suitable for bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3abones 3aboron nitride 3aceramics 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3adenaturation 3agelatin 3agene expression 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahumans 3ahydroxyapatite 3amechanical properties 3amineralization 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3aosteoblasts 3aosteosarcoma 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue engineering 0agelatin 0aboron nitride 0ananosheets 0abionanocomposites 0aelectrospinning 0amechanical properties 0atissue engineering1 aBalʻīd, al-Ḥabīb,1 aPochat-Bohatier, Céline1 aTeyssier, Catherine1 aIatsunskyi, Igor1 aCoy, Emerson1 aBalme, Sébastien1 aCornu, David1 aMiele, Philippe1 aKalkura, Narayana S.1 aCavaillès, Vincent1 aBechelany, Mikhael0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Oct. 04, v. 9, no. 39 p.33695-33706dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b131993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245007700153300002000230520174800250592002801998650001202026650001402038650001902052650001202071650002102083650001502104650001702119650002202136650000902158650001302167650001902180650000902199650001802208650002202226650001102248650002002259700001502279700001802294700001502312700001802327773013402345856007502479852000902554655001202563IND60538883520221118024640.0160815e20130710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053888352DNAL7 a10.1021/ja402456b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bo10aGraphene Nanoelectrodes: Fabrication and Size-Dependent Electrochemistry  ap. 10073-10080.  aThe fabrication and electrochemistry of a new class of graphene electrodes are presented. Through high-temperature annealing of hydrazine-reduced graphene oxides followed by high-speed centrifugation and size-selected ultrafiltration, flakes of reduced graphene oxides (r-GOs) of nanometer and submicrometer dimensions, respectively, are obtained and separated from the larger ones. Using n-dodecanethiol-modified Au ultramicroelectrodes of appropriately small sizes, quick dipping in dilute suspensions of these small r-GOs allows attachment of only a single flake on the thiol monolayer. The electrodes thus fabricated are used to study the heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) kinetics at r-GOs and the nanoscopic charge transport dynamics at electrochemical interfaces. The r-GOs are found to exhibit similarly high activity for electrochemical ET reactions to metal electrodes. Voltammetric analysis for the relatively slow ET reaction of Fe(CN)₆³– reduction produces slightly higher ET rate constants at r-GOs of nanometer sizes than at large ones. These ET kinetic features are in accordance with the defect-dominant nature of the r-GOs and the increased defect density in the nanometer-sized flakes as revealed by Raman spectroscopic measurements. The voltammetric enhancement and inhibition for the reduction of Ru(NH₃)₆³⁺ and Fe(CN)₆³–, respectively, at r-GO flakes of submicrometer and nanometer dimensions upon removal of supporting electrolyte are found to significantly deviate in magnitude from those predicted by the electroneutrality-based electromigration theory, which may evidence the increased penetration of the diffuse double layer into the mass transport layer at nanoscopic electrochemical interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aannealing 3acentrifugation 3adipping 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airon 3amass transfer 3aspectral analysis 3athiols 3aultrafiltration1 aFan, Lixin1 aZhong, Huawei1 aLiu, Yuwen1 aChen, Shengli0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 July 10, v. 135, no. 27 p.10073-10080dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja402456b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245011200157300001600269520100700285592002801292650001001320650002501330650001701355650001901372650001401391650001601405650001201421650001001433650001101443650002301454650002001477650001401497700001901511773012801530856007001658852000901728655001201737IND60481435220221121061014.0160204e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048143522DNAL7 a10.1890/0800492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurteau, Matthew10aFuel treatment effects on tree‐based forest carbon storage and emissions under modeled wildfire scenarios  ap. 409-414.  aForests are viewed as a potential sink for carbon (C) that might otherwise contribute to climate change. It is unclear, however, how to manage forests with frequent fire regimes to maximize C storage while reducing C emissions from prescribed burns or wildfire. We modeled the effects of eight different fuel treatments on tree‐based C storage and release over a century, with and without wildfire. Model runs show that, after a century of growth without wildfire, the control stored the most C. However, when wildfire was included in the model, the control had the largest total C emission and largest reduction in live‐tree‐based C stocks. In model runs including wildfire, the final amount of tree‐based C sequestered was most affected by the stand structure initially produced by the different fuel treatments. In wildfire‐prone forests, tree‐based C stocks were best protected by fuel treatments that produced a low‐density stand structure dominated by large, fire‐resistant pines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3afire regime 3aforests 3afuels 3amodels 3aprescribed burning 3astand structure 3awildfires1 aNorth, Malcolm0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2009 Oct., v. 7, no. 8 p.409-414dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0800493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013400169520150700303592002801810650001601838650002001854650001801874650001801892650001201910650001201922650002201934650002401956650001101980650001901991650002002010650001302030650002802043650001602071650002402087650001202111650003102123650001702154653001302171653002402184653002202208653000802230653001902238700001402257700001502271700001302286700002002299700001202319700001502331700001702346700001802363700002002381773012102401856008802522852000902610655001202619IND60682261120221122020655.0200217e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068226112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1039992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weirong10aRole of an Amur grape CBL-interacting protein kinase VaCIPK02 in drought tolerance by modulating ABA signaling and ROS production  aCalcineurin B-like proteins (CBL) and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPK) play critical roles in mediating plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which these complex functions and the potential cross talk between the diverse downstream signaling networks are regulated still remain elusive. Here we characterized a VaCIPK02 from Vitis amurensis, and show it functions in salt and drought stresses. We have identified that, at least, the domain at C terminus of VaCIPK02 involved in transcriptional activation. VaCIPK02 could strongly interact with four Ca²⁺ sensor proteins, VaCBL1, 4, 5 and 8, respectively. A Y2H-based screen to isolate genes encoding VaCIPK02-interacting proteins identified 12 additional partners, including an ABA receptor PYL9, which interacts with VaCIPK02 in vivo. Constitutive expression of VaCIPK02 in Arabidopsis showed extremely sensitive to salt stress, but displayed increased tolerance to drought stress accompanied by ABA-hypersensitive stomata closure, improved water-conserving capacity, and increased cellular ABA levels. Moreover, overexpression of VaCIPK02 caused reduced cellular levels of ABA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by regulating the expression levels of many ABA-responsive genes to scavenge and modulate ROS levels. Our results provide evidence for the involvement of VaCIPK02 along with its diverse interacting proteins in regulating salt and drought stress signal pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aVitis amurensis 3aabscisic acid 3abiotic stress 3acalcium 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agrapes 3aplant response 3aprotein kinases 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3asalt stress 3asignal transduction 3astomata 3atranscriptional activation 3awater stress 0aVaCIPK02 0aAbscisic acid (ABA) 0aStomatal movement 0aROS 0aDrought stress1 aShen, Wei1 aMa, Junjie1 aYa, Rong1 aZheng, Qiaoling1 aWu, Nan1 aYu, Qinhan1 aYao, Wenkong1 aZhang, Ningbo1 aZhang, Junxiang0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 Apr., v. 172 p.103999-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1039993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245007200169500001100241500000900252520151000261592002801771596006701799596002801866596004801894596004801942596010301990650001702093650001202110650001202122650002802134650001002162650001602172650000902188650002102197650001002218700002602228700003002254700002202284773021402306856008002520852000902600655001202609IND60663017620221118021138.0220826s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066301762DNAL7 a10.2134/ael2017.02.00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeumann, Rebecca B.10aSoil Warming Increases Arsenic Availability in the Rice Rhizosphere  aLETTER  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Arsenic is a common contaminant in rice, threatening yield and human health. Climate warming could alter availability and plant uptake of arsenic. Arsenic concentrations in porewater and plant tissue increased with soil warming. Grain arsenic concentrations were not significantly affected by soil temperature. Future studies should explore links between climate conditions and arsenic uptake by rice. Arsenic uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L.) threatens yield and contaminates grain. Climate warming could affect these hazards. We tested the effect of elevated soil temperature on arsenic availability to and uptake by rice plants. Rice was grown in arsenic‐amended soil in rhizoboxes that facilitated porewater sampling and synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging of the rhizosphere. Plants were subjected to similar atmospheric conditions but different soil temperatures. The XRF imaging revealed greater arsenic sequestration in root iron plaques with a warmer soil temperature. Mean and median arsenic concentrations in porewater and root, straw, and husk tissue were positively correlated with average daily maximum soil temperature. Grain arsenic concentrations did not change. Warmer soil temperatures likely increased plant‐available arsenic by increasing reductive dissolution of arsenic‐bearing iron minerals, but the plants effectively regulated grain arsenic. The impacts of changing environmental conditions on arsenic contamination of rice should be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data  a(A73891)cUniversity of Washington Royalty Research Fund Award  cInnovation Award to RBN  a1338389cNational Science Foundation Grants  a1350580cNational Science Foundation Grants  aDE‐AC02‐76SF00515cUS Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences 3aOryza sativa 3aarsenic 3aclimate 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahulls 3arhizosphere 3arice 3asoil temperature 3astraw1 aSeyfferth, Angelia L.1 aTeshera‐Levye, Jennifer1 aEllingson, Joseph0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2017, v. 2, no. 1 p.e170006-dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/ael2017.02.00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245024700171520121200418592002801630650005601658650002301714650001301737650002101750650002101771653001801792653001701810653002501827653003601852653003401888700001601922700002301938700002101961700002501982700002102007700002002028700002702048773011402075856008502189852000902274655001202283IND60755186120221119174226.0211129e20211206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075518612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4626442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroeneveld, Gino10aFast determination of functionality-type × molecular-weight distribution of propoxylates with varying numbers of hydroxyl end-groups using gradient–normal-phase liquid chromatography × ultra-high pressure size-exclusion chromatography  aUnderstanding the relation between chemical characteristics and properties of synthetic polymers is one of the challenges faced by analytical chemists in industry. This is a complex task, as polymers are not synthesized as single molecule, but are populations of chemically similar compounds with distributions over several properties. The latter include, for example, molecular weight, nature of end-groups (functionality), and chemical composition.In this paper, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography was used to determine the combined functionality-type and molecular-weight distributions of hydroxy‑functionalized propoxylates. Propoxylates derived from different initiators (one up to eight terminal hydroxyl groups) were separated in the first dimension using a gradient normal-phase LC separation (NPLC). In the second dimension ultra-high pressure size-exclusion chromatography separation (UHPSEC), further speciating distributions based on molecular size. The developed NPLC × SEC method with evaporative light-scattering detection can be used for the fast screening (< 30 min) of mutually dependent functionality-type and molecular-weight distributions of unknown propoxylates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 3agel chromatography 3aindustry 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 0aNPLC × SEC 0aPropoxylates 0aPoly-propylene oxide 0aFunctionality-type distribution 0aTwo-dimensional distributions1 aSalome, Ron1 aDunkle, Melissa N.1 aBashir, Mubasher1 aGargano, Andrea F.G.1 aPursch, Matthias1 aMes, Edwin P.C.1 aSchoenmakers, Peter J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 1659 p.462644-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4626443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019500159300002000354520202400374592002802398650001202426650002602438650002902464650002102493650001202514650002102526650002202547650001802569650001802587650002402605650001402629650004302643650002202686650002002708650002102728650002502749700001802774700001302792700001802805773012402823856007402947852000903021655001203030IND60640933520221120104456.0190505e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064093352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13066f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jing-Feng10aInsight into the short-term effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on active ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant: a DNA-stable isotope probing study  ap. 73421-73431.  aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are two distinct ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) responsible for nitrification in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, their relative contributions to ammonia oxidation in WWTPs and short-term responses to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂ NPs) remain unclear. In this study, DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), PCR, cloning and sequencing were applied to investigate the in situ activity of AOMs in a full-scale WWTP and to evaluate their responses to TiO₂ NPs. An environmentally relevant concentration (1 mg L⁻¹) and a higher concentration (50 mg L⁻¹) of TiO₂ NPs were chosen for laboratory microcosms. The laboratory microcosms revealed that TiO₂ NPs (1 or 50 mg L⁻¹) caused slight or no short-term inhibitions on nitrification activity and nitrification rate of activated sludge. The successful Na₂¹³CO₃ assimilation of AOB rather than AOA in original sludge provided compelling evidence for the strong contribution of AOB to the in situ nitrification of the WWTP. The main AOB in original sludge, Nitrosomonas oligotropha cluster and Nitrosomonas europaea cluster, were the dominant active AOB in the WWTP. However, compared with the original sludge, the abundance and distribution of active AOB changed under 1 and 50 mg L⁻¹ of TiO₂ NPs. In particular, AOA within Nitrososphaera cluster were the active AOMs under 50 mg L⁻¹ TiO₂ NPs. These results suggested that TiO₂ NPs had a potential impact on the abundance and composition of active AOMs in the WWTP. This study further provided direct evidence of the autotrophic growth of AOB within N. oligotropha cluster and N. europaea cluster, and AOA within the general Nitrososphaera cluster. Overall, AOB played an important role in the in situ nitrification of the full-scale WWTP investigated, while AOA showed a strong contribution to the active nitrification under higher concentration of TiO₂ NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aNitrosomonas europaea 3aNitrosomonas oligotropha 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3aisotope labeling 3amolecular cloning 3ananoparticles 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3aoxidation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3astable isotopes 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment1 aFan, Xiao-Yan1 aLuo, Xin1 aPan, Kai-Ling0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 02, v. 6, no. 77 p.73421-73431dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra13066f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245018200153300002000335520127500355592002801630650003501658650001701693650002601710650002401736650001201760650001501772650002401787650001301811651001001824700001401834700001601848700001201864700001701876773012501893856007502018852000902093655001202102IND60779641520221120211512.0220613e20220607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077964152DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02148j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lu10aDetermination of macro, micro and toxic element concentrations in peanuts from main peanut producing areas of China by ICP-MS: a pilot study on the geographical characterization  ap. 16790-16797.  aPeanut is an important crop grown worldwide. The geographic origin of peanuts has been a topic of substantial attention since their prices can vary according to their geographic origins. This study evaluated the main macro (K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Al), micro (Fe, Zn, Mn, Ni, Sr, Mo, Cu, Se, V, Co), and toxic (As, Cd, Cr, and Pb) element concentrations in peanuts collected from six different Chinese provinces. Multi-element analysis of peanuts from different regions was carried out to develop a reliable method to trace the origin of peanuts. After microwave digestion, the element concentrations were determined through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Certified reference material (CRM, GBW10011) was used to ensure accurate results. The profile of contents of major elements obtained in the current study showed the order: K > Mg > Ca > Al > Na > Zn > Fe > Mn > Ni > Sr > Mo. The average concentrations of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, As, and Cr were very low and within the safe limits. Correlation analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between individual elements in peanut samples. The data were processed by means of the chemometric approach of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and 97.0% of samples were correctly predicted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3amicrowave treatment 3apeanuts 3aprovenance 3areference standards 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aDing, Min1 aLi, Zengmei1 aLi, Xia1 aDeng, Ligang0 tRSC advances.g2022 June 07, v. 12, no. 26 p.16790-16797dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02148j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300002000268520106100288592002801349650002101377650001301398650001501411650003101426650002201457650001701479650002401496650001401520650001801534650001401552650002101566700001401587700001901601700001601620700001301636700001701649773012401666856007401790852000901864655001201873IND60640933620221120113543.0190505e20160718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064093362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13070d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Weijun10aPreparation of amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles for enhancement of bacterial capture efficiency  ap. 67875-67882.  aPathogenic bacteria can lead to food poisoning and serious infectious diseases, and place a large burden on human health. A method for rapid capture and removal of the harmful bacteria from the contaminated source is essential and important. In this study, two types of amine group functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were successfully fabricated for effective capture of bacterial pathogens. These magnetic nanoparticles with a positive-charge surface strongly interacted with the negative-charge bacterial cell wall via electrostatic attractions to exhibit efficient adsorptive ability of a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. Owing to more cationic amine groups, the bacterial capture capacity of Fe₃O₄@sSiO₂-PEI nanoparticles (PEI-MNPs) for E. coli BL21 was three times that of Fe₃O₄@sSiO₂-NH₂ nanoparticles (NH-MNPs), making them promising for practical applications. More importantly, the PEI-MNPs also showed excellent bacterial capture efficiency at a low concentration due to the multivalency effect that appeared in our system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acell walls 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afoodborne illness 3ahuman health 3ainfectious diseases 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3avirulent strains1 aHan, Chen1 aZhang, Huabing1 aWei, Wenmei1 aLiu, Rui1 aShen, Yuxian0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 18, v. 6, no. 72 p.67875-67882dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra13070d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245013000212300001600342506007600358520111200434592002801546506003701574650002001611650002201631650002001653650001301673650001201686650000901698650001601707650002301723650002001746650001001766650001901776651001101795700002601806700002901832700002701861773010501888856008101993852000902074655001202083IND60523787420221207090147.0160625e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052378742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-016-0582-82doi7 aPMC49207622pmcid7 a274073032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña-Yam, Laura P.10aIsolation of Mexican Bacillus Species and Their Effects in Promoting Growth of Chili Pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv Jalapeño)  ap. 375-378.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this work was to isolate and identify native bacteria from plants collected in the State of Yucatán, México with the ability to promote growth of chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv Jalapeño). We identified nine bacterial isolates that belong to five species of Bacillus (i.e. Bacillus subtilis, B. flexus, B. cereus, B. megaterium and B. endophyticus) that produced indoleacetic acid (4.0–24.3 µg/mL) with solubilization index of 1.3–1.6. All the bacterial isolates were evaluated based on their ability to promote growth of chili pepper. Plants inoculated with B. subtilis ITC-N67 showed an increase in stem diameter and root volume, whereas inoculation with B. cereus ITC-BL18 increased the number of flower buds, fresh biomass of roots and total fresh biomass. Conversely, B. flexus ITC-P4 and B. flexus ITC-P22 showed deleterious effect on root volume and total biomass.

However, kinetic and amplitude information regarding their ground-state conformational fluctuations has remained elusive. We demonstrate using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based relaxation dispersion that the D2 domain of p27ᴷⁱᵖ¹, a prototypical IDP, samples multiple discrete, rapidly exchanging conformational states. By combining NMR with mutagenesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that these states involve aromatic residue clustering through long-range hydrophobic interactions. Theoretical studies have proposed that small molecules bind promiscuously to IDPs, causing expansion of their conformational landscapes. However, on the basis of previous NMR-based screening results, we show here that compound binding only shifts the populations of states that existed within the ground state of apo p27-D2 without changing the barriers between states. Our results provide atomic resolution insight into how a small molecule binds an IDP and emphasize the need to examine motions on the low microsecond time scale when probing these types of interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahuman diseases 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amutagenesis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3ascreening 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aIconaru, Luigi I.1 aRamanathan, Arvind1 aZuo, Jian1 aKriwacki, Richard W.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 04, v. 139, no. 39 p.13692-13700dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b013803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002400138245012800162300001600290500001500306520164300321592002801964650001801992650001802010650001102028650001702039650001402056650003002070650001502100650002002115650002602135650001302161650001002174650004502184650001402229650002202243653002902265700002302294700002102317700002302338700002302361700002102384773010702405856007402512852000902586655001202595IND4473344220221120025855.0160903e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447334422DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027726762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIskandar, Hayati M.10aComparison of reference genes for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene expression in sugarcane  ap. 325-337.  a2019-12-06  aA protocol for reverse transcription followed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of tissue-specific and genotype-variable gene expression in sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) was developed. A key requirement for this analysis was the identification of a housekeeping gene with transcript levels that were relatively stable across tissues and genotypes, suitable for use as a reference. Primers for β-actin, β-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes and 25S ribosomal RNA were designed and tested by RT-qPCR, and formation of product in the reactions was measured with the SYBR green I dye system. Ribosomal RNA was the most sensitive and consistent as a reference gene. Determination of the expression levels of β-actin, β-tubulin, and GAPDH transcripts relative to that of 25S rRNA showed that GAPDH had the most consistent mRNA expression of protein-coding genes across different tissues. GAPDH also showed low variation in expression in maturing stem internodes when compared across 2 cultivars and 3 otherSaccharum species. GAPDH therefore appears to be a suitable “housekeeping gene” in addition to 25S rRNA as a reference for measuring the relative expression of other genes in sugarcane. With use of GAPDH as a reference, the relative expression of the sugarcane sugar transporter genePst2a was assessed in a range of tissues. The result obtained was similar to our previously published Northern blot analysis. The protocol described here, using GAPDH as a reference gene, is recommended for studying the expression of other genes of interest in diverse tissues and genotypes of sugarcane.  aPublisher supplied data 3amessenger RNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asugars 3atransporters 3aSaccharum 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainternodes 3agene expression 3areverse transcription 3agenotype 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3asugarcane 3aNorthern blotting 0atranscription (genetics)1 aSimpson, Robert S.1 aCasu, Rosanne E.1 aBonnett, Graham D.1 aMaclean, Donald J.1 aManners, John M.0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2004 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.325-337dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027726763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245005500160300002000215520201300235592002802248650001802276650002102294650002402315650002302339650001302362650003602375650001502411650001202426650001302438650001202451650001302463650001302476650002302489650001802512650002202530650001102552650001202563650001902575650002202594650001902616700002102635700001602656700001702672700001802689700001802707700001802725700002002743700001202763700002402775700002302799773013402822856007802956852000903034655001203043IND60580865520221120222728.0171004e20171004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058086552DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b014452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shuang10aChiral Ceramic Nanoparticles and Peptide Catalysis  ap. 13701-13712.  aThe chirality of nanoparticles (NPs) and their assemblies has been investigated predominantly for noble metals and II–VI semiconductors. However, ceramic NPs represent the majority of nanoscale materials in nature. The robustness and other innate properties of ceramics offer technological opportunities in catalysis, biomedical sciences, and optics. Here we report the preparation of chiral ceramic NPs, as represented by tungsten oxide hydrate, WO₃–ₓ·H₂O, dispersed in ethanol. The chirality of the metal oxide core, with an average size of ca. 1.6 nm, is imparted by proline (Pro) and aspartic acid (Asp) ligands via bio-to-nano chirality transfer. The amino acids are attached to the NP surface through C–O–W linkages formed from dissociated carboxyl groups and through amino groups weakly coordinated to the NP surface. Surprisingly, the dominant circular dichroism bands for NPs coated by Pro and Asp are different despite the similarity in the geometry of the NPs; they are positioned at 400–700 nm and 500–1100 nm for Pro- and Asp-modified NPs, respectively. The differences in the spectral positions of the main chiroptical band for the two types of NPs are associated with the molecular binding of the two amino acids to the NP surface; Asp has one additional C–O–W linkage compared to Pro, resulting in stronger distortion of the inorganic crystal lattice and greater intensity of CD bands associated with the chirality of the inorganic core. The chirality of WO₃–ₓ·H₂O atomic structure is confirmed by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The proximity of the amino acids to the mineral surface is associated with the catalytic abilities of WO₃–ₓ·H₂O NPs. We found that NPs facilitate formation of peptide bonds, leading to Asp-Asp and Asp-Pro dipeptides. The chiroptical activity, chemical reactivity, and biocompatibility of tungsten oxide create a unique combination of properties relevant to chiral optics, chemical technologies, and biomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3abiocompatibility 3abiomedical research 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adipeptides 3aethanol 3ageometry 3aligands 3amedicine 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3aoptical isomerism 3aoptics 3aproline 3asemiconductors 3asimulation models 3atungsten oxide1 aChekini, Mahshid1 aQu, Zhi-Bei1 aWang, Yichun1 aYeltik, Aydan1 aLiu, Yuangang1 aKotlyar, Alex1 aZhang, Tianyong1 aLi, Bin1 aDemir, Hilmi Volkan1 aKotov, Nicholas A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 04, v. 139, no. 39 p.13701-13712dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b014453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245007600175500002000251500000900271520125800280592002801538650000801566650001901574650001801593650001501611773021401626856008001840961001301920852000901933655001201942IND60663018020221118020842.0220826s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066301802DNAL7 a10.2134/ael2019.06.00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Leon Hartwell, Jr.10aSimplifying Crop Growth Response to Rising CO2 and Elevated Temperature  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Most modeling studies of crop growth are complex and difficult to understand. Crop growth responses to CO₂ concentration follow an asymptotic exponential function. Crop growth responses follow a function of 3 cardinal temperatures: Tₘₐₓ, Tₒₚₜ, Tₘᵢₙ. Merged growth responses to CO₂ and temperature produce a visual 3D response surface. Graphics convey information easily understood by the general public. Crop growth responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations and potential rising air temperatures can be a challenge for the scientist to convey in a form that the public can understand. Outputs of most modeling studies and meta‐analyses of crop responses to these two important variables can be complicated and difficult to comprehend. This paper merges two mathematical formulations, clearly illustrated in two‐dimensional graphics, to create a direct representation of crop growth responses to a range of both CO₂ concentrations and air temperatures. The output is a direct graphical view of crop growth responses to both CO₂ and temperature in three dimensions. The three‐dimensional graphic can be rotated to illustrate representative growth responses from various perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3ameta-analysis 3ascientists0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2019, v. 4, no. 1 p.e190021-dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/ael2019.06.00213Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245024500170520141400415592002801829650002501857650002101882650001701903650002001920650001701940650001101957650001501968650002601983650001402009650001502023650002602038650001502064650002702079650001302106650002902119653004402148653003802192653002202230700002302252700001602275700003202291700003102323773011402354856008502468852000902553655001202562IND60755186420221119174344.0211129e20211206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075518642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4626492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalari, Kalpana10aQuantitative determination of targeted and untargeted pesticide residues in coconut milk by liquid chromatography – Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization – high energy collisional dissociation tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry  aQuantitative determination of targeted and untargeted pesticide residues from food products is very important for the assessment of safety of the food products. In the present work, a simple, selective and sensitive method based on liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization high energy collisional dissociation high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-HCD-HRMS/MS) for quantification of 19 priority organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides and 10 untargeted pesticides from coconut milk samples was developed and validated. The pesticide residues were extracted by solvent partition followed by dispersive solid-phase extraction clean-up and quantified by LC-APCI-HRMS/MS technique. The method showed the linearity for targeted pesticides in the range of 0.5–1000 ng/g with a limit of detection of ranging 0.5–5 ng/g and limit of quantification of ranging 1–10 ng/g measured at 3:1 and 10:1 signal to noise ratios, respectively. The untargeted pesticide residues were quantified by the response factor method. The method was validated for intraday and interday precision, which was less than 15%. The recovery of the analytes varied between 82 and 117%, and the developed method was applied for the analysis of the coconut milk samples. The analyzed samples showed the presence of quinalphos, malathion, and methiocarb at concentrations of 4.55, 5.54, and 206.99 ng/g.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3achemical species 3acoconut milk 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amalathion 3amethiocarb 3aquantitative analysis 3aquinalphos 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aDispersive solid phase extraction 0aPesticide residue1 aGanji, Sai Krishna1 aKommu, Mani1 aTiruveedula, Raja Rajeswari1 aUpadhyayula, Vijayasarathi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 1659 p.462649-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4626493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04065naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245014300205300001600348500002000364500001500384520242700399592002802826596001502854596004002869596004702909650001402956650002302970650001102993650002003004650002103024650001203045650001503057650001103072650000903083650001403092650001003106650001303116650002403129650002403153653001203177700001903189700006003208700006603268700001903334773011803353856007903471852000903550655001203559IND60630230620221118175246.0190206e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063023062DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.132462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaber, Ariela I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5097-180712aA key floral scent component (β‐trans‐bergamotene) drives pollinator preferences independently of pollen rewards in seep monkeyflower  ap. 218-228.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aFloral odours play an important role in attracting insect pollinators.

Pollen is the only floral reward in M. guttatus, and pollen viability (a reliable indicator of protein content) is reduced in inbred plants. Yet, differences in pollen viability did not explain the observed preferences. In this study, we examined the floral volatile profiles of inbred and outbred M. guttatus to identify inbreeding effects and associations between volatile compounds and the number of viable pollen grains per flower, designated “PRQ” (pollen reward quality). We also conducted pairwise choice tests with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the ability of bees to discriminate between odours of rewarding and non‐rewarding flowers and to determine whether bumblebee preferences are explained by differences in the floral odours of inbred and outbred plants. Inbred plants exhibited reduced emission of β‐trans‐bergamotene, the second‐most abundant compound in the volatile blend of outbred plants. Furthermore, pollen and fertile anthers emitted nonadecane. Six other compounds in the floral blend were positively correlated with PRQ. There was no overlap between compounds affected by inbreeding and compounds associated with PRQ. Even when given prior experience foraging on M. guttatus, bumblebees did not distinguish between the floral odours of rewarding and non‐rewarding outbred plants. However, they preferred floral odours from non‐rewarding outbred plants over rewarding inbred plants. Bumblebees without prior experience of flowers preferred volatile blends with higher versus lower amounts of β‐trans‐bergamotene. Taken together, these results suggest that the volatile emissions of M. guttatus provide reliable indicators of pollen rewards (potential honest signals), but that the preference of bumblebees for outbred plants is not driven by these cues but rather by a sensory bias for β‐trans‐bergamotene. This may represent a subtle form of deceit‐pollination that allows plants to attract pollinators while minimizing investment in costly rewards.

A 2016 LGU faculty survey revealed strong support for open source/open access science. Most based research choices around scientific curiosity than commercialization potential. Plant scientists had the highest reliance on licensing revenues but still only 3% of total lab revenues. It may be time to reassess the research model of public universities. Based on a nationally representative survey done in 2016, this article examines the attitudes and activities of agricultural and life science faculty at US land grant universities with respect to open access/open source versus commercialization of research. The findings reveal pervasive faculty support for open scientific inquiry and sharing of knowledge and relatively low levels of participation in and laboratory market funding associated with commercialization activities. These results point toward the potential timeliness of a reassessment of public universities policies and public relations with respect to open science and commercialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLand Grant universities 3acommercialization 3amarkets 3asurveys1 aGoldman, Irwin1 avan Rijn, Jordan1 aFoltz, Jeremy1 aAgnes, Maria Isabella0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2017, v. 2, no. 1 p.e170008-dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/ael2017.03.00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245020500175520186300380592002802243650001102271650001402282650002002296650001602316650001602332650001602348650002102364650001902385650001902404650001502423650001502438650003102453650001502484650000902499650001102508650001102519650001802530650001502548650002102563650002002584650001502604651001002619653002302629653003702652653001602689653001802705653002502723700001602748700002602764700001602790700002602806773012002832856008802952852000903040655001203049IND60737683620221119163514.0210926e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073768362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1478222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlamas-Dios, M.I.10aAssessment of a wide array of contaminants of emerging concern in a Mediterranean water basin (Guadalhorce river, Spain): Motivations for an improvement of water management and pollutants surveillance  aThis study investigates the occurrence and distribution of 185 organic contaminants (regulated pollutants and contaminants of emerging concern; CECs) in surface and groundwater of the Guadalhorce River basin (southern Spain) providing the most detailed dataset regarding organic pollution presented so far in this area. Up to 63 contaminants were detected in a monitoring campaign conducted in March 2016. Most contaminants were detected more frequently in surface water where they generally present higher concentrations suggesting the prevalence of wastewater discharges into streams as the main pollutant sources. In general, hydrophobic CECs presented the highest frequencies of detection and concentrations, which can be a consequence of several factors: (1) hydrophobic compounds show a higher retardation factor, which result, along with a continuous contaminant input, in a widespread and homogeneous distribution. In contrast, hydrophilic contaminants are more easily transported by water flows towards the lower basin and potentially accumulate as driven by groundwater flow and because of low renewal rates in the detrital aquifers caused by re-pumping and irrigation return flows in agricultural lands; (2) hydrophobic CECs studied in this research are mainly personal care products and organophosphate esters flame retardants and plasticizers, which are present in many different products and are used in large amounts; Also, (3) use of biosolids (reclaimed sewer sludge) as fertilizer for crops is potentially an additional diffuse source of organic pollutants in the study area contributing to a widespread distribution, especially for hydrophobic compounds. Obtained results highlight the need to better define the potential risk of non-regulated contaminants in water resources as well as the great impact of untreated wastewater discharges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiosolids 3adata collection 3aenvironment 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airrigation 3amonitoring 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apollutants 3arisk 3arivers 3asludge 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awater management 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0aOrganic pollutants 0aContaminants of emerging concern 0aGroundwater 0aSurface water 0aSpatial distribution1 aVadillo, I.1 aJiménez-Gavilán, P.1 aCandela, L.1 aCorada-Fernández, C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 788 p.147822-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1478223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011000206300001600316520243100332592002802763650005302791650001402844650001802858650002102876650001602897650001702913650001702930650001402947650002402961650001902985650001103004651002103015653002003036653002603056653002903082653002003111653001703131700002003148700001903168700001603187700002103203773017903224856008303403852000903486655001203495IND60748336120221119060546.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074833612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2021.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Jee-Seon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8671-315310aAssociation between Ultra-processed Food Consumption and Dietary Intake and Diet Quality in Korean Adults  ap. 583-594.  aFood environments have changed rapidly, and the global interest in ultra-processed foods has increased. Ultra-processed foods are typically energy dense, high in sugars and fat, and low in fiber, protein, minerals, and vitamins. This study aimed to estimate the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods in the diet of Korean adults and to examine the association between ultra-processed food consumption and dietary intake and diet quality. This study is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016–2018). A total of 16,657 adults aged ≥19 years who completed a 1-day 24-hour recall. Absolute and relative intake of energy and nutrients were measured and dietary quality was assessed using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI). Multiple regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables were used to examine the association between quintiles of ultra-processed foods dietary energy contribution and dietary intake and quality. Mean reported daily energy intake was 2,031 kcal, with 25.1% of calories coming from ultra-processed foods. Mean energy contribution from ultra-processed foods ranged from 3.6% kcal (Q1) to 52.4% kcal (Q5). Energy contribution of ultra-processed foods was positively associated with reported intake of daily energy, total sugars, and total and saturated fat and inversely associated with reported intake of carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Both sodium and potassium were negatively associated with percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods. However, the sodium-to-potassium ratio was high regardless of quintile of energy contribution from ultra-processed foods, and the ratio was positively associated with percentage of total energy from ultra-processed foods. Although the KHEI score was inversely associated with percentage of daily energy from ultra-processed foods, all levels of ultra-processed food consumption were associated with poor diet quality. The ultra-processed foods consumption of Korean adults accounted for one fourth of daily energy intake, and a higher dietary energy contribution from ultra-processed foods was associated with poorer dietary intakes and a lower dietary quality. Further studies are needed to understand factors influencing selection and consumption of ultra-processed foods and to identify effective strategies to promote healthy food choices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3adietetics 3aenergy intake 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3afood quality 3ahealthy diet 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3asaturated fats 3asodium 3aKorean Peninsula 0aFood processing 0aUltra-processed foods 0aNOVA food classification 0aNutrient intake 0aDiet quality1 aShim, Sun Young1 aCha, Hee-Jeung1 aKim, Jinhee1 aKim, Hyeon Chang0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2022 Mar., v. 122, no. 3 p.583-594dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2021.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04676naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245016800215520295800383592002803341650001503369650002303384650002003407650002003427650001003447650001503457650002103472650001903493650001703512650001703529650002203546650001703568651001203585653002603597653002203623653002503645653002503670653002803695653003303723700006003756700002203816700002003838700005903858700006003917773011003977856008604087852000904173655001204182IND60740404520221118102830.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074040452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1083192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutengs, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0155-436910aVNIR and MIR spectroscopy of PLFA-derived soil microbial properties and associated soil physicochemical characteristics in an experimental plant diversity gradient  aImproving our understanding of the functions and processes of soil microbial communities and their interactions with the physicochemical soil environment requires large amounts of timely and cost-efficient soil data, which is difficult to obtain with routine laboratory-analytical methods. Soil spectroscopy with portable visible-to-near infrared (VNIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) instruments can fill this gap by facilitating the rapid acquisition of biotic and abiotic soil information.In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of VNIR and MIR spectroscopy to analyze soil physicochemical and microbial properties in a long-term grassland biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment. Soil samples were collected at the Jena Experiment (Jena, Germany) and measured with portable VNIR and MIR spectrometers in field-moist condition to determine their potential for on-site data collection and analysis. Reference data to calibrate spectroscopic models were acquired with routine analytical methods, including PLFA extractions of microbial biomarkers. We further collected reference VNIR and MIR data on pre-treated soils (dried and finely ground) to assess the anticipated impact of field measurements on spectroscopic calibrations.MIR spectra allowed more accurate estimates of soil physicochemical and microbial properties than VNIR data on pre-treated samples. For soils in field condition, MIR calibrations were more accurate for physicochemical properties, but VNIR data gave significantly better estimates of microbial properties. Combined VNIR/MIR estimates achieved the most accurate estimation results for all soil properties in each case.Soil physicochemical properties could be estimated from VNIR/MIR data with high accuracy (R² = 0.72–0.99) on pre-treated soil samples, whereas the results for soil microbial properties were more moderate (R² = 0.66–0.72). On field-moist soils, estimation accuracies decreased notably for organic and inorganic carbon (ΔRMSE = 52–72%), improved slightly for soil texture (ΔRMSE = 4–7%) and decreased slightly for microbial properties (ΔRMSE = 4–9%). The VNIR/MIR estimates derived from soils in field condition were sufficiently accurate to detect experimental plant treatment effects on organic carbon, as well as bacterial and fungal biomass. We further found that spectroscopic estimates of soil microbial properties were primarily enabled through indirect correlations with spectrally active soil constituents, i.e., associations between soil microbial properties and the physicochemical soil environment.Our findings highlight the capacity of VNIR and MIR spectroscopy to analyze the physicochemical soil environment, including potential on-site data collection and analysis on soils in field condition, and indicate that VNIR/MIR data can estimate soil microbial properties when soil physicochemical properties shape the distribution of soil microbial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aedaphic factors 3afungi 3agrasslands 3ainorganic carbon 3aorganic carbon 3asoil biology 3asoil texture 3aspecies diversity 3aspectroscopy 3aGermany 0aProximal soil sensing 0aSoil spectroscopy 0aPortable instruments 0aMicrobial biomarkers 0aPlant-soil interactions 0aBacterial and fungal biomass1 aEisenhauer, Nico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0371-67201 aSchädler, Martin1 aLochner, Alfred1 aSeidel, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1086-34511 aVohland, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6048-11630 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.108319-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1083193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245006600203300001800269520070000287592002800987650001701015650001501032650001401047650001701061650001901078650004401097650007401141650006501215650003701280650003601317650002701353650002801380700003001408700002301438700001801461700002101479700002301500773011001523856008101633990002301714852000901737655001201746IND60090649320221121065959.0141102e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009064932DNAL7 a218075232pmid7 aPMC31598292pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Youcai10aChromomycin SA analogs from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp.  ap. 5183-5189.  aTwo chromomycin SA analogs, chromomycin SA₃ and chromomycin SA₂, along with deacetylchromomycin A₃ and five previously reported chromomycin analogs were isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces sp.

An experiment was set up in Jaú, SP, Brazil, in which the second and third ratoon crop cycles (2008/2009 and 2009/2010) were evaluated. The experiment included an unfertilized N control in both years (T1), and the following three nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates (in kg ha⁻¹) applied in 2008 and 2009, respectively: 70 and 50 (T2), 140 and 100 (T3), and 210 and 150 (T4). Fertilization with N caused a marked gain in stalk yields by 98 Mg ha⁻¹ in 2 years. The N export with harvest was higher than N application in the control treatment T1 and at the lower rate (T2); this, in addition to the observed linear response to N, indicate the need to increase N fertilization in irrigated sugarcane. The values of Δ¹³C decreased with the increase of N supply showing a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) with stalk as well as whole plant aboveground dry matter yields. The values of Δ¹³C in top leaves may be used as a tool to characterize the N status of sugarcane plants and its relation to aboveground dry matter and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrop yield 3adry matter accumulation 3afertigation 3afertilizer rates 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aratooning 3asugarcane 3aBrazil1 ade Castro Gava, Glauber José1 aCantarella, Heitor1 aFranco, Henrique Coutinho Junqueira1 aUribe, Raul Andres Martinez1 ada Rocha Pannuti, Luiz Eduardo1 aTrivelin, Paulo Cesar Ocheuze0 tSugar tech.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.391-400dSpringer Indiax0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-015-0384-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166520166400299592002801963650002001991650002002011650001402031650001502045650001802060650001402078650001702092650001602109650001802125650001702143650001902160650002402179650001902203650001702222650001602239650001502255653001402270653001402284653001302298653001002311700001702321700001602338700001502354700001902369773009502388856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60748336320221119060555.0220423e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074833632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tianqi10aDifferent n-6/n-3 PUFA diets with fish oil attenuated osteoarthritis in ovariectomized mice via targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome  aOsteoporosis(OP) and osteoarthritis(OA) co-exist with increased inflammatory cytokines as a common feature. Modern diet containing high n-6/n-3 PUFA was suggested contributing to these chronic inflammatory diseases. Although fish oil (FO) rich in n-3 PUFAs has been confirmed beneficial for OA and bone loss in previous studies, whether small amounts of FO could alleviate osteoporotic OA under a high n-6/n-3 PUFA condition has not been reported. In this study, the osteoporotic OA mice were fed with 20:1 or 6:1 n-6/n-3 PUFA diets with or without FO for 12 weeks. The results showed that 20:1 diet with FO ameliorated systemic inflammation and cartilage degradation in model mice, compared to the non-FO 20:1 diet. Specifically, diets with FO altered the fatty acids composition with elevating n-3/n-6 PUFA in articular cartilage, thus restoring the cartilage homeostasis by inhibiting the catabolic process. Mechanistically, 20:1 non-FO diet promoted the expression of NLRP3 via PGE2/EP4/NFκB. However, 20:1 FO-H diet significantly inhibited the expression of NLRP3 and further exhibited a greater affinity for GPR120 than 20:1 non-FO diet to inactivate caspase-1-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome. As a consequence, 20:1 FO-H diet inhibited chondrocyte pyroptosis and followed by the reduction of the two catabolic cytokines: IL-1β and IL-18. Notably, the 20:1 FO-H diet performed as well as the 6:1 non-FO diet, and 6:1 diet with FO could further improve osteoporotic OA in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that FO could attenuate the adverse effect of 20:1 n-6/n-3 PUFA diet on osteoporotic OA, providing skeletal evidence for healthy diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abone resorption 3acartilage 3acatabolism 3adose response 3afish oils 3ahealthy diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aosteoarthritis 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3apyroptosis 0an-3 PUFAs 0an-6 PUFAs 0aFish oil 0aNLRP31 aBai, Xiaolin1 aDai, Yufeng1 aDong, Ping1 aWang, Jingfeng0 tFood bioscience.g2022 Feb., v. 45 p.101220-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245007900164300001800243520113800261592002801399650002101427650001501448650001501463650001101478650001901489650001001508650001301518650001201531650001301543650001901556700002901575700002601604700002201630700002701652773012501679856007501804852000901879655001201888IND60534888520170606000000.0160803e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053488852DNAL7 a10.1021/es501274a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrera-Codony, Alba10aBiogas Upgrading: Optimal Activated Carbon Properties for Siloxane Removal  ap. 7187-7195.  aA total of 12 commercial activated carbons (ACs) have been tested for the removal of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) in dynamic adsorption experiments using different carrier gases and D4 concentrations. Characterization of the ACs included several physical and chemical techniques. The D4 adsorption capacities were strongly related with the textural development of the ACs. Results showed that the optimum adsorbent for D4 is a wood-based chemically activated carbon, which rendered an adsorption capacity of 1732 ± 93 mg g–¹ using 1000 ppm (v/v) of D4 with dry N₂ as the carrier gas. When the concentration of D4 was lowered to typical values found in biogas, the adsorption capacity was halved. The presence of major biogas compounds (i.e., CH₄ and CO₂) and humidity further reduced the D4 adsorption capacity. The polymerization of D4 over the surface of all ACs was found to be relevant after prolonged contact times. The extent of this phenomenon, which may negatively affect the thermal regeneration of the AC, correlated reasonably well with the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups on the carbon surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3ahumidity 3amethane 3anitrogen 3apolymerization1 aMontes-Morán, Miguel A.1 aSánchez-Polo, Manuel1 aMartín, Maria J.1 aGonzalez-Olmos, Rafael0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 June 17, v. 48, no. 12 p.7187-7195dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes501274a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011900128300001800247500001400265520147000279592002801749650002101777650002601798650002101824650002601845650001001871650002601881650001601907650001501923650001201938650001801950650003001968650002901998650001502027650001002042650001102052650001002063653001402073653001502087653001402102700002402116700002302140700002202163773014302185852000902328655001202337IND60706445620221119002233.0200807e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070644562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNataraja, M10aEconomics of Different Herbicides for Weed Control in Rabi/Summer Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)

Partial capping of the surface silanols in the presence of the masking pattern of self-repelling tetramethylammonium ions allows us to isolate surface silanol islets, on which isolated titanium ions and dimeric oxo titanium species can be generated up to 2 Ti/Si mol %. Above this loading, and up to ∼8 Ti/Si mol %, higher oligomers (trimers, hexamers, octamers, and so on) are formed, reaching the size obtained at much lower loadings (<1 Ti/Si mol %) on a nonmodified silica surface. The downsizing effect produced on our organically modified surface is monitored from the blue-shift of the charge-transfer band of the Ti(IV) ions, measured by reflectance UV–visible spectroscopy. It is also mirrored by a higher catalytic activity in cyclohexene epoxidation, revealing that it is not only the isolated Ti species that are active but also the oligomers. Regarding the latter, the smaller they are, the more active they are.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acyclohexenes 3aepoxidation reactions 3aions 3aporous media 3areflectance 3asilica 3asilicon 3atetramethylammonium compounds 3atitanium 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aAlbela, Belén1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2182-23751 aYang, Boting1 aZheng, Yuting1 aWu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2193-73561 aHe, Mingyuan1 aBonneviot, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9092-89660 tLangmuir.g2018 Oct. 03, v. 34, no. 43 p.12713-12722dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b019323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245007200162300002000234520062300254592002800877650001900905650001900924700001700943700001700960700002300977700001801000700001701018700001901035700001801054700002401072700002101096773013401117856007801251852000901329655001201338IND60580865920221120222653.0171004e20171004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058086592DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b052992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrence, Jimmy12aA Versatile and Efficient Strategy to Discrete Conjugated Oligomers  ap. 13735-13739.  aAn efficient and scalable strategy to prepare libraries of discrete conjugated oligomers (Đ = 1.0) using the combination of controlled polymerization and automated flash chromatography is reported.

However, increasing evidence indicates that plant invasions do occur in these environments, which often have high conservation value and provide important ecosystem services. Over a thousand non‐native species have become established in natural areas at high elevations worldwide, and although many of these are not invasive, some may pose a considerable threat to native mountain ecosystems. Here, we discuss four main drivers that shape plant invasions into high‐elevation habitats: (1) the (pre‐)adaptation of non‐native species to abiotic conditions, (2) natural and anthropogenic disturbances, (3) biotic resistance of the established communities, and (4) propagule pressure. We propose a comprehensive research agenda for tackling the problem of plant invasions into mountain ecosystems, including documentation of mountain invasion patterns at multiple scales, experimental studies, and an assessment of the impacts of non‐native species in these systems. The threat posed to high‐elevation biodiversity by invasive plant species is likely to increase because of globalization and climate change. However, the higher mountains harbor ecosystems where invasion by non‐native species has scarcely begun, and where science and management have the opportunity to respond in time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aglobalization 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amountains1 aKueffer, Christoph1 aDietz, Hansjörg1 aDaehler, Curtis C.,1 aAlexander, John Gilbert,1 aEdwards, Peter J.,1 aArévalo, José Ramón,1 aCavieres, Lohengrin A1 aGuisan, A.q(Antoine),1 aHaider, Sylvia1 aJakobs, Gabi1 aMcDougall, Keith1 aMillar, Constance I.,1 aNaylor, Bridgett J1 aParks, Catherine G.,1 aRew, Lisa J1 aSeipel, Tim0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2009 Nov., v. 7, no. 9 p.479-486dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0800723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009400166520196800260592002802228650001502256650001602271650001102287650001502298650001302313650000902326650001602335650001402351650001702365650002102382650001402403650001302417650000702430650001802437650001502455650001402470650001602484653001602500653001702516653001102533653002102544653001602565700001702581700001402598700001902612700001502631700001702646700001502663773012002678856008802798852000902886655001202895IND60737684120221119163634.0210926e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073768412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1478302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hui10aSimultaneous reductions in antibiotics and heavy metal pollution during manure composting  aThe co-existence of antibiotics and heavy metal (HM) is common in manure. However, existing strategies for improving antibiotic dissipation or HM immobilization during composting rarely consider their combined pollution. In this study, we used agricultural lime and a newly designed attapulgite-activated carbon composite (AACC) to enhance the stabilization of HMs in a pilot-scale swine manure composting system and assessed the effectiveness of these materials for removing antibiotic residues. Results indicated that the application of either lime or AACC simultaneously enhanced HM immobilization and antibiotic degradation. In particular, the addition of AACC reduced the enrichment of Cr, Cd, Pb, and As during composting and decreased the half-lives of the antibiotics from 10.7 days to 6.3 days, which were more effectively than lime. The physicochemical and microbiological responses to different additives were subsequently studied to understand the mechanisms underlying the fates of HMs and antibiotics. High HM stress in manure inhibited antibiotic dissipation, but metal immobilization alleviated this effect. The AACC accelerated HM immobilization by surface adsorption and metal precipitation, and this enhancement strengthened during the late composting stage due to an increase in pH, whereas lime exhibited a short-term effect. Moreover, the AACC addition enhanced the contribution of bacteria to changes in antibiotic concentrations, while the increase in pile temperature could be a major factor that contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic degradation after the addition of lime. Characterization of the final compost further showed that AACC-treated compost had the lowest residual concentrations of HMs and antibiotics, higher mortality of ascarid egg, improved nitrogen conversation, and reduced phytotoxicity. Thus, co-composting of swine manure with AACC is a promising approach for producing safer compost for use in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3acarbon 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aeggs 3aenvironment 3ahalf life 3aheavy metals 3aliming materials 3amortality 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3apig manure 3apollution 3atemperature 0aAntibiotics 0aHeavy metals 0aManure 0aActivated carbon 0aAttapulgite1 aSun, Wanchun1 aYu, Yijun1 aDing, Yongzhen1 aYang, Yuyi1 aZhang, Zulin1 aMa, Junwei0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 788 p.147830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1478303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003600112245012600148300001800274500001400292520125500306592002801561650002001589650001301609650002101622650001501643650001901658650000901677650002301686650001301709650001001722651001101732651000901743653001301752653003201765700001801797773014301815852000901958655001201967IND60706445920221119002429.0200807e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070644592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdalla, Louai Abdalla Mohammed10aStudies on Antibioses Mechanism of Resistance to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in Maize, Zea mays L.  ap. 2217-2220.  aNAL-light  aThe stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is an important pest of maize in Asia and Africa. Study of the mechanisms of resistance in maize genotypes to C. partellus is useful for breeding resistant varieties. The following six maize genotypes were used: VIM 308, VIM 313, VIM 319 and VIM 322 (Highly resistant) and VIM 325 and VIM 329 (Resistant) along with susceptible (Basilocal) and resistant check (CM500). Growth and development of spotted stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) was studied under screen house conditions by releasing neonate larvae of C. partellus on 20-dayold seedlings of maize genotypes. Antibiosis was observed in terms of low larval survival, long larval and pupal periods, reduced pupal mass and low growth index in three Maize genotypes i.e., VIM 325, VIM 308 and VIM 322. The moths emerging from these genotypes were deformed, less active and did not attain the normal size. Antibiosis is an important mechanism of resistance in these genotypes against C. Partellus and can be useful in a program of breeding maize for resistance to C. partellus. Slower larval development on the resistant plants would prolong the exposure to predators and parasites which might reduce populations of this insect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilo partellus 3aZea mays 3aanimal nutrition 3aantibiosis 3aboring insects 3acorn 3alarval development 3aneonates 3apupae 3aAfrica 3aAsia 0asurvival 0aantibioses plant resistance1 aRaguraman, S.0 tIndian journal of animal nutrition.g2014 Aug., v. 7, no. 16 p.2217-2220dAnimal Nutrition Society of IndiawJournal:2071x2231-67447nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015100160300002000311520046000331592002800791650004400819650001600863650003400879650001300913650001400926650002400940650001400964700001700978700001700995700001901012700002201031700002101053700001901074773012501093856007501218852000901293655001201302IND60779642620221120211556.0220613e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077964262DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02381d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagata, Tatsuki10aN,N-Dimethylformamide-stabilized ruthenium nanoparticle catalyst for β-alkylated dimer alcohol formation via Guerbet reaction of primary alcohols  ap. 16599-16603.  aN,N-Dimethylformamide-stabilized Ru nanoparticles (NPs) provide a highly efficient catalyst for the Guerbet reaction of primary alcohols.

Herein, a nitrogen doped graphitic carbon networks (NG-CNTW) coated fiber was fabricated by direct carbonization of nanosized ZIF-67 crystals (nano-ZIF-67) that grown on stainless steel wire. The NG-CNTW coated fiber coupled with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was applied for enrichment and determination of pyrethroids. The NG-CNTW coating exhibited high surface area and hierarchical porous structures that facilitate diffusion and accessibility of target molecules. Simultaneously, the nitrogen doped and highly graphitic structures endow the coating with high adsorption affinity for aromatic compounds. Under optimum conditions, the SPME-GC-MS/MS method presented wide range of linearity performance (0.08–200.0 ng g⁻¹), low limits of detection (0.02–0.5 ng g⁻¹) and good repeatability (RSD < 9.6%) for 8 kinds of pyrethroids. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied in the determination of pyrethroids in grape and cauliflower samples, as the results were in the range of 3.16–15.06 ng g⁻¹and 2.08–9.29 ng g⁻¹, respectively. This work not only provides a new method by fabricating carbon nanomaterial coatings in situ derived from MOFs, but also shows great potential of MOFs derivative materials in environmental analysis field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbonization 3acauliflower 3achemical species 3aenvironmental assessment 3agrapes 3agraphene 3anitrogen 3apyrethrins 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3asurface area 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aNitrogen doped graphitic carbon networks 0aSolid-phase microextraction 0aGas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 0aPyrethroids1 aZhang, Wenmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7317-58541 aChen, Hui1 aDing, Qingqing1 aLi, Qingqing1 aZhang, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6905-21890 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122542-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008100177300001400258520170700272592002801979650002302007650002302030650001802053650001502071650001902086650001402105650001202119650002602131650001502157650003002172650001902202650003202221650002102253650002202274650001102296650001102307650000702318650001402325650000902339650001302348650001302361650002002374650002502394650002202419651001102441653001302452653001502465653001902480653002702499653002402526653002202550653002202572700002702594700006202621700005702683773012102740856008802861852000902949655001202958IND60597976320221122150909.0190613e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059797632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.4322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, Luísa,10aTrematode infection modulates cockles biochemical response to climate change  ap. 30-40.  aResulting mainly from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) build-up, seawater temperature rise is among the most important climate change related factors affecting costal marine ecosystems. Global warming will have implications on the water cycle, increasing the risk of heavy rainfalls and consequent freshwater input into the oceans but also increasing the frequency of extreme drought periods with consequent salinity increase. For Europe, by the end of the century, projections describe an increase of CO2 concentration up to 1120 ppm (corresponding to 0.5 pH unit decrease), an increase in the water temperature up to 4 °C and a higher frequency of heavy precipitation. These changes are likely to impact many biotic interactions, including host–parasite relationships which are particularly dependent on abiotic conditions. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule, exposed to different salinity, temperature and pH levels as proxy for climate change, modify the infection success of the trematode parasite Himasthla elongata, with consequences to cockles biochemical performance. The results showed that the cercariae infection success increased with acidification but higher biochemical alterations were observed in infected cockles exposed to all abiotic experimental stressful conditions tested. The present study suggested that changes forecasted by many models may promote the proliferation of the parasites infective stages in many ecosystems leading to enhanced transmission, especially on temperate regions, that will influence the geographical distribution of some diseases and, probably, the survival capacity of infected bivalves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerastoderma edule 3aHimasthla elongata 3aacidification 3abiocenosis 3acarbon dioxide 3acercariae 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal warming 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahydrologic cycle 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3aoceans 3apH 3aparasites 3arisk 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperate zones 3atrematode infections 3awater temperature 3aEurope 0aBivalves 0aTrematodes 0aClimate change 0aExperimental infection 0aHost susceptibility 0aInfection success 0aStress biomarkers1 ade Montaudouin, Xavier1 aFigueira, Etelvina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6763-26651 aFreitas, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4900-38970 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 637-638 p.30-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.4323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018200168520163400350592002801984650002502012650001602037650001702053650002202070650002702092650003102119650002002150650003702170650001902207650002402226650002302250650001402273650001802287650000702305650001202312650001702324650001102341650001602352650002202368650001402390653002602404653002202430653001502452653003002467700001802497700006302515700002002578700001902598773009502617856008302712852000902795655001202804IND60748336720221119060505.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074833672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarataş, Ersin10aImmobilization of Sporothrix schenckii 1099-18 exo-polygalacturonase in magnetic mesoporous silica yolk-shell spheres: Highly reusable biocatalysts for apple juice clarification  aIn this study, a heterologously expressed exo-polygalacturonase from Sporothrix schenckii 1099-18 was purified and then its two magnetic immobilized counterparts were prepared in yolk–shell-structured mesoporous silica. The exo-polygalacturonase was initially precipitated on porous calcium carbonate in the presence of Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles. Then, a silica layer was created on the surface of the precipitated particles. The obtained immobilized exo-polygalacturonase (silica@Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG) was further treated with glutaraldehyde (silica@Glu- Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to confirm the immobilization of polygalacturonase. The optimum pH and temperature of all the exo-polygalacturonase preparations were determined to be 4.0 and 60 °C, respectively which are also optimum conditions for apple juice clarification. The silica@ Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG and silica@Glu- Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG showed 3- and 3.7-fold much stability, respectively than the free exo-polygalacturonase at 60 °C. The free and immobilized SsExo-PG preparations were used for the clarification of apple juice and the result showed that the turbidity of apple juice was reduced by 82% after 1 h treatment time. After ten consecutive uses, silica@Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG and silica@Glu-Fe₃O₄/SsExo-PG retained 80% and 90% of their initial activities, respectively. Altogether, biochemical, thermal-stability, and apple juice clarification characteristics of the immobilized SsExo-PG suggest a high potential for biodegradation of pectin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporothrix schenckii 3aapple juice 3abiocatalysts 3acalcium carbonate 3achemical precipitation 3aclarification (processing) 3aenzyme activity 3aexo-poly-alpha-galacturonosidase 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apectins 3aporous media 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aturbidity 0aExo-polygalacturonase 0aMesoporous silica 0aYolk-shell 0aApple juice clarification1 aTülek, Ahmet1 aYıldırım, Deniz,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5041-81601 aTamtürk, Faruk1 aBinay, Barış0 tFood bioscience.g2021 Oct., v. 43 p.101324-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300002200306520079900328592002801127650004401155650002801199650001301227650001801240650001101258650003301269700002001302700001701322700001301339700001701352773012701369856007401496852000901570655001201579IND60640934720221121053129.0190505e20161124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064093472DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13093c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xuesong10aSelf-gradient mechanism, morphology and damping analysis of a thickness continuous gradient epoxy–polyurethane interpenetrating polymer network  ap. 111688-111701.  aA simple and affordable gradient-distributing interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) composite was created that takes advantage of the relatively poor compatibility and the curing rate discrepancy between epoxy (EP) and polyurethane (PU) resins.

Hydrogen boride sheets, a new 2D material recently predicted from theory, exhibit intriguing electronic and mechanical properties as well as hydrogen storage capacity. Here, we report the experimental realization of 2D hydrogen boride sheets with an empirical formula of H₁B₁, produced by exfoliation and complete ion-exchange between protons and magnesium cations in magnesium diboride (MgB₂) with an average yield of 42.3% at room temperature. The sheets feature an sp²-bonded boron planar structure without any long-range order. A hexagonal boron network with bridge hydrogens is suggested as the possible local structure, where the absence of long-range order was ascribed to the presence of three different anisotropic domains originating from the 2-fold symmetry of the hydrogen positions against the 6-fold symmetry of the boron networks, based on X-ray diffraction, X-ray atomic pair distribution functions, electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, photo absorption, core-level binding energy data, infrared absorption, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The established cation-exchange method for metal diboride opens new avenues for the mass production of several types of boron-based 2D materials by countercation selection and functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3aboron 3acation exchange 3acations 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amagnesium 3amechanical properties 3aprotons 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aFujita, Takeshi1 aCuong, Nguyen Thanh1 aTominaka, Satoshi1 aMiyauchi, Masahiro1 aIimura, Soshi1 aHirata, Akihiko1 aUmezawa, Naoto1 aOkada, Susumu1 aNishibori, Eiji1 aFujino, Asahi1 aFujimori, Tomohiro1 aItō, Shin'ichi,1 aNakamura, Junji1 aHosono, Hideo1 aKondo, Takahiro0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 04, v. 139, no. 39 p.13761-13769dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b061533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245006400174300001600238500001500254520114200269592002801411650004301439650001201482650001501494650001201509650000901521650000801530650001301538650001501551650001201566650001701578650001001595650003501605653001801640700002301658773008401681856008101765852000901846655001201855IND60523788320221119192128.0160625e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052378832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-015-0408-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevanato, Piergiorgio10aDigital PCR as New Approach to SNP Genotyping in Sugar Beet  ap. 429-432.  a2019-12-06  aReal-time PCR (qPCR) allelic discrimination and high-resolution melting (HRM) methods are widely adopted for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Digital PCR (dPCR) is a new method recently proposed for the detection of low-frequency and/or rare SNP. The molecular marker SNP_BvBTC1 is used in sugar beet to distinguish between annual and biennial flowering plants. The CC genotype at this SNP locus is associated with biennial beets, while the CA and AA genotypes are typically found in annual beets. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of qPCR, HRM and dPCR in detecting the allele A from two pools of bulk beet DNA composed of 90 biennial + 10 annual plants (B1) and 99 biennial + 1 annual plant (B2), respectively. All annual plants were found to have the AA genotype. qPCR could not detect allele A in either the B1 or B2 pool and HRM detected allele A only at moderate frequencies (10 %), in the B1 pool. dPCR, on the contrary, was able to detect allele A in both pools. We therefore concluded that dPCR is a suitable method for the quantitation of SNP_BvBTC1 within bulked DNA samples of sugar beet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aannuals 3asugar beet 3aalleles 3aloci 3aDNA 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amelting 3aAngiospermae 3abeets 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aMagnoliophyta1 aBiscarini, Filippo0 tSugar tech.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.429-432dSpringer Indiax0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-015-0408-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011600152300002000268520132800288592002801616650002201644650003701666650002201703650002001725650001401745650002301759650001601782650001401798650001401812650002301826650000901849650001301858650003701871700002001908700001601928700001501944700001301959700001201972773012401984856007402108852000902182655001202191IND60640934820221121053119.0190505e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064093482DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13097f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Nan10aElectro-catalysis of carbon black or titanium sub-oxide supported Pd–Gd towards formic acid electro-oxidation  ap. 68989-68996.  aCarbon black supported Pd–Gd catalysts (Pd–xGd/C, x is weight percent in catalyst) with different amounts of Gd were prepared by a simultaneous reduction reaction with sodium borohydride in aqueous solution. The structure, morphology and element valence state of these catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The electro-catalytic performance of these catalysts for formic acid oxidation was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and CO stripping experiments. It is found that the Pd–2.5Gd/C catalyst has a better electro-catalytic activity than the Pd/C catalyst, which can be explained by a bi-functional mechanism. In addition, the higher content of metallic Pd caused by the addition of Gd also contributes to the better catalytic activity of Pd–2.5Gd/C. Based on the good electro-catalytic performance of the Pd–2.5Gd/C, Pd–xGd/Ti₄O₇ (x stands for weight percentage in whole catalyst) catalysts were also prepared and characterized in the same way. The Pd–2.5Gd/Ti₄O₇ and Pd–4Gd/Ti₄O₇ catalysts exhibited better catalytic activities than the Pd–2.5Gd/C catalyst, which mainly results from the further increase of metallic Pd caused by Ti₄O₇.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aformic acid 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3asodium borohydride 3asoot 3atitanium 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aQin, Chuanguang1 aWang, Rumin1 aMa, Shuhui1 aWang, Yi1 aQi, Tao0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 20, v. 6, no. 73 p.68989-68996dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra13097f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245006000161300001800221520103900239592002801278650002301306650001201329650002201341650002201363650001301385700002201398700001701420773011101437856007501548852000901623655001201632IND60529465720221116155521.0160717e20130604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052946572DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400440c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLondero, Pablo S.10aLaser Ablation Surface-Enhanced Raman Microspectroscopy  ap. 5463-5467.  aImproved identification of trace organic compounds in complex matrixes is critical for a variety of fields such as material science, heritage science, and forensics. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that can attain single-molecule sensitivity and has been shown to complement mass spectrometry, but lacks widespread application without a robust method that utilizes the effect. We demonstrate a new, highly sensitive, and widely applicable approach to SERS analysis based on laser ablation in the presence of a tailored plasmonic substrate. We analyze several challenging compounds, including non-water-soluble pigments and dyed leather from an ancient Egyptian chariot, achieving sensitivity as high as 120 amol for a 1:1 signal-to-noise ratio and 5 μm spatial resolution. This represents orders of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to those of other SERS approaches intended for widespread application, greatly increasing the applicability of SERS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aleather 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic compounds 3apigments1 aLombardi, John R.1 aLeona, Marco0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 June 04, v. 85, no. 11 p.5463-5467dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac400440c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011800169300001400287520161500301592002801916650002201944650001801966650001001984650001201994650002602006651001102032653002302043653001902066653002402085653001302109653003202122700002002154700001502174700002402189773011202213856008002325852000902405655001202414IND60478584520221122111315.0200514e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047858452DNAL7 a10.1556/168.2015.16.1.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParaskevopoulou, S.10aSpatio-temporal variability of benthic macrofauna in a coastal lagoon assessed by ecological interaction networks  ap. 10-22.  aAn ecological survey of the benthic communities was carried out, at both spatial and temporal scales, in Papapouli Lagoon, the first ecotouristic park in Greece by applying for the first time, ecological network analysis. The application of ecological network analysis provided novel information on the quality of interactions among species, undetected by the most frequently used methods. The sorting of substrate samples enabled the identification and density determination of 40,036 individuals belonging to 31 different taxa, although, strong dominance of only a few species was observed. “Deposit feeders” were the dominant trophic group in all sampling sites and seasons while “suspension feeders” exhibited relatively the lowest abundance. The periodic opening of the sea inlet seems to be of crucial importance. In coastal lagoons, where there is constant communication with the sea, benthic fauna patterns seem to change according to the sea-land gradient. However, in intermittently closed lagoons, such as Papapouli Lagoon, a more homogenous pattern is evident. The obtained networks showed that when communication with the sea is interrupted all the benthic fauna patterns tend to be destabilized and centralized around one species, which in most cases is a “deposit feeder”. When the inlet opens and communication with the sea is restored, the benthic composition seems to be more cohesive, especially in the most distant regions.

Nees in diabetes mellitus  aPre-press version  aThe prevalence of diabetes mellitus has increased over time. Medicinal plants, including Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f) Nees, are recognized for their use to manage hyperglycemia. Nowadays, plenty of papers are published about A. paniculata as an antidiabetic; however, no bibliometric study about the topic exists. This study examines the existing papers about the preclinical trial of A. paniculata as an antidiabetic agent using bibliometric analysis focusing on countries, institutions, publishers, authors, documents, and keywords. Bibliographic information of relevant research and conference articles were obtained from the Scopus database. In total, 97 articles published between 1994 and 2021 were selected, covering 376 authors and 1270 keywords. Data were analyzed bibliometrically using Vosviewer 1.6.16. A total of 97 published papers occurred from 1994 to 2021 were selected. India, Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia), Journal of Ethnopharmacology, and Agung Endro Nugroho (Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia) were the most productive country, institution, publisher, and author, respectively. The analysis of the most influential papers, co-citation network of the most influential papers, bibliographical coupling network based on authors, and keyword co-occurrence network and overlay demonstrated that the abundance and variety of existing papers about preclinical trials of A. paniculata as an antidiabetic were from phytochemistry, pharmacology, and drug formulation. The findings of our analysis have implications for managerial and theoretical aspects on this topic, such as encouraging research collaborations by analyzing the contributions of countries, institutions, publishers, and authors and revealing research gaps (molecular mechanisms, toxicities and side effects, drug formulations, and clinical trials) to accept a phytomedicine as a therapeutic option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrographis paniculata 3abibliometric analysis 3adatabases 3adiabetes mellitus 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aplant biochemistry 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 0aAndrographis paniculata (Burm.f.)

Therefore, it is necessary to know how to harvest and handle fresh fruits and their storage conditions to handle the fruits after harvesting so that the quality of the products can be maintained. One of the first treatments in the fruit cold chain is evaporative cooling. In order to get an evaporative cooling system that has an even temperature distribution, it is necessary to make a spatial model when designing an evaporative cooling system using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). The objectives of this research are: (1) design of direct flow type evaporative cooling systems and (2) test the performance of direct flow type evaporative coolers. This research method uses design methods, experiments, and computer simulations. The results showed the performance of the evaporative cooler system in the scenario with the roof on, the highest effectiveness value was 1.198, the highest approximation value was 2.832, and the highest range value was 4.589. In the scenario without a roof on the evaporative cooler system, the highest effectiveness value was 1.767, the highest approach value was 2.139, and the highest range value was 4.835. The CFD analysis in the scenario with a roof had the highest temperature value of 25.9 ° C and the lowest temperature of 21.9 ° C, while the CFD analysis in the scenario without roof had the highest temperature of 23.7 ° C and the lowest temperature of 20.4 ° C.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acold chain 3acomputers 3acooling 3afluid mechanics 3afruits 3amodels 3atemperature 0acfd 0adirect flow type 0aevaporat ive cooler 0aquality 0afruit1 aSyska, Kavadya1 aRopiudin0 tJurnal Teknik Pertanian.g2021 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.338-350dJurusan Teknik Pertanian Universitas LampungwJournal:27834x2549-08187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.23960/jtep-l.v10.i3.338-3503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012600160300001800286520111400304592002801418650001601446650001601462650002001478650001701498650001701515650002501532650001801557650000701575650001301582650001101595700001801606700002801624700002401652773012901676856007301805852000901878655001201887IND60529465820170412000000.0160717e20130604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052946582DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400520s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDescalzo, Ana B.10aLuminescent Core–Shell Imprinted Nanoparticles Engineered for Targeted Förster Resonance Energy Transfer-Based Sensing  ap. 5316-5320.  aRed-luminescent 200 nm silica nanoparticles have been designed and prepared as a versatile platform for developing FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) biomimetic assays. Ru(phen)₃²⁺ dye molecules embedded off-center in the silica core provide the long-lived donor emission, and a near-infrared labeled analyte serves as fluorescent acceptor (the measured R₀ of this D–A pair is 4.3 nm). A thin surface-grafted molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shell intervenes as selective enrofloxacin-binding element. These nanoparticles have been tested for photochemical detection of enrofloxacin by using a competitive scheme that can be readily performed in MeCN–HEPES (pH 7.5) 7:3 (v/v) mixtures and allows for the antibiotic detection in the μM range (LOD = 2 μM) without optimization of the assay. Given the well-known difficulties of coupling the target-binding-to-MIP and the transducing events, the novel photochemical approach tuned up here will be valuable in future developments of MIP-based assays and optosensors that capitalize also on the advantages of nanomaterials for (bio)analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiomimetics 3aenergy transfer 3aenrofloxacin 3afluorescence 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymers 3asilica1 aSomoza, Clara1 aMoreno-Bondi, Maria C.,1 aOrellana, Guillermo0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 June 04, v. 85, no. 11 p.5316-5320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac400520s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016100166300001600327500002000343520171000363592002802073596002102101650002302122650002702145650001202172650002602184650001202210650001902222650001402241650001302255650002502268650002102293650002002314650001802334650002102352650001802373650001602391650001402407651001002421651001102431700006102442700002102503700002402524700001902548773011302567856008202680852000902762655001202771IND60575826620221117224330.0220815e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057582662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-016-1422-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruwez, Robert10aClimate warming and atmospheric deposition affect seed viability of common juniper (Juniperus communis) via their impact on the nutrient status of the plant  ap. 135-144.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGlobal environmental change is increasingly affecting species worldwide. One of the emblematic casualties among plants in several European countries is common juniper (Juniperus communis). Many populations of common juniper throughout its distribution range are declining. The relative lack of viable seed production, resulting in low probabilities for successful natural regeneration, is one of the main reasons for this decline. Climate warming and elevated atmospheric depositions have been shown to negatively affect seed viability of common juniper, but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains scarce. One possible pathway is via changes in the plant nutrient status that, in turn, may affect seed viability. Here we took advantage of large‐scale gradients in climate and atmospheric depositions between central Sweden and northern Spain, and analysed foliar nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry and seed viability in 20 juniper populations spread across Europe. Our results show that increasing temperatures can negatively affect needle N and P concentrations while enhanced potentially acidifying depositions resulted in lower foliar N and Ca concentrations. Needle C:N ratios increased with higher temperature, acidifying depositions and precipitation. By linking these patterns to seed viability, we found that low needle P, Ca and Mg concentrations were related to low seed viability. Thus, a shortage of these key elements during seed development and seed nutrient storage, can lead to anomalies and seed abortion. These findings help to explain the low seed viability of juniper in Europe and may help to assist land managers to take urgently needed conservation actions.  aPublisher supplied data  cGhent University 3aJuniperus communis 3aatmospheric deposition 3acalcium 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3amagnesium 3amanagers 3anatural regeneration 3anutrient content 3aplant nutrition 3aseed abortion 3aseed development 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3aviability 3aSpain 3aSweden1 aDe Frenne, Pieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8613-09431 aDe Schrijver, An1 aVangansbeke, Pieter1 aVerheyen, Kris0 tEcological research.g2017 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.135-144dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-016-1422-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245012500190300001600315520186700331592002802198653001702226653001302243653001502256653001702271653002002288653001802308653001502326700002302341773011202364856011702476852000902593655001202602IND60129385220221119192512.0151124e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012938522DNAL7 a10.1665/1082-6467(2001)010[0209:ROTGHE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowell, C.

F.10aReview of the genus Homeomastax (Eumastacinae, Eumastacidae, Eumastacoidea, Orthoptera), with description of new species  ap. 209-254.  aSeven new species of Homeomastax are described, two from Panama and five from Costa Rica; a further new species from Colombia is noted, but not described owing to the lack of a male. The genus now contains 22 species. On the basis of the male genitalia the genus can be divided into 4 species groups, represented by the species surda, bouvieri, kressi and silvicola respectively; those species known only from the female (dentata, richteri, annulipes, and the new Colombian form) cannot yet be arranged in this scheme. Apart from male phallic characters, the species are externally recognizable only by the male and female subgenital plates and by morphometric ratios, especially E//F (elytron: femur). Of the three species redescribed by Rehn & Rehn (1934), the originally missing male of surda Burr and the female of veraguae Hebard are shown to have been correctly assigned by those authors. Their redescription of H. dentata Saussure, however, is invalid, as the type is a different taxon. The phallic complex of the genus is described in detail, and observations on copulation and the nature of the spermatophore are presented. We suggest that the hooked and tapered end of the spermatophore may be used as an intromittent organ by the copulating male.The natural history and geographical distribution of the genus is reviewed; it occurs west and north of the Andean chains, though it extends up the major inter-Andean valleys of Northern Colombia, and ranges from Ecuador to Honduras. The four species groups are largely disjunct geographically. The bouvieri-group is South American, with an outlying species (brachyptera) in Central Panama; the surda-group is confined to the Pacific slope, the kressi-group to the Caribbean slope, and the silvicola-group is known only from the Caribbean slope and mountains of northern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGrasshoppers 0ataxonomy 0aNeotropics 0aEumastacidae 0aphallic anatomy 0aspermatophore 0acopulation1 aBentos-Pereira, A.0 tJournal of orthoptera research.g2001 Dec., v. 10, no. 2 p.209-254dOrthopterists' Societyx1082-64677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1665%2F1082-6467%282001%29010%5B0209%3AROTGHE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245008800207300001600295506007600311520179500387592002802182506003702210650001702247650001302264650001602277650001202293650001602305650002002321650002102341650000902362650001402371650002002385650001202405650002302417650001302440700002002453700002402473773010302497856008402600852000902684655001202693IND60111918420221207052040.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011191842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.03.0092doi7 aPMC30878202pmcid7 a213976672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedden, Lee10aP2X₇ receptor antagonists display agonist-like effects on cell signaling proteins  ap. 532-542.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The activation of various P2 receptors (P2R) by extracellular nucleotides promotes diverse cellular events, including the stimulation of cell signaling protein and increases in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ. We report that some agents that can block P2X₇R receptors also promote diverse P2X₇R-independent effects on cell signaling. METHODS: We exposed native rat parotid acinar cells, salivary gland cell lines (Par-C10, HSY, HSG), and PC12 cells to suramin, DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyano stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid), Cibacron Blue 3GA, Brilliant Blue G, and the P2X₇R-selective antagonist A438079, and examined the activation/phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PKCδ, Src, CDCP1, and other signaling proteins. RESULTS: With the exception of suramin, these agents blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by BzATP in rat parotid acinar cells; but higher concentrations of suramin blocked ATP-stimulated ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ entry. Aside from A438079, these agents increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Src, PKCδ, and other proteins (including Dok-1) within minutes in an agent- and cell type-specific manner in the absence of a P2X₇R ligand. The stimulatory effect of these compounds on the tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 and its Src-dependent association with PKCδ was blocked by knockdown of CDCP1, which also blocked Src and PKCδ phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Several agents used as P2X₇R blockers promote the activation of various signaling proteins and thereby act more like receptor agonists than antagonists. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Some compounds used to block P2 receptors have complicated effects that may confound their use in blocking receptor activation and other biological processes for which they are employed, including their use as blockers of various ion transport proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacinar cells 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3anucleotides 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3areceptors 3asalivary glands 3asuramin 3atransport proteins 3atyrosine1 aBenes, Cyril H.1 aSoltoff, Stephen P.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 May, v. 1810, no. 5 p.532-542dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166300001400277520070500291592002800996650001001024650001701034650001601051650001701067653001301084653002901097653002701126653001501153653002301168700001701191700001301208700001401221773013801235856008501373852000901458655001201467IND60793263020221118105011.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079326302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2022.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, De-Cai10aTwo novel isoflavone derivatives from Ficus esquiroliana Levl. and their cytotoxic effects on cancer cells  ap. 45-48.  aTwo novel isoflavone derivatives ficusavone A and B (1 and 2) together with two known biogenetically related isoflavone derivatives (3 and 4) were isolated from the stems of Ficus esquiroliana Levl.

The stacks mimic the terminal surface-active phospholipid (SAPL) coatings on cartilage in mammalian joints. Piles of 11 bilayer membranes of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) are immobilized at the interface of the solid silicon support and the liquid D₂O backing phase. We replace the natural hyaluronic acid (HA) component of synovial fluid by a synthetic substitute, namely, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), at identical concentration. We find the oligolamellar DMPC bilayer films strongly interacting with PAH resulting in a drastic increase of the membranes d spacing (by a factor of ∼5). Onset of shear causes a buckling-like deformation of the DMPC bilayers perpendicular to the applied shear field. With increasing shear rate we observe substantially enhanced water fractions in the membrane slabs which we attribute to increasing fragmentation caused by Kelvin–Helmholtz-like instabilities parallel to the applied shear field. Both effects are in line with recent theoretical predictions on shear-induced instabilities of lipid bilayer membranes in water (Hanasaki, I.; Walther, J. H.; Kawano, S.; Koumoutsakos, P. Phys. Rev. E 2010, 82, 051602). With the applied shear the interfacial lipid linings transform from their gel state Pᵦ′ to their fluid state Lα. Although in chain-molten state with reduced bending rigidity the lipid layers do not detach from their solid support. We hold steric bridging of the fragmented lipid bilayer membranes by PAH molecules responsible for the unexpected mechanical stability of the DMPC linings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acartilage 3acoatings 3adeformation 3adeuterium oxide 3agels 3ahyaluronic acid 3alipid bilayers 3aliquids 3amammals 3aneutrons 3aphospholipids 3aprediction 3asilicon 3aslabs 3asynovial fluid1 aTrapp, Marcus1 aBallauff, M.q(Matthias),1 aDahint, Reiner1 aSteitz, Roland0 tLangmuir.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 31, no. 42 p.11539-11548dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b016783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169520144800322592002801770650001501798650001301813650002201826650001301848650001901861650001301880650002401893650001501917650001901932650001001951650001201961650002401973650001801997650001302015650001502028650002202043650002502065650001802090650001602108650001502124650002502139650002002164650001802184650001602202650001302218653002002231653002002251653001502271653001502286653001502301653002502316700002102341700002402362700002102386700002202407700002002429773011302449856008602562852000902648655001202657IND60684696020221118065056.0210212e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068469602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1205002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKönig, Roger10aMicropollutant adsorption from water with engineered porous ceramic architectures produced by additive manufacturing and coated with natural zeolite  aTreatment of waste and drinking waters has gained importance in both emerging and industrialized countries. New pharmaceutical products, industrial processes, agricultural activities are reducing water quality. To solve these problems we propose an efficient and thus economical purification method which uses commercial available natural zeolites as coating material on engineered porous ceramic substrates produced by additive manufacturing. The filters were produced varying the coating thickness and processing parameters such as calcination time and temperature. A testing device was assembled to investigate the filters’ performance by exposing them in flowing water (240 Lh⁻¹). The micropollutant adsorption was tested in three different water matrices (distilled water, surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluent). A range of 0.05 mg NH₄–N g⁻¹ up to 3.1 mg NH₄– NH₄–N g⁻¹ zeolite of ammonium nitrogen was observed on the processed filters. Good filter stability expressed as weight loss (<5%) was observed. The adsorption of ten tested micropollutants showed an overall efficiency of 41.5% and 43% on the surface modified zeolite filters. Natural zeolite filters showed good specific adsorption capacity for metoprolol, citalopram, venlaflaxine and clarithromycin whereas the surface modified zeolite (SMZ) filters adsorb better hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac, candesartan, mecoprop and irbesartan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aceramics 3aclarithromycin 3acoatings 3adeveloped countries 3adiclofenac 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3afilters 3ahydrochlorothiazide 3amanufacturing 3amecoprop 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apurification methods 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aweight loss 3azeolites 0aMicropollutants 0aNatural zeolite 0aSurfactant 0aAdsorption 0aFiltration 0aWastewater treatment1 aSpaggiari, Marco1 aSantoliquido, Oscar1 aPrincipi, Pamela1 aBianchi, Giovanni1 aOrtona, Alberto0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 10, v. 258 p.120500-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1205003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245007700159300001400236520105600250592002801306650002201334650001501356650001101371650001601382653001401398653001401412653002201426653001901448653001501467653001401482773009201496856007901588852000901667655001201676IND60478584920221122111409.0160112e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047858492DNAL7 a10.1556/168.2015.16.1.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindo, Z.10aLinking functional traits and network structure to concepts of stability  ap. 48-54.  aThe objectives of this paper are to discuss stability as an emergent property of ecological systems, as well as promote a common language of network theory that will transfer among socio-ecological systems.

Many researchers have also made the connections between network architecture and robustness, recognizing species interaction links as important aspects of architecture, but few papers incorporate concepts of diversity and redundancy for both nodes and links into aspects of architecture, and consequently network dynamics and stability.

Savanna research on the impact of these drivers has widely applied the so-called plant functional type (PFT) approach, grouping the vegetation into two or three broad types (here called meta-PFTs): woody plants and grasses, which are sometimes divided into perennial and annual grasses. However, little is known about the response of functional traits within these coarse types towards water availability or livestock grazing. In this study, we extended an existing eco-hydrological savanna vegetation model to capture trait diversity within the three broad meta-PFTs to assess the effects of both grazing and mean annual precipitation (MAP) on trait composition along a gradient of both drivers. Our results show a complex pattern of trait responses to grazing and aridity. The response differs for the three meta-PFTs. From our findings, we derive that trait responses to grazing and aridity for perennial grasses are similar, as suggested by the convergence model for grazing and aridity. However, we also see that this only holds for simulations below a MAP of 500 mm. This combined with the finding that trait response differs between the three meta-PFTs leads to the conclusion that there is no single, universal trait or set of traits determining the response to grazing and aridity. We finally discuss how simulation models including trait variability within meta-PFTs are necessary to understand ecosystem responses to environmental drivers, both locally and globally and how this perspective will help to extend conceptual frameworks of other ecosystems to savanna research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abotanical composition 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aland use 3alivestock 3aperennials 3asavannas 3asimulation models 3awoody plants1 aGuo, Tong1 aTietjen, Britta0 tTheoretical ecology.g2018 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.161-173dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000920x1874-17387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-017-0356-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009700166300002000263520185300283592002802136650000802164650001902172650001102191650002102202650002002223650001602243650001502259650001102274650001302285650002202298650001302320650001302333650001302346650001402359650001102373650001602384700001702400700001702417700002102434700002302455773010102478856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60577333620221120133329.0170808e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057733362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b021832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Wenwen10aScience of Water Leaks: Validated Theory for Moisture Flow in Microchannels and Nanochannels  ap. 11740-11747.  aWater is ubiquitous; the science of its transport in micro- and nanochannels has applications in electronics, medicine, filtration, packaging, and earth and planetary science.

Here we report the first measurements of water vapor flow rates through four silica microchannels as a function of humidity, including under conditions when air is present as a background gas. An important finding is that the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) is strongly modified by surface layers of adsorbed water molecules, in agreement with previous work on the TMAC for nitrogen molecules impacting a silica surface in the presence of moisture. We measure enhanced flow rates for two-phase flows in silica microchannels driven by capillary filling. For the measurement of flows in nanochannels we use heavy water mass spectrometry. We construct the theory for the flow rates of the dominant modes of water transport through each of the four standard configurations and benchmark it against our new measurements in silica and against previously reported measurements for nanochannels in carbon nanotubes, carbon nanopipes, and porous alumina. The findings show that all behavior can be described by the four standard leak configurations and that measurements of leak behavior made using other molecules, such as helium, are not reliable. Single-phase water vapor flow is overestimated by a helium measurement, while two-phase flows are greatly underestimated for channels larger than 100 nm or for all channels when boundary slip applies, to an extent that depends on the slip length for the liquid-phase flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adeuterium oxide 3aelectronics 3afiltration 3ahelium 3ahumidity 3amass spectrometry 3amedicine 3amomentum 3anitrogen 3apackaging 3asilica 3awater vapor1 aFong, Nicole1 aYin, Yongbai1 aŠvehla, Martin,1 aMcKenzie, David R.0 tLangmuir.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 31, no. 42 p.11740-11747dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b021833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04203naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009400191300001800285500002000303520279700323592002803120650001703148650001603165650001203181650001103193650001903204650001503223650001603238650000903254650001403263650002203277650001503299650001103314650001703325650002703342650001103369650000903380650001503389650001203404650001003416650001003426651001003436700001403446773013203460856010803592852000903700655001203709IND60587497520221119140429.0180319e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058749752DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1792:SOEFFA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClanahan, T. R.10aSpillover of exploitable fishes from a marine park and its effect on the adjacent fishery  ap. 1792-1805.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of a marine protected area in enhancing local fisheries, through the emigration or spillover of exploitable fishes, was studied in a coral reef park (Mombasa Marine Park, Kenya) and fishery over a seven‐year period during a time when the park's border changed and pull seines were eliminated. We measured catches before and after the park's establishment and during the management changes and compared these catches with the unmanaged side of the park. Additionally, we placed baited traps on both sides of the park over a full tidal cycle which allowed us to measure the spillover from the park compared to the deeper, rougher, and less fished reef edge. The total wet mass of catches per trap, the mean size of the trapped fish, and the number of fish species caught per trap declined as a function of the distance away from the park edge on both the southern and northern sides. However, this relationship was truncated on the unmanaged side which also had smaller catches, smaller fish, and fewer species than the managed side. Trap fishers on the managed side adapted to the spillover by increasing the traps per fisher, which had the effect of reducing the catch per trap. Tides and reef morphology also appeared to interact and influenced catches, but we found no relationships between catches and benthic substratum cover, which was usually dominated by seagrass and sand. Spillover from the deeper reef edge was evident for the managed but not the unmanaged side of the park, but may be due to differences in reef morphology interacting with tidal patterns rather than management. On the managed side, the park significantly increased the catch per fisher and catch per area by >50%, but even after the park's size was reduced, the total catch was reduced by ∼30%. The reduced park was still ∼50% of the total area. Consequently, the catch per area increase was insufficient to compensate for the lost area over this early period of the park's establishment. Spillover was greatest for the dominant fisheries species. These were moderately vagile species in the rabbitfish (Siganidae; herbivores), emperors (Lethrinidae; carnivores), and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae; herbivores) families, which had instantaneous emigration rates from the park to the reserve fishing ground of ∼0.5. Our field survey, combined with previous modeling studies, based on adult emigration rates from marine reserves, suggests that tropical fisheries dominated by rabbitfish, emperors, and surgeonfish should be enhanced by closed areas of ∼10–15% of the total area. The optimal protected area may increase if larval export is important, but the predicted response should not be measurable for >10 years, beyond the length of our study, as breeding stock develop inside protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthuridae 3aLethrinidae 3aSiganus 3aadults 3abreeding stock 3acarnivores 3acoral reefs 3afish 3afisheries 3afishery resources 3aherbivores 3alarvae 3amarine parks 3amarine protected areas 3amodels 3asand 3aseagrasses 3asurveys 3atides 3atraps 3aKenya1 aMangi, S.0 tEcological applications.g2000 Dec., v. 10, no. 6 p.1792-1805dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B1792:SOEFFA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008600164300001600250500002000266520164000286592002801926650001401954650002701968650001601995650001502011650001802026650002602044650001802070650001402088650002402102650000902126650001402135650000902149651001202158700005802170700002002228700002202248700002202270700001502292700001702307700006102324773013302385856007302518852000902591655001202600IND60600899920221116160856.0180704e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060089992DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.132782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacava, Mariángeles10aWeb building and silk properties functionally covary among species of wolf spider  ap. 968-978.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough phylogenetic studies have shown covariation between the properties of spider major ampullate (MA) silk and web building, both spider webs and silks are highly plastic so we cannot be sure whether these traits functionally covary or just vary across environments that the spiders occupy. As MaSp2‐like proteins provide MA silk with greater extensibility, their presence is considered necessary for spider webs to effectively capture prey. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) are predominantly non‐web building, but a select few species build webs. We accordingly collected MA silk from two web‐building and six non‐web‐building species found in semirural ecosystems in Uruguay to test whether the presence of MaSp2‐like proteins (indicated by amino acid composition, silk mechanical properties and silk nanostructures) was associated with web building across the group. The web‐building and non‐web‐building species were from disparate subfamilies so we estimated a genetic phylogeny to perform appropriate comparisons. For all of the properties measured, we found differences between web‐building and non‐web‐building species. A phylogenetic regression model confirmed that web building and not phylogenetic inertia influences silk properties. Our study definitively showed an ecological influence over spider silk properties. We expect that the presence of the MaSp2‐like proteins and the subsequent nanostructures improves the mechanical performance of silks within the webs. Our study furthers our understanding of spider web and silk co‐evolution and the ecological implications of spider silk properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycosidae 3aamino acid composition 3acoevolution 3aecosystems 3aextensibility 3amechanical properties 3ananomaterials 3aphylogeny 3aregression analysis 3asilk 3aspidroins 3awebs 3aUruguay1 aCamargo, Arley1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7734-86791 aGarcia, Luis F.1 aBenamú, Marco A.1 aSantana, Martín,1 aFang, Jian1 aWang, Xungai1 aBlamires, Sean J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5953-37230 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2018 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.968-978dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.132783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
