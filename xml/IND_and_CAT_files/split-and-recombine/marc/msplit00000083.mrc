The apicoplast has some essential plant-like metabolic pathways and processes, making these parasites susceptible to inhibitors of these functions. The main objective of this paper is to determine if phytotoxins with plastid target sites are more likely to be good antiplasmodial compounds than are those with other modes of action. The antiplasmodial activities of some compounds with established phytotoxic action were determined in vitro on a chloroquine (CQ) sensitive (D6, Sierra Leone) strain of Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, we provide in vitro activities of almost 50 such compounds, as well as a few phytoalexins against P. falciparum. Endothall, anisomycin, and cerulenin had sufficient antiplasmodial action to be considered as new lead antimalarial structures. Some derivatives of fusicoccin possessed markedly improved antiplasmodial action than the parent compound. Our results suggest that phytotoxins with plastid targets may not necessarily be better antiplasmodials than those that act at other molecular sites. The herbicides, phytotoxins and the phytoalexins reported here with significant antiplasmodial activity may be useful probes for identification of new antimalarial drug targets and may also be used as new lead structures for new antiplasmodial drug discovery. 3aphytotoxins 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3astilbenes 3aherbicides 3afusicoccin 3aantimalarials 3aphytoalexins 2aAnimals 2aAntimalarials 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDrug Design 2aHerbicidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPlastidsxdrug effects 2aSesquiterpenes 2aStilbenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTerpenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 0aglycosides1 aSingh, K.1 aNanayakkara, D.1 aDuke, S.O.1 aRimando, A.M.1 aEvidente, A.1 aTekwani, B.L.0 tBiological & pharmaceutical bulletin.g2007, v.  30, no.  9 p.1740-17447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/104463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/02/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02150naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002900158245008200187300001600269500002400285520070900309650002201018650001001040650001801050650002301068650001001091650000901101650001301110650001101123650001501134650001601149650002501165650002301190650002401213650002001237651001801257700002301275700002401298773011701322852000901439856011201448930003301560945002501593946001301618961001301631655001201644IND4433115020221116171628.0100221e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443311502DNAL7 a10113/387092hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aX320 0aF8201 aFernandez-Cornejo, Jorge10aDynamic Diffusion with Disadoption: The Case of Crop Biotechnology in the USA  ap. 112-126.  aIncludes references  aControversy over the use of genetically engineered (GE) crops may have induced some farmers to disadopt these seeds, making a traditional diffusion model inappropriate. In this study, we develop and estimate a dynamic diffusion model, examine the diffusion paths of GE corn, soybeans, and cotton, predict the adoption of those crops over the next two years, and explore the main determinants of the diffusion rate. Our estimates indicate that future growth of Bt crops will be slower or negative, depending mainly on the infestation levels of the target pests. Adoption of herbicide-tolerant soybeans and cotton will continue to increase, unless consumer sentiment in the United States changes radically. 3atransgenic plants 3acrops 3abiotechnology 3afarmers' attitudes 3aseeds 3acorn 3asoybeans 3acotton 3aprediction 3aplant pests 3aherbicide resistance 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer acceptance 3apest management 3aUnited States1 aAlexander, Corinne1 aGoodhue, Rachael E.0 tAgricultural and resource economics review.g2002 Apr., v.  31, no.  1 p.112-126wJournal:22623x1068-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/387093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100224b20100305c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/02/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle04119naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003900113040001800152100001900170245005700189300001400246500002400260500001500284506017300299520228100472650001102753650001402764650002302778650001602801650001602817650002302833650002302856650002302879650002002902650001902922650000902941650002102950650001502971650002602986650002103012650001003033650001303043650001503056651001203071653001403083700001903097700002003116773011403136852000903250856011203259856008903371956009203460961001303552655001203565IND4462038820221120033336.0111017e19980601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446203882DNAL7 a10113/547862hdl7 a10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00036-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunsaker, D.J.10aCotton response to high frequency surface irrigation  ap. 55-74.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aHigh frequency irrigation with surface irrigation methods has been proposed as a means to increase cotton productivity in cases where drip irrigation or other pressurized systems are not economically justifiable. Field studies were conducted in 1993 and 1994 to evaluate the effects of surface irrigation frequency on the growth, lint yield and water use for a semi-determinate cotton cultivar in central Arizona. Cotton was grown in level basins on a sandy loam under three irrigation treatments defined as low frequency irrigation for the whole season (L), high frequency irrigation for the whole season (H), and low frequency irrigation until the initiation of rapid fruiting, high frequency during rapid fruiting, and low frequency after rapid fruiting (LHL). The treatments were governed by the percentage of allowable soil water depletion within the effective root zone, and the allowable depletion targets for low and high frequency irrigation were 55 and 30%, respectively. An irrigation scheduling program calculated the soil water depletion within the estimated cotton root depth on a daily basis for each treatment and was used to project the dates and amounts for treatment irrigations. In 1993, seven, 14, and 11 irrigations and in 1994 eight, 13 and 10 irrigations were given to the L, H, and LHL treatments, respectively. The total amount of water applied including rainfall differed among the treatments by 4% in 1993 and by 1% in 1994. Soil water measurements indicated that actual soil water depletion within the estimated cotton root depth immediately before treatment irrigations was close to the intended treatment allowable depletion targets for the majority of the growing season. Cotton growth and lint yields were maximized under the H treatment, and yields in this treatment averaged 15 and 21% more lint than the L treatment for the first and second seasons, respectively. The LHL treatment, although not as effective in increasing crop productivity as the H treatment, out yielded the low frequency treatment by an average of 10% in the two seasons. Crop evapotranspiration determined from the soil water balance was 8 and 9% higher for the H than the L treatment and 3 and 5% higher for the LHL than the L treatment in 1993 and 1994, respectively. 3abasins 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3arhizosphere 3alint cotton 3asoil water balance 3asurface irrigation 3aGossypium hirsutum 3amicroirrigation 3agrowing season 3arain 3airrigation rates 3asoil water 3airrigation scheduling 3asandy loam soils 3aroots 3afruiting 3alint yield 3aArizona 0awater use1 aClemmens, A.J.1 aFangmeier, D.D.0 tAgricultural water management.g1998 June 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.55-74dElsevierwJournal:jnl8460x1873-22837nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/547863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00036-53Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/110342_HunsakerFrequency1998.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02246naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110024002100131040001800152072000900170100002000179245007900199300001800278500002500296500001500321506007600336520054600412506003700958650001100995650003001006650001401036650001301050650001901063650001201082650002501094650002301119650002801142650002601170650002801196650002801224650003901252650003101291650002401322653001501346653001701361700001601378700001801394773010001412852000901512856011201521930003301633946001301666961001301679655001201692IND8906493520221207053859.0891207e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890649352DNAL7 a27828792pmid7 aPMC2030092pmcid7 a10113/241112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aRasmussen, M.A.10aImproved assay for quantitating adherence of ruminal bacteria to cellulose  ap. 2089-2091.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA quantitative technique suitable for the determination of adherence of ruminal bacteria to cellulose was developed.

Data from USDA Agricultural Research Service watersheds have been disseminated independently at each location, hindering multi-site analyses. A virtual team spanning diverse organizational units developed a web-based system, Sustaining the Earth's Watersheds-Agricultural Research Data System (STEWARDS) that allows users to search, visualize, and download soil, water, climate, management, and economic data from Conservation Effects Assessment Project benchmark watersheds. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of STEWARDS and discuss challenges that were met to deliver STEWARDS on time, according to requirements, and within available resources. The information technology specialists had to understand that vague and changing requirements are reasonable for a system to support loosely coupled research across diverse watersheds. Researchers and data managers had to learn to communicate clearly about their data. Open communication, respect for perspectives and constraints of others, and a shared commitment to the goal provided the basis for trust.

In 2001, a greenhouse study was initiated to determine the tolerance of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) to flooding of various durations and at different growth stages. Plants were subjected to 11 flooding treatments lasting from one to 11 days. Flood treatments were initiated when plants reached either early vegetative growth stage (second true leaf opening), early reproductive stage (first flower opening on the main stem) or late reproductive stage (green seeds fill 1/2 of the pod cavity). In the first study, flooding during the early vegetative growth stage for one, 2 and 5 days resulted in both the number of pods produced and pod fresh weight being statistically similar to that of the non-flooded control. The remaining flood treatments resulted in pod fresh weights of 73% or less than the control weight. The number of surviving plants had more influence on the pod fresh weight than did flood duration. The number of pods produced per plant was correlated to pod fresh weight. Only one plant grown to either the early or late reproductive growth stage survived flooding for >24 h. There was a 21% yield reduction for plants flooded for 24 h during the early reproductive growth stage. Flooding for 24 h at the late reproductive stage resulted in a 50% yield reduction. In the second study, plants flooded during the early vegetative growth stage did not flower. Flooding during the late vegetative and flowering stages caused a 70 and 49% reduction in yield, respectively. Pod production slowed with increasing flood duration. Yield could be correlated to several plant physical characteristics. Linear relationships were found between yield components (pod number and weight) and flood duration, flood timing and leaf area. Greenhouse data indicate that yield reduction can be estimated from changes in plant characteristics resulting from flooding. 3aplant growth 3afilling period 3abeans 3aflowering 3aseeds 3agreenhouse production 3aphenology 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3awater stress 3acrop yield 3aflooded conditions 3aflooding tolerance 3amortality 3aleaves 3apods 0adevelopmental stages1 aD' Ambrosio, F.R.1 aLi, Y.1 aRao, R.0 tJournal of vegetable science.g2005, v.  11, no.  2 p.43-56x1548-16897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J484v11n02_053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071122b20071210c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02702naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072001700130072001700147100001600164245006600180300001400246500002400260500001500284520141100299650001701710650001901727650001601746650003101762650002201793650001401815653001101829653002601840653001801866653002801884700001701912700001701929773010601946852000902052856011102061930003302172945002502205946001302230961001302243655001202256IND4380199920221120102611.0060515e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438019992DNAL7 a10113/16002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As a result, USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has procedures in place to keep the weevil from being reintroduced into eradicated areas as well as being transported overseas to cotton growing areas in other countries. Included in the procedure is the fumigation of baled cotton with methyl bromide prior to shipment. Methyl bromide may not be available as a fumigant in the near future and the fumigation process is expensive. Research was done at the USDA, ARS, Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory to determine the actual re-infestation risk from live boll weevils processed through the normal cotton ginning and baling systems in the United States. Two tests were done: 1) a gin process survival test, and 2) a bale compression survival test. No weevils survived processing through a saw gin stand and one saw-type lint cleaner. In addition, most weevils were immediately killed at compressions of 352.4 kg/m3 (22 lb/ft3) and higher in the bale press. There were also no survivors after six days at the specified UD bale density of 448.5 kg/m3 (28 lb/ft3). Test results showed it was extremely unlikely that a live boll weevil could survive both gin processing and bale compression. 3ainsect pests 3acotton ginning 3alint cotton 3aAnthonomus grandis grandis 3amechanical damage 3amortality 0acotton 0aprocessing technology 0acotton baling 0acotton bale compression1 aArmijo, C.B.1 aStaten, R.T.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2006 Jan., v.  22, no.  1 p.45-50wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/16003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070731b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/11/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03049naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001800139245008700157300001800244500002400262520163900286650001501925650001801940650001501958650000901973650001901982650001602001650001702017650002002034650003002054650002702084650001302111650001502124650001502139653002102154700001502175700001802190700001502208700001802223700001602241773008202257852000902339856011102348930003302459945002502492946001302517961001302530655001202543IND4374119020221119082222.0050909e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437411902DNAL7 a10113/55192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aVanotti, M.B.10aSolid-liquid separation of swine manure with polymer treatment and sand filtration  ap. 1567-1574.  aIncludes references  aSmall particles typical of liquid swine manure often clog sand filter beds and fine filters. We evaluated the effectiveness of polymer flocculants to improve drainage and filtration performance of sand filter beds by increasing the particle size of manure. A pilot separation unit was evaluated at the Swine Unit of the NCSU Lake Wheeler Road Laboratory in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 40 consecutive cycles during a 20-month period. The unit consisted of a homogenization tank that mixed the flushed swine manure, an in-line polymer mixer, and two sand filter beds (29.7 m2) designed to receive 30.5 cm (1 ft) depth of the polymer-treated effluent. Flocculation treatment using polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer improved drainage characteristics of the sand filter by preventing clogging and surface sealing. The combination of flocculation and filtration treatment removed 97% of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS), 85% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and 83% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the flushed manure. Along with the solids, treatment resulted in capture of 61% total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and 72% total phosphorus (TP). Most of the nutrients removed in the solids were organic forms. Drying time to produce removable cakes varied significantly with the loading rate of solids applied to the sand filter bed. A load of <2 kg TSS m(-2) per drying cycle allowed completion of the drying cycle in about 8 days, which is desirable to reduce potential fly problems. Our results indicate that PAM flocculation enhances performance of dewatering sand filter beds for swine manure applications. 3apig manure 3aliquid manure 3afiltration 3asand 3apolyacrylamide 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3amanure handling 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3adewatering 0asand filter beds1 aRice, J.M.1 aEllison, A.Q.1 aHunt, P.G.1 aHumenik, F.J.1 aBaird, C.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v.  48, no.  4 p.1567-1574x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/55193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071022b20071102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03542naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111024002000140040001800160072000900178072000900187100001600196245009200212300001600304500002400320520203300344650002102377650001802398650002402416650001602440650001502456650001402471650001502485650001202500650002502512650004602537650002102583650000902604650002302613650002402636700001802660773007502678852000902753856007902762856011102841930003302952945002502985946001303010961001303023655001203036IND4372365520221120093617.0050718e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236552DNAL7 a157829212pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.4942doi7 a10113/41032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX100 0aL6001 aRoush, W.B.12aA comparison of fitting growth models with a genetic algorithm and nonlinear regression  ap. 494-502.  aIncludes references  aA genetic algorithm (GA), an optimization procedure based on the theory of evolution, was compared with nonlinear regression for the ability of the 2 algorithms to fit the coefficients of poultry growth models. It was hypothesized that the nonlinear approach of using GA to define the parameters of growth equations would better fit the growth equations than the use of nonlinear regression. Two sets of growth data from the literature, consisting of male broiler BW grown for 168 and 170 d, were used in the study. The growth data were fit to 2 forms of the logistic model, the Gompertz, the Gompertz-Laird, and the saturated kinetic models using the SAS nonlinear algorithm (NLIN) procedure and a GA. There were no statistical differences for the comparison of the residuals (the difference between observed and predicted BWs) of growth models fit by a GA or nonlinear regression. The plotted residuals for the nonlinear regression and GA-determined growth values confirmed observations of others that the residuals have oscillations resembling sine waves that are not represented by the growth models. It was found that GA could successfully determine the coefficients of growth equations. A disadvantage of slowness in converging to the solution was found for the GA. The advantage of GA over traditional nonlinear regression is that only ranges need be specified for the parameters of the growth equations, whereas estimates of the coefficients need to be determined, and in some programs the derivatives of the growth equations need to be identified. Depending on the goal of the research, solving multivariable complex functions with an algorithm that considers several solutions at the same time in an evolutionary mode can be considered an advantage especially where there is a chance for the solution to converge on a local optimum when a global optimum is desired. It was concluded that the fitting of the growth equations was not so much a problem with the fitting methodology as it is with the form of the equation. 3abroiler chickens 3aanimal growth 3amathematical models 3abody weight 3aalgorithms 3aequations 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGrowthxgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aRegression Analysis1 aBranton, S.L.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v.  84, no.  3 p.494-502x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.4943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/41033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02812naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100002000167245016300187300001600350500005500366500002400421500001500445520120900460650002101669650001101690650001701701650002301718650002101741650002301762650001501785650001501800650002001815650002301835650001901858651002901877651001601906653001601922700001601938700001701954700001801971773007601989852000902065856011202074930003302186945002502219946001302244961001302257655001202270IND4406649720221122062313.0080611s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND440664972DNAL7 a10113/160012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aF9001 aSnodgrass, G.L.10aSuppression of tarnished plant bugs in cotton by treatment of early season wild host plants with herbicides in nine-square-mile areas of the Mississippi Delta  ap. 933-936.  aConference held January 6-10, 2003, Nashville, TN.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aBroadleaf weeds found in marginal areas by fields, roads, and ditches were controlled with the herbicides Trimec or Strike 3 in nine-square-mile areas of the Mississippi Delta in March or April of 1999, 2000, and 2001.

Cotton fields in the treated areas and in untreated nine-square-mile areas were sampled for tarnished plant bugs weekly during June and July of all three years. Overall mean numbers of tarnished plant bug adults and nymphs were significantly lower in cotton in the treated areas. The average reduction in overall mean numbers of plant bugs was 45.5 and 47% for adults and nymphs, respectively, for the three-year period. Grower costs for insecticides used to control plant bugs were lower in cotton in the treated test sites in all three years. Elimination of broadleaf weeds was found to be an effective method for reducing numbers of plant bugs in cotton. However, it did not reduce numbers of tarnished plant bugs in any year to a level in cotton where additional control with insecticides was not needed. 3aLygus lineolaris 3acotton 3aweed control 3aapplication timing 3acultural control 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aherbicides 3aweed hosts 3abroadleaf weeds 3apopulation density 3ainsect control 3aMississippi Delta region 3aMississippi 0ahost plants1 aScott, W.P.1 aHardee, D.D.1 aRobbins, J.T.0 tProceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences.g2003,  p.933-9367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/160013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080618b20080704c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/06/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02763naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001500131245011000146300001600256500002400272500001500296520110000311650001401411650001101425650001901436650001701455650001801472650002401490650001801514650001501532650001401547650003301561650001001594650002601604650001601630650001001646650001901656650002001675650001401695650001401709650001001723653002901733653002801762653001501790700001801805700001401823700001701837700001701854773009401871856011201965956010202077961000902179852000902188655001202197IND4364559920221119120908.0040920e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436455992DNAL7 a10113/591272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitt, W.M.10aPlectosporium alismatis comb. nov. a new placement for the Alismataceae pathogen Rhynchosporium alismatis  ap. 775-780.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe phytopathogen Rhynchosporium alismatis, occurring on Alisma, Sagittaria and other genera in the Alismataceae, is under investigation as a mycoherbicide for alismataceous weeds in Australian rice crops.

Analysis of ITS sequences revealed close relationships between R. alismatis and the teleomorph genus Plectosphaerella, as well as several anamorphic fungi which were primarily species of Verticillium. Rhynchosporium alismatis and Plectosphaerella cucumerina clustered together with 98 % bootstrap support. Morphological comparisons supported this relationship indicating that R. alismatis and the anamorphic genus Plectosporium are congeneric. Rhynchosporium alismatis is transferred to Plectosporium, a name proposed for conservation. 3aanamorphs 3aAlisma 3aRhynchosporium 3aVerticillium 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomic revisions 3aribosomal DNA 3aSagittaria 3aphylogeny 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3agenes 3amolecular systematics 3ateleomorphs 3aweeds 3amycoherbicides 3anew combination 3adatabases 3apathogens 3afungi 0aRhynchosporium alismatis 0aPlectosporium alismatis 0aHelotiales1 aGoodwin, S.B.1 aAsh, G.J.1 aCother, N.J.1 aCother, E.J.0 tMycological research.g2004 July, v. 108, no. 7 p.775-780wJournal:21715x0953-75627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/591273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/115639_Log_151011_Pitt_et_al_2004.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04346naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024001900131024002100150040001800171100001400189245010300203300001800306500002400324500001500348520207400363650001802437650002302455650003002478650001502508650002502523650000702548650003702555650001502592650002202607650001302629650001602642650002002658650002702678650001102705650001402716650002802730650001202758650001802770650001802788650004902806650002302855650002302878650001602901650001302917650002402930650003102954650002502985650004903010650001903059650001503078653001303093653001603106653001203122700001403134700001703148700002203165700001703187773010403204852000903308856011203317856008903429930003303518945001303551946001103564961001303575655001203588IND2332718020221120143011.0030522e200211  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233271802DNAL7 a10.1016/S0965-1748(02)00068-12doi7 a125302152pmid7 a10113/132662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.10aSite-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis of an active site tryptophan of insect chitinase  ap. 1477-1488.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aChitinase is an enzyme used by insects to degrade the structural polysaccharide, chitin, during the molting process. Tryptophan 145 (W145) of Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) chitinase is a highly conserved residue found within a second conserved region of family 18 chitinases. It is located between aspartate 144 (D144) and glutamate 146 (E146), which are putative catalytic residues. The role of the active site residue, W145, in M. sexta chitinase catalysis was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. W145 was mutated to phenylalanine (F), tyrosine (Y), isoleucine (I), histidine (H), and glycine (G). Wild-type and mutant forms of M. sexta chitinases were expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell line system. The chitinases secreted into the medium were purified and characterized by analyzing their catalytic activity and substrate or inhibitor binding properties. The wild-type chitinase was most active in the alkaline pH range. Several of the mutations resulted in a narrowing of the range of pH over which the enzyme hydrolyzed the polymeric substrate, CM-Chitin-RBV, predominantly on the alkaline side of the pH optimum curve. The range was reduced by about 1 pH unit for W145I and W145Y and by about 2 units for W145H and W145F. The W145G mutation was inactive. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of W145 appears to be critical for maintaining an abnormal pK(a) of a catalytic residue, which extends the activity further into the alkaline range. All of the mutant enzymes bound to chitin, suggesting that W145 was not essential for binding to chitin. However, the small difference in K(m)'s of mutated enzymes compared to K(m) values of the wild-type chitinase towards both the oligomeric and polymeric substrates suggested that W145 is not essential for substrate binding but probably influences the ionization of a catalytically important group(s). The variations in k(cat)'s among the mutated enzymes and the IC50 for the transition state inhibitor analog, allosamidin, indicate that W145 also influences formation of the transition state during catalysis. 3aManduca sexta 3acatalytic activity 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atryptophan 3aamino acid sequences 3apH 3astructure-activity relationships 3ahydrolysis 3aspectral analysis 3akinetics 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3amolecular conformation 3achitin 3achitinase 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aChitinasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCircular Dichroism 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aKinetics 2aManducaxenzymology 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aProtein Conformation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aThermodynamics 2aTryptophan 0amutation 0aallosamidin 0abinding1 aHuang, X.1 aFukamizo, T.1 aMuthukrishnan, S.1 aKramer, K.J.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2002 Nov., v.  32, no.  11 p.1477-1488x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0965-1748(02)00068-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03271naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100002400175245007900199300001600278500002400294500001500318520181800333650002302151650001902174650000902193650002202202650001202224650001502236650001002251651001302261653001802274653002602292653002602318653002202344653002002366653001402386773009902400852000902499856008502508856011202593930003302705945002502738946001302763961001302776655001202789IND4438511320221118230331.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443851132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-010-9469-y2doi7 a10113/440782hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB2001 aAugustine, David J.10aSpatial versus temporal variation in precipitation in a semiarid ecosystem  ap. 913-925.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpatial and temporal variations in precipitation are central features of semiarid ecosystems, influencing patterns of plant productivity and the distribution of native fauna. Although temporal variation in precipitation has been studied extensively, far less is known about the spatial scale and pattern of precipitation variability in semiarid regions. I used long-term precipitation records to examine spatial variation across the 63 km² Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado, and across the 117,000 km² region of shortgrass steppe in eastern Colorado. Relative to temporal variation, spatial variation was low at scales <10 km, increased linearly across scales of 40-120 km, and was nearly equal in magnitude to temporal variation across distances of 120-160 km. Although I hypothesized that most spatial variation would be generated by early-summer convective thunderstorms in June, I found that the magnitude and spatial pattern of variation was similar for precipitation received in June compared to cumulative precipitation received during the full growing season. The degree of spatial autocorrelation in precipitation across all distances that I evaluated was similar for drought, dry, above-average and wet years. Across distances of 10-120 km, spatial variation within a single growing season was approximately two times greater than spatial variation in long-term mean growing-season precipitation, indicating spatial shifting in the locations of patches of high and low precipitation over multiple years. Overall, these findings suggest spatial variation at scales of 10-160 km may have been an important factor influencing vegetation patterns and migratory fauna of the shortgrass steppe, and have implications for livestock producers and future assessments of climate change. 3atemporal variation 3asemiarid zones 3arain 3aspatial variation 3asteppes 3aecosystems 3abison 3aColorado 0aprecipitation 0aSpatiotemporal mosaic 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aShortgrass steppe 0aGrassland birds 0aMigration0 tLandscape ecology.g2010 July, v.  25, no.  6 p.913-925dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-010-9469-y3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03341naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072001700162072001700179100002000196245010100216300001600317500002400333500001500357520166000372650002902032650002802061650002602089650002802115650001202143650001902155650002302174650001902197650001902216650002602235650002402261650002502285653002902310700001802339700002202357700001802379700002002397773010802417852000902525856008102534856011202615930003302727945002502760946001302785961001302798655001202811IND4459238820221118032900.0110622e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445923882DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2010.07342doi7 a10113/495562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Attachment of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on new or rusty spinach harvester blades immersed in spinach extract or 10% tryptic soy broth (TSB) was investigated. Bacteriophages specific for E. coli O157:H7 were evaluated to kill cells attached to blade. A cocktail of five nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli O157:H7 isolates was transferred to 25 mL of spinach extract or 10% TSB. A piece of sterilized spinach harvester blade (2 × 1") was placed in above spinach extract or 10% TSB and incubated at room (22°C) or dynamic (30°C day, 20°C night) temperatures. E. coli O157:H7 populations attached to blade during incubation in spinach extract or 10% TSB were determined. When inoculated at 1 log CFU/mL, E. coli O157:H7 attachment to blades after 24 and 48 h incubation at dynamic temperature (6.09 and 6.37 log CFU/mL) was significantly higher than when incubated at 22°C (4.84 and 5.68 log CFU/mL), respectively. After 48 h incubation, two blades were sprayed on each side with a cocktail of E. coli O157–specific bacteriophages before scraping the blade, and subsequent plating on Sorbitol MacConkey media–nalidixic acid. Application of bacteriophages reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations by 4.5 log CFU on blades after 2 h of phage treatment. Our study demonstrates that E. coli O157:H7 can attach to and proliferate on spinach harvester blades under static and dynamic temperature conditions, and bacteriophages are able to reduce E. coli O157:H7 populations adhered to blades. 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial contamination 3aantibiotic resistance 3apostharvest food safety 3aspinach 3analidixic acid 3abacterial adhesion 3abacteriophages 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aon-farm food safety 3avegetable harvesters 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aSharma, Manan1 aMillner, Patricia1 aCalaway, Todd1 aSingh, Manpreet0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2011 Apr., v.  8, no.  4 p.541-546wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2010.07343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/495563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110801b20110805c00000000  aINDdPNNe2011/07/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02918naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141072000900159100002000168245015100188300001800339500002400357500001500381520134700396650002501743650001601768650001101784650002601795650001701821650002701838650002201865650001401887650001901901650002201920650001501942650001401957650002301971650001501994650002202009653001602031773008202047856011202129856007802241930003302319945002502352946001302377961001302390852000902403655001202412IND4459252020221118032706.0110623e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445925202DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ee01047f2doi7 a10113/495572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP1201 aMoser, Bryan R.10aComplementary blending of meadowfoam seed oil methyl esters with biodiesel prepared from soybean and waste cooking oils to enhance fuel properties  ap. 2160-2167.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe complementary blending of cold-pressed meadowfoam seed oil methyl esters (MFME) with soybean and waste cooking oil methyl esters (SME and WCME) was investigated. MFME prepared from cold-pressed meadowfoam oil exhibited an exceptionally high induction period (IP) of 66.2 h whereas SME and WCME yielded considerably lower values of 5.9 and 4.5 h, respectively. The kinematic viscosities (KVs) of SME and WCME were within the prescribed ranges in the biodiesel standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214) but MFME was not due to its content of unique longer-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, the iodine value (IV) of SME was in excess of the maximum limit specified in EN 14214 whereas MFME and WCME were not. Lastly, the cold flow properties of MFME were superior to those of SME and WCME. Complementary blends of MFME-SME and MFME-WCME ameliorated deficiencies of the individual fuels. Blends containing 20–30 vol % MFME in WCME provided IPs, KVs and IVs within the limits prescribed in both ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. With respect to MFME-SME blends, those containing 30–50% MFME complied with the specifications of both biodiesel standards. In addition, highly linear correlations between percentage of MFME and fuel properties were established. Furthermore, the influence of storage for 90 days on fuel properties of the blends was determined. 3astandards and grades 3asoybean oil 3amixing 3acooking fats and oils 3aiodine value 3along chain fatty acids 3awaste utilization 3aoil crops 3ameadowfoam oil 3afatty acid esters 3akinematics 3abiodiesel 3abioenergy industry 3afood waste 3aalternative fuels 0afood wastes0 tEnergy and environmental science.g2011 June, v.  4, no.  6 p.2160-21677nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/495573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ee01047f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110727b20110805c00000000  aINDdPNNe2011/07/25  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003800113040001800151100001900169245010100188300001400289520112600303592002801429650001801457650001401475650001801489650003201507650002001539650002501559650001401584650000901598650000901607650002401616700002001640700002201660700002401682773011801706852000901824856005101833856011201884961001301996655001202009IND4417287720221117203315.0130416e20090315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441728772DNAL7 a10113/285502hdl7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.10.2912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEntrican, Gary12aA current perspective on availability of tools, resources and networks for veterinary immunology  ap. 24-29.  aThere are many diseases of fish, livestock and companion animals that impact negatively on animal health, welfare and productivity and for which there are no effective vaccines. The development of new vaccines is reliant on the availability of well-characterised immunological tools and reagents to understand host–pathogen interactions and identify protective immune responses. Veterinary immunology has always lagged behind mouse and human immunology in terms of development and availability of tools and reagents. However, several initiatives are underway to address this. The Veterinary Immunology Committee (VIC) Toolkit was initiated 6years ago at the sixth International Veterinary Immunology Symposium (IVIS) in Uppsala and in the intervening period there have been several notable developments that have advanced reagent development and information exchange. This review will discuss advances in veterinary reagent development, networks, databases and commercial availability with particular reference to the second VIC Toolkit workshop held at the eighth IVIS in Ouro Preto, Brazil on the 15th of August 2007.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3adatabases 3afish diseases 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmune response 3ainformation exchange 3alivestock 3amice 3apets 3avaccine development1 aLunney, Joan K.1 aRutten, Victor P.1 aBaldwin, Cynthia L.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2009 Mar. 15, v. 128, no. 1-3 p.24-29dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.10.29140uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/285503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02013naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001800148245010200166500002400268520083000292650001001122650001401132650002201146650001401168650001501182650002101197650001501218650001101233650001601244650001201260650000901272651001801281773009601299852000901395856011101404930003301515945002501548946000901573961000901582655001201591IND4397046320221123042431.0071024e20011204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439704632DNAL7 a10113/63172hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aD5001 aAnthony, W.S.10aMethod and apparatus for separating elastomeric particulates and fibers from a pulverized mixture  aIncludes references  aA method and apparatus for separating elastomeric particulates from a pulverized mixture wherein a first separator assembly separates out substantially clean fiber and passes non-fibrous particulates and residual fiber to a second separator assembly that separates out substantially clean non-fibrous particulates.

Tests of column compression strength simulate the expected performance loads from appliances stacked in warehouses. Column strength depends on tube geometry, paper properties, basis weight, and number of laminations. A column strength model considers the tube geometry to be a sequence of geometric flat and arched segments with each segment apt to fail by either buckling or compression. Contributions of segments to strength depend on respective failure modes and are appropriately summed. The principles of our derived model provide insight into the optimum paper properties and number of laminations in the selection and design of tubular posts. 3apaper 3apackaging materials 3astrength (mechanics) 3acompressibility 0acompression strength 0atubular packaging forms 0aappliance packaging forms1 aLee, S.K.1 aJohnson, C.G.0 tJournal of testing and evaluation.g2006 Nov., v.  34, no.  6 p.1-7x0090-39737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE1000303Available from publisher's Web site  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/11/20  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03606naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245009800155300001600253500002400269500001500293520189100308650003302199650001202232650001202244650001302256650001602269650002702285650001102312650000902323650002902332650002402361650004302385650002302428650001402451650001702465650001302482650001802495653002702513653001702540653001702557653004002574700001302614700002302627700002002650700002302670700002002693700001702713773006902730852000902799856011202808930003302920945002502953946001302978961001302991655001203004IND4435389320221119095301.0100415s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443538932DNAL7 a10113/410212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP1201 aWang, Ping10aEffect of Endosperm Hardness on an Ethanol Process Using a Granular Starch Hydrolyzing Enzyme  ap. 307-312.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aGranular starch hydrolyzing enzymes (GSHE) can hydrolyze starch at low temperature (32°C). The dry grind process using GSHE (GSH process) has fewer unit operations and no changes in process conditions (pH 4.0 and 32°C) compared to the conventional process because it dispenses with the cooking and liquefaction step. In this study, the effects of endosperm hardness, protease, urea, and GSHE levels on GSH process were evaluated. Ground corn, soft endosperm, and hard endosperm were processed using two GSHE levels (0.1 and 0.4 mL per 100 g ground material) and four treatments of protease and urea addition. Soft and hard endosperm materials were obtained by grinding and sifting flaking grits from a dry milling pilot plant; classifications were confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. During 72 h of simultaneous granular starch hydrolysis and fermentation (GSHF), ethanol and glucose profiles were determined using HPLC. Soft endosperm resulted in higher final ethanol concentrations compared to ground corn or hard endosperm. Addition of urea increased final ethanol concentrations for soft and hard endosperm. Protease addition increased ethanol concentrations and fermentation rates for soft endosperm, hard endosperm, and ground corn. The effect of protease addition on ethanol concentrations and fermentation rates was most predominant for soft endosperm, less for hard endosperm, and least for ground corn. Samples (soft endosperm, hard endosperm, or corn) with protease resulted in higher (1.0% to 10.5% v/v) ethanol concentration compared to samples with urea. The GSH process with protease requires little or no urea addition. For fermentation of soft endosperm, GSHE dose can be reduced. Due to nutrients (lipids, minerals, and soluble proteins) present in corn that enhance yeast growth, ground corn fermented faster at the beginning than hard and soft endosperm. 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aethanol 3aglucose 3ahardness 3aproteinases 3aalcoholic fermentation 3ayeasts 3acorn 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aethanol production 3aendosperm 3apretreatment 3agrinding 3aalpha-amylase 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0adry grinding 0aglycosidases 0agranular starch hydrolyzing enzymes1 aLiu, Wei1 aJohnston, David B.1 aRausch, Kent D.1 aSchmidt, Shelly J.1 aTumbleson, M.E.1 aSingh, Vijay0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010, v.  53, no.  1 p.307-3127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/410213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100429b20100501c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/29  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03601naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001700159245010100176300001800277500002400295520163200319650001101951650001801962650001601980650001701996650002202013650001602035650002902051650002102080650002802101650003302129650001702162650001902179650002502198650000802223650001002231650001002241650006102251650000902312650001102321650001202332650001102344650005502355650001802410650000902428650001602437650001702453650001802470650001702488650001702505650006002522700002102582700001902603773010002622852000902722856011202731930003302843945002502876946001302901961001302914655001202927IND4365709420221119100435.0041119e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436570942DNAL7 a155316642pmid7 a10113/411802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aBehall, K.M.10aDiets containing barley significantly reduce lipids in mildly hypercholesterolemic men and women  ap. 1185-1193.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Barley has high amounts of soluble fiber but is not extensively consumed in the US diet. Objective: This study investigated whether consumption of barley would reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors comparably with that of other sources of soluble fiber. Design: Mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects (9 postmenopausal women, 9 premenopausal women, and 7 men) consumed controlled American Heart Association Step 1 diets for 17 wk. After a 2-wk adaptation period, whole-grain foods containing 0, 3, or 6 g beta-glucan/d from barley were included in the Step 1 diet menus. Diets were consumed for 5 wk each and were fed in a Latin-square design. Fasting blood samples were collected twice weekly. Results: Total cholesterol was significantly lower when the diet contained 3 or 6 g beta-glucan/d from barley than when it contained no beta-glucan; the greatest change occurred in the men and postmenopausal women. HDL and triacylglycerol concentrations did not differ with the 3 amounts of dietary beta-glucan. Large LDL and small VLDL fractions and mean LDL particle size significantly decreased when whole grains were incorporated into the 3 diets. Large LDL and large and intermediate HDL fractions were significantly higher, mean LDL particle size was significantly greater, and intermediate VLDL fractions were significantly lower in the postmenopausal women than in the other 2 groups. A group-by-diet interaction effect was observed on LDL fractions and small LDL particle size. Conclusion: The addition of barley to a healthy diet may be effective in lowering total and LDL cholesterol in both men and women. 3abarley 3adietary fiber 3afood intake 3abeta-glucans 3awhole grain foods 3acholesterol 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3atriacylglycerols 3alow density lipoprotein 3avery low density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3alipemic effect 3ahypercholesterolemia 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHordeum 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytotherapy 2aPostmenopause 2aPremenopause 2aRisk Factors 2abeta-Glucansxadministration & dosagexadverse effects.1 aScholfield, D.J.1 aHallfrisch, J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Nov., v.  80, no.  5 p.1185-1193x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/411803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100505b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03344naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201072000900210100001700219245014000236300001600376500002400392520178400416650001702200650000902217650002302226650003002249650001902279650001502298650002802313650002702341700002202368700002202390700002502412700001902437773011102456852000902567856009202576856011202668930003302780945002502813946001102838961001302849655001202862IND4383317520221119094809.0060903e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438331752DNAL7 a205074562pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2006.00350.x2doi7 a10113/300082hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF8311 aLee, Joohyun10aProteomic and genetic approaches to identifying defence-related proteins in rice challenged with the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani  ap. 405-416.  aIncludes references  aSheath blight, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is a major disease of rice world-wide, but little is known about the host response to infection. The objective of this study was to identify proteins and DNA markers in resistant and susceptible rice associated with response to infection by R. solani. Replicated two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments were conducted to detect proteins differentially expressed under inoculated and non-inoculated conditions. Tandem mass spectra analysis using electrospray ionization quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI Q-TOF MS) was carried out for protein identification with the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Seven proteins were increased after inoculation in both susceptible and resistant plants. Six of the seven proteins were identified with presumed antifungal, photosynthetic and proteolytic activities. An additional 14 proteins were detected in the response of the resistant line. Eleven of the 14 proteins were identified with presumed functions relating to antifungal activity, signal transduction, energy metabolism, photosynthesis, molecular chaperone, proteolysis and antioxidation. The induction of 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase was detected for the first time in resistant rice plants after pathogen challenge, suggesting a defensive role of this enzyme in rice against attack by R. solani. The chromosomal locations of four induced proteins were found to be in close physical proximity to genetic markers for sheath blight resistance in two genetic mapping populations. The proteomic and genetic results from this study indicate a complex response of rice to challenge by R. solani that involves simultaneous induction of proteins from multiple defence pathways. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3adisease resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant proteins 3aproteomics 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aplant pathogenic fungi1 aBricker, Terry M.1 aLeFevre, Michael.1 aPinson, Shannon R.M.1 aOard, James H.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2006 Sept., v.  7, no.  5 p.405-416dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2006.00350.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/300083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/06/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03579naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024001900131024002100150040001800171100001200189245007100201300001800272500002400290500001500314520146500329650001601794650002501810650002201835650001801857650002501875650002001900650000701920650001501927650001301942650002201955650002001977650001101997650001402008650001202022650002302034650003802057650001802095650003102113650001302144650002402157650001602181650002002197650004402217650002802261650001602289653002802305653001802333653001402351653002402365653001202389700001402401700001702415700002202432700001702454773010602471852000902577856011202586856008902698930003302787945001302820946001102833961001302844655001202857IND2324898620221120163741.0020118e20011101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232489862DNAL7 a10.1016/S0965-1748(01)00070-42doi7 a115839352pmid7 a10113/132602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, X.10aProperties of Manduca sexta chitinase and its C-terminal deletions  ap. 1221-1230.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aManduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) chitinase is a molting enzyme that contains several domains including a catalytic domain, a serine/threonine-rich region, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Previously we showed that this chitinase acts as a biopesticide in transgenic plants where it disrupts gut physiology. To delineate the role of these domains further and to identify and characterize some of the multiple forms produced in molting fluid and in transgenic plants, three different forms with variable lengths of C-terminal deletions were generated. Appropriately truncated forms of the M. sexta chitinase cDNA were generated, introduced into a baculovirus vector, and expressed in insect cells. Two of the truncated chitinases (Chi 1-407 and Chi 1-477) were secreted into the medium, whereas the one with the longest deletion (Chi 1-376) was retained inside the insect cells. The two larger truncated chitinases and the full-length enzyme (Chi 1-535) were purified and their properties were compared. Differences in carbohydrate compositions, pH-activity profiles, and kinetic constants were observed among the different forms of chitinases. All three of these chitinases had some affinity for chitin, and they also exhibited differences in their ability to hydrolyze colloidal chitin. The results support the hypothesis that multiple forms of this enzyme occur in vivo due to proteolytic processing at the C-terminal end and differential glycosylation. 3atemperature 3achemical composition 3acomplementary DNA 3aManduca sexta 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3aprotein secretion 3aenzyme activity 3achitin 3achitinase 2aAnimals 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlycosylation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aManducaxenzymology 2aMutagenesis 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aTemperature 0achitinase glycosylation 0acarbohydrates 0adeletions 0atruncated chitinase 0abinding1 aZhang, H.1 aFukamizo, T.1 aMuthukrishnan, S.1 aKramer, K.J.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2001 Nov. 1, v.  31, no.  12 p.1221-1230x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0965-1748(01)00070-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03649naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140100001700158245009900175300001800274500002400292520185600316650002102172650001502193650002302208650001602231650001702247650001902264650002002283650001002303650001702313650003102330650001302361650000902374650002402383650001602407650000702423650003902430650001302469650004802482650002002530650001402550650000902564650002502573653002502598700001602623700002002639700002002659773010502679856007702784856011202861956008002973961000903053852000903062655001203071IND4362022420221119121023.0040412e20040310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436202242DNAL7 a10.1021/jf034397c2doi7 a10113/591232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, V.D.10aCross-linking and rheological changes of whey proteins treated with microbial transglutaminase  ap. 1170-1176.  aIncludes references  aModification of the functionality of whey proteins using microbial transglutaminase (TGase) has been the subject of recent studies. However, changes in rheological properties of whey proteins as affected by extensive cross-linking with TGase are not well studied. The factors affecting cross-linking of whey protein isolate (WPI) using both soluble and immobilized TGase were examined, and the rheological properties of the modified proteins were characterized. The enzyme was immobilized on aminopropyl glass beads (CPG-3000) by selective adsorption of the biotinylated enzyme on avidin that had been previously immobilized. WPI (4 and 8% w/w) in deionized water, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM dithiothreitol was cross-linked using enzyme/substrate ratios of 0.12-10 units of activity/g WPI. The reaction was carried out in a jacketed bioreactor for 8 h at 40°C with continuous circulation. The gel point temperature of WPI solutions treated with 0.12 unit of immobilized TGase/g was slightly decreased, but the gel strength was unaffected. However, increasing the enzyme/substrate ratio resulted in extensive cross-linking of WPI that was manifested by increases in apparent viscosity and changes in the gelation properties. For example, using 10 units of soluble TGase/g resulted in extensive cross-linking of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin in WPI, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting results. Interestingly, the gelling point of WPI solutions increased from 68 to 94°C after a 4-h reaction, and the gel strength was drastically decreased (lower storage modulus, G'). Thus, extensive intra- and interchain cross-linking probably caused formation of polymers that were too large for effective network development. These results suggest that a process could be developed to produce heat-stable whey proteins for various food applications. 3aWestern blotting 3aadsorption 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abioreactors 3acrosslinking 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3afoods 3agel strength 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3agels 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alactalbumin 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymers 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3astorage modulus 3aviscosity 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate 0awhey protein isolate1 aClare, D.A.1 aCatignani, G.L.1 aSwaisgood, H.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Mar. 10, v. 52, no. 5 p.1170-1176x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034397c3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/591233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/112660_S115.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072000900186072000900195100001500204245007900219300001600298500002400314500001500338520092300353650002301276650002701299650002301326650001001349650002601359650002701385650001201412650002301424650003501447650007301482650005201555650002401607650001101631650001101642650000901653650001501662650001201677650001301689651001401702651002901716653002901745653001401774700001501788700001701803700001901820773008801839852000901927856008601936856011202022930003302134945002502167946001302192961001302205655001202218IND4371828020221118230347.0050628e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437182802DNAL7 a153628432pmid7 a10.7589/0090-3558-40.2.3612doi7 a10113/440752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aL8321 aDunn, J.R.10aPrevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in white-tailed deer from Louisiana  ap. 361-365.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEscherichia coli O157:H7 (EC O157) is an important zoonosis. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been implicated in transmission of this bacterium to humans and have been suggested as reservoirs that might affect carriage in cattle populations. Our study objectives were to estimate prevalence of EC O157 in feces of hunter-harvested deer and to describe fecal shedding patterns in a captive herd sampled over 1 yr. Prevalence of EC O157 in hunter-harvested deer was 0.3% (n5338). In August 2001, EC O157 was detected in one of 55 deer (1.8%) from the captive herd. Prevalence over the 1-yr period was 0.4% (n5226). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was rarely isolated from hunter-harvested deer during the winter. We could not describe a seasonal shedding pattern based on one positive sample in the captive herd. These data do not support a prominent role of deer as a reservoir for EC O157 for cattle or humans. 3adisease reservoirs 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adisease prevalence 3afeces 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aEscherichia infections 2aAnimals 2aDeerxmicrobiology 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aEscherichia coli O157xisolation & purification 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPrevalence 2aSeasons 2aZoonoses 3aLouisiana 0aLouisianaxepidemiology. 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aisolation1 aKeen, J.E.1 aMoreland, D.1 aThompson, R.A.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2004 Apr., v.  40, no.  2 p.361-365x0090-35587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-40.2.3613Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03903naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002000194245012100214300002000335500002400355500001500379520203700394650001902431650001502450650001202465650002102477650000802498650004902506650002302555650000902578650003202587650001702619650002602636650002402662650002502686650002202711650002402733650002102757650002202778650002802800650001402828653001502842700002502857700001602882773011202898852000903010856008603019856011203105930003303217945002503250946001303275961001303288655001203301IND4459039220221118032524.0110616e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445903922DNAL7 a10.1152/ajpcell.00042.20092doi7 a10113/495512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aHan, Chung-Ting10aInfluence of zinc deficiency on Akt-Mdm2-p53 and Akt-p21 signaling axes in normal and malignant human prostate cells  ap. C1188-C1199.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), a phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase-activated protein kinase, is highly expressed in prostate tumors. p-Akt can indirectly hinder p53-dependent growth suppression and apoptosis by phosphorylating Mdm2. Alternatively, p-Akt can directly phosphorylate p21 and restrict it to the cytoplasm for degradation. Because the prostate is the highest zinc-accumulating tissue before the onset of cancer, the effects of physiological levels of zinc on Akt-Mdm2-p53 and Akt-p21 signaling axes in human normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and malignant prostate LNCaP cells were examined in the present study. Cells were cultured for 6 days in low-zinc growth medium supplemented with 0 [zinc-deficient (ZD)], 4 [zinc-normal (ZN)], 16 [zinc-adequate (ZA)], or 32 [zinc-supplemented (ZS)] μM zinc. Zinc status of both cell types was altered in a dose-dependent manner, with LNCaP cells reaching a plateau at >16 μM zinc. For both cell types, p-Akt was higher in the ZD than in the ZN cells and was normalized to that of the ZN cells by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002. PTEN, an endogenous phosphatase targeting Akt dephosphorylation, was hyperphosphorylated (p-PTEN, inactive form) in ZD PrEC. Nuclear p-Mdm2 was raised, whereas nuclear p53 was depressed, by zinc deficiency in PrEC. Nuclear p21 and p53 were lowered by zinc deficiency in LNCaP cells. Higher percentages of ZD, ZA, and ZS than ZN LNCaP cells were found at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, with proportionally lower precentages at the S and G2/M phases. Hence, the increased p-PTEN in ZD PrEC would result in hyperphosphorylation of p-Akt and p-Mdm2, as well as reduction of nuclear p53 accumulation. For ZD LNCaP cells, Akt hyperphosphorylation was probably mediated through p21 phosphorylation and degradation, thus restricting p21 nuclear entry to induce cell cycle arrest. Thus zinc deficiency differentially modulated the Akt-Mdm2-p53 signaling axis in normal prostate cells vs. the Akt-p21 signaling axis in malignant prostate cells. 3acarcinogenesis 3ainterphase 3amitosis 3ahuman cell lines 3amen 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3anutritional status 3azinc 3adietary mineral supplements 3acell culture 3anutrient deficiencies 3asignal transduction 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aprostatic neoplasms 3adietary minerals 3adephosphorylation 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aapoptosis 0acell cycle1 aSchoene, Norberta W.1 aLei, Kai Y.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.

Duration of insect development was shorter and number of progeny produced was greater on cracked than on whole oats. Simulations based on data from the study showed that insect populations would reach the threshold level for treatment in 2-3 months of storage at 30 degrees C on cracked oats. Insect population development was slowest on the hulless cultivar Paul when the oat kernels were cracked. Simulations also indicated that all cultivars of whole oats tested could be stored for at least 1 yr at 30 degrees C without reaching the threshold for treatment when infested with these two species of insects, and insect populations would decrease over time on the cultivars Don, Jerry, Milton, NewDak, Otana, and Valley. Analyses of oat grain quality characteristics, including kernel weight, groat hardness, and groat composition, provided little insight into the mechanism of observed differences in insect development among cultivars. Hardness of the kernels (as indicated by % broken groats after dehulling) may be related to near immunity to these two species of insects in whole Otana. Steaming whole oats to inactivate hydrolytic enzymes in the trichomes of the pericarp did not increase susceptibility to these two species of insects, suggesting that enzymes in the trichomes were not responsible for insect population development being slower on whole oats than on cracked oats. Although we were unable to identify the factors that determined relative susceptibility in this study, the results will be useful for selecting commercial oat cultivars for planting that will be less susceptible to insect pests in storage and suggest that the economics of cleaning oats before storage to reduce insect population growth should be investigated. 3aoats 3acultivars 3astorage 3aCryptolestes pusillus 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3avarietal resistance 3abiological development 3apopulation growth 3achemical composition 3aresistance mechanisms 3aenzymes 3atrichomes 3asteaming 0aseed characteristics 0asimulation 0awhole grains 0awhole vs. cracked oats1 aDoehlert, D.C.1 aMcMullen, M.S.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2003, v.  39, no.  2 p.213-223x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-474X(01)00055-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002000120040001800140072000900158072000900167100001400176245010300190300001600293500002400309520135400333650003001687650001801717650002201735650001001757650002001767650001901787650001701806650001501823650001301838650002601851650002201877650001701899650001601916650003101932700001801963700001901981700001702000700001702017700001302034773007302047852000902120856007802129856011102207930003302318945002502351946001302376961001302389655001202402IND4373397720221121084032.0050818e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437339772DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-08532doi7 a10113/16812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF8211 aJiang, W.14aThe window of risk for emigration of Wheat streak mosaic virus varies with host eradication method  ap. 853-858.  aIncludes references  aThe wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella, the vector of Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), often survives the summer on volunteer wheat (Triticum aestivum) and may disperse from this “green bridge” in fall to newly planted winter wheat. Because some methods for managing volunteer wheat do not directly kill WCM, there is a window of risk for WCM and WSMV emigration after management has been applied. WCM survival in response to treatment of wheat by glyphosate, paraquat, stem cutting, and withholding water was measured in greenhouse experiments to determine how this window of risk for emigration varies with management. WCM populations on plants treated with paraquat or stem cutting decreased from the beginning of the sampling period. WCM populations on plants treated with glyphosate or that received no water increased up to 3 days after application and then decreased by 10 days after application. If glyphosate is used to manage volunteer wheat infested with WCM, it should be applied well before wheat is planted in fall. WCM in declining populations tended to be in an upright posture that could facilitate emigration via wind. The total green leaf area was strongly correlated with the number of WCM for treated plants and could be used in the field to predict the posttreatment survival of mites that pose a risk of emigration. 3aWheat streak mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3aAceria tosichella 3amites 3adisease vectors 3avector control 3amite control 3aglyphosate 3aparaquat 3apesticide application 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3ahost plants 3aintegrated pest management1 aGarrett, K.A.1 aPeterson, D.E.1 aHarvey, T.L.1 aBowden, R.L.1 aFang, L.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Aug., v.  89, no.  8 p.853-858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-08533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/16813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080603b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03005naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001900157245011100176300001600287500002400303520143800327650001001765650002801775650001501803650003801818650001501856650002401871650001401895650002201909650002001931650001801951650001801969650003301987650003302020650002002053650002302073650002102096651001602117653002602133700002702159773008802186852000902274856011102283930003302394945002502427946001102452961001202463655001202475IND4397906520221120075324.0071116e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439790652DNAL7 a10113/70302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK250 0aX1001 aBrandeis, T.J.10aEffects of Model Choice and Forest Structure on Inventory-Based Estimations of Puerto Rican Forest Biomass  ap. 250-268.  aIncludes references  a
Total aboveground live tree biomass in Puerto Rican lower montane wet, subtropical wet, subtropical moist and subtropical dry forests was estimated using data from two forest inventories and published regression equations. Multiple potentially-applicable published biomass models existed for some forested life zones, and their estimates tended to diverge with increasing tree diameter at breast height. Inventoried forests showed structural characteristics typical of secondary tropical forests and stand successional trends of increasing stem density from initial reversion to young closed forest, followed by a decrease in stem density and gradual increase in basal area and biomass as the stands developed. Stems with DBH < 10 cm contributed 9.9-50.9% of total aboveground biomass. When present, 50-90+ cm DBH trees greatly increased aboveground biomass values on individual plots, but these effects subsided when averaged over the forested landscape. Inherent variability in large-tree form combined with equations that extrapolate beyond the range of sampled trees impedes accurate aboveground biomass estimation for larger trees. Application of equations developed in areas that most closely match potential study sites should improve overall estimation accuracy of all forest stands, however, locally developed biomass equations are lacking for subtropical dry and perhaps subtropical moist forest life zones in Puerto Rico. 3atrees 3adry matter accumulation 3asubtropics 3atropical and subtropical forestry 3aestimation 3aregression analysis 3aequations 3asimulation models 3astand structure 3aforest stands 3astand density 3awet environmental conditions 3adry environmental conditions 3amontane forests 3astatistical models 3aforest inventory 3aPuerto Rico 0aRio Grande de Arecibo1 aSuarez Rozo, M. del R.0 tCaribbean journal of science.g2005 Aug., v.  41, no.  2 p.250-268x0008-64527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02695naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156100001600165245011000181300001600291500009800307500002400405520110000429650002001529650001201549650001701561650002601578650001001604650001801614650002001632650001301652650001401665650001101679650001001690650002401700650002001724700002401744700002001768700001601788700001601804773007901820852000901899856007501908856011201983930003302095945002502128946001102153961001302164655001202177IND4383851520221120115545.0060925s2006    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND438385152DNAL7 a10.1071/FP060652doi7 a10113/159752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aTesfaye, M.14aThe Affymetrix Medicago GeneChip array is applicable for transcript analysis of alfalfa (Medicago sativa)  ap. 783-788.  aIn the special issue: Legume Genomics and Genetics / edited by P.

We found that approximately 40-54% of the Medicago probes were detected in leaf or root samples of alfalfa or M. truncatula. Approximately 45-59% of the detected Medicago probes were called 'present' in all replicate GeneChips of Medicago species, indicating a considerable overlap in the number and type of Medicago probes detected between root and leaf organs. Nevertheless, gene expression differences between roots and leaf organs accounted for approximately 17% of the total variation, regardless of the Medicago species from which the samples were harvested. The result shows that the Medicago GeneChip is applicable for transcript analysis for both alfalfa and M. truncatula. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aforage crops 3amicroarray technology 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3agenomics 3aseedlings 3aleaves 3aroots 3aMedicago truncatula 3agenetic markers1 aSilverstein, K.A.T.1 aBucciarelli, B.1 aSamac, D.A.1 aVance, C.P.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2006, v.  33, no.  8 p.783-788x1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP060653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/159753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080616b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03444naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001800139245022300157300001600380500002400396500001500420520186400435650001902299650002302318650002302341650003002364650003302394650001602427650002602443650002302469650002002492650002702512650001302539650001402552650002002566651001502586653003402601653001702635700001602652773007802668852000902746856011102755930003302866945002502899946001302924961001302937655001202950IND4365176920221118144632.0041025e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436517692DNAL7 a10113/98022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aArthurs, S.P.10aField evaluation of commercial formulations of the codling moth granulovirus: persistence of activity and success of seasonal applications against natural infestations of coding moth in Pacific Northwest apple orchards  ap. 388-397.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInundative applications of the codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella L., granulovirus (CpGV), which target neonate larvae before or during initial entry into fruit, offer potential for selective control of this key pest. In field tests on apple we compared the persistence and efficacy of single applications of three CpGV products approved for organic orchards in North America. In addition, the success of repeated (2-14) applications of one product (Cyd-X) as a principal control measure for CM in apple orchards was monitored following operational use by cooperating growers at four separate locations. In the first study, an early season application of all products at label rates remained highly effective for the first 24 h (averaging 94% larval mortality relative to controls) and moderately effective after 72 h (averaging 71% mortality) during dry sunny conditions. Significant activity remained up to 14 days, suggesting prolonged survival of the virus in UV-protected locations, such as the calyx of fruit. A second application later in the season was slightly less effective. Data obtained from commercial sites provide circumstantial evidence for the effectiveness of well-timed CpGV applications against CM outbreaks. In all cases where first generation larvae were targeted beginning at egg hatch (approximately = to 250 degree days) and treated areas monitored (0.3-1.6 ha plots), fruit damage during the second larval generation was reduced or eliminated. Based on the number of live larvae recovered throughout the season, mortality rates remained high (80.3-100% across sites). The cumulative number of moths caught in pheromone-baited traps was reduced (66-94%) in the second flight. Data from tree bands placed to catch diapause-destined larvae indicated overwintering generations remained low in treated sites (< or = to 0.18 larvae/band). 3ainsect viruses 3aviral insecticides 3aapplication timing 3abiological control agents 3aCydia pomonella granulovirus 3acrop damage 3apesticide persistence 3apopulation density 3aMalus domestica 3apesticide formulations 3aspraying 3amortality 3aCydia pomonella 0aWashington 0ainundative biological control 0afruit damage1 aLacey, L.A.0 tBiological control.g2004 Nov., v.  31, no.  3 p.388-397x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/98023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080211b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03633naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002000141040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197100002800206245010700234300001800341500002400359520175900383650002102142650002302163650002302186650002302209650002502232650001002257650001302267650001202280650003602292650004602328650001302374650002402387650003802411650002102449650002602470650004302496650001302539700001502552700001802567700001602585700001802601700001902619700001902638773007802657852000902735856008002744856011102824930003302935945002502968946001302993961001303006655001203019IND4373922320221120112025.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437392232DNAL7 a162065742pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.14952doi7 a10113/38702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL200 0aL4001 aSolis de los Santos, F.10aHypobaric hypoxia in ascites resistant and susceptible broiler genetic lines influences gut morphology  ap. 1495-1498.  aIncludes references  aGenetic selection based on rapid growth rates, improved feed conversion, and increased body weights has led to a predisposition to ascites in broiler populations. Sire-family selection was applied to a commercial elite line to produce divergent lines of ascites-resistant (RES) and ascites-susceptible (SUS) broilers by the 8th generation. One objective of this research was to determine the effects of hypobaric hypoxia on gut morphology in these genetic lines. In two separate trials, pedigree broiler chickens were randomly assigned to cages in a hypobaric chamber (simulated 2,900 m above sea level) or a matching local altitude chamber (390 m above sea level). Ascites incidence was characterized by heart enlargement and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity. At the end of the study on d 42, all surviving birds were killed and evaluated for the presence of ascites and 2-cm sections from the duodenum and lower ileum were collected from 5 chickens per line, per altitude for each trial for morphometric analysis. At a high altitude, ascites incidence was lower in the RES line (20.9 and 3.7%) than in the SUS line (86.4 and 66.9%, Trials 1 and 2, respectively). No ascites was observed at a local altitude. Under hypoxic conditions, duodenum villus surface area was higher (P < 0.05) in the RES line (181.3 +/- 16.8 and 219 +/- 10.9 micrometer) compared with the SUS line (130.1 +/- 10.5 and 134.3 +/- 9.3 micrometer; Trials 1 and 2, respectively). No differences in ileum villus morphology were observed for any of the parameters measured. The reduced surface area in the duodenum of birds selected for ascites susceptibility suggests reduced enteric function and may provide clues as to why these birds have increased incidence of ascites. 3aline differences 3aselection criteria 3aselection response 3adisease resistance 3aatmospheric pressure 3avilli 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aHypoxiaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aAscitesxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aChickens 2aDuodenumxpathology 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aIleumxpathology 2aIntestinesxpathology 2aPoultry Diseasesxgeneticsxpathology. 2aPressure1 aTellez, G.1 aFarnell, M.B.1 aBalog, J.M.1 aAnthony, N.B.1 aPavlidis, H.O.1 aDonoghue, A.M.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v.  84, no.  9 p.1495-1498x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.14953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/38703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070926b20071002c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03389naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002400140245016100164300001400325500002400339520201400363650002702377650001702404650002402421650002202445650002002467650001602487650002002503650002202523653002802545700001902573700002202592700002402614700002202638773009002660852000902750856011202759930003302871945002502904946001302929961001302942655001202955IND4435815820221122034902.0100423e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443581582DNAL7 a10113/410122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aPalmer, Mitchell V.10aEvaluation of an in vitro blood-based assay to detect production of interferon-γ by Mycobacterium bovis-infected white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)  ap. 17-21.  aIncludes references  aTuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis in captive Cervidae was identified as an important disease in the United States in 1990 and prompted the addition of captive Cervidae to the USDA Uniform Methods and Rules for eradication of bovine tuberculosis. As well, M. bovis infection was identified in free-ranging white-tailed deer in northeast Michigan in 1995. Tuberculosis in both captive and free-ranging Cervidae represents a serious challenge to the eradication of M. bovis infection from the United States. Currently, the only approved antemortem tests for tuberculosis in Cervidae are the intradermal tuberculin skin test and the blood tuberculosis test (BTB). At present, the BTB is not available in North America. Tuberculin skin testing of Cervidae is time-consuming and involves repeated animal handling and risk of injury to animals and humans. This study evaluated the potential of a new blood-based assay for tuberculosis in Cervidae that would decrease animal handling, stress, and losses due to injury. In addition, a blood-based assay could provide a more rapid diagnosis. Twenty 6-9-month-old white-tailed deer, male and female, were experimentally inoculated by instillation of 300 colony-forming units of M. bovis in the tonsillar crypts. Seven, age-matched uninfected deer served as controls. Blood was collected on days 90, 126, 158, 180, 210, 238, 263, and 307 after inoculation and was analyzed for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to incubation with M. bovis purified protein derivative (PPDb), M. avium PPDa, pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or media alone. Production of IFN-gamma in response to PPDb was significantly greater (P < 0.05) at all time points in samples from M. bovis-infected deer as compared with uninfected control deer, whereas IFN-gamma production to PWM did not differ significantly between infected and control deer. Measurement of IFN-gamma production to PPDb may serve as a useful assay for the antemortem diagnosis of tuberculosis in Cervidae. 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3atuberculosis 3aMycobacterium bovis 3awildlife diseases 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3ablood chemistry 3adisease diagnosis 0ablood tuberculosis test1 aWaters, W.

We used a gradient of endogenous soil N levels resulting from different management legacies and soil textures to investigate the effects of soil organic matter dynamics and N availability on soybean (Glycine max) N₂ fixation. Soybean N₂ fixation was estimated on 13 grain farm fields in central New York State by the ¹⁵N natural abundance method using a non-nodulating soybean reference. A range of soil N fractions were measured to span the continuum from labile to more recalcitrant N pools. Soybean reliance on N₂ fixation ranged from 36% to 82% and total N₂ fixed in aboveground biomass ranged from 40 to 224 kg N ha⁻¹. Soil N pools were consistently inversely correlated with % N from fixation and the correlation was statistically significant for inorganic N and occluded particulate organic matter N. However, we also found that soil N uptake by N₂-fixing soybeans relative to the non-nodulating isoline increased as soil N decreased, suggesting that N₂ fixation increased soil N scavenging in low fertility fields. We found weak evidence for internal regulation of N₂ fixation, because the inhibitory effects of soil N availability were secondary to the environmental and site characteristics, such as soil texture and corresponding soil characteristics that vary with texture, which affected soybean biomass, total N₂ fixation, and net N balance. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3anitrogen fixation 3aRhizobiaceae 3anitrogen 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3asoil organic matter 3anitrogen content 3aplant tissues 3anutrient uptake 3asoil texture 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aNew York1 aDrinkwater, L.

To accomplish the goal of understanding underlying mechanisms, we selected the cell line most responsive to the CE treatment to study the effects of the extract on signaling molecules regulating cell cycle progression. Cell cycle analyses were conducted on treated versus nontreated cells from 0-6 h. The percentages of cells in G2/M in CE-treated cells increased significantly from 11.0±1.0 to 23.6±1.4 after 6 h, while the percentage for nontreated cells remained unchanged (12.3±0.8). Multiparametric flow cytometric analyses were used to associate activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) with cells arrested in G2/M, the size of these cells, and the presence or absence of cyclin B1. After 4 h, there was a 26% increase in the activated phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK in CE-treated cells compared with the nontreated control cells, with larger cells showing the greater increases. Although the proportion of CE-treated cells in G2/M was higher than controls, this population was shown to be less positive for cyclin B1 than the control G2/M population. Our results demonstrate that CE significantly modulated two signaling proteins, p38 MAPK and cyclin B, that regulate progression through G2/M. Overall, the data provide evidence that CE affects proliferation in a leukemic cell line by disrupting critical phosphorylating/dephosphorylating signaling events that propel cells through the G2/M phase. 3atranscription factors 3apolyphenols 3acell cycle 3aleukemia 3anutritional intervention 3aphytochemicals 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aCinnamomum verum 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3achemoprevention 3aplant extracts 3abiochemical pathways 3aphosphorylation 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acinnamon 3aapoptosis 3asupercritical fluid extraction 2aLeukocyte Common Antigensxdeficiency. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Sizexdrug effects 2aCinnamomum zeylanicum 2aClone Cells 2aCyclin Bxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCyclin B1 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aFlow Cytometryxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHumans 2aJurkat Cells 2aMAP Kinase Signaling Systemxdrug effects 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPolyphenols 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aspices1 aKelly, Meghan A.1 aPolansky, Marilyn M.1 aAnderson, Richard A.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2009 Aug., v.  20, no.  8 p.614-620dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/324323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2008.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090822b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02297naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100001500163245005600178300001600234500002400250506017300274520093400447650001401381650000901395650001501404650000901419650002001428651001401448700001601462700001501478773012801493852000901621856011201630856008201742956008601824961001301910655001201923IND4462028320221120231945.0111014e196904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446202832DNAL7 a10113/547772hdl7 a10.1002/qj.497095404032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIdso, S.B.10aRelations of radiation fluxes over natural surfaces  ap. 244-257.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRadiation fluxes over surfaces of bare soil and short grass sod were measured on clear days at St. Paul, Minnesota. Widely diverse types of daily cycles describing the hourly dependence of net upon net solar radiation were found. Heating coefficients depended as much upon atmospheric radiative properties as upon surface properties. Causes for these relations are proposed and tentatively verified experimentally. The accuracy of regressions of solar on net radiation is shown to depend upon the uniform distribution of data points extending to the region of the origin. Controversies in the literature are illuminated by this analysis, both theoretically and experimentally. Two equations relating the slope of the regression of solar on net radiation to albedo are also considered. Finally, a relation between the long-wave radiation balance and the heating coefficient proposed by Ekern (1965) is qualitatively substantiated. 3aequations 3aheat 3asod strips 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3aMinnesota1 aBaker, D.G.1 aBlad, B.L.0 tQuarterly journal of the Royal Meteorological Society.g1969 Apr., v. 95, no. 404 p.244-257wJournal:22006x1477-870X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/547773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.497095404033Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/110300_alarc_0232_idso.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02399naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100002000130245005300150300002000203500002400223520130100247650001901548650002801567650001401595650001401609650002001623650000901643650002001652700001801672700002001690700001601710773009501726852000901821856011101830930003301941945001301974946001301987961001302000655001202013IND2208970520221120230140.0010110e200011  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220897052DNAL7 a10113/30002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhardt, T.A.10aCa2+-ATPase protein expression in mammary tissue  ap. C1595-C1602.  aIncludes references  aProtein expression of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) and the putative Golgi secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA) was examined in rat mammary tissue. As lactation started, PMCA protein expression increased dramatically, and this increased expression paralleled milk production. Mammary PMCA was primarily PMCA2b but was apprx4,000 daltons larger than expected. RT-PCR showed that the primary mammary PMCA2b transcript was alternatively spliced, at splice site A, to include an additional 135 bp, resulting in the insertion of 45 amino acids. This splice form is designated 2bw. PMCA2bw is secreted into milk, associated with the milk fat globule membrane. Therefore, PMCA2bw is located on the apical membrane of the secretory cell. Smaller amounts of PMCA1b and 4b protein were found in mammary tissue. PMCA4b was the major PMCA expressed in developing tissue, and its level declined as lactation started. PMCA1b expression increased moderately during lactation. SPCA protein expression increased 1 wk before parturition and increased further as lactation proceeded. The abundance and cell location of PMCA2b suggest that it is important for macro-Ca2+ homeostasis in lactating tissue. The pattern of expression and abundance of SPCA suggest that it is a candidate for the Golgi Ca2+-ATPase. 3amammary glands 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3alactation 3apregnancy 3aGolgi apparatus 3arats 3aplasma membrane1 aFiloteo, A.G.1 aPenniston, J.T.1 aHorst, R.L.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g2000 Nov., v.  279, no.  5 p.C1595-C1602x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/30003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070912b20071002c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01301naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245009800155300001600253500002500269500001500294520030800309650002700617650001900644650001600663653001700679773009900696852000900795856011200804930003300916946001300949961001300962655001200975IND9005741620221121215045.0901120e196109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900574162DNAL7 a10113/503022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aBouwer, H.12aA double tube method for measuring hydraulic conductivity of soil in situ above a water table  ap. 334-339.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-06  aWith two concentric tubes placed in an auger hole and filled with water to saturate the soil below, hydraulic conductivity is calculated from the rate of change in the water level in the inner tube, using dimensionless parameters describing the flow component due to different water levels in the tubes. 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainfiltrometers 3awater table 0asoil physics0 tSoil Science Society of America proceedings.g1961 , v.  25, no.  5 p.334-339x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/503023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110927b20111007c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03357naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002300203245015800226300002000384500002400404520163400428650002402062650002102086650002402107650003302131650001602164650001702180650002002197650001802217650001602235650002202251650003102273650002002304700002202324700002502346700002802371773014902399852000902548856008602557856011202643930003302755945002502788946001302813961001302826655001202839IND4442157020221118230901.0100908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444215702DNAL7 a10.1152/ajpregu.00272.20092doi7 a10113/440622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aM001 0aL200 0aL6001 aCleveland, Beth M.10aInsulin-like growth factor-I and genetic effects on indexes of protein degradation in response to feed deprivation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. R1332-R1342.  aIncludes references  aThis study determined the effect of genetic variation, feed deprivation, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on weight loss, plasma IGF-I and growth hormone, and indexes of protein degradation in eight full-sibling families of rainbow trout. After 2 wk of feed deprivation, fish treated with IGF-I lost 16% less (P < 0.05) wet weight than untreated fish. Feed deprivation increased growth hormone (P < 0.05) and decreased IGF-I (P < 0.05), but hormone levels were not altered by IGF-I. Plasma 3-methylhistidine concentrations were not affected by IGF-I but were decreased after 2 wk (P < 0.05) and increased after 4 wk (P < 0.05) of feed deprivation. In white muscle, transcript abundance of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome, lysosomal, and calpain- and caspase-dependent pathways were affected by feed deprivation (P < 0.05). IGF-I prevented the feed deprivation-induced upregulation of MAFbx (F-box) and cathepsin transcripts and reduced abundance of proteasomal mRNAs (P < 0.05), suggesting that reduction of protein degradation via these pathways may be partially responsible for the IGF-I-induced reduction of weight loss. Family variations in gene expression, IGF-I concentrations, and weight loss during fasting suggest genetic variation in the fasting response, with considerable impact on regulation of proteolytic pathways. These data indicate that nutrient availability, IGF-I, and genetic variation affect weight loss, in part through alterations of proteolytic pathways in rainbow trout, and that regulation of genes within these pathways is coordinated in a way that supports a similar physiological response. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afeed deprivation 3aprotein degradation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aweight loss 3asomatotropin 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aproteinases 3agenetic variation 3agene expression regulation 3askeletal muscle1 aWeber, Gregory M.1 aBlemings, Kenneth P.1 aSilverstein, Jeffrey T.0 tAmerican journal of physiology. :regulatory, integrative, and comparative physiology.g2009 Nov., v.  297, no.  5 p.R1332-R1342x1522-14907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00272.20093Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03479naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001300148245012800161300001200289500002400301500007600325500001500401520174100416650001102157650001702168650002502185650002302210650002402233650002502257650002802282650002102310650001502331650002102346650001802367650001802385651001202403651001602415653001902431653001702450700001602467700001802483700002202501700002002523700001702543700001602560700001602576773009302592852000902685856011102694930003302805945002502838946001302863961001302876655001202889IND4367414120221116203936.0050303s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436741412DNAL7 a10113/28542hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aS2001 aSaha, S.10aEffect of chromosome substitutions from Gossypium barbadense L. 3-79 into G. hirsutum L.

Incorporating the superior fiber properties from Pima into Upland cotton has generally not achieved stable introgression because of genome incompatibility. Using a set of stable lines (CS-B) containing chromosome or chromosome arm substitutions from G. barbadense (3-79) backcrossed into a G. hirsutum (TM-1) background, traits from the TM-1 parent that varied significantly could be attributed to genes in the substituted chromosome, to other residual 3-79 chromatin material, and/or their interaction with the other 25 chromosomes from TM-1. In 2002, seeds from 13 different CS-B lines, and the TM-1 and 3-79 parents, were planted in replicated tests at two locations in Mississippi and one location in Arizona for evaluation of agronomic and fiber properties. Compared with TM-1, the CS-B lines with substitutions for chromosomes 16, 18, 14sh and 22sh from 3-79 had reduced seed cotton yield and lint yield. The CS-B lines with alien chromosomes 2, 6, 16, 18, 5sh, 22Lo and 22sh from 3-79 had improved lint percentage. The CS-B line with substitution of chromosome 25 from 3-79 had reduced micronaire and increased fiber strength. All of the substituted chromosomes except 2, 4, and 6 had reduced boll weight. The CS-B lines 14sh, 15sh, and 25 had increased fiber length. The results provided information on the association of specific chromosomes with genes for agronomic and fiber traits. These new genomic resources will provide additional approaches for improvement of Upland cotton and will enable development of chromosome-specific recombinant inbred lines for higher resolution mapping. 3acotton 3abackcrossing 3agermplasm evaluation 3aGossypium hirsutum 3agenetic improvement 3aGossypium barbadense 3achromosome substitution 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3aline differences 3afiber quality 3aintrogression 3aArizona 3aMississippi 0aplant breeding 0aPima cottons1 aWu-O, Jess.1 aJenkins, J.N.1 aMcCarty, J.C.

Several plant species, including rape, produce glucosinolates which decompose to form isothiocyanates which are closely related to methyl isothiocyanate the active ingredient of metham sodium. Such plants may be useful in CBR control strategies. This research was conducted to determine the fungicidal effect of the glucosinolate in rapeseed meal on microsclerotia of C. crotalariae. Rapeseed meal containing 13 mmol of glucosinolate kg-1 was added to a soil column 50 mm in diameter and 325 mm long. Meal was either placed at the 150 mm depth or mixed with the top 150 mm of soil. An untreated control and metham sodium at a rate equivalent to 190 L ha-1 injected 150 mm deep were included. Metham sodium was much more effective in reducing microsclerotial populations of C. crotalariae than rapeseed meal. However, the amount of glucosinolate in the metham sodium treatment was three times as great as that found in the rapeseed meal. Rapeseed meal treatments usually significantly reduced the number of soilborne microsclerotia when comparisons were made with untreated soil. 3aArachis hypogaea 3aCylindrocladium crotalariae 3asclerotia 3amortality 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asoil amendments 3aglucosinolates 3aisothiocyanates 3ametam 3asoil water content 3aantifungal properties1 aPorter, D.M.1 aAuld, D.L.0 tPeanut science.g1992 , v.  19, no.  2 p.92-94x0095-36797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3146/i0095-3679-19-2-73Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/503043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110928b20111007c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03908naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001900149245008200168300001600250500002400266500001500290520226700305650001402572650002102586650001802607650001902625650001402644650001202658650001302670650001802683650001402701650001402715650001402729650003702743650001802780650001302798650002502811650001902836653001302855653002602868653001902894653002702913653001602940700001702956700001802973700002002991700001603011773008803027852000903115856011203124930003303236945001303269946001103282961001303293655001203306IND2051003520221119055940.0960425e199411  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205100352DNAL7 a10113/254782hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aThompson, A.E.10aGermplasm development of Vernonia galamensis as a new industrial oilseed crop  ap. 185-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aGenetic transfer of the day-neutral flowering habit found in Vernonia galamensis ssp. galamensis var. petitiana [A 20295 (V 029)] has been successfully accomplished by intraspecific hybridization. Crosses were made in 1990-1991 utilizing var. petitiana as the female parent and five other accessions from the V. galamensis complex as male parents. The F1 progenies of the crosses were grown in the greenhouse in 1991-1992. Single plant selections were made within F2 and F3 field-grown populations in 1992 and 1993, respectively, in Arizona and various locations throughout the continental United States. Seed increase of selected F3 plants was made in Puerto Rico in 1993-1994 for wide-scale evaluation, further selection, and initiation of agronomic crop production research. Selection for rapid germination in the seedling stage in F2 and F3 populations was effective in minimizing seed dormancy. Early germination, nine days after planting, increased from 10.9 ± 1.6% for the F2's, to 34.3 ± 1.8% for the F3's. Among the 59 F2 crosses grown under long-day conditions in the field in 1992, the percentage of F2 plants flowering ranged from 31% to 100%, with a mean of 77.3 ± 2.5%. Flowering percentage of F3 progenies from within 38 crosses increased to 94.2 ± 1.6% with a range of 50% to 100%. Mean seed weights of greenhouse-grown F1's was 5.73 ± 0.12 g/1000. Field-grown F2's and F3's had smaller seed weights, 2.50 ± 0.05 and 2.11 ± 0.06 g/1000, respectively. The F1's also had higher seed oil and vernolic acid contents (39.8 ± 0.4% and 80.8 ± 0.4%) as compared to the F2's (33.2 ± 0.4% and 62.0 ± 1.0%) and the F3's (32.1 ± 0.6% and 64.9 ± 0.8%). The relatively wide range in seed weight, and in oil and vernolic acid contents in both F2's and F3's demonstrate that directed selection for these yield factors should be effective. High genotype × environment interaction suggests that plant selection and evaluation should be conducted over a range of geographic and climatic conditions within the temperate zone to identify the most favorable production sites. The rapid progress made within the past five years indicates that commercialization of vernonia as a new industrial oilseed could be a reality within the next seven to ten years. 3agermplasm 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3aplant breeding 3aflowering 3ahybrids 3aVernonia 3ahybridization 3avarieties 3aseed oils 3avernolate 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aoilseed crops 3aseed set 3aartificial selection 3aphotoperiodism 0acrossing 0aday neutral flowering 0aflowering date 0along chain fatty acids 0aseed weight1 aDierig, D.A.1 aJohnson, E.R.1 aDahlquist, G.H.1 aKleiman, R.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g1994 Nov., v.  3, no.  3 p.185-200x0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02519naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168100002500177245010700202300001600309500002400325500001500349520101000364650003001374650001601404650001201420650001701432650001401449650001801463650002001481650001401501650001001515651001001525653002101535653002301556653001901579700002201598700001601620700001701636773007001653852000901723856011101732856008801843930003301931945002501964946001101989961001302000655001202013IND4393010120221123021615.0070713e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439301012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mycres.2005.12.0052doi7 a10113/10432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aMuthusubramanian, V.10aCultural characteristics, morphology, and variation within Claviceps africana and C. sorghi from India  ap. 452-464.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aSorghum ergot in India is caused by Claviceps africana and C. sorghi. The distributions of these two species in India is not known. Eighty-nine sorghum ergot isolates were cultured from young sphacelia obtained from male sterile sorghum plants artificially inoculated using inoculum collected in the field. Based on cultural characteristics, the isolates were separated into two groups which differed distinctly in the morphology of their sphacelia, conidia, and sclerotia. Marked differences also were observed in rates of secondary conidial production and disease spread between the groups. In combination with molecular evidence, our results confirm that the isolates placed in Group I represent C. africana and Group II isolates represent C. sorghi. C. africana was found to be widely distributed in all sorghum growing areas of India. The species first described as occuring in India, C. sorghi, appears to be restricted to a few locations in the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. 3ageographical distribution 3asporulation 3aconidia 3acell culture 3asclerotia 3agrain sorghum 3aSorghum bicolor 3aClaviceps 3aergot 3aIndia 0aClaviceps sorghi 0aClaviceps africana 0afungal anatomy1 aBandyopadhyay, R.1 aReddy, D.R.1 aTooley, P.W.0 tMycological research.g2006 Apr., v.  110, no.  4 p.452-4647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/10433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2005.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/07/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02550naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100002800191245011500219300001600334500002400350520128500374650002201659650001501681650002701696650001701723650002101740653002601761773008001787852000901867856009201876856011201968930003302080945002502113946001302138961001302151655001202164IND4421262220221119094742.0090601e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442126222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00140.x2doi7 a10113/300052hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF130 0aP3001 aBestelmeyer, Brandon T.10aThreshold Concepts and Their Use in Rangeland Management and Restoration: The Good, the Bad, and the Insidious  ap. 325-329.  aIncludes references  aEcological thresholds describe abrupt changes in ecological properties in time or space. In rangeland management, thresholds reflect changes in vegetation and soils that are expensive or impossible to reverse. The threshold concept has catalyzed important advances in rangeland management thinking, but it has also introduced two classes of drawbacks. First, the ambiguity of the term "threshold" and the desire for simplicity in its application has led to an overemphasis on classification thresholds, such as vegetation cover values. Uncritical use of classification thresholds may lead to the abandonment of management efforts in land areas that would otherwise benefit from intervention. Second, it is possible that the invocation of thresholds and irreversible degradation may eventually result in the wholesale conversion of land areas that would have been recoverable or served important societal functions, such as biodiversity maintenance, that are not reflected in threshold definitions. I conclude with a recommendation to clarify the nature of thresholds by defining the relationships among pattern, process, and degradation and distinguishing preventive thresholds from restoration thresholds. We must also broaden the attributes used to define states and thresholds. 3alandscape ecology 3arangelands 3aecological restoration 3abiodiversity 3arange management 0aecological thresholds0 tRestoration ecology.g2006 Sept., v.  14, no.  3 p.325-329x1526-100X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00140.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/300053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/06/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03452naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168100002700177245017300204300001600377500002400393520183500417650002102252650002302273650001302296650002302309650001902332650002202351650001502373653003202388653001902420653006102439700002302500700002702523700001902550700002202569773010102591852000902692856011202701856008702813930003302900945002502933946001102958961001302969655001202982IND4442161320221118230500.0100909e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444216132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasms.2010.01.0132doi7 a10113/440672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 aFagerquist, Clifton K.10aCovalent Attachment and Dissociative Loss of Sinapinic Acid to/from Cysteine-Containing Proteins from Bacterial Cell Lysates Analyzed by MALDI-TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometry  ap. 829-832.  aIncludes references  aWe report covalent attachment via a thiol ester linkage of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid or SA) to cysteine-containing protein biomarkers from bacterial cell lysates of E. coli analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry when using SA as the matrix. Evidence to support this conclusion is the appearance of additional peaks in the MS spectra when using SA, which are absent when using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA). The additional peaks appear at a mass-to-charge (m/z) approximately 208 greater to the m/z of a more abundant protein ion peak. Protein biomarkers were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a MALDI time-of-flight/time-of-flight (TOF-TOF) mass spectrometer and top-down proteomics. Three protein biomarkers, HdeA, HdeB, and homeobox or YbgS (each containing two cysteine residues) were identified as having reactivity to SA. Non-cysteine-containing protein biomarkers showed no evidence of reactivity to SA. MS ions and MS/MS fragment ions were consistent with covalent attachment of SA via a thiol ester linkage to the side-chain of cysteine residues. MS/MS of a protein biomarker ion with a covalently attached SA revealed fragment ion peaks suggesting dissociative loss SA. We propose dissociative loss of SA is facilitated by a pentacyclic transition-state followed by proton abstraction of the β-hydrogen of the bound SA by a sulfur lone pair followed by dissociative loss of 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-ynal. The apparent reactivity of SA to cysteine/disulfide-containing proteins may complicate identification of such proteins, however the apparent differential reactivity of SA and HCCA toward cysteine/disulfide-containing proteins may be exploited for identification of unknown cysteine-containing proteins. 3aEscherichia coli 3abacterial proteins 3acysteine 3achemical reactions 3acoumaric acids 3amass spectrometry 3abiomarkers 0acyteine-containing proteins 0asinapinic acid 0amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization spectrometry1 aGarbus, Brandon R.1 aWilliams, Katherine E.1 aBates, Anna H.1 aHarden, Leslie A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry.g2010 May, v.  21, no.  5 p.829-8327nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasms.2010.01.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02899naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169100001600178245009600194300001600290500002400306520114000330650001201470650001901482650002701501650003301528650002501561650001101586650002301597650001201620650002601632650001201658650002401670650001001694650000901704650002501713650001801738650001201756651001101768700001601779700001801795700001701813700001601830700001601846700001601862700002001878700001701898773008901915852000902004856011202013856008802125930003302213945002502246946001102271961001502282655001202297IND4366903620221122061456.0050203e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436690362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2004.07.0202doi7 a10113/410012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aAmass, S.F.10aProcedures for preventing transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus (O/TAW/97) by people  ap. 143-149.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to determine personal hygiene protocols and animal avoidance periods needed to prevent transmission of FMDV (O/TAW/97). Forty-six, 9-week-old barrows free of FMDV were randomly allocated to five treatment groups and a control group. Investigators contacted and sampled FMDV-inoculated pigs for approximately 40 min and then contacted and sampled sentinel pigs after using no biosecurity procedures, washing hands and donning clean outerwear, or showering and donning clean outerwear. Personnel were sampled for nasal carriage of FMDV for 85.43 h. Contaminated personnel did not transmit FMDV to susceptible pigs after handwashing or showering, and donning clean outerwear. FMDV was transmitted when biosecurity procedures were not used. FMDV was not detected in nasal secretions of investigators. Thus, extended animal avoidance periods do not appear to be necessary to prevent transmission of FMDV (O/TAW/97) by people to pigs when organic material is removed through handwashing/showering and donning clean outerwear. This study supports similar findings in a previous publication using FMDV (O/UK/35/2001). 3abarrows 3aswine diseases 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3adisease transmission 3ahumans 3adisease prevention 3ahygiene 3alivestock biosecurity 3awashing 3aprotective clothing 3amucus 3anose 3alivestock production 3aanimal health 3astrains 3aTaiwan1 aMason, P.W.1 aPacheco, J.M.1 aMiller, C.A.1 aRamirez, A.1 aClark, L.K.1 aRagland, D.1 aSchneider, J.L.1 aKenyon, S.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2004 Nov. 15, v.  103, no.  3-4 p.143-149x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/410013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2004.07.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03081naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133024002100174040001800195072000900213072000900222072000900231100001400240245007700254300001800331500002400349500001500373506007600388520039400464506003700858650004400895650002300939650001800962650002100980650002001001650002601021650001601047650002501063650002001088650002701108650001501135650001301150650001801163650002101181650000901202650002201211650002501233650001501258650001501273650002201288650002501310650002101335650004001356650002301396650002401419650005601443650002901499650002201528650003001550650004701580650002201627650003801649651001301687653002301700653001001723653002401733700003101757700002401788700001901812773010001831852000901931856009101940856011202031930003302143945002502176946001302201961001302214655001202227IND4372567420221207065955.0050720e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437256742DNAL7 a160008332pmid7 aPMC11689842pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.7.4132-4136.20052doi7 a10113/199532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF200 0aW0001 aFang, Min10aBacterial Diversity in Rhizospheres of Nontransgenic and Transgenic Corn  ap. 4132-4136.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterial diversity in transgenic and nontransgenic corn rhizospheres was determined.

For this study, 34 newly established cell lines from 10 lepidopteran species, namely Anagrapha falcifera, Anticarsia gemmatalis, Agrotis ipsilon, Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea, Ostrinia nubilalis, Plutella xylostella, Spodoptera exigua, S. frugiperda and Trichoplusia ni. were screened for their ability to produce ECV and OBs from a variety of baculoviruses. The selected baculoviruses included: the alfalfa looper virus (AcMNPV); the celery looper virus (AfMNPV); the velvetbean caterpillar virus (AgMNPV), the bollworm virus (HzSNPV), the diamondback moth virus (PxMNPV), and the beet armyworm virus (SeMNPV). ECV titers were determined using TCID50 assays (50% tissue culture infectivity dose), with the presence or absence of OBs being noted. For AcMNPV, 28 new cell lines were tested, with eight producing AcMNPV ECV titers of 1.1-47.3 × 106 TCID50/ml and 11 producing OBs. For AgMNPV, six new cell lines were tested, with all producing AgMNPV ECV titers of 3.5-62.3 × 106 TCID50/ml and generating OBs. For HzSNPV, four new cell lines were tested with three lines producing HzSNPV ECV titers of 1.4-5.0 × 106 TCID50/ml, but none generating OBs. For PxMNPV, 10 new cell lines were tested with seven generating PxMNPV ECV titers of 4.7-232.6 × 106 TCID50/ml and eight producing OBs. Lastly, using qualitative or semiquantitative methods, homologous cell lines were tested for AfMNPV and SeMNPV production, all of which produced OBs. Overall, many of the cell lines tested were found to produce OBs and generate moderate to high levels of ECVs of one or more baculoviruses. 3anuclear inclusions 3aLepidoptera 3ainsect pests 3acell culture 3aBaculoviridae 3acell lines 3avirus replication 3ainfection 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aMcIntosh, A.H.1 aEl Sayed, G.N.1 aGrasela, J.J.1 aStiles, B.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2001 June, v.  37, no.  6 p.373-379x1071-26907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/90093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290/1071-2690(2001)037&lt;0374:POSBIN&gt;2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080123b20080202c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02986naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001500199245007000214300001600284500002400300500001500324520149200339650001801831650001801849650002001867650002101887650002001908650001901928650001801947650002501965650001401990653001602004653001802020653002302038700001802061700001702079773009002096852000902186856011102195856009202306930003302398945002502431946001102456961001302467655001202480IND4394676520221117200120.0070904e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439467652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00582.x2doi7 a10113/29782hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aKwon, H.S.10aBacterial challenge and eicosanoids act in plasmatocyte spreading  ap. 285-292.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe report on experiments designed to more thoroughly document the roles of eicosanoids as crucial elements in cell spreading and on experiments designed to test the hypothesis that in vivo bacterial infections influence cell spreading on glass surfaces. We used hemocytes prepared from tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) and four species of bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus) in each experiment. Our protocols yielded several important points: (i) hemocytes prepared from hornworms at 15 and 60 min following infection with, separately, each of the four bacterial species were fundamentally altered in size (all less than the 15-micrometer counting cut-off) and none of the hemocytes exhibited cell-spreading behavior; (ii) the influence of bacterial challenge on cell spreading declined with incubation time post-challenge; (iii) conditioned medium (CM) prepared by exposing hemocytes to bacterial cells in vitro exerted a strong dose-dependent influence on cell spreading. Specifically, plasmatocytes increased in length from about 38 micrometer with 2.5% CM to a maximum of about 54 micrometer at 100% CM; and (iv) the retarding influence of dexamethasone (an eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitor) on cell spreading was reversed by arachidonic acid, prostaglandin H2, and CM. Taken together, these findings indicate that both bacterial infection and eicosanoids influence hemocyte-spreading processes. 3adose response 3aManduca sexta 3ainsect immunity 3aarachidonic acid 3aimmune response 3aprostaglandins 3adexamethasone 3abacterial infections 3ahemocytes 0aeicosanoids 0ahemocyte size 0ahemocyte spreading1 aStanley, D.W.1 aMiller, J.S.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2007 Sept., v.  124, no.  3 p.285-2927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/29783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00582.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070910b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03171naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245006800167300001600235500002400251500001500275520179400290650001702084650001302101650002302114650002502137650002002162650001402182650002002196650001702216650002002233650001902253650001502272650001002287650002502297650001802322650001702340653001202357700002002369773007102389852000902460856011202469930003302581945002502614946001302639961001302652655001202665IND4371687920221120053225.0050623e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437168792DNAL7 a10113/159702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aH0001 aWebster, T.M.10aHalosulfuron has a variable effect on cucurbit growth and yield  ap. 707-710.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aHalosulfuron is a proposed alternative to methyl bromide for managing nutsedges (Cyperus spp.) in several vegetable crops, including cucurbits. Field studies were conducted to evaluate the crop sensitivity to halosulfuron in a spring squash (Cucurbita pepo L.)-fall cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) rotation from 2000 to 2002. Treatments included application of halosulfuron to the soil surface after forming the bed, but before laying mulch (halosulfuron-PRE), halosulfuron applied through drip irrigation (halosulfuron-DRIP) after forming bed and laying mulch, metham applied through drip irrigation after forming bed and laying mulch, a nontreated control with mulch, and nontreated control without mulch. Each treatment was applied to both direct seeded and transplanted zucchini squash. Halosulfuron treatments reduced squash plant diameter relative to metham, however plant diameters in halosulfuron-PRE (transplant and direct seed) and halosulfuron-DRIP (transplant) treatments were not different from the nontreated control. Halosulfuron-PRE delayed squash fruit production relative to the mulched nontreated control. However, application of halosulfuron-PRE and halosulfuron-DRIP did not reduce squash yield at the conclusion of the season, relative to the nontreated control. Cucumbers were transplanted and direct seeded into previous squash plots and received either an application of halosulfuron-DRIP, or were not treated. Differences in cucumber yields were not detected with second crop treatments. Cucumbers appear to have adequate tolerance to halosulfuron, making it a potential replacement for methyl bromide for nutsedge control. Suppression of early season squash growth by halosulfuron may hinder the adoption of halosulfuron as a methyl bromide alternative for squash. 3aplant growth 3asquashes 3aapplication timing 3aplastic film mulches 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3avegetable crops 3ahalosulfuron 3amicroirrigation 3aCucurbita pepo 3acrop yield 3ametam 3aherbicide resistance 3acrop rotation 3aplant damage 0amulches1 aCulpepper, A.S.0 tHortScience.g2005 June, v.  40, no.  3 p.707-710x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/159703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080616b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02600naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092024002100149040001800170072000900188072000900197100002300206245007500229300001800304500002400322500001500346520104600361650001501407650001201422650001301434650002001447650001801467650002501485650001401510651001301524653001501537653002201552653002201574653001701596653001701613700002401630700001801654773010801672852000901780856010701789856011201896930003302008945002502041946001302066961001502079655001202094IND4432852220221116171426.0100218e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443285222DNAL7 a10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1266:POSDFM>2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/386952hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aX1001 aStanovick, John S.10aPrecision of Statistics Derived from Missouri Statewide Angler Surveys  ap. 1266-1269.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe assessed the validity of using statewide telephone survey data to develop estimates of total angler effort and effort by water category (e.g., ponds and streams) for individual water bodies, management regions, and north-south geographic regions. Angler hours and trips for individual reservoirs and put-and-take trout parks were found to vary by less than 30% for both estimates, but effort estimates for individual streams and five classes of small impoundments were highly variable and imprecise because of the low number of cooperators fishing these waters. We found that survey results from 40 cooperators and 195 cooperator trips were required to obtain estimates of angler hours and angler trips, respectively, such that the variation of those estimates would be less than 30% for at least 80% of the water bodies meeting that sample size. We recommend that statewide surveys be used to assess only effort for water bodies that receive statewide use, that is, for those that draw from a very large regional or statewide population. 3aestimation 3asurveys 3avalidity 3awater resources 3asport fishing 3astatistical analysis 3aprecision 3aMissouri 0astatistics 0aangler statistics 0astatewide surveys 0aangler trips 0aangler hours1 aZweifel, Richard D.1 aWagner, Bruce0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2002 Nov., v.  22, no.  4 p.1266-1269x0275-59477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1266:POSDFM>2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100224b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/24  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02252naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001300149245004900162300001700211500002400228500001500252520112700267650001301394650001301407650001801420650001601438650001801454650001201472650003101484653000901515653001601524700001701540773008001557852000901637856011201646930003301758945001301791946001301804961001301817655001201830IND2202648320221119055806.0000219e199909  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220264832DNAL7 a10113/254682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aWu, Y.V.10aParticle-size reduction in gum concentration  ap. 673- 676.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aParticle-size reduction is a widely used process for cereal grains. In wheat flour milling, the wheat kernel after tempering is passed through a number of rollers to break and reduce the particle size, and it is then sifted into flour and mill-feed fractions. In corn dry milling, the kernel after tempering is broken into large pieces by a degerminator and then sifted, aspirated, and ground between a number of rollers into grits, flour, germ, and meal. The same milling equipment used for cereal grains can also be used to process oilseed meal to enrich gum content. Particle-size reduction of defatted seed meal by various mills and its effects on gum concentration was studied. Miag vario mill, Allis-Chalmers roller mill, Glen Mills micro hammer/cutter mill, Buhler mill, and Alpine pin mill were used to concentrate gum from defatted lesquerella seed meal by grinding and sifting/air classification. The best result for gum enrichment was obtained when the defatted meal was ground once at 9,000 rpm and three times at 14,000 rpm in pin mill (largest reduction in particle size) and separated by air classification. 3aoilseeds 3aoilmeals 3aparticle size 3aLesquerella 3awater content 3amilling 3aparticle size distribution 0agums 0agum content1 aAbbott, T.P.0 tCereal foods world.g1999 Sept., v.  44, no.  9 p.673- 676x0146-62837nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02935naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024002800116024002100144040001800165072000900183072000900192100001700201245006600218300001600284500002500300520115100325650001601476650001801492650001201510650002101522650001301543650002101556650001801577650001601595650002301611650001201634650002501646650002801671650003501699650002501734650001101759650003101770650002101801650001601822650003001838650002001868650003001888653002101918700001701939700001601956773006601972852000902038856007802047856011202125930003302237945002502270946001302295961001302308655001202321991618937900742620221117203740.0780601s197802  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890421002DNAL7 a6340412pmid7 a10.1007/BF025332502doi7 a10113/285302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aLanser, A.C.10aMetabolism of linoleate versus linoelaidate in the laying hen  ap. 103-109.  aIncludes references.  aThe metabolic fate in the laying hen of linolaidic acid, the trans,trans-geometric isomer of linoleic acid, was compared to that of the naturally occurring cis,cis linoleate. In two experiments, mixtures of radioisotope-labeled linoleate and linoelaidate were orally administered to a set of three laying hens. A third mixture consisting of linoleate-3H and linoleate-14C was fed to three hens to measure biological isotope effects. Isotopic ratios (3H/14C) of the neutral lipid and phospholipid fractions isolated from egg yolks and of the octadecadienoic acids from these fractions were compared to those of the administered mixtures. The 3H/14C ratios indicate that linoelaidic acid and linoleic acid are equally incorporated into egg yolk neutral lipids and phospholipids. Arachidonic acid was found exclusively in the phospholipid fraction and was radiolabeled with the isotope from the cis,cis octadecadienoate isomer only. Further detailed analysis of individual neutral lipid components indicated: (a) discrimination against the trans,trans isomer in cholesteryl esters and (b) no discrimination against either isomer in triacylglycerols. 3alaying hens 3alinoleic acid 3aisomers 3alipid metabolism 3aegg yolk 3atriacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aCholesterol Estersxmetabolism 2aEgg Yolkxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aLinoleic Acidsxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aOviposition 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aStereoisomerism 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism 0alinoelaidic acid1 aMounts, T.L.1 aEmken, E.A.0 tLipids.g1978 Feb., v.  13, no.  2 p.103-109x0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025332503Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/285303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03205naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193072000900202100002000211245010300231300001600334500002400350520124100374592002801615650001701643650001201660650001501672650001701687650001701704650002201721650002601743650001901769650002201788650002401810650001601834650002601850650002601876650001901902650002101921650002501942650001801967650002001985650001202005650001702017650002002034650001102054700002302065700001902088700002202107773012602129852000902255856008502264856011202349930003302461945002502494946001102519961001302530655001202543IND4461817520160422000000.0110921e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446181752DNAL7 a10.1080/036503409033022942doi7 a10113/502932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ700 0aJ800 0aF600 0aQ5041 aAllen, Brett L.10aLong-term effects of topsoil removal on soil productivity factors, wheat yield and protein content  ap. 293-303.  aIncludes references  aQuantifying long-term effects of soil erosion on plant production and soil quality can aid in restoring degraded soils. The objectives of this study were to determine the long-term effects of topsoil removal on spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and soil productivity factors. In 1982, the surface 0, 6, 12, and 18 cm of topsoil was mechanically removed from a Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustoll) and subsequently cropped. Soil samples were collected in 1998. There was no difference in soil organic matter (SOM), particulate organic matter (POM), mineralizable N, or water stable soil aggregates (WSA) in the surface 15 cm. Though not significant, there was an average increase of 1.2 g SOM kg⁻¹ soil from the surface 15 cm since 1982, but fungal and bacterial biomass was reduced. The SOM and POM increased in the surface 15 cm of soil where grass was planted in strips between plots. Topsoil removal did not affect soil water at planting nor wheat yields from 1998–2001. The use of commercial fertilizer maintained crop yields, but SOM remained unchanged indicating that, restoring erosion damage is unlikely with a conventionally tilled wheat-fallow rotation in semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil erosion 3atopsoil 3aloam soils 3acarbon sinks 3asoil quality 3aTriticum aestivum 3along term experiments 3agrowing season 3asoil productivity 3asoil organic matter 3agrain yield 3asoil nutrient balance 3aplant available water 3asoil fertility 3anitrogen balance 3anitrogen fertilizers 3awheat protein 3aprotein content 3abiomass 3aparticulates 3asoil aggregates 3afallow1 aCochran, Verlan L.1 aCaesar, TheCan1 aTanaka, Donald L.0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2011 May 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.293-303dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/036503409033022943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110926b20111007c00000000  aINDdPNNe2011/09/26  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02591naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072001700167072001700184072001700201100002600218245014100244300001400385500002400399500001500423520069800438650002301136650001801159650002301177650002901200650003801229650002501267650002301292650001501315650002801330650002801358650002701386650002301413651001301436651001301449653001401462653003301476700002001509700002301529700002201552700001801574700002101592773009701613852000901710856008601719856011201805930003301917945002501950946001301975961001301988655001202001IND4417573620221118012449.0090313e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441757362DNAL7 a10.3198/jpr2005.12.0517crg2doi7 a10113/314452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Thinning occurred in 1972, 1976, and 1980. Height, dbh, and crown characteristics were measured seven times at 4-7-year intervals from 1972 to 2002. Tree rings were measured retrospectively to determine growth of individual years. Periodic annual increment (PAI) was analyzed for quadratic mean diameter (QMD), height, crown volume, and basal area per ha. We found significant difference for all variables among thinning levels and among measurement periods (P < 0.002). Trees in heavily thinned plots grew more in height, dbh, and crown volume than trees in lightly thinned plots. The trends were true for the eight tallest trees per plot (=100 trees/ha) for height and dbh. Yet, both total and PAI stand basal area were greater in the lightly thinned plots than in the heavily thinned plots. Thinning intensity accelerated the transformation in diameter distribution from either reverse 'J' or skewed shape to a bell-shape. In addition, the heavier thinned plots increased stand vigor and health as indicated by less snow damage and stem deformities than the lighter thinned plots. Annual diameter growth was significantly related to average minimum temperature during the growing season. We conclude that thinning young red fir stands to a wide spacing will enhance stand development and minimize damage to the residual trees. 3aforest thinning 3astand structure 3adensity 3atree growth 3atree and stand measurements 3aAbies magnifica 3atree damage 3asnow 3aplant response 3aconiferous forests 3aforest health 3aoverstory 3atemperature 3aCalifornia 0athinning intensity 0aoverstory removal1 aOliver, W.W.0 tForest ecology and management.g2006 Mar. 1, v.  223, no.  1-3 p.275-283x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2005.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02551naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001400131245017400145300001600319500002400335520136500359650003001724650001601754650001401770650002701784650002301811650003001834650001301864700001601877700001601893773007701909852000901986856011201995930003302107945001302140946001102153961001302164655001202177IND2201453420221119195219.0991104e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220145342DNAL7 a10113/132522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Y.C.10aDetection of single-base substitution in an esterase gene and its linkage to malathion resistance in the parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)  ap. 398-404.  aIncludes references  aAnisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is an important parasitoid of stored-grain insect pests. Partial cDNA sequences of an esterase-like enzyme have been obtained from a malathion-resistant (R) strain and a susceptible (S) strain of this wasp. A single-base substitution in the R strain has been confirmed by using PCR amplification of specific allele (PASA) to amplify genomic DNA extracted from individual resistant and susceptible parents, F(1) hybrids from double reciprocal crosses, and progeny from backcrosses. The R allele appeared to be Inherited in a strict Mendelian fashion in both diploid female and haploid male progeny. The esterase fragment co-segregated with resistance in these crosses and backcrosses. Female wasps in a mixed population of A calandrae that survived a malathion screen carried the R allele for the esterase-like enzyme, while those wasps that died did not have the R allele. The single base-pair mutation, guanine in the R strain and thymine in the S strain, presumably results in a tryptophan-to-glycine amino acid substitution in the encoded protein. We do not know how these amino acid substitutions may relate to functional differences in the enzyme. However, this esterase gene or another linked esterase gene may encode the resistance-associated malathion detoxifying activity in the R strain. 3aAnisopteromalus calandrae 3aparasitoids 3amalathion 3ainsecticide resistance 3agenetic resistance 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amutation1 aDowdy, A.K.1 aBaker, J.E.0 tPesticide science.g1999 Apr., v.  55, no.  4 p.398-404x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02650naa a2200637 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099024002100143040001800164072000900182072000900191072000900200072000900209100001500218245008700233300001700320500002500337500001500362520082100377650002501198650000901223650002101232650001401253650001501267650002501282650001601307650001801323650001301341650000901354650001001363650002001373650001101393650000901404650002701413650002001440650001501460650001401475650001301489653001701502653002801519653000901547653003301556700001701589700001501606773008001621852000901701856009401710856011201804930003301916945002501949946001301974961001301987655001202000991589134200742620221116201641.0780601s197805  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890796362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1978.tb02406.x2doi7 a10113/299962hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ504 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aWang, L.C.10aGamma glutamyl dipeptide content in soybean protein products and other commodities  ap. 740- 745.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aThe amount of .gamma.-glutamyl dipeptides (.gamma.-glutamyl tyrosine and .gamma.-glutamyl phenylalanine) present in soybeans and other commodities was measured by a method consisting of alchol extraction, preliminary purification and determination with an automated amino acid analyzer.

The cDNAs consist of 1963 nucleotides including a 35 bp untranslated 5'-end, a 1596 bp open reading frame, and a 332 bp untranslated 3'-end. The open reading frame encodes 532 amino acid residues. The predicted protein sequence from these cDNAs includes 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, a carboxylesterase type-B serine active site FGGDSENVTIFCESAG, and conserved residues Ser(187), Glu(317), and His(432) to function as the catalytic triad. The predicted carboxylesterase-like enzyme sequence is most similar to that of the carboxylesterase from the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae with 45% sequence identity. Alignment of the parasitoid carboxylesterase-like enzyme cDNAs revealed that there are two nucleotide differences in the open reading frame between the parasitoid strains, including a silent mutation and a point mutation that presumably causes a gene product difference. A nucleotide thymine at position 658 in the susceptible strain cDNA is replaced by a guanine in the resistant strain cDNA. This substitution leads to an amino acid change from tryptophan (Trp(220)) in the susceptible strain to glycine (Gly(220)) in the resistant strain. This substitution is genetically linked to resistance but it is not known how or if this amino acid substitution affects detoxification of malathion. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that expression level of the carboxylesterase-like enzyme mRNA in adult A. calandrae is approximately 30-fold higher in the resistant strain relative to that in the susceptible strain. Southern analysis indicated that Pst I or Eco RI restriction sites are different in the two strains. Both a modified gene structure and an increase in expression of carboxylesterase may be responsible for the high level of resistance found in this beneficial wasp. 3aAnisopteromalus calandrae 3amalathion 3ainsecticide resistance 3acarboxylesterase 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3astrain differences 3agenetic resistance 3aparasitoids 3amutation 3asequence alignment 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messenger 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aWaspsxenzymologyxgenetics. 0acloning 0amalathion resistance 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af064523 0agenbank/af0645241 aDowdy, A.K.1 aBaker, J.E.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1999 May, v.  29, no.  5 p.417-425x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0965-1748(99)00018-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02139naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100001800188245008500206300001600291500002400307500001500331520087600346650001301222650001801235650001901253650002501272650001301297653001601310700002101326773008901347852000901436856011201445856008901557930003301646945002501679946001301704961001201717655001201729IND2123766420221123005045.0980630e199806  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212376642DNAL7 a10.1016/S0034-4257(98)00010-82doi7 a10113/367392hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX620 0aX1001 aStehman, S.V.10aDesign and analysis for thematic map accuracy assessment: fundamental principles  ap. 331-344.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBefore being used in scientific investigations and policy decisions, thematic maps constructed from remotely sensed data should be subjected to a statistically rigorous accuracy assessment.

We discuss options available for each of these components. A statistically rigorous assessment requires both a probability sampling design and statistically consistent estimators of accuracy parameters, along with a response design determined in accordance with features of the mapping and classification process such as the land-cover classification scheme, minimum mapping unit, and spatial scale of the mapping. 3asampling 3athematic maps 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3aaccuracy 0acartography1 aCzaplewski, R.L.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g1998 June, v.  64, no.  3 p.331-344x0034-42577nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/367393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(98)00010-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20091223b20100101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/12/23  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03139naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003900113024002200152024001900174040001800193100002500211245013700236500002400373506007600397506017300473520106400646506003701710650002101747650000801768650002901776650001801805650003201823650001501855650001801870650001001888650001301898650001701911650002401928650001101952650001501963700001401978700001801992700001702010700002202027700002202049700002102071700001902092700001902111773010702130856011202237856008902349956011302438961001302551852000902564655001202573IND4463071420221207143538.0120423e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446307142DNAL7 a10113/551812hdl7 a10.1088/1468-6996/12/5/0550042doi7 aPMC50744362pmcid7 a278774422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitchuli, Narendiran10aMultifunctional ZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats by an electrospinning - electrospraying hybrid process for use in protective applications  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats were prepared by an electrospinning–electrospraying hybrid process in which ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of Nylon 6 nanofibers without becoming completely embedded. The prepared ZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats were evaluated for their abilities to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth and to catalytically detoxify chemicals. Results showed that these ZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats had excellent antibacterial efficiency (99.99%) against both the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus cereus bacteria. In addition, they exhibited good detoxifying efficiency (95%) against paraoxon, a simulant of highly toxic chemicals. ZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats were also deposited onto nylon/cotton woven fabrics and the nanofiber mats did not significantly affect the moisture vapor transmission rates and air permeability values of the fabrics. Therefore, ZnO/Nylon 6 nanofiber mats prepared by the electrospinning–electrospraying hybrid process are promising material candidates for protective applications.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aair 3aantibacterial properties 3acotton fabric 3adetoxification (processing) 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3anylon 3aparaoxon 3apermeability 3aprotective clothing 3avapors 3azinc oxide1 aShi, Quan1 aNowak, Joshua1 aKay, Kathryn1 aCaldwell, Jane M.1 aBreidt, Frederick1 aBourham, Mohamed1 aMcCord, Marian1 aZhang, Xiangwu0 tScience and technology of advanced materials.g2011 Oct., v. 12, no. 5wJournal:28309x1878-55147nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/551813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1468-6996/12/5/0550043Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/113431_Multifunctional_ZnO_Nylon_6_nanofiber_mats.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100002000187245007200207300001600279500002400295500001500319520163600334650001301970650001901983650004402002650001202046650002202058650001202080650001202092650002102104650002202125650002702147653001002174653002302184653002502207653001902232653002302251653001202274653002302286653002202309700001802331700002102349773007402370852000902444856011202453856008802565930003302653945002502686946001102711961001302722655001202735IND4433116020221116171702.0100222e20050228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443311602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2004.12.0102doi7 a10113/386862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aX1001 aAppell, Michael10aDFT study of α- and β-D-mannopyranose at the B3LYP/6-311++G level  ap. 459-468.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThirty-five conformations of α- and β-d-mannopyranose, the C-2 substituted epimer of glucopyranose, were geometry optimized using the density functional (B3LYP), and basis set (6-311++G**). Full geometry optimization was performed on the hydroxymethyl rotamers (gg/gt/tg) and an analytical hessian program was used to calculate the harmonic vibrational frequencies, zero point energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The lowest energy conformation investigated is the β-tg in the 4C1 chair conformation. The in vacuo calculations showed little energetic preference for either the α or β anomer for mannopyranose in the 4C1 chair conformation. Results are compared to similar glucopyranose calculations in vacuo where the α anomer is approximately 1 kcal/mol lower in electronic energy than the β anomer. In the case of the generally higher energy 1C4 chair conformations, one low-energy, low-entropy β-gg-1C4 chair conformation was identified that is within approximately 1.4 kcal/mol of the lowest energy 4C1 conformation of mannopyranose. Other 1C4 chair conformations in our investigation are approximately 2.9-7.9 kcal/mol higher in overall energy. Many of the 3,OB, B3,O, 1,4B, and B1,4 boat forms passed through transitions without barriers to 1S3, 5S1, 1S5 skew forms with energies between approximately 3.6 and 8.9 kcal/mol higher in energy than the lowest energy conformation of mannopyranose. Boat forms were found that remained stable upon gradient optimization. As with glucopyranose, the orientation and interaction of the hydroxy groups make a significant contribution to the conformation/energy relationship in vacuo. 3aenthalpy 3aenergy content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aglucose 3acrystal structure 3amannose 3aentropy 3ahydrogen bonding 3aGibbs free energy 3amolecular conformation 0aB3LYP 0adensity functional 0arelative free energy 0athermodynamics 0aanalytical methods 0aHessian 0achemical structure 0azero point energy1 aWillett, J.L.1 aMomany, Frank A.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2005 Feb. 28, v.  340, no.  3 p.459-4687nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2004.12.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100224b20100305c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/02/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03395naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100001700191245010300208300001600311500002400327520150700351650001901858650001501877650002401892650003701916650001901953650001401972650002601986650002202012650001202034650001002046650000802056650002602064650002502090650001402115650002302129650002202152650002502174650002402199651001202223653004002235653002402275700001702299700002102316700002202337700001702359773011002376852000902486856009202495856011202587930003302699945002502732946001102757961001302768655001202781IND4401591020221121200039.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440159102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00618.x2doi7 a10113/324152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aX1001 aConaghan, P.10aGenotype x environment interactions for herbage yield of perennial ryegrass sward plots in Ireland  ap. 107-120.  aIncludes references  aPerennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is by far the most widely sown grass species in Ireland. Genotype x environment (G x E) interactions are a frequent occurrence in herbage yield evaluations. The objectives were to determine (i) the nature and relative magnitudes of the pertinent G x E interaction variance components for dry matter yield of perennial ryegrass sward plots in Ireland and (ii) the optimal allocation of replicates, locations and years in a testing programme. Sixteen perennial ryegrass cultivars were sown at six locations throughout Ireland between 2000 and 2004. Plots from each sowing were harvested for 2 consecutive years under a simulated mixed grazing and conservation management programme. The largest component of the G x E variance was generally genotype x location x year emphasizing the need for evaluation of genotypes across locations and years to adequately characterize genotypes for differences in yield. Relative differences among genotypes from year to year and location to location were due mainly to changes in genotype rankings. Weather was estimated to have a greater effect on annual variation in herbage yield than age of stand. The optimum allocation of resources for a testing programme was estimated at four replicates per location, and either two locations and 3 sowing years or three locations and 2 sowing years with 2 harvest years for each sowing year. The most appropriate option depends on the relative importance of time vs. financial resources. 3aLolium perenne 3acrop yield 3aresource allocation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aforage grasses 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic variation 3aweather 3asward 3aage 3astand characteristics 3astatistical analysis 3aequations 3atemporal variation 3aspatial variation 3aspatial distribution 3aexperimental design 3aIreland 0agenotype x environment interactions 0avariance components1 aCasler, M.D.1 aMcGilloway, D.A.1 aO'Kiely, Padraig.1 aDowley, L.J.0 tGrass and forage science.g2008 Mar., v.  63, no.  1 p.107-120dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00618.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/324153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03537naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144100001800162245016800180300001800348500002400366500001500390520176600405650002602171650001702197650003402214650002002248650002602268650002302294650003102317650001202348650001902360650001802379650001102397650002502408653001102433653001702444653002702461653001202488700001502500700002102515700001702536700001702553700001802570700001702588773009202605852000902697856008102706856011202787930003302899945001302932946001302945961001302958655001202971IND2198651720221120045526.0990511e199812  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219865172DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.6.14372doi7 a10113/159652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, J.A.10aIntegration of nonchemical, postharvest treatments for control of navel orangeworm (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Indianmeal moth (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in walnuts  ap. 1437-1444.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aWe propose a treatment strategy combining an initial disinfestation treatment with 1 of 3 protective treatments as an alternative for chemical fumigation of walnuts for control of postharvest insect populations. The initial disinfestation treatment (0.4% O2 for 6 d) was designed to disinfest walnuts of field populations of navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker). The protective treatments were low temperature (10 degrees C) storage, controlled atmosphere (5% O2) storage, and application of the Indianmeal moth granulosis virus, and were designed to prevent establishment of indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner). The initial disinfestation treatment was effective against laboratory populations of navel orangeworm. Efficacy of protective treatments was determined by exposure to Indianmeal moth population levels far higher than those found in commercial walnut storage facilities. All 3 protective treatments prevented development of damaging Indianmeal moth populations as measured by pheromone trap catches and sample evaluation of the walnuts. No Indianmeal moths were trapped, nor were any seriously damaged walnuts (nuts with obvious damage that rendered the nutmeat less marketable or unmarketable) recovered from either low temperature or controlled atmosphere storage. Very low numbers of moths (less than or equal to 21/wk) were trapped from walnuts treated with virus, and only 0.2% of the walnuts were seriously damaged. In contrast, large numbers of moths (119-793/wk) were trapped from untreated nuts, and 35% of the sampled walnuts showed serious damage. Quality analysis by a commercial laboratory showed that overall walnut quality for all protective treatments was maintained at levels acceptable by industry standards. 3apostharvest treatment 3acold storage 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aBetabaculovirus 3aPlodia interpunctella 3apopulation density 3aintegrated pest management 3awalnuts 3ainsect control 3astorage pests 3aoxygen 3aAmyelois transitella 0adamage 0aGranulovirus 0acontrolled atmospheres 0aquality1 aVail, P.V.1 aSoderstrom, E.L.1 aCurtis, C.E.1 aBrandl, D.G.1 aTebbets, J.S.1 aValero, K.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Dec., v.  91, no.  6 p.1437-1444x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.6.14373Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/159653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080616b20080704c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02284naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001900140245008200159300001600241500002500257520125600282650001601538650001501554650001701569650001101586650001801597650002701615650001001642653001801652773007201670852000901742856011201751930003301863946001301896961001301909655001201922IND8904442120221120042507.0890817e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890444212DNAL7 a10113/240792hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1041 aNavickis, L.L.10aRheological changes of fortified wheat and corn flour doughs with mixing time  ap. 321-324.  aIncludes references.  aRheological properties of doughs blended from wheat and corn flours fortified with vital wheat gluten were measured on rested doughs for a series of mixing times (at increasing work energy inputs) all at the same water content. As mixing time increased, the volume of loaves baked from these doughs increased to a maximum, then decreased. The shear modulus obtained at small strains (0.2%) increased with mixing time, whereas the relaxation time generally decreased. The dynamic storage modulus G'  increased with mixing time while the loss modulus G'' decreased. The ratio G''/G' was close to 1.0 at the mixing time that gave the greatest loaf volume. This ratio (1.0) shifted to a longer mixing time at 1% higher water content. The response of these doughs to large torsional deformations was also examined. The maximum torque attained at first showed a stiffening dough, followed by less resistance as mixing time increased. The strain corresponding to the maximum torque generally decreased  until the doughs were mixed well past the point of minimum mobility. A similarity is noted between maximum torque values and maximum strains of these blended flours and extensigraph measurements reported for all-wheat flours as influenced by mixing times. 3awheat flour 3acorn flour 3awheat gluten 3amixing 3awater content 3arheological properties 3adough 0afortification0 tCereal chemistry.g1989 , v.  66, no.  4 p.321-324x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/240793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02905naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100002500197245017800222300001300400500002400413520122000437650001801657650001501675650002401690650003901714650001901753650001301772650002101785650001901806650002001825650001801845650000901863651001801872700002301890700002001913700002401933700002501957700002101982773007802003852000902081856011202090856008902202930003302291945002502324946001102349961001502360655001202375IND4432854320221116171339.0100218e199707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443285432DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-5877(96)01135-X2doi7 a10113/386892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aX2501 aLosinger, Willard C.10aDesign and implementation of the United States National Animal Health Monitoring System 1994-95 Cattle on Feed Evaluation, and an evaluation of the impact of response biases  ap. 1-14.  aIncludes references  aThe 1994-1995 Cattle on Feed Evaluation was a cooperative project (sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture) involving Washington State University, state agricultural departments, and several agencies of the United States Department of Agriculture). The project focused on cattle-on-feed operations in 13 states that accounted for over 85% of the United States cattle on feed inventory. Participants were selected from National Agricultural Statistics Service list frames. Questionnaires were administered by telephone to operations with a one-time capacity of fewer than 1000 cattle; larger operations were visited twice to administer questionnaires. The participation rate for the first phase of the study was 56.7%. Ninety-one percent of eligible operations completed the second phase of the study. Data summarized from this national study can be used to profile management practices on cattle-feeding operations in the United States. Differences between participants and non-participants did not appear to be great. However, one does need to be mindful of the fact that a small percentage of the producers accounted for the vast majority of feedlot cattle marketed when interpreting the results. 3aanimal health 3amonitoring 3ainformation systems 3aagricultural programs and projects 3acattle feeding 3afeedlots 3anational surveys 3aquestionnaires 3adata collection 3adata analysis 3aUSDA 3aUnited States1 aGarber, Lindsey P.1 aHill, George W.1 aDomseif, Stephen E.1 aRodriguez, Judith M.1 aFrye, William B.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g1997 July, v.  31, no.  1-2 p.1-147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-5877(96)01135-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100224b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03804naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133024002100174040001800195072000900213100002200222245011000244300001800354500002400372500001500396506007600411520130800487506003701795650001201832650002001844650002801864650002001892650001701912650002301929650002801952650002201980650001302002650001602015650001402031650001202045650003202057650002602089650001802115650002702133650001702160650005302177650001102230650002802241650003502269650002702304650002502331650002802356650001702384650009402401653001102495653001702506653004402523653001502567653002502582700002302607700002002630773010002650852000902750856009102759856011202850930003302962945002502995946001303020961001303033655001203046IND4372559820221207073012.0050720e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437255982DNAL7 a160007572pmid7 aPMC11690472pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.7.3524-3527.20052doi7 a10113/199502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2061 aRichards, Gary P.10aDevelopment of a Simple and Rapid Fluorogenic Procedure for Identification of Vibrionaceae Family Members  ap. 3524-3527.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a simple colony overlay procedure for peptidases (COPP) for the rapid fluorogenic detection and quantification of Vibrionaceae from seawater, shellfish, sewage, and clinical samples. The assay detects phosphoglucose isomerase with a lysyl aminopeptidase activity that is produced by Vibrionaceae family members. Overnight cultures are overlaid for 10 min with membranes containing a synthetic substrate, and the membranes are examined for fluorescent foci under UV illumination. Fluorescent foci were produced by all the Vibrionaceae tested, including Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., and Plesiomonas spp. Fluorescence was not produced by non-Vibrionaceae pathogens. Vibrio cholerae strains O1, O139, O22, and O155 were strongly positive. Seawater and oysters were assayed, and 87 of 93 (93.5%) of the positive isolates were identified biochemically as Vibrionaceae, principally Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Photobacterium damselae, and Shewanella putrefaciens. None of 50 nonfluorescent isolates were VIBRIONACEAE: No Vibrionaceae were detected in soil, and only A. hydrophila was detected in sewage. The COPP technique may be particularly valuable in environmental and food-testing laboratories and for monitoring water quality in the aquaculture industry.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aoysters 3aVibrio cholerae 3abacterial contamination 3aaminopeptidases 3afluorescence 3afood contamination 3apathogen identification 3afood microbiology 3aseawater 3aPlesiomonas 3aAeromonas 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCoumarinsxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aDipeptidesxmetabolism 2aFluorescence 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aOstreidaexmicrobiology 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aShellfishxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 2aVibrionaceaexclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0aVibrio 0aVibrionaceae 0acolony overlay procedure for peptidases 0apeptidases 0alysyl aminopeptidase1 aWatson, Michael A.1 aParveen, Salina0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 July, v.  71, no.  7 p.3524-3527x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.7.3524-3527.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/199503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081005b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03077naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002000141040001800161072000900179072000900188100001200197245013200209300001800341500002400359500001500383520108100398650001901479650001501498650001701513650002301530650003101553650002001584650001001604650001301614650001201627650001301639650001001652650001101662650001801673650003101691650000901722650000901731650002301740650002101763650001301784650001401797650003201811650002201843650001701865653004301882653001701925653001101942700001501953700001801968700001501986700001702001773007702018852000902095856008002104856011102184930003302295945002502328946001302353961001302366655001202379IND4364024320221118145113.0040820e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436402432DNAL7 a153390272pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.8.14672doi7 a10113/97932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ503 0aX6001 aLiu, Y.10aPrediction of physical, color, and sensory characteristics of broiler breasts by visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy  ap. 1467-1474.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe feasibility of predicting pH, color, shear force, and sensory characteristics of chicken breasts deboned at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h postmortem by visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) in the 400 to 1850 nm region was determined. Prediction of physical attributes of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color values (L*, a*, and b*), pH, and shear force had better accuracies than those of individual sensory attributes. Calibration and validation statistics for shear force and sensory traits indicated that visible/near infrared models were not significantly improved for cooked muscles compared with predictions based on raw muscle characteristics. On the basis of predicted shear values from the partial least squares (PLS) model, breast samples were classified into "tender" and "tough" classes with a correct classification of 74.0% if the boundary was set at 7.5 kg. The model developed from measured shears using soft independent modeling of class analogy/principal components analysis (SIMCA/PCA) showed nearly the same classification success. 3ashear strength 3ahot boning 3achicken meat 3asensory properties 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3ameat tenderness 3acolor 3aaccuracy 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aColor 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeat 2aPostmortem Changes 2aReference Values 2aRheology 2aSensation 2aSpectroscopy, Near-Infrared 2aSpectrum Analysis 2aTime Factors 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0ameat quality 0aboning1 aLyon, B.G.1 aWindham, W.R.1 aLyon, C.E.1 aSavage, E.M.0 tPoultry science.g2004 Aug., v.  83, no.  8 p.1467-1474x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.8.14673Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080211b20080301c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/05/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03439naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173100001400182245019900196300001400395500002400409500001500433520168700448650002302135650002102158650001602179650003002195650002502225650002702250650001802277650001202295650002302307650001102330650001902341650001802360650001402378653002802392653002102420653003002441653001102471700001502482700001602497700001802513773006802531852000902599856011202608856008302720930003302803945001302836946001102849961001302860655001202873IND2199019620221119055904.0990601s1998    ne |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND219901962DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10069628087122doi7 a10113/254632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF6001 aVidal, C.10aEffect of various liquid culture media on morphology, growth, propagule production, and pathogenic activity to Bemisia argentifolii of the entomopathogenic Hyphomycete, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus  ap. 33-46.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe entomopathogenic Hyphomycete Paecilomyces fumosoroseus was grown in five different liquid media, which have been developed for mass production of Beauveria spp. or P. fumosoroseus. Production was followed for 96 h by measuring both biomass and concentration of propagules. Maximal biomass was obtained with two media, Jackson and Catroux media (40-60 mg ml-1 suspension produced after 42 h incubation), where the exponential phase of growth began earlier than in the other media. While high concentrations of propagules (1.4-5.5 x 108 propagules ml-1) were produced in three media (Jackson, Paris, and Catroux media) after 48-72 h incubation, production of propagules was lower in the two other media, containing maltose as carbon source (Goral and Kondryatiev media) with 0.4-3.7 x 107 propagules ml-1 after 96 h incubation. P. fumosoroseus produced oblong blastospores in the three most productive media and conidiospore-like (ovoid to subspherical) propagules in the two other media. Infection potential of produced propagules was tested on the silverleaf whitefly, (Bemisia argentifolii). Whiteflies were sprayed as 2nd instars with P. fumosoroseus propagules produced in the five liquid media (1.9 x 103 and 1.9 x 104 propagules cm-2). All the media produced propagules that were infectious for larvae. With the lower dosage, mortality rates were significantly lower with propagules produced in one of the two least productive media (57%) (in the Kondryatiev medium) compared to those obtained with the three most productive media (>90%). However, when whiteflies were treated with the higher dosage, mortality rates (91-99%) between media were not significantly different. 3aIsaria fumosorosea 3aapplication rate 3asporulation 3abiological control agents 3aBemisia argentifolii 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3amaltose 3abiomass production 3alarvae 3afungal anatomy 3aculture media 3amortality 0aexperimental infections 0anutrient sources 0aPaecilomyces fumosoroseus 0agrowth1 aFagues, J.1 aLacey, L.A.1 aJackson, M.A.0 tMycopathologia.g1998, v.  143, no.  1 p.33-46x0301-486X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10069628087123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03307naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245017100166300001400337500002400351520134800375650001601723650001801739650002601757650001401783650001101797650001201808650001401820650001701834650003301851650001601884650001201900650001601912650002301928650004501951650001901996650005402015650003802069650001102107650004002118650005702158650004902215653002302264700001402287700001802301700001702319700001602336700001602352700002002368700001502388773007202403856011202475956009602587961001302683852000902696655001202705IND2197121620221118062613.0990220e19980701nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219712162DNAL7 a107344742pmid7 a10113/590972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasby, R.J.10aLuteal function and estrus in peripubertal beef heifers treated with an intravaginal progesterone releasing device with or without a subsequent injection of estradiol  ap. 55-63.  aIncludes references  aThe objectives of this experiment were to determine if treatment of beef heifers with progesterone (P4) using an intravaginal device alone or in combination with estradiol benzoate (EB) would induce estrus and cause development of corpora lutea (CL) with a typical life span. Peripubertal heifers (n=311) were used when about 40% of the heifers had a functional CL. The heifers were assigned to receive one of the following treatments on Day 0: 1) a sham device for 7 d (C, n=108); 2) an intravaginal device containing P4 for 7 d (P, n=102); or 3) an intravaginal device containing P4 for 7 d plus an injection of 1 mg EB 24 to 30 h after device removal (PE, n=101), Serum concentrations of P4 were determined on Days -7, 0, 8, 15 and 22. Weight and age of the heifers at the start of the trial averaged 292 +/- 45 kg and 365 +/- 38 d, respectively. A greater (P < 0.0001 ) proportion of the heifers from the PE than P group was in standing estrus (81 vs 37%) and formed normal CL (68 vs 44%) after device removal. Of the heifers exhibiting estrus, a greater (P < 0.05) proportion of PE (94%) than P (80%) heifers was active 1 to 3 d after implant removal. Short-term progesterone treatment increased the proportion of heifers in estrus and those forming normal CL, and adding EB to the progesterone treatment further enhanced these responses. 3abeef cattle 3acorpus luteum 3adrug delivery systems 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3aheifers 3alongevity 3aprogesterone 2aAdministration, Intravaginal 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCorpus Luteumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDrug Synergism 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEstrusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intravenousxveterinary 2aProgesteronexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSexual Maturationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0acontrolled release1 aDay, M.L.1 aJohnson, S.K.1 aKinder, J.E.1 aLynch, J.M.1 aShort, R.E.1 aWettemann, R.P.1 aHafs, H.D.0 tTheriogenology.g1998 July 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.55-63x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/590973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/113709_Therio_1998_50_55_63.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002100099040001800120072001700138100001600155245009800171300001600269500002500285500001500310520069200325650001401017650000901031650003001040650001701070650001201087650002301099650001301122650001201135650002501147650001201172650001201184650001101196650002101207650001801228650002001246650001401266650001301280650001401293650001201307653002001319653003201339653002001371653002101391653002101412653001801433700002101451700001501472700001601487773013001503852000901633856011201642930003301754945002501787946001301812961001301825655001201838991618937140742620221117203441.0780601s197707  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890476252DNAL7 a10113/285282hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As judged by titratable acidity and pH changes during growth, strain variation existed in the ability of the microorganisms to utilize the sugars. Strain NRRL B-1910 was a superior utilizer of raffinose and stachyose as measured by medium pH changes. Therefore, B-1910 was selected as inoculum for the successful production of a yoghurt-like soybean product, which has potential as a good protein food source. 3araffinose 3amilk 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3afermentation 3aglucose 3atitratable acidity 3afructose 3alactose 3anutrient utilization 3asucrose 3amannose 3ayogurt 3astarter cultures 3aacidification 3adietary protein 3agalactose 3asoybeans 3astachyose 3amaltose 0amonosaccharides 0ayogurt-like soybean product 0afermented foods 0asoybean products 0aoligosaccharides 0adisaccharides1 aHesseltine, C.W.1 aWang, H.L.1 aKonishi, F.0 tCanadian Institute of Food Science and Technology journal.g1977 July, v. 10, no. 3 p.197-200wJournal:12963x0315-54637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/285283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/04/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04318naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133024002100163040001800184072000900202100002600211245014100237300001800378500002400396506007600420520168300496506003702179650003302216650001602249650001202265650001402277650003202291650002202323650002202345650002402367650001602391650001902407650002402426650001202450650001102462650001402473650002002487650002302507650004202530650004802572650004502620650002902665650002802694650003102722650002302753650002702776650003202803650002202835650002302857650001002880650004202890650002302932650002202955653002202977653004102999700002803040700001503068700001803083700002203101700002303123773008103146852000903227856011203236856008003348930003303428945002503461946001303486961001303499655001203512IND4440841820221207083712.0100806e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444084182DNAL7 a190520792pmid7 aPMC26437712pmcid7 a10.1128/JVI.02112-082doi7 a10113/440502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 ade los Santos, Teresa12aA Conserved Domain in the Leader Proteinase of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Is Required for Proper Subcellular Localization and Function  ap. 1800-1810.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe leader proteinase (Lpro) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is involved in antagonizing the innate immune response by blocking the expression of interferon (IFN) and by reducing the immediate-early induction of kIFN-kβ mRNA and IFN-stimulated genes. In addition to its role in shutting off cap-dependent host mRNA translation, Lpro is associated with the degradation of the p65/RelA subunit of nuclear factor B (NF-B). Bioinformatics analysis suggests that Lpro contains a SAP (for SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain, a protein structure associated in some cases with the nuclear retention of molecules involved in transcriptional control. We have introduced a single or a double mutation in conserved amino acid residues contained within this domain of Lpro. Although three stable mutant viruses were obtained, only the double mutant displayed an attenuated phenotype in cell culture. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that Lpro subcellular distribution is altered in cells infected with the double mutant virus. Interestingly, nuclear p65/RelA staining disappeared from wild-type (WT) FMDV-infected cells but not from double mutant virus-infected cells. Consistent with these results, NF-kB-dependent transcription was not inhibited in cells infected with double mutant virus in contrast to cells infected with WT virus. However, degradation of the translation initiation factor eIF-4G was very similar for both the WT and the double mutant viruses. Since Lpro catalytic activity was demonstrated to be a requirement for p65/RelA degradation, our results indicate that mutation of the SAP domain reveals a novel separation-of-function activity for FMDV Lpro.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aproteinases 3amutants 3aphenotype 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3acytopathogenicity 3avirus replication 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aproteolysis 3acultured cells 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aConserved Sequence 2aEndopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-4Gxmetabolism 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aMutation, Missense 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtein Transport 2aSequence Alignment 2aSwine 2aTranscription Factor RelAxmetabolism 2aViral Plaque Assay 2aVirus Replication 0aleader proteinase 0atranslation initiation factor eIF-4G1 aDiaz-San Segundo, Fayna1 aZhu, James1 aKoster, Marla1 aDias, Camila C.A.1 aGrubman, Marvin J.0 tJournal of virology.g2009 Feb., v.  83, no.  4 p.1800-1810x1098-55147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/440503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02112-083Available from publisher's Web site  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/10/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01856naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002100188245009400209300001200303500002400315520044100339650001500780650001900795650002700814650002900841650001900870650001800889650003900907650005000946653002000996700002801016773008501044852000901129856011201138856008901250930003301339945002501372946001301397961001201410655001201422IND4430247020221123044749.0091221e199910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443024702DNAL7 a10.1016/S0034-4257(99)00053-X2doi7 a10113/367302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX620 0aX3301 aCohen, Warren B.10aValidating MODIS Terrestrial Ecology Products: Linking In Situ and Satellite Measurements  ap. 1-3.  aIncludes references  aThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is the principal high temporal frequency global mapping sensor on-board the NASA's Earth Observation System.

Sickness, behavioral, and physical responses  ap. 707-715.  aIncludes references  aGenetic variation in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was studied in chicken lines divergently selected for high (HGPS) and low (LGPS) group productivity and survivability resulting from cannibalism and flightiness in colony cages and in a Dekalb XL (DXL) commercial line. Six-week-old chicks were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and were injected intravenously with Escherichia coli LPS (5 mg/kg of BW) or distilled saline (control). Sickness responses were measured at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h following injection (n = 10 at each point in time for each line). Although LPS induced widespread sickness symptoms in all of the treated chicks, the reactions were in a genotypic- and phenotypic-specific manner. Compared with LGPS and DXL chicks, HGPS chicks had acute, transient behavioral and physical changes with less effect on BW gain, organ development, and core temperature, which were in the order HGPS < DXL < LGPS. The effects of heritable factors and LPS challenge on the differential responses among the present lines may reflect each line's unique adaptability to stress and resistance to infection and inflammation. The results suggested that the present chicken lines may provide a valuable animal model for investigating the effects of genetic-environmental interactions on the behavioral and physiological homeostasis in response to stress and disease. 3alaying hens 3aline differences 3aselection response 3astress tolerance 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3achicks 3alipopolysaccharides 3aEscherichia coli 3aliveweight gain 3atissue weight 3aspleen 3aheart 3aliver 3aadrenal glands 3abody temperature 3aanimal behavior1 aFreire, R.1 aPajor, E.A.0 tPoultry science.g2004 May, v.  83, no.  5 p.707-715x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.5.7073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080211b20080301c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03138naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183072000900192072000900201100002000210245014900230300001500379500002400394520130700418650002401725650001001749650002001759650001701779650002801796650002301824650002301847650002001870650002701890650004301917650002301960650001801983650004102001650002502042650004402067650001702111700001602128700001702144700001502161700001202176773007602188852000902264856011202273856009302385930003302478945002502511946001102536961001302547655001202560IND4367659320221118090343.0050315e20041126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436765932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.08.0032doi7 a10113/409942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL833 0aM001 0aM1201 aRodriguez, M.F.10aGenetic markers associated with resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis in rainbow and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) backcrosses  ap. 93-115.  aIncludes references  aBackcrosses of rainbow trout and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were used to construct a linkage map and to identify associations between molecular markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) determining resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). The sire map covers 1019 centimorgans (cM), and it is composed of 257 molecular markers [185 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and 72 microsatellites] distributed over 28 linkage groups. The dam map consists of 236 markers (164 AFLPs and 72 microsatellites), with a total of 45 linkage groups, covering 2041 cM. Sixty-one new microsatellite markers were added to the existing rainbow trout linkage maps. Six AFLPs and six microsatellites in the dam map were associated with IHNV resistance and were located in linkage groups 3, 14, 16, 30, 31, and 39. Sixteen AFLPs and six microsatellites associated with IHNV resistance were located in linkage groups 11, 20, and 25 in the sire map. Microsatellite markers mapped to the three linkage groups were used to screen nine other families, and QTL-marker associations were observed for four of the markers in at least one of the families. Further marker mapping is required to increase resolution and to ultimately facilitate positional cloning of QTLs affecting IHNV resistance. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atrout 3aanadromous fish 3abackcrossing 3aquantitative trait loci 3alinkage (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3adisease resistance 3afish diseases 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3ainvertebrate viruses 3aInfectious hematopoietic necrosis virus 3afish culture1 aLaPatra, S.1 aWilliams's'.1 aFamula, T.1 aMay, B.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Nov. 26, v.  241, no.  1-4 p.93-115x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/409943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2004.08.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/03/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03486naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100001700188245010200205300001600307500002400323500001500347520163700362650004301999650001602042650002002058650001102078650002502089650001102114650001902125650001402144650003302158650001102191650001102202650002602213650001502239650001902254650001902273650002402292650002002316650001002336651002102346653002302367653002802390653001102418700001602429700003102445773010402476852000902580856011202589856008902701930003302790945002502823946001102848961001302859655001202872IND4402982720080905221628.0080319e20080221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440298272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2007.11.0022doi7 a10113/182192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF7001 aIpek, Meryem10aGenetic characterization of Allium tuncelianum: An endemic edible Allium species with garlic odor  ap. 409-415.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aAllium tuncelianum (Kollman) Özhatay, Matthew & Şiraneci is a native species to the Eastern Anatolia. Its plant architecture resembles garlic (Allium sativum L.) and it has mild garlic odor and flavor. Because of these similarities between two species, A. tuncelianum has been locally called “garlic”. In addition, both A. tuncelianum and garlic has 16 chromosomes in their diploid genomes. Recently, A. tuncelianum has been suggested as the wild progenitor species of garlic. In this study, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers and nucleotide sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) were used to assess genetic and phylogenetic relationships among A. tuncelianum, garlic and some other Allium species. AFLP analysis demonstrated that A. tuncelianum and garlic are genetically distinct and they are likely different species. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequence of ITS suggested that A. tuncelianum and garlic are distinct species and placed A. tuncelianum, garlic, Allium ampeloprasum and Allium scorodoprasum into the same clade in the neighbor joining dendrogram and in the consensus tree of parsimony analysis. However, A. tuncelianum was phylogenetically less related to garlic than either A. ampeloprasum or A. scorodoprasum, suggesting that A. tuncelianum may not be the immediate wild ancestor species of garlic. Further studies to generate hybrid progeny between A. tuncelianum and garlic (if possible) could provide more information on the homology between the chromosomes of A. tuncelianum and garlic and genetic relationships between these two species. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3awild plants 3aspecialty crops 3agenome 3aAllium schoenoprasum 3agarlic 3aAllium sativum 3aphylogeny 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3achives 3aflavor 3amolecular systematics 3awild foods 3awild relatives 3aplant taxonomy 3aAllium ampeloprasum 3agenetic markers 3aodors 3aTurkey (country) 0aAllium tuncelianum 0amolecular sequence data 0aAllium1 aIpek, Ahmet1 aSimon, P.

Field data collected through the dairy herd improvement association from January 1997 to December 2003 and extracted from the Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory national database were used for analysis. Actual lactation records calculated from test-day yields using the test-interval method were used in this study. The model for analyses included herd-year of calving, year-state-month of calving, previous lactation record, age at calving, and days dry as a categorical variable. Fat and protein yield was maximized in the subsequent lactation with a 60-d dry period. Dry periods of 20 d or less resulted in substantial losses in fat and protein yield in the subsequent lactation. In contrast to yields, a short dry period was beneficial for fat and protein percentages. Short dry periods also resulted in fewer days open in the subsequent lactation; however, this was entirely due to the lower milk yield associated with shortened dry period. When adjusted for milk yield, short dry periods actually resulted in poorer fertility in the subsequent lactation. Long days dry improved somatic cell score in the subsequent lactation. Herds with mastitis problems should be cautious in shortening days dry because short dry periods led to higher cell scores in the subsequent lactation compared with 60-d dry. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3alactation 3afemale fertility 3amilk fat percentage 3adairy herd management 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 3adays open 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistryxcytologyxstandards. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aTime Factors 3aUnited States 0aoptimization 0amilk proteins 0amilk quality 0amilk fat 0adry period1 aHutchison, J.L.1 aNorman, H.D.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2006 May, v.  73, no.  2 p.154-162x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/324093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050015973Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/06/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03287naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133024002100174040001800195072000900213100002300222245008600245300001800331500002400349500001500373506007600388520149300464506003701957650002801994650001602022650002902038650001602067650001602083650004102099650004102140650002202181650002802203653001702231653001602248653001902264700002202283700001802305700002702323773009902350852000902449856009102458856011202549930003302661945002502694946001302719961001302732655001202745IND4369617720221207065340.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436961772DNAL7 a158703132pmid7 aPMC10875802pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.5.2288-2293.20052doi7 a10113/199442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aGunther, Nereus W.10aProduction of Rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas chlororaphis, a Nonpathogenic Bacterium  ap. 2288-2293.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRhamnolipids, naturally occurring biosurfactants constructed of rhamnose sugar molecules and {szligbeta}-hydroxyalkanoic acids, have a wide range of potential commercial applications. In the course of a survey of 33 different bacterial isolates, we have identified, using a phenotypic assay for rhamnolipid production, a strain of the nonpathogenic bacterial species Pseudomonas chlororaphis that is capable of producing rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipid production by P. chlororaphis was achieved by growth at room temperature in static cultures of a mineral salts medium containing 2% glucose. We obtained yields of roughly 1 g/liter of rhamnolipids, an amount comparable to the production levels reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown with glucose as the carbon source. The rhamnolipids produced by P. chlororaphis appear to be exclusively the mono-rhamnolipid form. The most prevalent molecular species had one monounsaturated hydroxy fatty acid of 12 carbons and one saturated hydroxy fatty acid of 10 carbons. P. chlororaphis, a nonpathogenic saprophyte of the soil, is currently employed as a biocontrol agent against certain types of plant fungal diseases. The pathogenic nature of all bacteria previously known to produce rhamnolipids has been a major obstacle to commercial production of rhamnolipids. The use of P. chlororaphis therefore greatly simplifies this matter by removing the need for containment systems and stringent separation processes in the production of rhamnolipids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aindustrial microbiology 3aglycolipids 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3asurfactants 3alipogenesis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGlycolipidsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPseudomonasxmetabolism 0arhamnolipids 0aPseudomonas 0abiosurfactants1 aNúñez, Alberto.1 aFett, William1 aSolaiman, Daniel K.

Hydrocarbons were examined for the presence of rubber, gutta, and waxes. Rubber and gutta were analyzed for weight-average molecular weight (ìw) and molecular weight distribution (MWD). Helianthus ciliaris had the highest oil yield (3.7%) and was analyzed for yield of fatty acids and unsaponifiable matter. Most taxa had low polyphenol yields (<10%), with H. strumosus having the highest (13.9%). Helianthus salicifolius yielded the most hydrocarbon (1.6%) and H. ciliaris had the highest protein content (13.4%). Natural rubber was present in 13 species of wild sunflowers. Helianthus maximiliani had the lowest ìw (29.8 x 103), while H. laevigatus had the highest (73.3 x 103). The MWD of rubber from sunflowers were within the range of those for commercial rubbers. The lower molecular weight rubbers may have potential as plasticizing additives in commercial processing of synthetic polyisoprenes and as hydrocarbon feedstock for a synthetic petroleum industry. 3aHelianthus 3awild plants 3arenewable resources 3achemical composition 3ahydrocarbons 3arubber 3aplant fats and oils 3apolyphenols 3aplant proteins 3aindustrial crops 3aUnited States 0arubber plants1 aCarr, M.E.1 aBagby, M.O.0 tEconomic botany.g1991 , v.  45, no.  1 p.4-14x0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/240663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028600453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aENE  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04352naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133024002100174040001800195072000900213072000900222072000900231072000900240100001800249245014500267300001800412500002400430500001500454506007600469520164700545506003702192650002302229650001502252650001002267650002402277650002802301650001302329650001402342650002002356650001902376650001002395650001502405650001102420650002302431650001102454650001302465650001302478650002302491650002202514650001202536650002502548650002402573650001202597650003502609650001802644650002302662650002502685650002702710650002902737650005302766650001302819650002802832650005902860653005702919653002802976653001803004653001403022700001803036700001703054700002003071773009903091852000903190856009103199856011203290930003303402945002503435946001303460961001303473655001203486IND4369622120221207065401.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436962212DNAL7 a158703572pmid7 aPMC10875382pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.5.2653-2662.20052doi7 a10113/199462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aF110 0aQ205 0aQ2031 aBrandl, M.

We have investigated the role of the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2) in the ability of S. enterica serovar Thompson to colonize the chicken intestine and the cilantro phyllosphere. A mutant of S. enterica serovar Thompson that is defective in AI-2 production was constructed by insertional mutagenesis of luxS. The population size of the S. enterica serovar Thompson parental strain was significantly higher than that of its LuxS⁻ mutant in the intestine, spleen, and droppings of chicks 12 days after their oral inoculation with the strains in a ratio of 1:1. In contrast, no significant difference in the population dynamics of the parental and LuxS⁻ strain was observed after their inoculation singly or in mixtures onto cilantro plants. Digital image analysis revealed that 54% of S. enterica serovar Thompson cells were present in large aggregates on cilantro leaves but that the frequency distributions of the size of aggregates formed by the parental strain and the LuxS⁻ mutant were not significantly different. Carbon utilization profiles indicated that the AI-2-producing strain utilized a variety of amino and organic acids more efficiently than its LuxS⁻ mutant but that most sugars were utilized similarly in both strains. Thus, inherent differences in the nutrients available to S. enterica in the phyllosphere and in the chicken intestine may underlie the differential contribution of AI-2 synthesis to the fitness of S. enterica in these environments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aluciferase 3agenes 3apopulation dynamics 3abacterial contamination 3alactones 3aphenotype 3acell aggregates 3aquorum sensing 3afeces 3aintestines 3aspleen 3apopulation density 3aleaves 3acilantro 3achickens 3afood contamination 3apathogen survival 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aSalmonella Thompson 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon-Sulfur Lyases 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCoriandrumxmicrobiology 2aHomoserinexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesis. 2aLactones 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSalmonella entericaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Thompson 0amolecular sequence data 0aautoinducer 2 0aluxS gene1 aMiller, W.

Dairy and feedlot operations in New Mexico produce 1.2 million tonnes of manure annually. Traditionally, manure has been used as a soil amendment in agriculture. However, land application of manure is limited in New Mexico due to problems with salinity, potential groundwater contamination, and limited availability of agricultural land. Waste treatment alternatives are sought. A two-phase anaerobic digestion system was used to evaluate the feasibility of producing methane and soil amendment from mixed agricultural wastes. Cotton gin waste and dairy manure were combined and used as feedstock. Under mesophilic conditions, 48% of the combined waste was converted into biogas. The gas yield was 87 m3 of methane per tonne of mixed waste. Methane concentration in the biogas averaged 72%. Gas production with mixed waste increased 35% compared to digesting dairy waste alone. Nutrient analyses of the residuals showed that they could be used as soil amendments. Residual solid material from the two-phase anaerobic digester had a considerably higher nitrogen and lower sodium content than aerobically composted manure. Anaerobic digestion lasted from one to three months and required 0.15 m3 of water per 1 m3 of waste.

Agricultural straw was subjected to thermal or alkali pulping prior to enzymatic saccharification. When wheat straw (WS) was treated at 170 degrees C for 30-60 min at a water-to-solids ratio of 7:1, the yield of cellulosic pulp was 70-82%. A sodium hydroxide extration yielded a 60% cellulosic pulp and a hemicellulosic fraction available for fermentation to ethanol. The cellulosic pulps were subjected to cellulase hydrolysis at 55 degrees C for production of sugars to support a 6-C fermentation. Hemicellulose was recovered from the liquor filtrates by acid/alcohol precipitation followed by acid hydrolysis to xylose for fermentation. Subsequent experiments have involved the fermentation of cellulosic and hemicelluosic hydrolysates to ethanol. Apparently these fermentations were inhibited by substances introduced by thermal and alkali treatment of the straws, because ethanol efficiencies of only 40-60% were achieved. Xylose from hydrolysis of wheat straw pentosans supported an ethanol fermentation by Pachysolen tannophilus strain NRRL 2460. This unusual yeast is capable of producing ethanol from both glucose and xylose. Ethanol yields were not maximal due to deleterious substances in the WS hydrolysates. 3ahemicellulose 3aglucose 3aalcoholic fermentation 3axylose 3ayeasts 3aPachysolen tannophilus 3awheat straw 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3aheat treatment 3aSaccharomyces bayanus 3aacid treatment 3asaccharification 0aSaccharomyces uvarum1 aCunningham, R.L.1 aBothast, R.J.1 aBagby, M.O.1 aHerman, A.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g1982 May, v.  24, no.  5 p.1105-1113x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.2602405073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/06  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03560naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111024002000152040001800172072000900190100001700199245006500216300001600281500002400297500002700321500001500348520156000363650001201923650002101935650001201956650001701968650002001985650001602005650001802021650002002039650003002059650001602089650001902105650001102124650001702135650001302152650001102165650002302176650001902199650001902218650000902237650001502246650001202261650001202273650001502285650001002300650002902310650002402339650002102363653002302384653002002407653003602427700001602463773007802479852000902557856009102566856011102657930003302768945002502801946001102826961001302837655001202850IND4394708920221118182513.0070906e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439470892DNAL7 a176074482pmid7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20070002000012doi7 a10113/35102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aDolinski, C.10aMicrobial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits  ap. 161-179.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Portuguese.  a2019-12-05  aA multitude of insects and mites attack fruit crops throughout the tropics. The traditional method for controlling most of these pests is the application of chemical pesticides. Growing concern on the negative environmental effects has encouraged the development of alternatives. Inundatively and inoculatively applied microbial control agents (virus, bacteria, fungi, and entomopathogenic nematodes) have been developed as alternative control methods of a wide variety of arthropods including tropical fruit pests. The majority of the research and applications in tropical fruit agroecosystems has been conducted in citrus, banana, coconut, and mango. Successful microbial control initiatives of citrus pests and mites have been reported. Microbial control of arthropod pests of banana includes banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (with EPNs and fungi) among others Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) is one of the most important pests of coconut and one of the most successful uses of non-occluded virus for classical biological control. Key pests of mango that have been controlled with microbial control agents include fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) (with EPNs and fungi), and other pests. Also successful is the microbial control of arthropod pests of guava, papaya and pineapple. The challenge towards a broader application of entomopathogens is the development of successful combinations of entomopathogens, predators, and parasitoids along with other interventions to produce effective and sustainable pest management. 3apapayas 3aMangifera indica 3amangoes 3amite control 3aPsidium guajava 3afruit trees 3aCarica papaya 3aentomopathogens 3abiological control agents 3aplant pests 3ainsect control 3aCitrus 3ainsect pests 3acoconuts 3aguavas 3abiological control 3aAnanas comosus 3aCocos nucifera 3aMusa 3apineapples 3abananas 2aAnimals 2aArthropods 2aFruit 2aPest Control, Biological 2aTreesxparasitology 2aTropical Climate 0aliterature reviews 0aarthropod pests 0atropical and subtropical fruits1 aLacey, L.A.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2007 , v.  36, no.  2 p.161-179x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20070002000013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/35103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03349naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151100001600169245014700185300001600332500002400348500001500372520174400387650001302131650001702144650001402161650001902175650001202194650001902206650001202225650001002237650001302247650002302260653002602283653001302309653001902322653002102341700001802362700001702380700001802397700001402415700002402429773008702453852000902540856011202549856008802661930003302749945001302782946001102795961001302806655001202819IND2053866920221119195136.0961104e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205386692DNAL7 a10.1016/0022-1910(95)00131-X2doi7 a10113/132402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWappner, P.10aRole of catecholamines and beta-alanine in puparial color of wild-type and melanic mutants of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata)  ap. 455-461.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aCeratitis capitata prepupae were microinjected with beta-alanine (BALA) and/or dopamine at the onset of pupariation to manipulate the phenotypes of wild-type and mutant strains. A mutant strain, Black pupa (B), reverted to the wild-type phenotype when injected with BALA, whereas black puparial cuticle was partially maintained when dopamine was co-injected with BALA. Phenocopies of the B mutant strain were obtained with injections of dopamine into wild-type prepupae, but partial or total inhibition of melanization occurred when BALA was co-injected. The puparial phenotype of another melanic mutant, niger (nig), remained unchanged when injected with BALA. Analysis of BALA content showed that the wild-type strain had twice the levels found in B and about half of those in the nig mutant. Reversed phase HPLC analysis of catecholamines in whole-body extracts showed that high levels of N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) and low levels of dopamine correlated with the 'brown phenotype', whether in the wild-type or the rescued B mutant. Conversely, B mutants contained high concentrations of dopamine, but only minor amounts of NBAD. The results suggest that B is probably defective in BALA synthesis, because BALA injections resulted in restoring NBAD and dopamine to normal levels similar to those of the wild-type and produced reddish-brown puparial cuticle. However, the nig mutant had high levels of endogenous BALA and dopamine, but low NBAD, and, therefore, apparently cannot synthesize NBAD. N-Acetyldopamine (NADA) concentrations were relatively high in both of the melanic mutants compared to the wild-type; therefore, NADA, rather than NBAD, may serve as the principal precusor for sclerotizing agents of black puparial cuticle. 3adopamine 3amelanization 3aphenotype 3asclerotization 3aalanine 3aanimal cuticle 3amutants 3acolor 3apuparium 3aCeratitis capitata 0an-beta-alanyldopamine 0amelanins 0acatecholamines 0an-acetyldopamine1 aHopkins, T.L.1 aKramer, K.J.1 aCladera, J.L.1 aManso, F.1 aQuesada-Allue, L.A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1996 May, v.  42, no.  5 p.455-461x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1910(95)00131-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03047naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100001700191245015900208300001600367500002400383520136800407650002601775650002401801650001501825650001401840650001801854650002401872650002401896650001701920650003301937650002401970650002401994653001802018700001502036700001602051700001702067700001602084700001502100773011902115852000902234856011202243856009202355930003302447945002502480946001102505961001302516655001202529IND4407944520221118012447.0080718e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440794452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01180.x2doi7 a10113/314292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL2101 aWhitlock, BK10aComparative Aspects of the Endotoxin- and Cytokine-Induced Endocrine Cascade Influencing Neuroendocrine Control of Growth and Reproduction in Farm Animals  ap. 317-323.  aIncludes references  aDisease in animals is a well-known inhibitor of growth and reproduction. Earlier studies were initiated to determine the effects of endotoxin on pituitary hormone secretion. These studies found that in sheep, growth hormone (GH) concentration was elevated, whereas insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) was inhibited, as was luteinizing hormone (LH). Examination of the site of action of endotoxin in sheep determined that somatotropes expressed the endotoxin receptor (CD14) and that both endotoxin and interleukin-Iβ activated GH secretion directly from the pituitary. In the face of elevated GH, there is a reduction of IGF-I in all species examined. As GH cannot activate IGF-I release during disease, there appears to be a downregulation of GH signalling at the liver, perhaps related to altered nitration of Janus kinase (JAK). In contrast to GH downregulation, LH release is inhibited at the level of the hypothalamus. New insights have been gained in determining the mechanisms by which disease perturbs growth and reproduction, particularly with regard to nitration of critical control pathways, with this perhaps serving as a novel mechanism central to lipopolysaccharide suppression of all signalling pathways. This pathway-based analysis is critical to the developing novel strategies to reverse the detrimental effect of disease on animal production. 3afarmed animal species 3alipopolysaccharides 3aendotoxins 3acytokines 3aanimal growth 3aanimal reproduction 3ahormonal regulation 3asomatotropin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aluteinizing hormone 3asignal transduction 0aGH signalling1 aDaniel, JA1 aWilborn, RR1 aElsasser, TH1 aCarroll, JA1 aSartin, JL0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2008 July, v.  43, no.  s2 p.317-323dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/314293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01180.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b20090801c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/07/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04452naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002200126024001900148024002100167040001800188072001700206072001700223100002400240245011700264500002400381500001500405506007600420520214100496506003702637650003402674650003102708650001202739650003002751650002602781650002802807650005202835650002202887650002902909650001802938650001702956650002102973650003102994653003303025653001103058653002003069653006503089700001703154700001803171700001903189700002503208700002203233700002103255700002703276700002303303700001903326700002303345700002003368773007903388852000903467856011203476856008403588930003303672945002503705946001103730961001303741655001203754IND4434748220221207144711.0100330s2009    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443474822DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2164-10-6092doi7 aPMC28056962pmcid7 a200035342pmid7 a10113/401452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAdhikari, Bishwo N.10aTranscriptional profiling of trait deterioration in the insect pathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The success of a biological control agent depends on key traits, particularly reproductive potential, environmental tolerance, and ability to be cultured. These traits can deteriorate rapidly when the biological control agent is reared in culture. Trait deterioration under laboratory conditions has been widely documented in the entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Hb) but the specific mechanisms behind these genetic processes remain unclear. This research investigates the molecular mechanisms of trait deterioration of two experimental lines of Hb, an inbred line (L5M) and its original parental line (OHB). We generated transcriptional profiles of two experimental lines of Hb, identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and validated their differential expression in the deteriorated line. Results: An expression profiling study was performed between experimental lines L5M and OHB of Hb with probes for 15,220 ESTs from the Hb transcriptome. Microarray analysis showed 1,185 DEGs comprising of 469 down- and 716 up-regulated genes in trait deteriorated nematodes. Analysis of the DEGs showed that trait deterioration involves massive changes of the transcripts encoding enzymes involved in metabolism, signal transduction, virulence and longevity. We observed a pattern of reduced expression of enzymes related to primary metabolic processes and induced secondary metabolism. Expression of sixteen DEGs in trait deteriorated nematodes was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) which revealed similar expression kinetics for all the genes tested as shown by microarray. Conclusion: As the most closely related major entomopathogen to C. elegans, Hb provides an attractive near-term application for using a model organism to better understand interspecies interactions and to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying trait deterioration in biological control agents. This information could also be used to improve the beneficial traits of biological control agents and better understand fundamental aspects of nematode parasitism and mutualism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aenzymes 3abiological control agents 3amicroarray technology 3aexpressed sequence tags 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agenetic stability 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3ainbred lines 3aline differences 3agene expression regulation 0adifferential gene expression 0atraits 0atrait stability 0aquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aLin, Chin-Yo1 aBai, Xiaodong1 aCiche, Todd A.1 aGrewal, Parwinder S.1 aDillman, Adler R.1 aChaston, John M.1 aShapiro-Ilan, David I.1 aBilgrami, Anwar L.1 aGaugler, Randy1 aSternberg, Paul W.1 aAdams, Byron J.0 tBMC genomics.g2009, v.  10, no.  609wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-6093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/04/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02687naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002300205245011800228300001800346500002400364520104100388650002501429650001601454650002301470650001301493650002001506650002901526650002101555650001401576650000901590650002201599651001801621653002201639653002701661700002201688700002101710700002201731773011401753852000901867856011201876856008801988930003302076945002502109946001102134961001202145655001202157IND4427278220221122034505.0091012e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442727822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0112doi7 a10113/351242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aK200 0aX100 0aX2001 aReynolds, Keith M.10aNational fuel-treatment budgeting in US federal agencies: Capturing opportunities for transparent decision-making  ap. 2373-2381.  aIncludes references  aThe Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system has been used by the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Bureaus of the Department of the Interior since 2006 to evaluate wildfire potential across all administrative units in the continental US, and to establish priorities for allocating fuel-treatment budgets.

EMDS aids the budget allocation process by providing a rational, transparent, and reproducible process that can be clearly communicated to Congressional staff and oversight personnel.

Research and policy discussions highlight the role of forests in reducing greenhouse gases by storing carbon. An important factor regarding forests and carbon is simply maintaining the amount of land that is retained in forest cover. Since 1973, Oregon's statewide land-use planning program has sought to maintain forest and agricultural lands in the face of increasing development by maintaining forest and agricultural zones and to limit growth to within urban growth boundaries. We combine projections of forest and agricultural land development with estimates of average carbon stocks for different land uses to examine what effect land-use planning has had in maintaining forest carbon in western Oregon. In addition to other benefits arising from the conservation of forestland, results indicate that Oregon's land-use planning system in western Oregon yields significant gains in carbon storage equivalent to a reduction of 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per year. 3acarbon sequestration 3aforests 3aland use planning 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aagricultural land 3aOregon1 aKline, J.D.1 aDelaney, M.1 aTilton, M.0 tJournal of forestry.g2007 June, v.  105, no.  4 p.167-172x0022-12017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/31433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070913b20071002c00000000  aINDdARSe2007/08/09  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03330naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172100001500181245024800196300001600444500002400460520160400484650001302088650001702101650001502118650001602133650003002149650002902179650003002208650003202238650001402270650002502284650001402309650001402323650002002337650001002357653002602367653002702393653003102420773007702451852000902528856011102537856009202648930003302740945002502773946001302798961001302811655001202824IND4380313720221121034245.0060519e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438031372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.01.0162doi7 a10113/18202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aLord, J.C.10aInteraction of Mattesia oryzaephili (Neogregarinorida: Lipotrophidae) with Cephalonomia spp. (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) and their hosts Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae) and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae)  ap. 167-172.  aIncludes references  aThe neogregarine, Mattesia oryzaephili, is pathogenic for several stored-grain pest insects, including the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, and the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus. It also infects their respective bethylid parasitoids, Cephalonomia tarsalis and Cephalonomia waterstoni. Male wasps do not attack the beetle larvae and do not become infected, but the disease is transmitted per os to nearly all female wasps when they paralyze or feed on infected hosts. The mean survival time of infected female C. tarsalis after exposure to heavily infected O. surinamensis was 20.0 days, while that of healthy C. tarsalis was 38.0 days. For C. waterstoni females, the mean survival times were 36.1 days when infected and 45.9 days when uninfected. The long survival time of infected wasps fosters oviposition and inoculum deposition in the hosts' habitat. The wasps sting and bite infected host larvae and sometimes oviposit. Wasp progeny that are deposited on infected host larvae rapidly succumb to M. oryzaephili. Two-hour wasp confinement with patently infected larvae resulted in no transmission from C. waterstoni to C. ferrugineus and 4% transmission from C. tarsalis to O. surinamensis. Contamination of wheat by wasps after they had attacked infected beetles resulted in 8.9% infection of O. surinamensis that developed from eggs that were placed on the contaminated wheat. It is proposed that Cephalonomia spp. can be used as a means to inoculate M. oryzaephili into pest grain beetle populations and aid in its dispersal to help suppress pest populations. 3aMattesia 3aCephalonomia 3agregarines 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aCryptolestes ferrugineus 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ainfection 3adisease transmission 3amortality 3afecundity 3astorage insects 3awheat 0aCephalonomia tarsalis 0aCephalonomia watersoni 0anatural enemy interactions0 tBiological control.g2006 May, v.  37, no.  2 p.167-172x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/18203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.01.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/06/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02420naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168100002300177245007900200300001600279500002400295520124700319650001301566650000901579650001901588650001601607700002201623700002001645773009101665852000901756856011201765856008701877930003301964945002501997946001102022961001302033655001202046IND4414907720090207005349.0090113e20090130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441490772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2008.03.0042doi7 a10113/227042hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aCiganda, Verónica10aNon-destructive determination of maize leaf and canopy chlorophyll content  ap. 157-167.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to develop a rapid non-destructive technique to estimate total chlorophyll (Chl) content in a maize canopy using Chl content in a single leaf. The approach was (1) to calibrate and validate a reflectance-based non-destructive technique to estimate leaf Chl in maize; (2) to quantify the relative contribution of each leaf Chl to the total Chl in the canopy; and (3) to establish a relationship between leaf Chl content and total Chl in a maize canopy. The Red Edge Chlorophyll Index CIred edge=(RNIR/Rred edge)-1 based on reflectances, R, in the red edge (720-730 nm) and near infrared (770-800 nm) was found to be an accurate measure of maize leaf Chl. It was able to predict leaf Chl ranging from 10 to 805 mg Chl m-2 with root mean-square error less than 38 mg Chl m-2. Relationships between Chl content in each maize leaf and total canopy Chl content were established and showed that Chl in the collar leaf before silking or ear leaves explained more than 80% and 87% of the variation in total Chl in a maize canopy, respectively. Thus, non-destructive measurements of both reflectance and area of a single leaf (either collar or ear) can be used to accurately estimate total Chl content in a maize canopy. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll1 aGitelson, Anatoly1 aSchepers, James0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2009 Jan. 30, v.  166, no.  2 p.157-167x0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/227043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2008.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090121b20090206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/01/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02732naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100002000157245011300177500002400290520107600314650002201390650001001412650001101422650001801433650002001451650002701471650001001498650003201508650001601540650002801556650002701584650002201611650002501633650003001658650001201688650000901700651001801709653002101727653002801748700001701776700001601793700001601809700001901825700001701844773009701861852000901958856011101967930003302078945002502111946000902136961000902145655001202154IND4397046020221123043314.0071024e20011113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439704602DNAL7 a10113/63142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF200 0aD5001 aFrederick, R.D.10aMethod for differentiating between the casual agents of karnal bunt wheat fungus and ryegrass smut using PCR  aIncludes references  aKarnal bunt of wheat is caused by Tilletia indica Mitra.

Previously developed PCR assays failed to differentiate T. indica from the newly discovered ryegrass pathogen, T. walkeri. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb region of mitochondrial DNA, previously amplified by PCR only from T. indica, was determined for three isolates of T. indica and for three isolates of T. walkeri. There was greater than 99% identity within either the T. indica group or the T. walkeri group of isolates, whereas there was approximately 3% divergence between isolates of these two Tilletia species. Five sets of PCR primers were made specific to T. indica, and three sets were designed specifically for T. walkeri based upon nucleotide differences within the mtDNA region. In addition, a 212 bp amplicon was developed as a target sequence in a fluorogenic 5' nuclease PCR assay using the TaqMan system for the detection and discrimination of T. indica and T. walkeri. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aLolium 3asmut diseases 3aTilletia indica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aseeds 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3ateliospores 3apathogen identification 3amolecular epidemiology 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apatents 3aUSDA 3aUnited States 0aTilletia walkeri 0amolecular sequence data1 aTooley, P.W.1 aBonde, M.R.1 aKnorr, D.A.1 aPeterson, G.L.1 aSchaad, N.W.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2001 Nov. 13, , no.

Specifications mandating biodiesel quality, most notably in Europe (EN 14214) and the USA (ASTM D6751), have emerged that limit feedstock choice in the production of biodiesel fuel. For instance, EN 14214 contains a specification for iodine value (IV; 120 g I₂/100 g maximum) that eliminates soybean oil as a potential feedstock, as it generally has an IV >120. Therefore, partially hydrogenated soybean oil methyl esters (PHSME; IV = 116) were evaluated as biodiesel by measuring a number of fuel properties, such as oxidative stability, low-temperature performance, lubricity, kinematic viscosity, and specific gravity. Compared to soybean oil methyl esters (SME), PHSME were found to have superior oxidative stability, similar specific gravity, but inferior low-temperature performance, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity. The kinematic viscosity and lubricity of PHSME, however, were within the prescribed US and European limits. There is no universal value for low-temperature performance in biodiesel specifications, but PHSME have superior cold flow behavior when compared to other alternative feedstock fuels, such as palm oil, tallow and grease methyl esters. The production of PHSME from refined soybean oil would increase biodiesel production costs by US$ 0.04/L (US$ 0.15/gal) in comparison to SME. In summary, PHSME are within both the European and American standards for all properties measured in this study and deserve consideration as a potential biodiesel fuel. 3asoybean oil 3avegetable oil 3afatty acid composition 3aviscosity 3aoxidative stability 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aesters 3aspectral analysis 3abiodiesel 3ahydrogenation 3agas chromatography 0achemical composition 0amethyl esters 0aoxidative stability index 0aphysicochemical properties1 aHaas, M.J.1 aWinkler, J.K.1 aJackson, M.A.1 aErhan, S.Z.1 aList, G.R.0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2007 Jan., v.  109, no.  1 p.17-24x1438-93127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/32403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2006002153Available from publisher's Web site  a20070914b20071002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/09/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01581naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002300149245011400172500002400286520023800310650003100548650003000579650001900609650002400628650001000652650001500662650001700677650001800694650001200712650000900724651001800733653002000751653002500771700001800796700001600814773009600830852000900926856011200935930003301047945002501080946000901105961000901114655001201123IND4406371420221122155915.0080605e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440637142DNAL7 a10113/159502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aD5001 aShapiro-Ilan, D.I.10aApplication of entomopathogenic nematode-infected cadavars from hard-bodied arthropods for insect suppression  aIncludes references  aPesticidal and/or antimicrobial biological agent-infected hard-bodied arthropod cadavers, such as from the family Tenebrionidae are used to control pest and/or microbial infestations in agriculture, commercial and urban environments. 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3ainsect control 3aapplication methods 3ahosts 3aarthropods 3adead animals 3aTenebrionidae 3apatents 3aUSDA 3aUnited States 0ainsect cadavers 0acadaver formulations1 aTedders, W.L.1 aLewis, E.E.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2008 May 20, , no.

Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key cytochrome P450 CYP74 enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of plant oxylipin jasmonates to convert 13(S)-hydroperoxide to allene oxide. Guayule (Parthenium argentatum) AOS, CYP74A2, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Protein was purified using affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, and then crystallized. Two different crystal forms were obtained from 0.2 M (NH4)H2PO4, 50% MPD, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5 at 277 K using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Preliminary X-ray analysis was carried out, and the crystals were found to belong to the tetragonal space group I422 with cell parameters a = b = 126.5, c = 163.9 angstrom, and the monoclinic space group C2 with cell parameters a = 336.5, b = 184.2, c = 159.0 angstrom, β = 118.6°.

About three-fourths of these species have been from central and southern Illinois, but only about 2% have been from arid or semiarid regions of the USA. For this report, 100 species collected from Arizona were evaluated, bringing the total number of species evaluated at this Center to 700 in 96 families. Plant specimens were analyzed for yields  of fractions referred to as "oil", "polyphenol", "hydrocarbon", and protein and were examined for botanical characteristics. Oil and hydrocarbon fractions of selected species were partially characterized. Ten species gave high yields of oil and/or polyphenol. for example, Asclepias linaria yielded 8.7% oil (dry, ash-free sample basis) + 11.7% polyphenol (1.9% hydrocarbon). Rhus choriophylla yielded 7.0% oil + 20% polyphenol (0.4% hydrocarbon) and Juglans major yielded 7.0% oil + 9.4% polyphenol (0.2% hydrocarbon). Pittosporum tobira gave the highest yield of hydrocarbon (2.3%). Fourteen species contained at least 18% protein. In general, the percentages of species yielding substantial amounts of oil and/or polyphenol were considerably higher for the Arizona species than for those 600 species previously analyzed. Complete analytical data are presented for 38 species and are discussed in relationship to the 600 species previously reported. 3axerophytes 3aenergy resources 3arenewable resources1 aPhillips, B.S.1 aBagby, M.O.0 tEconomic botany.g1985 , v.  39, no.  4 p.505-513x0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028587583Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/240583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aENE  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02628naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245009800174300001600272500002400288500002300312500001500335520095200350650002501302650002501327650001101352650001501363650002601378650002201404650002301426650001601449650002301465650001601488650002801504650002401532651002101556653001401577653001201591653002701603653001501630700001501645700001901660700001801679773007801697852000901775856011201784856007201896930003301968945002502001946001102026961001302037655001202050IND4407424720221122222705.0080702e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440742472DNAL7 a10113/167872hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aL300 0aL0011 aRatti, C.M.10aBumble bees influence berry size in commercial Vaccinium spp. cultivation in British Columbia  ap. 348-363.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  a
We studied the abundance, diversity, and dispersion patterns of managed and wild bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) populations in commercial highbush blueberry and cranberry (Ericaceae: Vaccinium corymbosum L., Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) fields in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, and assessed their potential as pollinators of these crops by determining which groups of bees had the greatest impact on percent yield and mass of berries. Bumble bees were evenly distributed within both crops. Other wild bee species were well distributed in blueberry fields but generally remained at edges of cranberry fields. Percent berry yield was not related to bee abundance for any group of bees, nor was species diversity correlated with berry mass. Blueberry mass and cranberry mass were related to abundance of bumble bees but not to that of honey bees or other wild bees. Bumble bees are recommended as potential alternative pollinators of these crops. 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aspatial distribution 3aBombus 3acrop yield 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation density 3acranberries 3ainsect pollination 3ablueberries 3aalternative pollinators 3apollinating insects 3aBritish Columbia 0awild bees 0aApoidea 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0afruit size1 aHigo, H.A.1 aGriswold, T.L.1 aWinston, M.L.0 tCanadian entomologist.g2008 , v.  140, no.  3 p.348-363x0008-347X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/167873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://esc-sec.org/canent1.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/07/08  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03456naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245016600210300001400376500002400390500003400414500001500448520163800463650001802101650002302119650001502142650002402157650001502181650001902196650002502215650001702240650003402257650001902291650001602310650002602326650001902352650002502371650001302396650001802409653001802427653001002445653001002455700001902465700002502484773006002509852000902569856008202578856011202660930003302772945002502805946001102830961001302841655001202854IND4434750920221118185254.0100330e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443475092DNAL7 a10.1051/fruits/20090392doi7 a10113/401342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ305 0aQ205 0aQ1151 aMercier, Julien10aIn-package use of Muscodor albus volatile-generating sachets and modified atmosphere liners for decay control in organic table grapes under commercial conditions  ap. 31-38.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French and Spanish  a2019-12-05  aIntroduction. In-package biofumigation with the volatile-producing fungus Muscodor albus was tested to control fungal decay in organic table grapes stored at a commercial packinghouse. Materials and methods. Sachets containing two different amounts of activated M. albus culture were inserted into shipping boxes containing approximately 4.5 kg of 'Thompson Seedless' or 'Red Seedless' table grapes. The volatiles were contained inside the boxes either by wrapping pallets of the boxes externally with plastic film after pre-cooling (pallet wrapping) or by using a modified atmosphere liner inside each box. Decay incidence was evaluated after 7 weeks of storage at 0 °C. Results. The M. albus sachets reduced decay incidence among 'Red Seedless' table grapes in both wrapped pallets and boxes with liners. In this cultivar, the modified atmosphere liner alone reduced decay incidence by about 70% and the M. albus treatment in the liner further reduced decay incidence, regardless of the amount of M. albus used. The combination of the M. albus sachet and the modified atmosphere liner proved to be the most effective decay control treatment. Decay incidence was lower among 'Thompson Seedless' table grapes and a significant decay control was only observed after the grapes had been allowed to warm up after storage with the 50-g rates applied inside the liner. No adverse effects were associated with the treatment or the liners. Discussion. Based on our results, biofumigation with M. albus sachets is compatible with the commercial handling of organic table grapes and could provide significant improvement in their shelf life. 3afood spoilage 3avolatile compounds 3afumigation 3apackaging materials 3ashelf life 3afood transport 3apostharvest diseases 3atable grapes 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood packaging 3adecay fungi 3asecondary metabolites 3apacking houses 3afood biopreservation 3ashipping 3aorganic foods 0abiofumigation 0aboxes 0afungi1 aLego, Sarah F.1 aSmilanick, Joseph L.0 tFruits.g2010 , v.  65, no.  1 p.31-38x0248-12947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/fruits/20090393Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01967naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012900173300001600302520084900318653001601167653002501183653001401208653001701222653002701239700001901266700002101285700001501306700001801321773014501339852000901484856009201493930003301585946001101618655001201629IND4417642320221122033459.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441764232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02240.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheun, Hyeong-Il10aElimination of lymphatic filariasis in the Republic of Korea: an epidemiological survey of formerly endemic areas, 2002-2006  ap. 445-449.  aTo determine the current status of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Korea. Epidemiological surveys between 2002 and 2006 in areas where LF was previously endemic: remote and coastal areas Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, and Jeju-do, and inland Gyeongsangbuk-do. We took night blood smears from 9426 people for microfilaria testing and assayed samples from 3049 children (10- to 13-year-olds) and 1526 adults for Brugia malayi antibodies. We found two cases (0.01%) with low microfilaria density in their peripheral blood (1-2/20 μl) on the remote island of Jeollanam-do in the southern part of the Korean peninsula. These patients, males over 60-years old, were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). None of the 4575 people surveyed tested positive for specific B. malayi antibodies.

Study of their in vitro cytotoxicities showed that the two proteins selectively injured choriocarcinoma and melanoma cells. Hepatoma cells represented the most resistant cell line among the various cell lines investigated. Cytotoxicity profiles of trichosanthin and alpha-momorcharin differed from those of anti-cancer drugs which interfere with DNA metabolism such as cisplatin, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. Radioactive precursor incorporation studies suggested that the two abortifacient proteins inhibited cellular protein synthesis. The marked decrease in secretion of human chorionic gonadotrophin and progesterone by choriocarcinoma cells after treatment with the proteins could be attributed mainly to loss of cells. 3aTrichosanthes kirilowii 3aplant proteins 3atoxins 3acytotoxicity 3acell lines 3acarcinoma 2aAbortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidalxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellular 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cell 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aChoriocarcinoma 2aChorionic Gonadotropinxsecretion. 2aCisplatinxtoxicity 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxtoxicity 2aFluorouracilxtoxicity 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasms 2aMelanoma 2aMethotrexatextoxicity 2aPlant Proteinsxtoxicity 2aProgesteronexsecretion. 2aRibosomal Proteins 2aRibosome Inactivating Proteins 2aTrichosanthinxtoxicity 2aTumor Cells, Cultured1 aNg, T.B.1 aYeung, H.W.0 tToxicon.g1990, v. 28, no. 10 p.1183-1192x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02997naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010600143300001600249520153500265650001201800650001401812650001201826650001401838650001301852650001301865650001701878650002301895650000801918650001401926650001201940650001201952650002801964650004201992650001402034650005202048650003702100650001202137650005002149650000902199650001702208650003502225653002002260700001702280700001902297773008502316852000902401930003302410945001302443946001102456655001202467IND2054623420221122033536.0961223e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205462342DNAL7 a76265932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, P.H.14aThe responses of blood galactose to oral doses of lactose, galactose plus glucose and milk to piglets  ap. 753-761.  aThe capacity of intestinal lactase (EC 3.2.1.23) of piglets to hydrolyse lactose in vivo was investigated by measuring the response of blood galactose to doses of lactose, galactose plus glucose and both whole and skimmed milk. Following the administration of oral doses of lactose dissolved in water to piglets from 2 to 18 d of age the adjusted galactose area under the curve (AUC) was between 1.12 and 1.36 arbitrary units, while following a dose of galactose plus glucose dissolved in water it was between 1.56 and 1.98 arbitrary units. Whereas these results suggest that the rate of digestion of lactose appeared to limit the amount of galactose reaching the peripheral blood after a dose of lactose dissolved in water, there was no significant correlation between the capacity of piglets to hydrolyse physiological amounts of lactose and the age of the piglets (2- to 18-d-old piglets; r 0.11). Following oral doses of sow's milk containing either lactose, or galactose plus glucose, the adjusted galactose AUC Values were 0.94 and 1.00 arbitrary units respectively, in 10-d-old piglets. Thus, the limitation to the digestion of lactose observed when it was present in water was not evident for lactose in sow's milk. Since there was no significant difference between the adjusted galactose AUC following a dose of whole milk (0.95 arbitrary units) and that following a dose of skimmed milk (1.03 arbitrary units), the presence of fat in sow's milk did not appear to affect the utilization of lactose by the sucking piglets. 3alactose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3askim milk 3asuckling 3asow milk 3ablood plasma 3abeta-galactosidase 3aage 3adigestion 3apiglets 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxblood 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aGalactosexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aGlucosexadministration & dosage 2aLactase 2aLactosexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aMilk 2aSwinexblood 2abeta-Galactosidasexmetabolism 0aage differences1 aAtwood, C.S.1 aHartmann, P.E.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1995 May, v. 73, no. 5 p.753-761x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01887naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013200174300001600306520084500322650001201167650001701179653001101196653002001207653001501227700002001242700002101262773014501283852000901428856009201437930003301529946001101562655001201573IND4417641520221122020902.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441764152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02247.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Michael D.10aRapid colorimetric field test to determine levels of deltamethrin on PermaNet® surfaces: association with mosquito bioactivity  ap. 381-388.  aTo evaluate a simple and inexpensive colorimetric test to measure the amount of cyanopyrethroid insecticide residue from filter paper exposed to mosquito net surfaces.

Handling animals is essential for many applications in wildlife management. However, currently there are limited techniques to safely handle and move large mobile pinnipeds, particularly when they cannot be physically restrained first. Such animals can be the cause of many land-based wildlife-human conflicts. The New Zealand (NZ) sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) is the world's rarest and second largest otariid, and is in severe decline. Although most NZ sea lions live on uninhabited NZ subantarctic islands, a small population is recolonising the coastline of Otago, NZ and this close proximity with humans can cause conflict. Aims. The aim of this research was to assess a method of remote chemical anaesthesia for its ability to safely and practically immobilise large pinnipeds to allow attachment of satellite tracking equipment and to handle and potentially move animals if in situations of conflict. Methods. The chemical anaesthetic Zoletil® was remotely applied to immobilise adult male NZ sea lions at Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, to allow handling and the application of satellite tracking equipment. Key results. Six adult males weighing up to 330kg were successfully anaesthetised, weighed and measured. Two of these had satellite location tags attached, which showed two very different post-breeding movement patterns by adult males and indicated minimum overlap with local fisheries activities. Conclusions. This remote anaesthesia technique was successful for adult male NZ sea lions and could be used for the immobilisation and management of other large mobile pinnipeds. Implications. The ability to anaesthetise and safely handle large adult male pinnipeds will provide better management in areas where animals come in close contact with human populations with possible lethal interactions or where attachment of monitoring equipment is required to investigate population parameters or possible lethal interactions. 3aPhocarctos hookeri 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3aanimal handling 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aequipment 3afisheries 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ahumans 3aislands 3amales 3amonitoring 3awildlife management 3aNew Zealand 0acapture 0adarting 0afisheries interactions 0ahuman interactions 0ainhalation anaesthesia 0aZoletil1 aChilvers, B.

  1 aChukwu, E.10aInstantaneous multiple-depth soil mechanical impedance sensing from a moving vehicle  ap. 885-894.  a2019-12-05  aA three-depth soil mechanical impedance sensor was developed and tested within a laboratory soil bin. Soil mechanical impedance measurements were made on a continuous basis at three simultaneous depths of 178, 279, and 381 mm from one end of the soil bin to the other using three prismatic tips and three Omega LCF500 load cells. This article discusses how the sensor can be used for measuring the soil mechanical impedances that plant roots encounter during normal growth. The soil sensor also offers excellent opportunities to study the forces acting on soil-engaging implements and subsequent control of tillage tools. Compaction created from past tillage machinery operation and trafficking by heavy equipment sometimes forms "plowpans" in crop fields. These layers, as well as other naturally occurring dense soil layers that impede water infiltration and root penetration, can be located using the three-depth soil mechanical impedance sensor. The laboratory experiment for testing and verifying the device's performance showed that the three-depth sensor can measure differences in soil mechanical impedance with depth and location and that these impedances correlate well with corresponding cone penetrometer measurements. 3asandy soils 3asoil penetration resistance 3atillage 3aloamy sand soils 3asoil compaction 3apenetrometers 0amechanical impedance sensors 0asensors 0asoil mechanical ipedance 0athree-depth soil mechanical impedance sensors 0aDelmi recording cone penetrometers1 aBowers, C.G.

III10aForest operations and water quality in the South  ap. 871-880.  a2019-12-05  aSouthern forests, which rely on intensive management practices, are some of the most productive forests in the U.S. Intensive forest management utilizes forest operations, such as site preparation, fertilization, thinning, and harvesting, to increase site productivity and reduce rotation time. These operations are essential to meet the ever-increasing demands for timber products. Forest managers utilize forest operations as tools in an attempt to manage the nation's forestlands for multiple uses while maintaining or improving resource quality. Forest operations can influence nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution by disturbing natural processes that maintain water quality. In recent years, NPS pollution has been identified as the nation's largest source of water quality problems. Forest management activities have been identified as activities that influence NPS pollution in the South. Results of watershed-scale studies that investigated the effect of forest operations on water quality in the 13 southern states are highly variable. However, taken collectively, the results indicate that forest operations have little impact on the quality of water draining from forests in the South. Based on this review, best management practices (BMPs) show the potential to protect water quality following forest operations; however, accurate assessments of the overall effectiveness of BMPs are not possible because the benefits of BMPs on different scales are relatively unknown. 3alogging 3awater quality 3aforest hydrology 3afertilizer application 3aforested watersheds 3asilviculture 3abest management practices 3anonpoint source pollution 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest roads 3aSoutheastern United States 0aliterature reviews 0aforestry0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.871-880x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009000166300001600256500002400272520160100296650001201897650002501909650001401934650002701948650001801975650002101993650001302014650002402027650002602051650002602077650001502103650002802118650001002146700002202156700002102178700002002199700002002219700001702239773009202256852000902348856004802357655001202405IND4417079720221121230834.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441707972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-008-9081-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibley, Kevin J.10aField-scale validation of an automated soil nitrate extraction and measurement system  ap. 162-174.  aIncludes references  aOne of the many gaps that needs to be solved by precision agriculture technologies is the availability of an economic, automated, on-the-go mapping system that can be used to obtain intensive and accurate 'real-time' data on the levels of nitrate nitrogen (NO₃-N) in the soil. A soil nitrate mapping system (SNMS) has been developed to provide a way to collect such data. This study was done to provide extensive field-scale validation testing of the system's nitrate extraction and measurement sub-unit (NEMS) in two crop (wheat and carrot) production systems. Field conditions included conventional tillage (CT) versus no tillage (NT), inorganic versus organic fertilizer application, four soil groups and three points in time throughout the season. Detailed data analysis showed that: (i) the level of agreement, as measured by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of efficiency (CE), between NEMS soil NO₃-N and standard laboratory soil NO₃-N measurements was excellent; (ii) at the field-scale, there was little practical difference when using either integer or real number data processing; (iii) regression equations can be used to enable field measurements of soil NO₃-N using the NEMS to be obtained with laboratory accuracy; (iv) future designs of the SNMS's control system can continue to use cheaper integer chip technology for processing the nitrate ion-selective electrode (NO₃ ⁻-ISE) readings; and (v) future designs of the SNMS would not need a soil moisture sensor, ultimately saving on manufacturing costs of a more simple system. 3acarrots 3aconventional tillage 3aequations 3afertilizer application 3amanufacturing 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aorganic fertilizers 3aprecision agriculture 3aproduction technology 3asoil water 3aspecific ion electrodes 3awheat1 aAstatkie, Tessema1 aBrewster, Gordon1 aStruik, Paul C.1 aAdsett, John F.1 aPruski, Kris0 tPrecision agriculture.g2009 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.162-174dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-008-9081-1 7aarticle01581naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245003100171300001600202520076700218650002400985651001101009653001401020653001301034773011801047852000901165856008501174930003301259946001101292655001201303IND4443690220221120214405.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444369022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11205-010-9580-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrzeziński, Michał.10aIncome Affluence in Poland  ap. 285-299.  aThis paper examines the evolution of income affluence (richness) in Poland during 1998-2007.

Results show that over the period under study there was a statistically significant and socio-economically sizable rise in income affluence by between 9 and 50%, depending on the index used. The overall income distribution in the period has shifted in favour of the rich as relative poverty and relative size and income share of the middle class have declined. 3aincome distribution 3aPoland 0aAffluence 0aRichness0 tSocial indicators research.g2010 Nov., v. 99, no. 2 p.285-299dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0303-83007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-010-9580-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02665naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012600189300001600315520141900331650001201750650002101762650001201783650002001795650002801815650003701843650001101880650003401891650002201925650001801947653003701965700001902002773011302021852000902134856009202143930003302235946001102268655001202279IND4442788920221120214541.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444278892DNAL7 a200597052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00705.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, M.S.10aSelection of priority groups for obesity prevention: current approaches and development of an evidence-informed framework  ap. 731-739.  aResources for obesity prevention interventions are inevitably limited, necessitating the selection of priority groups to ensure effective and equitable use of funds. This paper aims to review published approaches to selection of priority groups ('target populations') for obesity prevention, and to present the development of a new systematic framework for organizing and assessing evidence for selecting priority groups. A review was conducted of the process and justification described for selecting priority groups in a sample of obesity prevention publications. Using the results of this review and adaptation of theory and frameworks in both the obesity prevention and health promotion priority-setting literature, a framework was developed for assessment of potential priority groups for obesity prevention. The published literature lacks discussion of and explicit processes for selection of priority groups for obesity prevention intervention. The new framework describes specific types of evidence that should be considered in the assessment of a potential priority group for obesity prevention and has applications for funding and implementing community-based or settings-level obesity prevention interventions and research. Application of this framework has the potential to enhance the effective use of limited obesity prevention resources and to identify areas in need of additional research evidence. 3afunding 3ahealth promotion 3aobesity 2aDecision Making 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aHealth Services Needs and Demand 2aHumans 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aPatient Selection 2aPublic Health 0aHealth services needs and demand1 aSwinburn, B.A.0 tObesity reviews.g2010 Oct., v. 11, no. 10 p.731-739dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00705.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02446naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011300165300001800278520125100296650002401547650001401571650001401585650001401599650001201613650001001625650001101635650001001646650002501656650002601681653002501707653002201732653001801754700002401772773011401796852000901910856008501919930003302004946001102037655001202048IND4446337320221120214439.0101210e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444633732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9370-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Kensuke 10aPlasticity of size and allometry in multiple sexually selected traits in an armed beetle Gnatocerus cornutus  ap. 1339-1351.  aMale-male competition frequently results in the evolution of sexually selected traits used as weapons and ornaments. The expression of these traits often depends on male condition, i.e., condition dependence. Although males often have multiple sexually selected traits, to date many studies have focused on the morphological analysis of one sexual trait whilst ignoring the others. We here report phenotypic plasticity for multiple sexual traits, by manipulating larval diet quality and density, in the broad-horned flour beetle Gnatocerus cornutus. The male beetles possess enlarged mandibles, developed genae and a pair of small horns, but females lack these completely. Larval density significantly affected overall body size but not relative investment in each sexual trait. In contrast, diet quality had no effect on body size but had a significant effect on relative investment in the mandibles and genae. These results indicate that the allometric intercepts of the mandible and genae alter in response to diet quality, i.e., allometric plasticity. However, diet quality had no effect on the growth of the horn. Thus, multiple sexual traits exhibited differences in plasticity as a result of larval nutrient condition in G. cornutus males. 3aGnatocerus cornutus 3aallometry 3abody size 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahorns 3alarvae 3amales 3anutritional adequacy 3aphenotypic plasticity 0aCondition dependence 0aExaggerated trait 0aHorned beetle1 aMiyatake, Takahisa 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 24, no. 6 p.1339-1351dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9370-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008500145300001600230500001500246520088800261650002001149650001801169650000901187650002501196650001701221650002101238650001201259650000901271650002101280650003401301650002101335650002201356650002401378650002301402650001201425653001301437653001701450653003401467700002501501700001501526773007901541852000901620939003301629946001301662655001201675IND9201202420221120132828.0920306e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920120242DNAL7 a22362552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, R.H.14aThe influence of maternal labels on dietary preferences of spiny mouse weanlings  ap. 103-106.  a2019-12-04  aTo assess the influence of conspecific chemical cues on the development of dietary preferences, spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) weanlings were tested for their responses to food items that were partially eaten (thus, presumably labeled) by various categories of conspecifics. Consumption of a highly preferred novel food (fresh carrot) labeled by the pups' parents, or mother alone, was greater than that of a clean sample of the same food. The presence of labels emanating from the father or an alien mother had no effect on food consumption. Salient maternal labels that elicit preferential feeding by young appear to be individually unique, therefore allowing pups to recognize such cues emanating from their own mother. The attractive substance that mothers transfer to food items while eating (the maternal label per se) has not been identified, but saliva is a likely candidate. 3amaternal effect 3ayoung animals 3amice 3aanimal communication 3afood choices 3afood consumption 2aAnimals 2aCues 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aFood Preferences 2aMaternal Behavior 2aMuridaexpsychology 2aSocial Environment 2aWeaning 0alabeling 0ainteractions 0amother-offspring interactions1 aMcFadyen-Ketchum, S.1 aKing, G.A.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g1990 July, v. 48, no. 1 p.103-106x0031-93847nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03437naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011900147300001600266520181900282650001502101650002502116650001302141650000902154650001202163650002702175650001202202650002502214650001302239650002102252650001602273650001202289650002302301650001202324650003602336650003602372650003302408650003102441650001202472650001302484650004502497650001202542650003702554650002302591650002102614650001302635653002102648700001702669700002302686773008202709852000902791930003302800945001302833946001302846655001202859IND2323392520221122033423.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339252DNAL7 a112100282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernard, J.K.10aIn vitro mixed ruminal microorganism fermentation of whole cottonseed coated with gelatinized corn starch and urea  ap. 154-158.  aWe conducted an in vitro mixed ruminal microorganism fermentation study to determine the effect of coating whole cottonseed with gelatinized corn starch and feed grade urea. Treatments were arranged as a 3 x 4 factorial to provide three concentrations of starch (0.0, 2.5, and 5.0%) and four concentrations of urea (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0%). All treatments were prepared from one lot of whole cottonseed. Batch culture fermentations were conducted using anaerobic medium that contained 20% (vol/vol) ruminal fluid in 160-ml serum bottles. Whole cottonseed was ground to pass through a 6-mm screen and weighed amounts (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 g) were added to the serum bottles. As starch increased, H2, CH4, total volatile fatty acids, and molar proportions of propionate increased linearly, whereas pH, molar proportions of acetate, and the acetate to propionate ratio decreased linearly. L-Lactate concentrations were highest with 2.5% starch compared with 0 or 5.0%. As the amount of urea in the coating increased, pH and CH4 increased linearly, whereas H2 concentrations decreased linearly. Ammonia concentrations exhibited a quadratic response due to moderate increases with the addition of 0.25 and 0.5% urea, and a greater increase was observed with 1.0% urea. Interactions between starch and urea were observed for H2, CH4, NH3, and L-lactate. Concentrations of H2 decreased and CH4 was relatively constant as urea increased in the presence of 0 and 2.5% starch, but increased with 5% starch. L-Lactate concentrations were unchanged (0% starch), higher (2.5% starch), or lower (5.0% starch) as urea increased. Ammonia concentrations increased after urea exceeded 10% of the starch concentration. The addition of urea did not prevent the decline in pH, but did reduce H2 and CH4 accumulation with 2.5% starch. 3acottonseed 3arumen microorganisms 3acoatings 3aurea 3agelatin 3ain vitro digestibility 3aammonia 3avolatile fatty acids 3ahydrogen 3afeed formulation 3acorn starch 3amethane 3amethane production 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCottonseed Oilxpharmacology 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aGelatin 2aHydrogen 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aMethane 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aUreaxmetabolism 2aZea mays 0aartificial rumen1 aMartin, S.A.1 aWedegaertner, T.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.154-158x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03103naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245005400182300001800236500013200254500001500386520156000401650002301961650002301984650001102007650001102018650001502029650001902044650002602063650002402089650002302113650002502136650001302161650001702174650002102191653002602212653002302238653002502261653002002286700002202306700002402328700002202352773013102374852000902505930003302514945002502547946001302572655001202585IND4410156420221122033428.0080912e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441015642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both indicators are decreased in moderate or severe copper deficiency. The activity of several cuproenzymes is decreased in mild copper deficiency. However, their use is limited by the nonexistence of standardized assays and high interindividual variability and because some of these indicators are affected by other conditions. Recently, it was shown that the protein expression of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is increased in erythrocytes of rodents with mild copper deficiency. However, no traditional laboratory indicators have been identified as potential early markers of copper excess. It is possible that the biomarkers studied so far are not sensitive enough to detect an increase in body copper before the appearance of functional or clinical effects or that the homeostatic mechanisms are so strong that no significant changes in body copper occur with mild-to-moderate copper exposure. The identification of appropriate biomarkers for early detection of an increase in body copper represents a major challenge for further research, and the development of new approaches, such as network biology, allows us to search and propose new candidates to be studied. Recently, we found that CCS mRNA abundance in mononuclear blood cells significantly decreased after copper supplementation. The usefulness of this indicator to detect an increase in body copper should be assessed in clinical trials. 3anutritional status 3amineral metabolism 3ahumans 3acopper 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3anutrient deficiencies 3adeficiency diseases 3anutrient retention 3anutrition assessment 3atoxicity 3ablood plasma 3adietary minerals 0adiet-related diseases 0aliterature reviews 0anutrition physiology 0acopper overload1 aMéndez, Marco A.1 aAstudillo, Pablo A.1 aPizarro, Fernando0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Sept., v. 88, no. 3 p.859S-862SdAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle02252naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245015600174300002000330500002400350520089500374650001401269650002801283650001401311650001501325650001201340650006301352650002701415650006001442650002001502650003601522700001301558700001601571700001801587700001601605700001701621773011801638852000901756856007701765655001201842IND4459637620221122033333.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963762DNAL7 a214697322pmid7 a10.1021/jf10495632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chuanwen10aSynthesis, Insecticidal Activity, and Molecular Docking Studies of Nitenpyram Analogues with a Flexible Ester Arm Anchored on Tetrahydropyrimidine Ring  ap. 4828–4835.  aIncludes references  aTo make further researches on the structure–activity relationships (SARs) of our previous synthesized neonicotinoid compounds, a new series of nitenpyam analogues with flexible ester arm were synthesized. Preliminary bioassays indicated that all of our newly designed nitenpyam analogues exhibited good insecticidal activity at 100 mg/L, while analogues 4c and 4d afforded the best in vitro activity, and both of them had 100% mortality at 20 mg/L. The SAR studies suggested that their insecticidal potency was dual-controlled by the length of the ester arm and the size of the ester group. In addition, the molecular docking simulations revealed that the structural uniqueness of these analogues may lead to a unique molecular recognition and binding mode, which explained the SARs observed in vitro, and shed light on the novel insecticidal mechanism of these novel nitenpyam analogues. 3abioassays 3ainsecticidal properties 3amortality 3anitenpyram 2aAnimals 2aInsecticidesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aInsectaxdrug effects. 2aPyridinesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStereoisomerism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aXu, Xiao1 aXu, Yonghua1 aYan, Dingrong1 aFang, Ding.1 aLiu, Tianyan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4828–4835-4828–4835x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10495633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04225naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245015000142300001400292520232300306650001502629650002302644650001302667650001802680650001902698650001702717650001702734650001402751650003302765650002002798650001202818650002302830650002802853650002202881650005202903650001102955650001102966650005502977650002903032650007403061650001603135650004103151650001403192650003303206650001703239650002903256653001903285653002503304700001903329700001403348700001803362700001803380700002203398700001903420773008003439852000903519930003303528945001303561946001303574655001203587IND2323391720221122033431.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339172DNAL7 a112100542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz, T.10aEffects of the persistent dominant follicle on the ability of follicle stimulating hormone to induce follicle development and ovulatory responses  ap. 88-99.  aThree experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of an induced first wave persistent dominant follicle on folliculogenesis and ovulatory responses induced by FSH. On d 6 of a synchronized estrous cycle (d 0 = estrus), cows were treated with a Syncromate-B implant and two injections of PGF(2alpha) (25 mg, 0700 h; 15 mg, 1900 h, i.m.). Cows in the control group retained a first-wave persistent dominant follicle, but in the aspirated group, the first-wave dominant follicle was removed via transvaginal aspiration on d 10 (d 0 = estrus). Beginning on d 12, cows received 32 mg of FSH-P i.m. in decreasing doses at 12-h intervals over a 4-d period. On d 15, the Syncromate-B implant was removed, and cows were ovariectomized (experiment 1, n = 8) or inseminated (experiment 2, n = 11) at 10 and 22 h after the onset of estrus. Cows in experiment 3 received a used controlled intravaginal drug releasing (CIDR) device and two injections of PGF(2alpha) (25 mg, 0700 h; 15 mg, 1900 h; i.m.) on d 6. On d 8, the first-wave dominant follicle was aspirated (n = 6) or left intact (n = 5), and FSH treatment was initiated (20 mg of Folltropin in decreasing doses at 12-h intervals over a 4-d period), and on d 10 the used CIDR device was removed from all cows. Ovarian follicle size and number were examined daily by ultrasonography from d 5 of the estrous cycle. The persistent dominant follicle increased in size from 10.7 mm on d 5 to 15.4 mm on d 10 (experiments 1 and 2), and from 9 mm on d 5 to 20.4 mm on d 11 (experiment 3). From d 11 to 14, the number of class 1 (2 to 5 mm) follicles was lower in the aspirated group than in the control group; the number of class 2 (6 to 9 mm) follicles was higher on d 12 and 13 for the aspirated group (experiments 1 and 2). The number of class 3 (greater than or equal to 10 mm) follicles was higher in the aspirated group on d 14 to 16, but the same on d 17. Ovarian and embryo responses to superovulation did not differ between groups. In experiment 3, the numbers of class 1, 2, and 3 follicles, as well as ovarian and embryo responses following ovulation did not differ between groups. Initiation of exogenous FSH treatment appears to override any systemic inhibitory effect that a persistent dominant follicle may be exerting at the pituitary and possibly the ovary. 3adairy cows 3aGraafian follicles 3adiameter 3acorpus luteum 3asuperovulation 3ablood plasma 3aprogesterone 3aestradiol 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aembryo (animal) 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDinoprostxpharmacology 2aDrug Combinations 2aEstradiolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aEstrus 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexbloodxpharmacology. 2aInsemination, Artificial 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aOvariectomy 2aOvulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOxytocics 2aPregnenedionesxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aUterusxultrasonography. 0aovulation rate 0asynchronized females1 aPancarci, S.M.1 aDrost, M.1 aSchmitt, E.J.1 aAmbrose, J.D.1 aFredriksson, W.E.1 aThatcher, W.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.88-99x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03965naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245015700147300001600304500001500320520203500335650001902370650000902389650001902398650001002417650001602427650000902443650001202452650002002464650001602484650001902500650001702519650001102536650002002547650001802567650001502585650001202600650001102612650002702623650001602650650003102666650002402697650002902721650001202750650002302762650002402785650000902809650001802818650001102836650003102847650002002878650002902898650002502927650003502952653001602987653001303003653002203016653000703038700001303045700001903058700001603077773008203093852000903175930003303184945001303217946001303230655001203243IND2323392420221122021551.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339242DNAL7 a112100272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, J.A.14aThe effect of cation-anion difference on calcium requirement, feed intake, body weight gain, and blood gasses and mineral concentrations of dairy calves  ap. 147-153.  a2019-12-05  aOur objective was to examine the effects of two diets with different cation-anion differences on Ca requirements in the growing calf. Holstein calves (n = 48, 24 males) were blocked at 56 to 70 d after birth (80 +/- 10 kg of body weight) according to sex and birth date and assigned randomly in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments containing cation-anion differences as meq (Na + K)-(Cl + S)/kg of diet dry matter and Ca content of 1) 0 and 0.35%, 2) 0 and 0.50%, 3) 0 and 0.65%, 4) 200 and 0.35%, 5) 200 and 0.50%, and 6) 200 and 0.65%. Feed intake and average daily gain did not differ among treatment groups. Plasma pH and Ca were unaffected by dietary Ca content or dietary cation-anion difference. Plasma Cl and P decreased linearly with increasing Ca content in the diet. Plasma HCO3 increased linearly with increased dietary Ca content. Plasma HCO3 and partial pressure of CO2 were higher in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 cation-anion difference diets. Plasma Cl was, however, lower in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 meq diets. An interaction of Ca content and dietary cation-anion difference was detected for plasma P content. Urinary pH increased linearly with increasing dietary Ca content. Calves fed the 200 meq dietary cation-anion difference had higher urinary pH values than those fed the 0 meq diet. Urinary P excretion was not altered by dietary cation-anion difference or Ca content of the diet. Calves fed the 0 meq diet had higher urinary concentrations of Ca and Cl when compared with those fed the 200 meq diet. Bone ash, P, Ca, Mg, and K content of the 10th rib were not affected by dietary treatments. Breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs increased quadratically with increasing dietary Ca content. Dietary cation-anion difference had no effect on the breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs. Varying the dietary cation-anion difference from 0 to 200 meq/kg of dietary dry matter had no effect on Ca requirement of the growing calf. 3acarbon dioxide 3adiet 3ainorganic ions 3aurine 3ablood gases 3aribs 3acalcium 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3aalkali reserve 3ablood plasma 3acalves 3amineral content 3abone strength 3aphosphorus 2aAnimals 2aAnions 2aBicarbonatesxanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aBone and Bonesxphysiology 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aCations 2aCattlexphysiology 2aChloridesxanalysis 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMineralsxblood 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aTensile Strengthxdrug effects 0aion balance 0abone ash 0abreaking strength 0apH1 aAkay, V.1 aFranklin, S.T.1 aAaron, D.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.147-153x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03086naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245013000150300001600280520138200296650003001678650002701708650001701735650000901752650001101761650001901772650002201791650002301813650002501836650000701861650002201868650001701890650001201907650001601919650001201935650005201947650003601999650002802035650003802063650001302101650005302114650002202167650001702189653001702206653002002223653002102243653003102264700001602295700001902311700001602330773008202346852000902428930003302437945001302470946001302483655001202496IND2323392620221122002254.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339262DNAL7 a112100292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez-Anon, M.10aEffects of alimet on nutrient digestibility, bacterial protein synthesis, and ruminal disappearance during continuous culture  ap. 159-166.  aA dual effluent continuous culture system was used to investigate the effects of inclusion of Alimet (Novus International, Inc., St. Louis, MO) feed supplement [an 88% aqueous solution of dl, 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMB)] in the diet on nutrient digestibility, bacterial protein synthesis and ruminal disappearance of HMB. Four fermenters were fed three times daily a basal diet that consisted of 50% grain mixture and 50% forage for 9 d. In experiment 1, four concentrations of HMB (0, 0.20, 0.77, and 1.43% DM basis) were added to the diet and fed to the fermenters twice daily. In experiment 2, two concentrations of dietary HMB (0 and 0.88% DM basis) were fed twice daily and evaluated with two solids retention times (16.7 vs. 25.0 h) and two liquid dilution rates (0.15 vs. 0.125 h(-1)). Increasing the amount of HMB in the diet did not affect nutrient digestibility, volatile fatty acid concentrations, or ruminal escape of HMB. Bacterial protein synthesis was improved with the addition of HMB during high and low retention times. The extent of HMB escaping ruminal degradation ranged from 21.6 to 43.2% and was highest at the lower retention time. It can be concluded that a fraction of HMB survives rumen microbial degradation and, therefore, provides a rumen-protected form of methionine at the same time that it improves bacterial protein synthesis. 3amethionine hydroxy analog 3ain vitro digestibility 3aconcentrates 3acorn 3aforage 3arumen bacteria 3aprotein synthesis 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids 3apH 3aammonium nitrogen 3arumen fluids 2aAmmonia 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxdrug effects. 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMethioninexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0atransit time 0aalfalfa haylage 0aartificial rumen 0arumen-protected methionine1 aCassidy, T.1 aMcCullough, P.1 aVarga, G.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.159-166x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04622naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100001700202245010600219300001800325500002400343520276300367650001803130650001903148650001503167650002903182650002303211650001903234650001803253650001103271650002503282650002503307650002003332650002003352650002303372650002003395650001303415650002103428650001503449650001903464650002203483650001803505650001303523650001603536650002703552653001903579653002603598653002303624700001603647700002003663773011103683852000903794856008803803930003303891945002503924946001103949655001203960IND4434575920221122002312.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK800 0aX620 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aX1001 aWaring, R.H.10aImproving predictions of forest growth using the 3-PGS model with observations made by remote sensing  ap. 1722-1729.  aIncludes references  aMeasurements made by remote sensing can characterize the leaf area density and nitrogen/chlorophyll content of forest canopies, as well as maximum photosynthetic capacity and above-ground structure and biomass. Combining these with climate data estimated from relationships based on temperature measurements and using an appropriate process-based model, it is possible to calculate, with useful accuracy, carbon sequestration and wood production by different forest types covering large land areas. To broaden its application and reduce the need for detailed information on stand characteristics, a satellite-driven version of the model 3-PG, was developed. The 3-PGS model incorporates the major first-order physiological processes that determine forest growth, and the biophysical factors that affect and govern those processes. It incorporates remotely sensed estimates of seasonal variation in canopy light interception (fPAR) and includes physiological variables (stomatal conductance and canopy quantum efficiency) that can be estimated by remote-sensing measurements of factors that influence those variables. 3-PGS therefore provides a useful framework within which to evaluate how data from the array of airborne and satellite-borne sensors now available might be used to initialize, drive, and test process-based growth models across regions with diverse soils and climates. We address the question: to what extent might additional remote-sensing techniques improve 3-PGS predictions? Sensitivity analyses indicate that model accuracy would be most improved through better estimates of seasonal changes in canopy photosynthetic capacity (α) and canopy conductance (G c ). Canopy photosynthetic capacity depends on the amount of light absorbed by the canopy, estimated as a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), and on foliage nitrogen or chlorophyll content, which can be estimated using multi-spectral imagery. G c depends on canopy leaf area index (L) and stomatal conductance of the foliage (g s ), which is affected by the vapor pressure deficit of the air and soil water content. The onset and effects of drought can be determined from changes in canopy reflectance and fPAR identified from sequential measurements; the same measurements, coupled with calculations of evapotranspiration using climatic data and standard formulae, provide estimates of total available water in forest root zones. Periodic surveys with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and interferometric RADAR may serve to validate model predictions of above-ground growth (NPP A ), while progressive reduction in light-use efficiency (NPP A /APAR) may identify forests with declining vigor that are likely to succumb to attack from insects and pathogens. 3aforest growth 3aremote sensing 3aprediction 3aradiation use efficiency 3aevapotranspiration 3aphotosynthesis 3aforest health 3amodels 3acarbon sequestration 3aprimary productivity 3atree physiology 3alight intensity 3aseasonal variation 3aleaf area index 3aaccuracy 3aclimatic factors 3asoil water 3asoil fertility 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest canopy 3anitrogen 3achlorophyll 3anet ecosystem exchange 0aprocess models 0aecosystem respiration 0awater availability1 aCoops, N.C.1 aLandsberg, J.J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1722-1729dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20110802b20110902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03095naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245016800143300001600311500001500327520119100342650001201533650001501545650002501560650001701585650002601602650001201628650002601640650002001666650001101686650001101697650001501708650002301723650001901746650000901765650001701774650001001791650001901801650001601820650002301836650001601859650001201875650003001887650002301917650003301940650002901973650002602002650002002028650000902048650002102057650001602078650002802094650002202122653001002144653002502154653001502179653001902194700001702213700001602230773008502246852000902331930003302340945001302373946001102386655001202397IND2053513620221122002321.0961011e199205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205351362DNAL7 a16229762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeal, C.J.14aThe effect of forage and forage-concentrate diets on rumen fermentation and metabolism of nutrients by the mesenteric- and portal-drained viscera in growing steers  ap. 355-370.  a2019-12-05  aGrowing Friesian steers chronically catheterized in the anterior mesenteric and portal veins were used to study the influence of feeding with either a forage or forage-concentrate diet on nutrient utilization by mucosal tissue. When animals were consuming the forage-concentrate diet the molar proportion of propionate in rumen fluid was significantly increased, although production rate as measured by isotope dilution was not altered. Net rates of absorption of VFA into portal blood when compared with rumen production rates underlined the extent to which metabolism within mucosal tissue modifies the propionate supply to the liver. Net glucose utilization by splanchnic tissue was shown to be significantly lower on the forage-concentrate diet. There were no effects of diet on whole-body glucose turnover or on the proportion of glucose derived from propionate. Animals fed on the forage-concentrate diet had significantly lower concentrations of circulating essential amino acids, due mainly to a reduction in branched-chain amino acid levels. There was net absorption of all amino acids by animals on both diets except for glutamate, glutamine and taurine in forage-fed animals. 3aammonia 3ametabolism 3avolatile fatty acids 3aconcentrates 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aglucose 3aessential amino acids 3anutrient uptake 3asteers 3aforage 3aintestines 3arumen fermentation 3apropionic acid 3aurea 3arumen fluids 3ablood 3aanimal tissues 3alactic acid 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexblood 2aFermentationxphysiology 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aLactatesxblood 2aMale 2aMesenteric Veins 2aPortal Vein 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 0arumen 0anutrition physiology 0athroughput 0asplanchnic bed1 aParker, D.S.1 aAvery, P.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1992 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.355-370x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03117naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245021600172300002000388500002400408520130300432650001701735650001801752650003101770650002001801650002601821650001501847650001701862650006801879650006101947650002402008650005802032650003802090650007402128650003602202700001802238700001402256700001502270700001502285700001802300700001502318700002002333700001502353700001502368700001202383773011802395852000902513856007702522655001202599IND4459636920221122002227.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963692DNAL7 a214528312pmid7 a10.1021/jf104247w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hong-Wu10aStudies of O,O-Dimethyl α-(2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetoxy)ethylphosphonate (HW02) as a New Herbicide. 1.

Their herbicidal activity and efficacy in vitro against PDHc were examined. Some of these compounds exhibited significant herbicidal activity and were demonstrated to be effective inhibitors of PDHc from three different plants. The structure−activity relationships of these compounds including previously reported analogous compounds were studied by examining their herbicidal activities. Both inhibitory potency against PDHc and herbicidal activity of title compounds could be increased greatly by optimizing substituent groups of the title compounds. O,O-Dimethyl α-(2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetoxy)ethylphosphonate (I-5), which acted as a competitive inhibitor of PDHc with much higher inhibitory potency against PDHc from Pisum sativum and Phaseolus radiatus than from Oryza sativa, was found to be the most effective compound against broadleaf weeds and showed potential utility as herbicide. 3aOryza sativa 3aPisum sativum 3aVigna radiata var. radiata 3abroadleaf weeds 3aherbicidal properties 3aherbicides 3apyruvic acid 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aPyruvate Dehydrogenase Complexxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aYuan, Jun-Lin1 aPeng, Hao1 aChen, Ting1 aShen, Ping1 aWan, Shu-Qing1 aLi, Yanjun1 aTan, Hong-Liang1 aHe, Ya-Hui1 aHe, Jun-Bo1 aLi, Yan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4801–4813-4801–4813x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104247w3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02967naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245012000175300002000295500002400315520134000339650001101679650001901690650001301709650002101722650001801743650001301761650001401774650002201788650001801810650001101828650002201839650001001861650002301871650001001894650002001904650001101924650004101935650001101976650000901987650001601996650002402012650001002036650003202046650002102078650004202099700002102141700001602162700001902178773011802197852000902315856007702324655001202401IND4459638720221121232139.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963872DNAL7 a214566162pmid7 a10.1021/jf104649y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiota, Makoto10aModel Studies on Volatile Release from Different Semisolid Fat Blends Correlated with Changes in Sensory Perception  ap. 4904–4912.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of dispersed aqueous droplets in water-in-oil (W/O)-emulsion semisolid fats on aroma release and sensory perception was investigated on margarine models where model aroma substances were added. Aroma release from W/O-emulsion fat blends and bulk fat blends with added monoglycerides combining different fatty acids of various short-chain free fatty acids, methylketones, esters, and lactones were measured using headspace solid phase microextraction−gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME−GC/MS), and their perception profiles were evaluated by sensory analysis. The presence of aqueous phase in a fat blend significantly reduced the headspace concentrations of butanoic acid and hexanoic acid, and also decreased the perceived intensity of total aroma and cheesy aroma. The aroma release of methylketones, esters, and lactones from the W/O-emulsion fat blends increased with increasing carbon chain length of the volatile molecules. The intensity of aroma perception in a W/O-emulsion fat blend depended on the melting point of the fatty acids (oleic, palmitic, stearic, and behenic) of the monoglyceride used as an emulsifier. Thus, aroma release from a W/O-emulsion semisolid fat blend was influenced by interactions between aroma volatiles and the dispersed aqueous droplets and by their viscoelastic properties. 3acarbon 3achromatography 3adroplets 3afree fatty acids 3ahexanoic acid 3alactones 3amargarine 3amass spectrometry 3amelting point 3amodels 3amonoacylglycerols 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 2aAdult 2aFatsxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aSmell 2aSolid Phase Microextraction 2aTaste Perception 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistry1 aIsogai, Tomoyuki1 aIwasawa, Ai1 aKotera, Mariko0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4904–4912-4904–4912x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104649y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04053naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002400184245009600208300001800304500002400322500001500346520229000361650001602651650002302667650002202690650001802712650002402730650002602754650002502780650001402805650001702819650001802836650001702854650002602871650001102897650001902908650002102927650002302948650001002971650002002981651001403001653002503015653002303040653002603063700003203089700002103121700002003142773011103162852000903273856008803282930003303370945002503403946001103428655001203439IND4434576320221121232134.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK120 0aX100 0aF5001 aForrester, David I.10aEnhanced water use efficiency in a mixed Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mearnsii plantation  ap. 1761-1770.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSignificant increases in aboveground biomass production have been observed when Eucalyptus is planted with a nitrogen-fixing species due to increased nutrient availability and more efficient use of light. Eucalyptus and Acacia are among the most popular globally planted genera with the area of Eucalyptus plantations alone expanding to over 19Mha over the past two decades. Despite this, little is known about how nutrition and light availability in mixed-species tree plantations influence water use and water use efficiency (WUE). This study examined to what extent water use and WUE have been influenced by increased resource availability and growth in mixed-species plantations. Monocultures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman and 1:1 mixtures of these species were planted. Growth and transpiration were measured between ages 14 and 15 years. Aboveground biomass increment (Mgha⁻¹) was significantly higher in mixtures (E. globulus; 4.8+ A. mearnsii; 0.9) than E. globulus (3.3) or A. mearnsii monocultures (1.6). Annual transpiration (mm) measured using the heat pulse technique was also higher in mixtures (E. globulus; 285+ A. mearnsii; 134) than in E. globulus (358) and A. mearnsii (217) monocultures. Mixtures exhibited higher WUE than monocultures due to significant increases in the WUE of E. globulus in mixtures (1.69kg aboveground biomass per cubic metre water transpired) compared to monocultures (0.94). The differences in WUE appear to result from increases in canopy photosynthetic capacity and above- to belowground carbon allocation in mixtures compared to monocultures. Although further studies are required and operational issues need to be resolved, the results of this study suggest that mixed eucalypt-acacia plantations may be used in water-limited environments to produce a given amount of wood with less water than eucalypt monocultures. Alternatively, because mixtures can be more productive and use more water per unit land area (but use it more efficiently), they could be utilized in recharge zones where rising water tables and salinity result from the replacement of vegetation (fast growing trees) that uses higher quantities of water with vegetation (shallow rooted annual crops) that use lower quantities of water. 3atree growth 3asoil water balance 3anitrogen fixation 3aforest canopy 3aEucalyptus globulus 3anutrient availability 3awater use efficiency 3aequations 3asilviculture 3atranspiration 3amixed stands 3anutrient partitioning 3acarbon 3atree nutrition 3astand management 3aforest plantations 3aroots 3aAcacia mearnsii 3aAustralia 0aheat pulse technique 0acanopy conductance 0aplant-water relations1 aTheiveyanathan, Swaminathan1 aCollopy, John J.1 aMarcar, Nico E.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1761-1770dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20100413b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03426naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100003200184245011100216300001800327500002400345500001500369520180300384650001602187650001802203650001502221650003602236650002702272650001202299650001102311650002002322650001402342650002302356650001402379650002802393653003002421653002602451653002002477700002202497700004202519700002002561700002602581773011102607852000902718856008802727930003302815945002502848946001102873655001202884IND4434576520221121232020.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK120 0aJ500 0aF500 0aF6001 aAlmeida, Julio Cesar Raposo12aA positive growth response to NaCl applications in Eucalyptus plantations established on K-deficient soils  ap. 1786-1795.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContrasting responses of Eucalyptus trees to K fertilizer applications have been reported on soils with low K contents. A complete randomized block experiment was set up in Brazil to test the hypothesis that large atmospheric deposits of NaCl in coastal regions might lead to a partial substitution of K by Na in Eucalyptus physiology and enhance tree growth. Treatments with application of 1.5, 3.0, 4.5kmolKha⁻¹ (K₁.₅, K₃.₀, K₄.₅, respectively) as KCl, 3.0kmolKha⁻¹ applied as K₂SO₄, 3.0kmolNaha⁻¹ (Na₃.₀) as NaCl commercialized for cattle feeding, and a mixture of 1.5kmolK+1.5kmolNaha⁻¹ (K₁.₅ +Na₁.₅) were compared to a control treatment (C) with no K and Na applications. All the plots were fertilized with large amounts of the other nutrients. A positive effect of NaCl applications on the growth of E. grandis trees was observed. NaCl and KCl additions in treatments Na₃.₀ and K₃.₀ increased above-ground biomass by 56% and 130% three years after planting, respectively, in comparison with the C treatment. By contrast, accumulated litterfall up to age 3 years was not significantly modified. NaCl applications in the Na₃.₀ treatment significantly increased Na accumulation in above-ground tree components but did not modify K accumulation, whatever the sampling age. A partial substitution of K by Na in tree physiology, as observed for various agricultural crops, might explain this behaviour. Our results suggest the possibility of applying inexpensive K fertilizers, which are less purified in Na, and explain why high yields are achieved without K fertilizer applications in areas with large dry depositions of marine aerosols. Further investigations are necessary to identify the processes involving Na in Eucalyptus tree physiology. 3atree growth 3afoliar uptake 3aEucalyptus 3achemical constituents of plants 3afertilizer application 3atropics 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3apotassium 3aforest plantations 3anutrients 3adry matter partitioning 0apotassium deficient soils 0achemical substitution 0atree physiology1 aLaclau, Jean-Paul1 aGonçalves, José Leonardo de Moraes.1 aRanger, Jacques1 aSaint-André, Laurent0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1786-1795dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20100413b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245009400173300002000267500002400287520111100311650001901422650002301441650001201464650000901476650000901485650002201494650001801516650000901534650001301543650001501556650002601571650001801597650001301615650002301628650001301651650001201664650001201676650003101688650002601719650003001745650001201775650002301787650001101810650003301821650005401854700002401908700002101932700002001953700002301973700002101996773011802017852000902135856007702144655001202221IND4459639720221121220212.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963972DNAL7 a214346952pmid7 a10.1021/jf20057822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppa, Mauro10aEffect of a Hay-Based Diet or Different Upland Grazing Systems on Milk Volatile Compounds  ap. 4947–4954.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of animal feeding on milk volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of metabolic origin was tested on a hay-based diet (H), a highly diversified pasture under continuous grazing (CG), or a less diversified pasture under rotational grazing (RG). Individual milk of 24 Montbliarde cows (8 per treatment) were sampled after 2 weeks. Pasture-derived milk was richer (p < 0.05) in camphene, sabinene, β-caryophyllene, and skatole than H milk. Neither milk yield nor fat content affected the majority of VOCs measured. Skatole increased slightly with milk yield, while indole and cineole decreased slightly with milk fat content but with poor regression (R2 < 0.54). Multivariate analysis showed that, on the basis of those VOCs of metabolic origin whose concentration differed between treatment (dimethyl-sulfone, skatole, toluene, undecanoic acid, 1-octadecene, benzeneacetaldehyde, octanoic acid, and 2-pentanone-4-hydroxy-4-methyl), it was possible to obtain good discriminations among feeding systems. This study is promising for a future use of VOCs of metabolic origin to trace animal feeding systems. 3aanimal feeding 3abeta-caryophyllene 3acineole 3acows 3adiet 3agrazing intensity 3alipid content 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3amultivariate analysis 3aoctanoic acid 3apastures 3arotational grazing 3asabinene 3askatole 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aMilkxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aMartin, B.q(Bruno)1 aPradel, Philippe1 aLeotta, Barbara1 aPriolo, Alessandro1 aVasta, Valentina0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4947–4954-4947–4954x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20057823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02830naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245011700176300002000293500002400313520098800337650002901325650001801354650001301372650001201385650001001397650002701407650001101434650002201445650001701467650004401484650001501528650001501543650001601558650001501574650001201589650004401601650001101645650003601656650004301692650005301735650004501788650003501833650003901868650002501907700002301932700003001955700001801985700002502003700002002028773011802048852000902166856007702175655001202252IND4459639820221121220354.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963982DNAL7 a214431632pmid7 a10.1021/jf104605r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Dina10aMetabolic Profiling of Potential Probiotic or Synbiotic Cheeses by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy  ap. 4955–4961.  aIncludes references  aTo assess ripening of potential probiotic cheeses (containing either Lactobacillus casei-01 or Bifidobacterium lactis B94) or synbiotic cheeses with fructooligosaccharides (FOS) or a 50:50 mix of FOS/inulin, metabolic profiles have been obtained via classical biochemical analyses and by NMR spectroscopy. The addition of prebiotics to the cheeses resulted in lower proteolysis indices, especially in those synbiotic cheeses inoculated with B. lactis B94. Among synbiotic cheeses the combination of FOS and inulin resulted in an increase in lipolytic activity. The metabolic profiles of the cheeses analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, combined with multivariate statistics, allowed profiles to be distinguished by maturation time, added probiotic bacteria, or, in the case of B. lactis B94 cheese, added prebiotic. The NMR results are in agreement with the biochemical analyses and demonstrate the potential of NMR for the study of metabolic processes in probiotic/synbiotic food matrices. 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aLactobacillus 3abacteria 3acheeses 3afoods 3afructooligosaccharides 3ainulin 3ametabolic studies 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aproteolysis 3astatistics 2aAnimals 2aBifidobacteriumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aFood Additivesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLacticaseibacillus caseixchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMilkxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aProbioticsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSynbioticsxanalysis1 aSantos, Claudio H.1 aRocha-Santos, Teresa A.P.1 aGomes, Ana M.1 aGoodfellow, Brian J.1 aFreitas, Ana C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4955–4961-4955–4961x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104605r3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03183naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011100159300001800270500002400288520168600312650001901998650002002017650001802037650001202055650001202067650002002079650002302099650001302122650001402135650001602149650001302165650002202178650002402200650001202224650003202236650001002268650001302278651001702291651000902308651001002317651001202327700002502339700002302364700002102387700002502408700001802433700002202451773011102473852000902584856004802593655001202641IND4407534720221121220252.0080704e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440753472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9326-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKindt, R.10aSpecies accumulation within land use and tree diameter categories in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal  ap. 1883-1905.  aIncludes references  aAlthough farmers have managed west African parkland savanna systems for 1,000 of years, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of these agro-ecosystems due to human population growth, shortening of fallow periods, droughts, desertification and new orientations towards cash generation away from subsistence farming. We conducted a tree diversity survey in 16 villages from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal, recording total species composition for 300 quadrats (mainly 50 x 20 m²) that were randomly sampled from the main landuse categories of parklands of village fields (VF), bush fields (BF), sylvopastoral zone (SP) and forest reserves (FR). About 110 tree species were encountered, including 100 indigenous species. The results from balanced species accumulation curves (based on randomized subsampling of the same number of quadrats from each village) showed that the accumulated number of species was smallest in VF, largest in FR and almost equal in BF and SP, whereas classical (unbalanced) species accumulation curves yielded different results. Although there was a significant within-village reduction in species richness with increasing diameter class [averaging 8.5-13.1 more species in the smallest (<5 cm) compared to the largest diameter class (>80 cm)] for the different landuse categories, new species were also encountered in larger diameter classes (2.7-7.2 species). The evidence for tree regeneration problems (including problems in FR) suggest that farmer-managed tree regeneration should be further explored and that advances in domestication and marketing of indigenous tree species may be crucial to tree conservation in parkland systems. 3aagroecosystems 3adesertification 3adomestication 3adrought 3afarmers 3aforest reserves 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3amarketing 3anew species 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3asubsistence farming 3asurveys 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3avillages 3aBurkina Faso 3aMali 3aNiger 3aSenegal1 aKalinganire, Antoine1 aLarwanou, Mahamane1 aBelem, Mamounata1 aDakouo, Joseph Marie1 aBayala, Jules1 aKairé, Maguette.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 July, v. 17, no. 8 p.1883-1905dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9326-3 7aarticle03010naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012800173300001800301520164400319650001301963650001601976650003901992650001602031650001402047650001702061650001902078650001502097650000902112650001702121650002702138700002302165700002302188700001602211700001902227700001502246700002202261700002302283773011302306852000902419856009202428930003302520946001102553655001202564IND4410123120221121145807.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441012312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06606.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoosterman, Dirk10aIntracellular degradation of somatostatin-14 following somatostatin-receptor 3-mediated endocytosis in rat insulinoma cells  ap. 4728-4739.  aSomatostatin receptor (SSTR) endocytosis influences cellular responsiveness to agonist stimulation and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, a common diagnostic imaging technique. Recently, we have shown that SSTR1 is differentially regulated in the endocytic and recycling pathway of pancreatic cells after agonist stimulation. Additionally, SSTR1 accumulates and releases internalized somatostatin-14 (SST-14) as an intact and biologically active ligand. We also demonstrated that SSTR2A was sequestered into early endosomes, whereas internalized SST-14 was degraded by endosomal peptidases and not routed into lysosomal degradation. Here, we examined the fate of peptide agonists in rat insulinoma cells expressing SSTR3 by biochemical methods and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found that [¹²⁵I]Tyr11-SST-14 rapidly accumulated in intracellular vesicles, where it was degraded in an ammonium chloride-sensitive manner. In contrast, [¹²⁵I]Tyr1-octreotide accumulated and was released as an intact peptide. Rhodamine-B-labeled SST-14, however, was rapidly internalized into endosome-like vesicles, and fluorescence signals colocalized with the lysosomal marker protein cathepsin D. Our data show that SST-14 was cointernalized with SSTR3, was uncoupled from the receptor, and was sorted into an endocytic degradation pathway, whereas octreotide was recycled as an intact peptide. Chronic stimulation of SSTR3 also induced time-dependent downregulation of the receptor. Thus, the intracellular processing of internalized SST-14 and the regulation of SSTR3 markedly differ from the events mediated by the other SSTR subtypes. 3aagonists 3acathepsin D 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aoctreotide 3arats 3ascintigraphy 3asomatostatin receptors1 aBrune, Nicole E.I.1 aKreuzer, Oliver J.1 aFeld, Micha1 aPauser, Sylvia1 aZarse, Kim1 aSteinhoff, Martin1 aMeyerhof, Wolfgang0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Oct., v. 275, no. 19 p.4728-4739dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06606.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02964naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002200177245011200199300001800311500002400329520147300353650001901826650002301845650002401868650002901892650001201921650003601933650002201969650001701991650001902008650002102027653002002048653003502068700001802103700002102121700001902142700002702161700001802188773009602206852000902302856009002311930003302401945002502434946001102459655001202470IND4434570220221121145756.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aBlažević, Ivica10aGlucosinolates, glycosidically bound volatiles and antimicrobial activity of Aurinia sinuata (Brassicaceae)  ap. 1020-1028.  aIncludes references  aVolatiles of Aurinia sinuata (L.)

The main compounds were glucosinolate degradation products originating from glucoberteroin, glucobrassicanapin and glucoalyssin. They were: 6-(methylthio)hexanenitrile (1.8-51.5%), 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexanenitrile (0-11.5%), 5-(methylsulfinyl)pentyl isothiocyanate (0-10.2%), 5-(methylthio)pentyl isothiocyanate (0.4-9.5%), 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (0.7-8.9%), 5-hexenenitrile (2.6-14.6%) and 5,6-epithiohexanenitrile (0-3.4%). Also other volatiles were identified, such as fatty acids and esters (0.3-19.2%), phenols, phenylpropane derivatives and related compounds (0.4-15.8%), aliphatic alcohols and carbonyl compounds (4.2-11.6%) and some other compounds in smaller percentages. The O-glycosidically bound volatiles were isolated from aerial parts of A. sinuata. After the enzymatic hydrolysis and GC and GC-MS analyses, among 20 volatile aglycones identified, eugenol (73.0%) was the main one. The volatile samples containing glucosinolate degradation products were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the disc diffusion method with calculated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). All volatile samples expressed a wide range of growth inhibition activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentrations varied between 0.008 and 0.115mg/ml. 3aglucosinolates 3avolatile compounds 3aglycosidic linkages 3aantimicrobial properties 3aAurinia 3achemical constituents of plants 3achemical analysis 3aaerial parts 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants 0aAurinia sinuata 0aglycosidically bound volatiles1 aRadonić, Ani1 aMastelić, Josip1 aZekić, Marina1 aSkočibušić, Mirjana1 aMaravić, Ana0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.1020-1028dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008400172300001600256520148000272651001401752653001401766653001501780700002201795700001901817700002001836700002301856773010401879852000901983856008501992946001102077655001202088IND4445409720221121145828.0101119e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444540972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10346-010-0203-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepúlveda, Sergio A. 10aLandslides induced by the April 2007 Aysén Fjord earthquake, Chilean Patagonia  ap. 483-492.  aOn the 21st of April 2007, the Aysén Fjord earthquake (Mw 6.2) in southern Chile (45.3° S, 73.0° W) triggered hundreds of landslides in the epicentral area along the fjord coast and surroundings. Some of these landslides induced large tsunami waves within the fjord causing fatalities and damaging several salmon farms, the most important economic activity of the area. The landslides included rock slides and avalanches, rock falls, shallow soil and soil-rock slides, and debris flows. The earthquake was the climax of a seismic swarm that began 3 months earlier. The seismicity is associated with tectonic activity along the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone (LOFZ), a major structural feature of the region. The earthquake-induced landslides were mapped and classified from field observations and remote sensing analysis. The landslide areas and epicentral distances are within the expected range for the earthquake magnitude according to worldwide data, while the position of landslides on the slopes strongly suggests topographic amplification effects in triggering the failures. The location of the landslides is also clearly related to some of the main fault branches of the LOFZ. The seismic event has configured a new situation of seismic and landslide hazard in the Aysén region and along the LOFZ, where the presence of towns and economic infrastructure along the coasts of several fjords constitutes a potential risk that was not considered before this seismic event. 3aArgentina 0aLandslide 0aEarthquake1 aSerey, Alejandra 1 aLara, Marisol 1 aPavez, Andrés 1 aRebolledo, Sofía 0 tLandslides.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.483-492dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-510X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-010-0203-23Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03982naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010800146300001600254500001500270520223800285650002002523650001802543650001102561650001202572650001202584650002002596650002002616650002602636650001602662650001702678650001502695650001202710650001402722650001202736650002402748650003302772650000902805650000902814650002902823650005002852650004002902650002802942650003102970650003503001650001703036650002403053650001603077653001703093653001303110653001403123653001103137700002203148700002303170773008503193852000903278930003303287945001303320946001103333655001203344IND2053515120221121145809.0961011e199205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205351512DNAL7 a16229822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, A.M.10aCalcium and phosphorus requirements of the very young turkey as determined by response surface analysis  ap. 421-435.  a2019-12-05  aThe first experiment was a central composite rotatable design with calculated calcium levels of 6.2, 7.0, 9.0, 11 .0, and 11.8 g/kg diet and total phosphorus levels of 5.2, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 10.8 g/kg diet (2.8 g phytin-P/kg by analysis). This design involved three replicates for each rotatable point and fifteen replicates of the central point. The second experiment was a 4 X 4 factorial design with calculated Ca levels of 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, and 14.0 g/kg diet and calculated total P levels of 7.0, 9.0, 11.0, and 13.0 g/kg diet (2.5 g phytin-P/kg by analysis). There were four replicates for each treatment. In both 16 d experiments maize-soya-bean diets were used and each replicate consisted of one pen containing 10-d-old broad-breasted, white tom turkeys. The Ca and total P requirements for optimum growth were estimated to be 12.5 and 10.0 g/kg diet respectively. Bone ash was adequate at these levels of Ca and total P, but maximum bone ash was not achieved until much higher levels of Ca and total P were employed. At the required levels of Ca and total P for growth the incidences of Ca- and P-deficiency rickets were very low. There were no treatment effects on feed efficiency. Increasing dietary Ca decreased the incidence of the Ca-deficiency lesion. There was a quadratic response due to dietary total P on both P-deficiency rickets and plasma dialysable P; intermediate levels of dietary P resulted in low incidence of the P-deficiency lesion and high levels of plasma dialysable P. There was a strong negative correlation between the incidence of P-deficiency rickets and plasma dialysable P. Percentage retention was very low at high levels of dietary P and low levels of Ca which corresponded with slightly higher P-deficiency rickets and low plasma dialysable P. No such obvious relationships existed between Ca retention, incidence of Ca-deficiency rickets, and plasma Ca. The incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia was very low in the present study. There were pronounced dietary treatment effects on phytin-P retention; at 14 d percentage phytin-P retention treatment means ranged from 18 to 46 in Expt 1 and from 0 to 40 in Expt 2 with the highest retention of phytin-P at low levels at both Ca and total P. 3anutrient intake 3ayoung animals 3aphytin 3aturkeys 3acalcium 3apoultry feeding 3aliveweight gain 3anutrient requirements 3afeed intake 3ablood plasma 3aphosphorus 3arickets 3aincidence 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxdeficiency 2aCalcium, Dietaryxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxetiologyxveterinary. 2aPhosphorusxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aPhytic Acidxmetabolism 2aPoultry Diseasesxetiology 2aRicketsxetiologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 2aTurkeysxmetabolism 2aWeight Gain 0aoptimization 0abone ash 0aretention 0agrowth1 aEdwards, H.M.

In order to enhance the ribonuclease production, in this study the optimization of culture conditions using response surface methodology was done. The fermentation variables including culture temperature, initial pH, inoculum size, sucrose, yeast extract, MgSO₄·7H₂O, and KNO₃ were considered for selection of significant ones by using the Plackett-Burman design, and four significant variables (sucrose, yeast extract, MgSO₄·7H₂O, and KNO₃) were further optimized by a 2⁴ factorial central composite design. The optimal combination of the medium constituents for maximum ribonuclease production was determined as 8.50 g/l sucrose, 9.30 g/l yeast extract, 2.00 g/l MgSO₄·7H₂O, and 0.62 g/l KNO₃. The enzyme activity was increased by 60%. This study will be helpful to the future commercial development of the new bacteria-based antiviral ribonuclease fermentation process. 3aBacillus cereus 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3ainoculum 3amagnesium sulfate 3apH 3apotassium nitrate 3aresponse surface methodology 3aribonucleases 3asucrose 3atemperature 3ayeast extract 2aBacillus cereusxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCulture Media 2aFermentation 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRegression Analysis 2aRibonucleasesxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virus 0aAntiviral ribonuclease 0aMedium optimization1 aHe, Yun-Long 1 aNiu, Tian-Gui 1 aZhong, J.-J.q(Jian-Jiang)0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.657-663dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0330-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02737naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002300178245009600201300002000297500002400317506007600341520090100417506003701318650001801355650001901373650001601392650001401408650001601422650001201438650002801450650002101478650003201499650001101531650001101542650000901553650001501562650005001577650005201627700002401679700002401703700002701727700002301754700002101777700002001798700001801818700002201836700001801858700002301876700002201899700002201921773011801943852000902061856007702070655001202147IND4459643520221207094940.0110705s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964352DNAL7 a214010482pmid7 aPMC30994012pmcid7 a10.1021/jf104901g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenealey, Jason D.10aResveratrol Metabolites Do Not Elicit Early Pro-apoptotic Mechanisms in Neuroblastoma Cells  ap. 4979–4986.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResveratrol, a nontoxic polyphenol, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of neuroblasoma. However, resveratrol is rapidly metabolized, mainly to its glucuronidated and sulfated derivatives. This study demonstrates that resveratrol alone, and not the glucuronidated or sulfated metabolites, is taken up into tumor cells, induces a rise in [Ca2+]i, and ultimately leads to a decrease in tumor cell viability. A new water-soluble resveratrol formulation was delivered directly at the site of the tumor in a neuroblastoma mouse model. The amount of unmodified resveratrol associated with the tumor increased more than 1000-fold. The increase of unmodified resveratrol associated with the tumor resulted in tumor regression. The number of residual tumor cells that remained viable also decreased as the ratio of the metabolites relative to unmodified resveratrol declined.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acell viability 3ametabolites 3aremission 3aresveratrol 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aNeuroblastomaxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aStilbenesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism.1 aSubramanian, Lalita1 aVan Ginkel, Paul R.1 aDarjatmoko, Soesiawati1 aLindstrom, Mary J.1 aSomoza, Veronika1 aGhosh, Sunil K.1 aSong, Zhenlei1 aHsung, Richard P.1 aKwon, Glen S.1 aEliceiri, Kevin W.1 aAlbert, Daniel M.1 aPolans, Arthur S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4979–4986-4979–4986x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104901g3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03729naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001600185245009900201300001400300500002400314520174700338650001102085650002002096650002202116650001702138650003502155650002802190650002302218650002002241650003002261650002302291650001602314650002002330650001302350650001202363650001102375650004902386650002502435650005802460650003502518650002402553650001502577650002902592650001602621650001702637651001102654651002602665700001802691700002002709700001702729700001702746700001402763700001702777773009502794852000902889856008802898930003302986945002503019946001103044655001203055IND4434569420221121145832.0100326e20100419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456942DNAL7 a200710832pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aX6201 aDutra, L.H.10aMapping risk of bovine fasciolosis in the south of Brazil using Geographic Information Systems  ap. 76-81.  aIncludes references  aFasciolosis, caused by Fasciola hepatica, is an endemic disease of ruminants that occurs in several countries of South America where it can lead to decreased production and fertility and, in severe cases, animal death. Although very prevalent, information on the epidemiology of the disease is incomplete in Brazil. The objective of the present study was to define the prevalence of F. hepatica in the livers of cattle from slaughterhouses and correlate the data with the animal's origin (climate and altitude) using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The data was used to create an epidemiological map of fasciolosis by state (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná), by municipality (n =530) and by year (2003-2008). Information was analyzed using a databank from slaughterhouses with Federal Inspection Services of the Ministry of Agriculture. The highest cattle infection rate was found in the two most Southern states of Rio Grande do Sul (18.7%) and Santa Catarina (10.1%). Animals from the Campanha region of Rio Grande do Sul and from the central coast area of Santa Catarina had prevalences of greater than 40%. Cattle from low altitude[crossed out text: s] municipalities were significantly more likely to have the disease (p <0.05). No significant differences were found between high or low prevalence and ambient temperatures. Risk maps resulting from this study provide information on the epidemiology and transmission of F. hepatica in Southern Brazil needed for design of appropriate control measures to control economic impacts. F. hepatica may represent an important source of zoonotic infection of humans as well; therefore these findings may be complemented by future studies on human infections in high risk areas. 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3aFasciola hepatica 3afascioliasis 3ageographic information systems 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease prevalence 3aslaughterhouses 3ageographical distribution 3atemporal variation 3acartography 3arisk assessment 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aFasciolaxphysiology 2aFascioliasisxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aLiverxparasitology 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aMolento, M.B.1 aNaumann, C.R.C.1 aBiondo, A.W.1 aFortes, F.S.1 aSavio, D.1 aMalone, J.B.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Apr. 19, v. 169, no. 1-2 p.76-81dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.12.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/05/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245017700178300001800355520161800373650002001991650002602011650001702037650002502054650001802079650001702097650001602114650002402130650001702154650001102171650001902182650001502201650001202216650003002228700001702258700001902275700001602294700002002310773011302330852000902443856009202452930003302544946001102577655001202588IND4410123320221121145751.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441012332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06608.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmodiya, Krishanpal10aDeciphering the key residues in Plasmodium falciparumβ-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase responsible for interactions with Plasmodium falciparum acyl carrier protein  ap. 4756-4766.  aThe type II fatty acid synthase (FAS) pathway of Plasmodium falciparum is a validated unique target for developing novel antimalarials, due to its intrinsic differences from the type I pathway operating in humans. β-Ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabG) performs the NADPH-dependent reduction of β-ketoacyl-ACP to β-hydroxyacyl-ACP, the first reductive step in the elongation cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis. In this article, we report intensive studies on the direct interactions of Plasmodium FabG and Plasmodium ACP in solution, in the presence and absence of its cofactor, NADPH, by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of P. falciparum FabG (PfFabG) and by surface plasmon resonance. To address the issue of the importance of the residues involved in strong, specific and stoichiometric binding of PfFabG to P. falciparum ACP (PfACP), we mutated Arg187, Arg190 and Arg230 of PfFabG. The activities of the mutants were assessed using both an ACP-dependent and an ACP-independent assay. The affinities of all the PfFabG mutants for acetoacetyl-ACP (the physiological substrate) were reduced to different extents as compared to wild-type PfFabG, but were equally active in biochemical assays with the substrate analog acetoacetyl-CoA. Kinetic analysis and studies of direct binding between PfFabG and PfACP confirmed the identification of Arg187 and Arg230 as critical residues for the PfFabG-PfACP interactions. Our studies thus reveal the significance of the positively charged/hydrophobic patch located adjacent to the active site cavities of PfFabG for interactions with PfACP. 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aactive sites 3aacyl carrier protein 3aantimalarials 3abiosynthesis 3afatty acids 3afatty-acid synthase 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amonitoring 3amutants 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aModak, Rahul1 aSahoo, Nirakar1 aSajad, Syed1 aSurolia, Namita0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Oct., v. 275, no. 19 p.4756-4766dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06608.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03503naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245012500175300002000300500002400320520135100344650001401695650001701709650001801726650003701744650001901781650002001800650000901820650002401829650001701853650003201870650001201902650005801914650002101972650005601993650002702049650003402076650005802110650001102168650000902179650005302188650002702241650005802268650005202326650006202378650000902440650001702449650003802466700002802504700002002532700002002552700002202572700001702594700002002611700003002631773011802661852000902779856007702788655001202865IND4459643320221121145831.0110705s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964332DNAL7 a214282992pmid7 a10.1021/jf10467382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yung-Chang10aChondroprotective Role of Sesamol by Inhibiting MMPs Expression via Retaining NF-κB Signaling in Activated SW1353 Cells  ap. 4969–4978.  aIncludes references  aOverexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a major pathological factor causing cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of sesamol on expression of MMPs in activated chondrosarcoma cells. Sesamol significantly attenuated TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced gelatinolysis and expression of MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner in SW1353 cells. Additionally, both MMP-1 and -13 stimulated by PMA were inhibited by sesamol. On the other hand, the NF-κB signaling activation through IκB-α degradation was restored by sesamol under TNF-α or PMA stimulation. Furthermore, this bioactive compound exerted the reduction on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or p38 MAPKs after either PMA or IL-1β stimulation. This study also evaluated whether sesamol down-regulates MMP expression in the joint cartilage of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA in rats. Sesamol prevented the expression of MMP-1 and -9 in the cartilage of MIA-induced OA in rats. The results of this study demonstrate that sesamol inhibits cytokine- or PMA-induced MMPs expression through the signal pathways of either NF-κB or ERK/p38 MAPKs down-regulation. This study also showed that sesamol attenuates destructive factor expression in vivo, providing a potential strategy for the chondroprotective therapy in OA. 3acartilage 3agelatinase A 3ainterleukin-1 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aosteoarthritis 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aBenzodioxolesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChondrocytesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aOsteoarthritisxdrug therapyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aProtective Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects1 aJayakumar, Thanasekaran1 aDuann, Yeh-Fang1 aZhou, Yongzhen.1 aHsieh, Cheng-Ying1 aYu, Shin-Yun1 aSheu, Joen-Rong1 aHsiao, G.

Recruitment of Csk occurs via SH2-domain binding to PAG pTyr317, thus, the interaction is highly dependent on phosphorylation performed by the Src family kinase Fyn, which docks onto PAG using a dual-domain binding mode involving both SH3- and SH2-domains of Fyn. In this study, we investigated Fyn SH3-domain binding to 14-mer peptide ligands derived from Cbp/PAG-enriched microdomains sequence using biochemical, biophysical and computational techniques. Interaction kinetics and dissociation constants for the various ligands were determined by SPR. The local structural impact of ligand association has been evaluated using CD, and molecular modelling has been employed to investigate details of the interactions. We show that data from these investigations correlate with functional effects of ligand binding, assessed experimentally by kinase assays using full-length PAG proteins as substrates. The presented data demonstrate a potential method for modulation of Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylation through minor changes of the substrate SH3-interacting motif. 3aT-lymphocytes 3adissociation 3aligands 3amodels 3aphosphoproteins 3aphosphorylation 3atyrosine1 aPetsalaki, Evangelia1 aStokka, Anne J.1 aRussell, Robert B.1 aTaskén, Kjetil1 aBerge, Torunn0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Oct., v. 275, no. 19 p.4863-4874dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06626.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02130naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245010000164300001800264500001500282520114800297650001501445650001501460650001301475650001501488653002301503653002701526653001801553700001801571700001901589773008001608852000901688930003301697945002501730946001301755655001201768IND4367125020221121052544.0050215e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436712502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDe Castro, L.R.10aEffect of container opening area on air distribution during precooling of horticultural produce  ap. 2033-2038.  a2019-12-05  aAn existing research tool was used to investigate air distribution in horticultural produce containers during forced-air precooling. This tool consisted of an instrumented produce simulator that allowed indirect measurement of surrounding air velocity at different positions inside a package. Using this new research tool for different forced-air cooling conditions, the surrounding air velocity was inferred as a function of the simulator's location in reference to the air entrance. The air pathway during the cooling process was investigated for three total package-opening areas (0.67%, 2%, 6%) at airflow rates ranging from 0.125 to 3.9 L s(-1) kg(-1). The air approach velocity at each position inside a package rose as the opening area increased. More vented area also enhanced the cooling efficiency. However, increasing the airflow rate resulted in a greater air pressure drop. Opening areas more than 6% of the package surface should be tested to achieve the maximum necessary vented configuration that meets the structure constraints and generates air distribution and cooling efficiency not significantly different from fully open. 3aprecooling 3acontainers 3aair flow 3avegetables 0aforced air cooling 0apacked food containers 0afruits (food)1 aVigneault, C.1 aCortez, L.A.B.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v. 47, no. 6 p.2033-2038x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle03348naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001600155245008400171300001600255500002400271520204300295650002402338650001602362650002102378650001702399650001702416650002902433650001102462650000902473650002202482650002702504650002302531650005702554650002402611700001902635700001302654700001602667700002002683700001502703700001902718773010502737852000902842856003902851655001202890IND4438880320221121052522.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443888032DNAL7 a203100572pmid7 a10.1002/pca.12092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhi-Jun10aAnalysis of sesterterpenoids from Aspergillus terreus using ESI-QTOF and ESI-IT  ap. 374-383.  aIncludes references  aIntroduction - Biosynthesis of terretonin was studied due to the interesting skeleton of this series of sesterterpenoids. Very recently, López-Gresa reported two new sesterterpenoids (terretonins E and F) which are inhibitors of the mammalian mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mass spectrometry (MS), especially tandem mass spectrometry, has been one of the most important physicochemical methods for the identification of trace natural products due to it rapidity, sensitivity and low levels of sample consumption. The potential application prospect and unique skeleton prompted us to study structural characterisation using MS.Objective - To obtain sufficient information for rapid structural elucidation of this class of compounds using MS.Methodology - The elemental composition of the product ions was confirmed by low-energy ESI-CID-QTOF-MS/MS analyses. The fragmentation pathways were postulated on the basis of ESI-QTOF-MS/MS/MS and ESI-IT-MSn spectra. Common features and major differences between ESI-QTOF-MS/MS and IT-MSn spectra were compared. For ESI-QTOF-MS/MS/MS experiments, capillary exit voltage was raised to induce in-source dissociation. Ammonium acetate or acetic acid were added into solutions to improve the intensity of [M + H]⁺. The collision energy was optimised to achieve sufficient fragmentation. Some fragmentation pathways were unambiguously proposed by the variety of abundance of fragment ions at different collision energies even without MSn spectra.Results - Fragmentation pathways of five representative sesterterpenoids were elucidated using ESI-QTOF-MS/MS/MS and ESI-IT-MSn in both positive- and negative-ion mode. The key group of characterising fragmentation profiles was ring B, and these fragmentation patterns are helpful to identify different types of sestertepenoids.Conclusion - Complementary information obtained from fragmentation experiments of [M + H]⁺ (or [M + NH₄]⁺) and [M - H]⁻ precursor ions is especially valuable for rapid identification of this kind of sesterterpenoid. 3aAspergillus terreus 3aacetic acid 3aammonium acetate 3abiosynthesis 3adissociation 3aelectron transport chain 3aenergy 3aions 3amass spectrometry 2aAspergillusxchemistry 2aLimit of Detection 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTerpenesxchemistry1 aFang, Dong-Mei1 aHan, Dan1 aLi, Guo-You1 aChen, Xiao-Zhen1 aQi, Hua-Yi1 aZhang, Guo-Lin0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2010 July, v. 21, no. 4 p.374-383dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0958-03447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.1209 7aarticle04406naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245010000204300001400304500017600318500002400494500001500518520194300533650001302476650002202489650003202511650002202543650002502565650001102590650004402601650001602645650002602661650003802687650003402725650002102759650002502780650001902805650001902824650001402843650002202857650002002879650001202899650001402911650006102925650005502986650004503041650003603086650002203122650001703144650005103161650003103212653003203243653002003275653001503295700001803310700001703328700002103345700001603366700001703382773009503399852000903494856008803503930003303591945002503624946001103649655001203660IND4434578520221121020658.0100326e20100421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457852DNAL7 a198924972pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aReimann, Ilona10aCharacterization of a new chimeric marker vaccine candidate with a mutated antigenic E2-epitope  ap. 45-50.  aPaper presented at the 7th Pestivirus Symposium of the European Society of Veterinary Virology, held on September 17-19, 2008, in Uppsala, Sweden / edited by Ann Lindberg.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA new chimeric pestivirus “CP7_E1E2alf_TLA”, based on the infectious cDNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain CP7, was constructed. The substitution of BVDV E1 and E2 with the respective proteins of classical swine fever (CSF) strain Alfort 187 allows an optimal heterodimerization of E1 and E2 in the chimeric virus, which is beneficial for efficient and authentic virus assembly and growth. In addition, for implementation of E2-based marker diagnostics, the previously described antigenic CSFV-specific TAVSPTTLR epitope was exchanged with the corresponding E2-epitope of BVDV strain CP7. Recombinant virus CP7_E1E2alf_TLA displayed a growth defect, and was not reacting with monoclonal antibodies used in commercial E2 antibody blocking ELISAs. Therefore, efficacy as well as marker properties of CP7_E1E2alf_TLA were investigated in an animal experiment with both a high dose and a low dose vaccine preparation. All CP7_E1E2alf_TLA-vaccinated animals seroconverted until day 28 post-vaccination with neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, at the day of challenge infection CP7_E1E2alf_TLA-immunized animals showed distinct lower ELISA values in a commercial CSFV E2 antibody test in comparison to the C-strain vaccinated controls. However, E2-ELISA reactivity as well as neutralizing titers were directly connected to the dosage used for vaccination, and only the low dose group had E2-ELISA values below threshold until challenge infection. Following challenge infection with highly virulent CSFV strain Koslov, all vaccinees were protected, however, short-term fever episodes and very limited CSFV genome detection with very low copy numbers could be observed. In conclusion, manipulation of the TAVSPTTLR-epitope within the tested chimeric virus resulted in an slightly reduced efficacy, but the E2 marker properties unexpectedly did not allow a clear differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals in some cases. 3aepitopes 3adisease detection 3aClassical swine fever virus 3acomplementary DNA 3aneutralization tests 3adosage 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avaccination 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3amicrobial growth 3arecombinant vaccines 3aviral antigens 3aseroconversion 3avirulence 3avirus replication 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aClassical Swine Feverximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aClassical Swine Fever Virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDiarrhea Virus 1, Bovine Viralxgenetics 2aEpitopesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0amarker vaccines 0aantibodies1 aDepner, Klaus1 aUtke, Katrin1 aLeifer, Immanuel1 aLange, Elke1 aBeer, Martin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 Apr. 21, v. 142, no. 1-2 p.45-50dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02635naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245007500146300001400221520109100235650001701326650002001343650001601363650001601379650002501395650001101420650001201431650002001443650001701463650002401480650003701504650003501541650002101576650002501597650004001622650002901662650001801691650002501709650004401734650001701778651001001795653001901805700001601824700001501840700001401855700002001869700001601889700001601905773008001921852000902001930003302010945001302043946001302056655001202069IND2323391320221121020833.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339132DNAL7 a112100502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaiaschi, A.10aProteolysis of beta-casein as a marker of Grana Padano cheese ripening  ap. 60-65.  aProteolysis has a critical role in defining the typical organoleptic characteristics of Grana Padano, a well-known Italian cheese. During the ripening process, hydrolysis of beta-casein produces different fragments, the most abundant and widely studied of which are gamma-caseins, three polypeptides containing the HOOC-terminal portion of beta-casein. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and a specific anti-beta-casein monoclonal antibody, two beta-casein-derived bands were identified in Grana Padano cheese: beta(a) and beta(b). Thanks to the identification of the amino acid sequences, it was shown that: a) beta(a) contains gamma1-casein [beta-casein (29-209)] and the correlated peptide [beta-casein (30-209)]; b) beta(b) contains gamma2-casein [beta-casein (106-209)] and gamma3-casein [beta-casein (108-209)]. The production of beta(a) and beta(b) by the three enzymes most involved in cheese proteolysis (pepsin, chymosin, and plasmin) was evaluated by performing in vitro digestions. A significant correlation between abundance of some polypeptides and ripening process was shown. 3aGrana cheese 3acheese ripening 3aproteolysis 3abeta-casein 3aamino acid sequences 3apepsin 3aplasmin 3aenzyme activity 3apolypeptides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxanalysis 2aCaseinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCheesexanalysis 2aChymosinxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFibrinolysinxmetabolism 2aFood Handling 2aPepsin Axmetabolism 2aPeptide Fragmentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aTime Factors 3aItaly 0acheese quality1 aBeretta, B.1 aPoiesi, C.1 aConti, A.1 aGiuffrida, M.G.1 aGalli, C.L.1 aRestani, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.60-65x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002400176245011900200300001400319500017600333500002400509500001500533520077800548650002701326650002101353650003201374650002501406650001501431650002301446650002201469650002601491650001201517650003501529650001401564650003801578650006901616650003601685650003801721650004901759650002101808650004101829650001001870650003601880653002801916653001901944700001801963700002801981700001502009773009502024852000902119856008802128930003302216945002502249946001102274655001202285IND4434578420221121020608.0100326e20100421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457842DNAL7 a198504202pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aPorntrakulpipat, S.10aRNA interference targeting nucleocapsid protein (C) inhibits classical swine fever virus replication in SK-6 cells  ap. 41-44.  aPaper presented at the 7th Pestivirus Symposium of the European Society of Veterinary Virology, held on September 17-19, 2008, in Uppsala, Sweden / edited by Ann Lindberg.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe application of RNA interference (RNAi) strategy for controlling classical swine fever could become a promising alternative to the conventional eradication measures, as it was recently shown for foot-and-mouth disease (), influenza (), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome () and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (). The use of synthetic siRNA which is corresponding to nucleotides 1130-1148 of the CSF virus strain Alfort, targeting the nucleocapsid protein (C) was investigated to show the inhibition of CSF virus replication. It could be shown that the virus titer of infected cells, which had been mock-transfected or transfected with control (non-silence) RNA were not affected.

With a view to providing additional information on the cellular mechanisms that may contribute to protection, which in turn may aid the development of the next generation of CSFV vaccines, we explored the kinetics of the cytokine responses from peripheral blood cells of pigs vaccinated with an attenuated C-strain vaccine strain and/or infected with a recent CSFV isolate. Peripheral blood cells were isolated over the course of vaccination/infection and stimulated in vitro with C-strain or UK2000/7.1 viruses. Virus-specific responses of peripheral blood cells isolated from C-strain vaccinated pigs were dominated by the production of IFN-γ. IFN-γ production in response to the C-strain virus was first detected in vaccinates 9 days post-vaccination and was sustained over the period of observation. In contrast, cells from challenge control animals did not secrete IFN-γ in response to stimulation with C-strain or UK2000/7.1 viruses. Supernatants from UK2000/7.1 infected animals contained significant levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines from day 8 post-infection and these cytokines were present in both virus and mock stimulated cultures. The results suggest that the C-strain virus is a potent inducer of a type-1 T cell response, which may play a role in the protection afforded by such vaccines, whereas the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses observed in cultures from infected pigs may reflect a pathological pro-inflammatory cascade initiated in vivo following the replication and spread of CSFV. 3aClassical swine fever virus 3ain vitro studies 3aT-lymphocytes 3alive vaccines 3acytokines 3ainflammation 3aswine 3ainterferons 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3astrains 3adisease course 3ahog cholera 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aClassical Swine Feverximmunology 2aClassical Swine Fever Virusximmunology. 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunologyxvirology. 2aMale 2aSwine 2aTime Factors 2aVaccinationxveterinary 2aVaccines, Attenuatedximmunology 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 0aimmunity 0avaccine strains 0ablood cells1 aEverett, Helen E.1 aJohns, Helen L.1 aHaines, Felicity J.1 aRocca, S.

  1 aLiu, S.10aSpatial pH distribution during ripening of Camembert cheese  ap. 279-285.  aDuring the ripening phase, the pH values continually change, which impacts the survival and growth of all microorganisms including Listeria monocytogenes (a foodborne pathogen). Toward this end, distribution and change of pH during ripening of cylindrical (108 mm diameter; 32 mm height) Camembert cheese were measured at 16 locations and three vertical cross-sections 120 degrees apart. The pH at different locations had significant differences (P < 0.05) for each day of ripening. The pH values in the top and bottom regions had higher values than in the top middle and bottom middle regions. In addition, the pH in the surface region was higher than in the center region. The day had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the pH values during ripening. Overall, the pH values increased gradually and throughout the ripening of Camembert cheese. The pH value was around 4.5 on day 1 and approximately 7.5 on day 35 of ripening. Within a set, the pH values had no significant difference (P > 0.05) for each batch and each section. For across-set comparisons, the set had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the pH values during ripening. There were similar values for each batch and section on each ripening day. The pH values measured in this research can be the basis for developing a mathematical model to predict the distribution of pH, which when coupled with a dynamic predictive growth model, will enable the prediction of survival and growth of L. monocytogenes during ripening of Camembert cheese. 3aCamembert cheese 3afood quality 3apH 3aspatial variation 3acheese ripening 3atemporal variation1 aPuri, V.M.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 1 p.279-285x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/27  aOther US 7aarticle03846naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245007000204300001400274500017600288500002400464500001500488520156900503650001102072650002202083650003402105650001802139650002302157650001402180650001602194650002102210650001902231650003402250650001202284650002002296650001002316650002302326650001202349650002902361650003302390650001102423650001402434650005802448650001102506650005502517650002502572650001302597650001902610650002702629650003802656650001502694650003102709653002002740653001202760700002102772700002202793700001902815700001702834773009502851852000902946856008802955930003303043945002503076946001103101655001203112IND4434578820221121041322.0100326e20100421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457882DNAL7 a198752532pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aZemke, Johanna10aNovel BVDV-2 mutants as new candidates for modified-live vaccines  ap. 69-80.  aPaper presented at the 7th Pestivirus Symposium of the European Society of Veterinary Virology, held on September 17-19, 2008, in Uppsala, Sweden / edited by Ann Lindberg.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aProtection against Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 2 infection of commercially available vaccines is often limited due to marked genetic and antigenic differences between BVDV types 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Therefore, the immunogenicity of selected BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 mutants derived from infectious full-length cDNA clones and their use as modified-live vaccine candidates against challenge infection with a virulent heterologous BVDV-2 field isolate were investigated. Deletion mutants of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 lacking a part of the Npro gene (BVDV-1ΔNpro/BVDV-2ΔNpro) were used as well as a packaged replicon with a deletion in the structural core protein encoding region (BVDV-2ΔC-pseudovirions). The 25 calves used in this vaccination/challenge trial were allocated in five groups (n =5/group). One group received BVDV-1ΔNpro (1 shot), one group BVDV-2ΔNpro (1 shot), one group received both, BVDV-1ΔNpro and BVDV-2ΔNpro (1 shot), and one group was immunised with the BVDV-2ΔC-pseudovirions (2 shots). The fifth group served as non-vaccinated control group. All groups were challenged intranasally with the BVDV-2 strain HI916 and monitored for signs of clinical disease, virus shedding and viremia. All tested BVDV vaccine candidates markedly reduced the outcome of the heterologous virulent BVDV-2 challenge infection showing graduated protective effects. The BVDV-2ΔNpro mutant was able to induce complete protection and a “sterile immunity” upon challenge. Thus it represents a promising candidate for an efficacious future live vaccine. 3avirion 3acomplementary DNA 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 2 3alive vaccines 3astrain differences 3avirulence 3avaccination 3adisease severity 3aviral proteins 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3amutants 3aimmune response 3agenes 3amicrobial genetics 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aBody Temperatureximmunology 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aDiarrhea Virus 2, Bovine Viralxgeneticsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aHemorrhagic Syndrome, Bovinexprevention & control 2aLeukocytesxvirology 2aMutation 2aNosexvirology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Load 2aViral Vaccinesximmunology 0avaccine strains 0astrains1 aKönig, Patricia1 aMischkale, Katrin1 aReimann, Ilona1 aBeer, Martin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 Apr. 21, v. 142, no. 1-2 p.69-80dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01892naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245006400152300001400216500001500230520058100245650002100826650001100847650001400858650001700872650001600889650002400905650003000929650001600959650001500975650001200990650002401002650002101026650002001047650001801067650002401085650002701109650003201136650003901168653000901207700001901216700001501235773008001250852000901330930003301339945001301372946001301385655001201398IND2323391020221121041116.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339102DNAL7 a112100472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaaskelainen, A.J.10aOn reflectometric measurement of a refractive index of milk  ap. 38-43.  a2019-12-05  aThe refractive index of milk samples was measured with a reflectometer.

Lactic acid in Cheddar enzyme-modified cheeses varied markedly depending on the manufacturer. Differences in the ratio of L- to D-lactic acid indicate that cheeses of different age were used in their manufacture or contained varying levels of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria. The level of lipolysis in enzyme-modified cheese was higher than in natural Cheddar cheese; butyrate was the predominant free fatty acid. The addition of exogenous acetate, lactate, and butyrate was also indicated in some enzyme-modified cheeses and may be used to confer a specific flavor characteristic or reduce the pH of the product. Propionate was also found in some enzyme-modified cheese products and most likely originated from Swiss-type cheese used in their manufacture. Propionate is not normally associated with natural Cheddar cheese flavor; however, it may be important in the flavor and aroma of Cheddar enzyme-modified cheese. Levels of lipolysis and glycolysis appear to highly controlled as interbatch variability was generally low. Overall, the production of enzyme-modified Cheddar cheese involves manipulation of the end-products of glycolysis (lactate, propionate, and acetate) and lipolysis to generate products for specific applications. 3aenantiomers 3avolatile fatty acids 3aCheddar cheese 3aflavor 3alipolysis 3aglycolysis 3aodors 3alactic acid 2aAcetates 2aBacillusxmetabolism 2aButyrates 2aCheesexanalysis 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFood Handling 2aGlycolysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPropionates 2aTaste 2aTime Factors 0afatty acids 0al-lactic acid 0ad-lactic acid1 aWilkinson, M.G.1 aFox, P.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.66-73x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03739naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245016300181300001800344500002400362500001500386520127400401650001401675650001101689650001301700650001101713650001101724650002301735650001201758650001101770650001601781650001901797650001401816650003101830650002601861650001001887650002201897650002401919650001901943650001401962650004201976650001502018650002802033650001302061650001002074650002402084650005702108650003802165650001702203650001902220650001702239650002802256650004202284650007802326650002502404650004602429650002302475650002702498650003702525650005502562653002502617653001002642653001202652700002402664700002502688700002102713700001302734700001702747700001702764773009502781852000902876856004802885655001202933IND4422472220221121031706.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442247222DNAL7 a194792582pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-009-0715-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanania, Uri14aThe ubiquitin extension protein S27a is differentially expressed in developing flower organs of Thompson seedless versus Thompson seeded grape isogenic clones  ap. 1033-1042.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn Vitis vinifera L. cv. Thompson Seedless, fertilization occurs but seeds abort, a type of stenospermocarpy. To clone transcripts with differential expression during flower development, suppressive subtractive hybridization was carried out using two isogenic clones 'Thompson seedless' and 'Thompson seeded', at three stages of inflorescence development (from bud break to ~20 days prior to anthesis). Differential screening and sequencing of a forward and reverse subtractive cDNA library yielded several singleton ESTs. One differentially expressed clone in 'Thompson' seeded versus seedless isogenic clones was the ubiquitin extension protein S27a. In situ hybridization demonstrated its significantly higher expression in the carpel and ovaries of 'Thompson' seedless versus seeded isogenic clones during flower development. Overexpression of this gene resulted in abnormal plant regeneration and inhibited shoot development compared to controls; its silencing in embryogenic callus induced cell necrosis and callus death, evidencing tight regulation of this gene in developing organs of grape. S27a overexpression in carpels and integuments of the seedless flower may interfere with normal development of these organs, leading to embryo abortion and seedlessness. 3aflowering 3agrapes 3anecrosis 3acallus 3ashoots 3aseedless varieties 3acarpels 3aclones 3agrape seeds 3aVitis vinifera 3ascreening 3agene expression regulation 3ain situ hybridization 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3acDNA libraries 3aubiquitin 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3aintegument 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abudbreak 3adeath 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGene Silencing 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRibosomal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aUbiquitinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVitisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0adevelopmental stages 0agenes 0aovaries1 aVelcheva, Margarita1 aSahar, N.q(Nachman)1 aFlaishman, Moshe1 aOr, Etti1 aDegani, Oded1 aPerl, Avihai0 tPlant cell reports.g2009 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.1033-1042dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-009-0715-1 7aarticle02296naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245010200154300001800256500002400274520132900298650002201627650002101649650001501670650001201685650001601697650001501713651001801728700001601746700001301762700002401775773011101799852000901910856003901919655001201958IND4398250920221121005616.0071125e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439825092DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.65552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudheer, K.P.10aImpact of time-scale of the calibration objective function on the performance of watershed models  ap. 3409-3419.  aIncludes references  aMany of the continuous watershed models perform all their computations on a daily time step, yet they are often calibrated at an annual or monthly time-scale that may not guarantee good simulation performance on a daily time step. The major objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the calibration time-scale on model predictive ability. This study considered the Soil and Water Assessment Tool for the analyses, and it has been calibrated at two time-scales, viz. monthly and daily for the War Eagle Creek watershed in the USA. The results demonstrate that the model's performance at the smaller time-scale (such as daily) cannot be ensured by calibrating them at a larger time-scale (such as monthly). It is observed that, even though the calibrated model possesses satisfactory 'goodness of fit' statistics, the simulation residuals failed to confirm the assumption of their homoscedasticity and independence. The results imply that evaluation of models should be conducted considering their behavior in various aspects of simulation, such as predictive uncertainty, hydrograph characteristics, ability to preserve statistical properties of the historic flow series, etc. The study enlightens the scope for improving/developing effective autocalibration procedures at the daily time step for watershed models. 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3asoil water 3astreams 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aUnited States1 aChaubey, I.1 aGarg, V.1 aMigliaccio, Kati W.0 tHydrological processes.g2007 Dec. 01, v. 21, no. 25 p.3409-3419dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6555 7aarticle03727naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011400146300001600260500001500276520163100291650001201922650001201934650001801946650002501964650001401989650001102003650001902014650001902033650002602052650002102078650001902099650002502118650001902143650001202162650001502174650001002189650001002199650002002209650001702229650002702246650001602273650001202289650003602301650001402337650003102351650003202382650002502414650002802439650003702467650003502504650001702539650002802556653001002584653002202594653002202616653001902638653001702657653001102674653001302685700001302698700001502711700001402726700002002740700001402760700002102774773008202795852000902877930003302886945001302919946001302932655001202945IND2323392720221120224837.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339272DNAL7 a112100302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanford, K.10aEffects of alcohol ethoxylate and pluronic detergents on the development of pasture bloat in cattle and sheep  ap. 167-176.  a2019-12-05  aA series of studies was conducted to determine the efficacy and possible modes of action of a water-soluble mixture of alcohol ethoxylate and pluronic detergents (AEPD; Blocare 4511, ANCARE, Auckland, NZ) in preventing pasture bloat in ruminants grazing or fed freshly harvested alfalfa. Ten cannulated Suffolk wethers were offered freshly harvested alfalfa; five were given a daily intraruminal dose of 40 ml of 50% AEPD (vol/vol) 1 h before feeding, and five (controls) were dosed with water. Viscosity of ruminal fluid was reduced (P < 0.001) in AEPD-treated wethers, relative to the controls, for the first 2 h after feeding but not at 4 h after feeding and beyond. Treatment with AEPD did not affect dry matter (DM) intake, digestibility of DM, acid detergent fiber, or neutral detergent fiber, or N digestion and retention, implying that AEPD likely would not affect milk production. In a crossover grazing study, five of the wethers were given AEPD in drinking water (0.1%, vol/vol); treatment with AEPD was 100% effective for preventing bloat in sheep grazing early-bloom alfalfa for 4 h daily. Replicate grazing studies were conducted with cattle in Lethbridge, AB; Lacombe, AB; and Kamloops, BC. Treated animals received AEPD in the water (0.06%, vol/vol) and grazed vegetative alfalfa for 6 h daily. As it did with sheep, AEPD treatment effectively precluded the bloat observed in control animals. Consequently, AEPD may be a valuable tool for alfalfa pasture-based dairy production although further study is required to develop an integrated model for optimal administration under a variety of climatic conditions. 3agrazing 3aalfalfa 3adigestibility 3avolatile fatty acids 3aviscosity 3asteers 3afatty alcohols 3arumen protozoa 3abotanical composition 3aantibloat agents 3amaturity stage 3anonionic surfactants 3adrinking water 3afoaming 3adetergents 3abloat 3asheep 3aMedicago sativa 3arumen fluids 2aAlcoholsxpharmacology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDigestion 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aMedicago sativaxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPoloxamerxpharmacology 2aRumenxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSheepxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aViscosityxdrug effects 0arumen 0aweed palatability 0aselective grazing 0arumen contents 0atransit time 0acattle 0amaturity1 aWang, Y.1 aBerg, B.P.1 aMajak, W.1 aMcCartney, D.H.1 aBaron, V.1 aMcAllister, T.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.167-176x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03762naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245012100148300001600269500001500285520167000300650001001970650001901980650002301999650002002022650001502042650001902057650001702076650002602093650002102119650001202140650001702152650001702169650002702186650001802213650002102231650002402252650001202276650002402288650002602312650002602338650001402364650006102378650001202439650002402451650001102475650002802486650002202514650002702536650005702563650002602620650002102646650004102667650002002708650001002728653002902738653001302767653003102780700001502811700001902826700001502845700001802860773008202878852000902960930003302969945001303002946001303015655001203028IND2323393620221120224821.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339362DNAL7 a112100392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBequette, B.J.10aInsulin regulates milk production and mammary gland and hind-leg amino acid fluxes and blood flow in lactating goats  ap. 241-255.  a2019-12-05  aWe investigated the roles of insulin and amino acid (AA) in regulating milk production and the uptake of AA and blood flow (BF) by the mammary gland and hind-leg of goats (n = 4). During two periods, either saline or AA (65 g/d) was infused i.v. for 7.5 d, and, beginning on d 5, goats were subjected to a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The insulin clamp elevated plasma insulin levels threefold and insulin-like growth factor-1 by 27%, and euglycemia was maintained by the infusion of glucose. Arterial, mammary, and tarsal vein blood samples were obtained on d 4 and 8 of each period, and blood flow was monitored continuously by probes. Insulin and insulin plus AA infusions increased the yields of milk by 13 to 18% and protein by 10 to 21%, but AA infusion alone had no effect. The insulin clamp reduced milk fat content by 21 to 31% and yield by 8 to 19%, and reduced the yields of milk fatty acids >C16. The insulin clamp increased mammary blood flow by 42%, but insulin and AA infusions both increased hind-leg BF by 29 to 52% and by 25%, respectively. Net uptakes of most plasma AA by the udder were reduced by insulin, whereas AA infusion had no effect. For the leg, the uptake of His and Thr were decreased by insulin, whereas the infusion of AA stimulated the uptake of total essential AA. Insulin increased the uptake of glucose by the udder but not by the leg. This study suggests that the udder and leg tissues respond differently to infusions of insulin and AA; the udder was more responsive to insulin, while the leg was more responsive to AA concentration (supply), at least in terms of AA uptake and net anabolism (protein gain or secretion). 3agoats 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein yield 3anutrient uptake 3ablood flow 3amammary glands 3ablood plasma 3aamino acid metabolism 3ahyperinsulinemia 3alactose 3ablood lipids 3abody regions 3along chain fatty acids 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3ahormonal regulation 3ainsulin 3amilk fat percentage 3aessential amino acids 3anutrient partitioning 3agoat milk 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexbloodxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aFemale 2aGlucose Clamp Technique 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aHindlimbxblood supply 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexbloodxphysiology. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxblood supply 2aMilkxchemistry 2aVeins 0anonessential amino acids 0amilk fat 0ainsulin-like growth factor1 aKyle, C.E.1 aCrompton, L.A.1 aBuchan, V.1 aHanigan, M.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.241-255x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02596naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002400161245006600185300001800251500013200269520119600401650002001597650001101617650002101628650002301649650002501672650001001697650002601707650002401733653002301757653002201780653002501802653002001827700002601847700001801873700001901891700001701910773013101927852000902058930003302067945002502100946001302125655001202138IND4410155820221120121925.0080912e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441015582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Multiple proteins require one or more atoms of copper for proper structure and function, but excess of copper is toxic. To prevent the consequences of copper deficiency and overload, living organisms have evolved molecular mechanisms that regulate its uptake, intracellular traffic, storage, and efflux. Underlying some of the cellular responses to variations in copper levels are changes in the expression of genes encoding molecular components of copper metabolism. In recent years, genome-scale expression analysis in several eukaryotic models has allowed the identification of copper-responsive genes involved in copper homeostasis. Characterization of the transcriptional changes in response to varying copper levels include both genes directly involved in copper homeostasis and genes involved in different cellular process that, even though they are not directly connected to copper metabolism, change their expression during the cellular adaptation to copper availability. Evaluation of these gene expression patterns could aid in the identification of biologically relevant markers to monitor copper status in humans. 3agene expression 3acopper 3adietary minerals 3amineral metabolism 3anutrition physiology 3agenes 3anutrient deficiencies 3adeficiency diseases 0aliterature reviews 0ametallochaperones 0acopper-related genes 0acopper overload1 aReyes-Jara, Angélica1 aSuazo, Miriam1 aJo, William J.1 aVulpe, Chris0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Sept., v. 88, no. 3 p.830S-834SdAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle03141naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150100002500170245011700195300001800312500013200330500002800462520178100490650001602271650001102287650002102298650002302319650002502342650001002367650002602377650002402403650002602427650001302453650002602466650002402492653002302516700002302539773013502562852000902697946001302706655001202719IND4410155920221122033343.0080912s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441015592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, understanding the systemic regulation of copper availability and distribution among the different tissues of an intact multicellular organism has proven to be more challenging. This analysis is made even more difficult if the genetic variability among organisms is taken into account. The zebrafish has long been considered a powerful animal model because of its tractable genetics and embryology, but it has more recently become a player in environmental studies, pharmaceutical screening, and physiologic analysis. In particular, the use of the larvae, small enough to fit into a microtiter well, but developed enough to have full organ functionality, represents a convenient alternative for studies that aim to establish effects of environmental agents on the intact, living organism. Studies by our group and others have characterized absorption and tissue distribution of copper and have described the acute effects of the metal on larvae in terms of survival, organ stress, and functionality of sensory organs. A large body of work has shown that there is strong conservation in mechanisms and genes between fish and mammals, opening the possibility for genetic or small molecule screens or for generating fish models of human diseases related to copper metabolism. The variability within humans in terms of tolerance to copper excess or deficiency requires a genetic approach to be taken to understand the behavior of populations, because markers and vulnerabilities need to be identified. The zebrafish could represent a unique tool to move in this direction. 3aDanio rerio 3acopper 3adietary minerals 3amineral metabolism 3anutrition physiology 3agenes 3anutrient deficiencies 3adeficiency diseases 3aanimal disease models 3atoxicity 3anutrient availability 3atissue distribution 0aliterature reviews1 aAllende, Miguel L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition AJN.g2008 Sept., v. 88, no. 3 p.835S-839SdAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle03148naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012700165300001800292520190700310650001102217650001102228650000802239650001102247650001002258650002402268650000902292650001902301650001102320650001102331650002402342650001402366650002002380700001802400700001802418700002002436700001802456700001402474700001602488773015502504856004602659852000902705655001202714IND60557132120221120121907.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713212DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.11.12202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheon, Byunggyu10aComparison of contrast media for visualization of the colon of healthy dogs during computed tomography and ultrasonography  ap. 1220-1226.  aOBJECTIVE To evaluate contrast agents for their ability to improve visualization of the colon wall and lumen during CT and ultrasonography. ANIMALS 10 healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURES Food was withheld from dogs for 36 hours, after which dogs consumed 250 mL of polyethylene glycol solution. Dogs were then anesthetized, a contrast agent (tap water, diluted barium, or air; order randomly assigned) was administered rectally, iodine contrast medium (880 mg of I/kg) was administered IV, and CT and ultrasonography of the colon were performed. After a 1-week washout period, this process was repeated with a different contrast agent until all agents had been evaluated. Two investigators reviewed the CT and ultrasonographic images for colon wall thickness, conspicuity, artifacts, wall layering, and degree of lumen dilation at 4 sites. RESULTS Thickness of the colon wall was greatest in CT and ultrasonographic images with water used as contrast agent, followed by barium and then air. The CT images obtained after water administration had a smooth appearance that outlined the colonic mucosa and had the highest score of the 3 contrast agents for wall conspicuity. Although no substantial artifacts related to any of the contrast agents were identified on CT images, barium- and gas-induced shadowing and reverberation artifacts hindered wall evaluation during ultrasonography. For ultrasonography, the degree of conspicuity was highest with barium in the near-field wall and with water in the far-field wall. In contrast to CT, ultrasonography could be used to distinguish wall layering, and the mucosal and muscular layers were distinct with all contrast agents. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of water as a contrast agent for both CT and ultrasonography of the colon in dogs compensated for each imaging modality's disadvantages and could be beneficial in the diagnosis of colon disease. 3aBeagle 3aadults 3aair 3abarium 3acolon 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3aimage analysis 3aiodine 3amucosa 3apolyethylene glycol 3atap water 3aultrasonography1 aMoon, Sohyeon1 aPark, Seungjo1 aYi, Sang-gwŏn,1 aHong, Sunghwa1 aCho, Hyun1 aChoi, Jihye0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1220-1226dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.11.1220  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245014000168300001800308520167700326650001102003650001702014650001902031650000902050650001102059650002702070650001302097650001102110650001402121700001902135700001702154700001702171700001902188700001902207700001802226700001802244773015502262856004602417852000902463655001202472IND60557131520221120113039.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713152DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.11.11942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakozaki, Takaharu10aBiomechanical assessment of the effects of vertebral distraction-fusion techniques on the adjacent segment of canine cervical vertebrae  ap. 1194-1199.  aOBJECTIVE To assess effects of vertebral distraction-fusion techniques at a treated segment (C5-C6) and an adjacent segment (C4-C5) of canine cervical vertebrae. SAMPLE Cervical vertebrae harvested from cadavers of 10 skeletally mature Beagles. PROCEDURES Three models (intact, titanium plate, and polymethylmethacrylate [PM MA]) for stabilization of the caudal region of the cervical vertebrae (C4 through C7) were applied to the C5-C6 vertebral segment sequentially on the same specimens. Biomechanical assessments with flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotational tests were conducted after each procedure. Range of motion (ROM) for a torque load applied with a 6-axis material tester was measured at C4-5 and C5-6 and calculated by use of a 3-D video measurement system. RESULTS In both the plate and PMMA models, ROM significantly increased at C4-5 and significantly decreased at C5-6, compared with results for the intact model. The ROM at C5-6 was significantly lower for the plate model versus the PMMA model in lateral bending and for the PMMA model versus the plate model in axial rotation. Conversely, ROM at C4-5 was significantly higher in axial rotation for the PMMA model versus the plate model. No significant differences were identified in flexion-extension between the PMMA and plate models at either site. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results of this study suggested that vertebral distraction and fusion of canine vertebrae can change the mechanical environment at, and may cause disorders in, the adjacent segment. Additionally, findings suggested that effects on the adjacent segment differed on the basis of the fusion method used. 3aBeagle 3abiomechanics 3acervical spine 3adogs 3amodels 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atitanium 3atorque 3avertebrae1 aIchinohe, Tomu1 aKanno, Nobuo1 aYogo, Takuya1 aHarada, Yasuji1 aInaba, Tadashi1 aKasai, Yuichi1 aHara, Yasushi0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1194-1199dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.11.1194  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002800168245009800196300001800294500002400312500001500336520142800351650002401779650001701803650001901820650001601839650002201855650002201877650002001899650001301919650002001932653001701952653002501969653002101994653003502015700002102050700002102071700001602092700002002108773009602128852000902224856009002233930003302323945002502356946001102381655001202392IND4434572720221120113048.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aQ5001 aLakshman, P.L.

However, only a little attention has been paid to the proteinases produced by this fungus and their role in the fermentation process. The main objective of this study was to purify and characterise acid proteinases produced by Monascus pilosus. Two acid proteinases (MpiAP1 and MpiAP2) were purified to homogeneity. Both purified enzymes, MpiAP1 and MpiAP2, were monomeric structures with molecular masses of around 43 and 58kDa, respectively. The former was an acidic non-glycoprotein, whereas the latter was an acidic glycoprotein with 27% carbohydrate content. Although amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of both enzymes (MpiAP1 and MpiAP2) of 20 amino acid length showed over 90% similarity, their amino-terminal amino acids were different from each other. Both enzymes were optimally active at 55°C and at pH 2.5-3.0 against casein or human haemoglobin. The T ₁/₂ values of MpiAP1 and MpiAP2 were 65 and 70°C, respectively. Both of the enzymes were completely inhibited by pepstatin A, and markedly by SDS. MoO₃ also showed a partial inhibition of both enzymes. Milk casein and haemoglobin were good substrates for these enzymes. Eleven cleavages were detected using the oxidised insulin B-chain as a peptide for the proteolytic specificity test of MpiAP1, while seven cleavages were detected for MpiAP2. 3aextracellular space 3afermentation 3asalt tolerance 3aproteinases 3achemical analysis 3aenzyme substrates 3aprotein content 3aMonascus 3aenzyme activity 0apurification 0achemical composition 0aMonascus pilosus 0aextracellular acid proteinases1 aToyokawa, Yoichi1 aToyama, Hirohide1 aTaira, Toki1 aYasuda, Masaaki0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.1216-1224dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.02.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02838naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002300146245006000169300001800229500014800247520129000395650001101685650002101696650002401717650002501741650002401766650002101790650002101811650001301832650001301845650001701858650001901875650002701894650002001921650002101941650001301962650002401975650000901999650001002008650002102018650001102039650002602050650002102076653002302097653001902120773007702139852000902216930003302225945002502258946001302283655001202296IND4370715020221120113128.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437071502DNAL7 a158673072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJeffery, Elizabeth10aComponent Interactions for Efficacy of Functional Foods  ap. 1223-1225.  aPaper presented at the symposium on "Relative bioactivity of functional foods and related dietary supplements", April 17, 2004, Washington, DC.  aThe study of functional foods appears to hold the promise of improved quality of life, particularly for older persons who fight chronic disease. Many laboratories are studying the mechanisms of action of individual bioactive food components; but, relatively few studies are concerned with the interaction of the many components found in a single food or with a comparison between effects of the putative major bioactive component and the whole food. This overview is an introduction to the papers that follow, which were given as a symposium at the 2004 Experimental Biology meetings and which address the interactive effects of bioactive food components, particularly those in soy, broccoli, berries, and tomatoes. However, conclusions to be drawn go further than these 4 foods. The studies act as examples, identifying needed areas of focus in the study of functional foods and specifically the need for research into functional foods to encompass 3 areas of study: strength in chemical analysis, mechanistic studies carried out in cell culture, and animal studies comparing effects of dietary exposure to purified components and whole foods. Together, data from these 3 areas can give the solid scientific basis needed, so that clinical studies can be properly planned and executed. 3ahumans 3afunctional foods 3adietary supplements 3abioactive properties 3amechanism of action 3afood composition 3asoybean products 3abroccoli 3atomatoes 3asmall fruits 3acultured cells 3aanimal experimentation 3achemoprevention 3achronic diseases 2aBrassica 2aDietary Supplements 2aFood 2aFruit 2aHealth Education 2aHumans 2aSolanum lycopersicum. 2aSoybean Proteins 0aliterature reviews 0aresearch needs0 tJournal of nutrition.g2005 , v. 135, no. 5 p.1223-1225x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060203b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle02736naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009600165300001400261500002400275520161000299650001201909650001601921650001401937650001601951650001201967650001201979650001201991650002302003650002002026650001002046650001602056650001902072650001102091650001302102650001302115651001902128700001502147773009502162852000902257856004802266655001202314IND4431708520221120112718.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443170852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0032-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobbie, Erik A.10aNitrogen isotopes in ectomycorrhizal sporocarps correspond to belowground exploration types  ap. 71-83.  aIncludes references  aNitrogen isotope values (δ¹⁵N) are higher in ectomycorrhizal fungi than in their plant hosts but the wide variability in δ¹⁵N among sporocarps of different fungal taxa is unexplained. We propose that fungal δ¹⁵N reflects sequestration of fungal nitrogen to build fungal biomass, and should accordingly reflect fungal exploration strategies and hyphal properties. To test this, we compared δ¹⁵N to exploration types, hyphal hydrophobicity, and the presence of rhizomorphs in ectomycorrhizal species from surveys at four sites in temperate and boreal coniferous forests. Fungi with exploration types of high biomass, such as long-distance (e.g., Suillus), medium-distance mat (e.g., Hydnellum), and medium-distance fringe (e.g., Cortinarius) were 4-7‰ more enriched in ¹⁵N than fungi with exploration types of low biomass [medium-distance smooth (e.g., Amanita), short-distance (e.g., Inocybe), and contact (e.g., Hygrophorus)]. High biomass types comprised 79% (Åheden, northern Sweden), 65% (Deer Park, Pacific Northwest, USA), 45% (Stadsskogen, central Sweden), and 39% (Hoh, Pacific Northwest, USA) of ectomycorrhizal species, with these types more prevalent at sites of lower nitrogen availability. Species with hydrophobic hyphae or with rhizomorphs were 3-4‰ more enriched in ¹⁵N than taxa with hydrophilic hyphae or without rhizomorphs. The consistency of these patterns suggest that δ¹⁵N measurements could provide insights into belowground functioning of poorly known taxa of ectomycorrhizal fungi and into relative fungal biomass across ectomycorrhizal communities. 3aAmanita 3aCortinarius 3aHydnellum 3aHygrophorus 3aInocybe 3aSuillus 3abiomass 3aconiferous forests 3aectomycorrhizae 3afungi 3ahost plants 3ahydrophobicity 3ahyphae 3aisotopes 3anitrogen 3aPacific States1 aAgerer, R.0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Feb., v. 327, no. 1-2 p.71-83dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0032-z 7aarticle02386naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008000130300001600210520105800226650001501284650001801299650002101317650003501338650002101373650001601394650001601410650005201426650001501478650001001493650002901503650001301532700001601545700001601561700001501577700002201592700001101614700001701625700001501642773021101657856008701868852000901955655001201964IND60557130320161205000000.0161102e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuang10aIdentification and characterization of pig adipose-derived progenitor cells  ap. 309-317.  aAdipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent, and can be differentiated into many cell types in vitro. In this study, tissues from pigs were chosen to identify and characterize ADSCs. Primary ADSCs were sub-cultured to passage 28. The surface markers of ADSCs: CD29, CD71, CD73, CD90, and CD166 were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays and the markers CD29, CD44, CD105, and vimentin were detected by immunofluorescence. Growth curves and the capacity of clone-forming were performed to test the proliferation of ADSCs. Karyotype analysis showed that ADSCs cultured in vitro were genetically stable. To assess the differentiation capacity of the ADSCs, cells were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, epithelial cells, neural cells, and hepatocyte-like cells. The results suggest that ADSCs from pigs showed similar biological characteristics with those separated from other species, and their multi-lineage differentiation shows potential as an application for cellular therapy in an animal model. 3aadipocytes 3aanimal models 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ain vitro culture 3akaryotyping 3aosteoblasts 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3avimentin1 aBai, Chunyu1 aZheng, Dong1 aGao, Yuhua1 aFan, Y.q(Yanan),1 aLi, Lu1 aGuan, Weijun1 aMa, Yuehui0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2016 Oct., v. 80, no. 4 p.309-317dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/cvma/cjvr/2016/00000080/00000004/art00008  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002300180245012200203300001800325500001500343520166700358650001202025650002002037650001502057650002102072650002002093650003002113650002002143650001002163650001402173650002002187650002002207650001502227650001802242650000802260650001202268650002002280650001802300650001602318650002802334650002502362650001002387650000902397650001402406650001002420650005402430650000902484650001102493650001002504650004402514650001102558650005702569650000902626650001602635650000902651650001502660651001602675651001602691653000902707700002502716700002102741700003002762700002502792700001902817773007702836852000902913930003302922945002502955946001302980655001202993IND4370714720221120082453.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437071472DNAL7 a158673042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Initially, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered to be enterolignan precursors, but recently, new precursors such as lariciresinol and pinoresinol were identified. We recently developed a lignan database including 4 major enterolignan precursors. We used this database to estimate lignan intake in a representative sample of Dutch men and women participating in the Dutch Food Consumption Survey, carried out in 1997-1998. Median total lignan intake among 4660 adults (19-97 y old) was 979 [micro]g/d. Total lignan intake did not differ between men and women; thus, the lignan density of the diet was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in women than in men. Lignan intake was strongly skewed toward higher values (range 43-77584 [micro]g/d, mean 1241 [micro]g/d). Lariciresinol and pinoresinol contributed 75% to lignan intake, whereas secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol contributed only 25%. The major food sources of lignans were beverages (37%), vegetables (24%), nuts and seeds (14%), bread (9%), and fruits (7%). Lignan intake was significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with intake of dietary fiber (r = 0.46), folate (r = 0.39), and vitamin C (r = 0.44). Older persons, nonsmokers, vegetarians, and persons with a low BMI or a high socioeconomic status had higher lignan intakes than their counterparts. In brief, this study shows that the amount of enterolignan precursors in the diet has previously been largely underestimated. 3aelderly 3achemoprevention 3afolic acid 3afood composition 3aplant estrogens 3aintestinal microorganisms 3avegetarian diet 3awomen 3aneoplasms 3asmoking (habit) 3adietary surveys 3ametabolism 3adietary fiber 3amen 3alignans 3abody mass index 3aascorbic acid 3afood intake 3acardiovascular diseases 3asocioeconomic status 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBeverages 2aBread 2aButylene Glycolsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aFuransxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aLignansxmetabolismxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNuts 2aVegetables 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0adiet1 aFeskens, Edith J.

The experimental plots were established with sprinkler irrigation. During the following three irrigation seasons, plots were irrigated when the average soil water content in the upper 30 cm of soil decreased below 20% by volume, which corresponded to a management-allowed depletion value of 50%. The amount of irrigation water, the visual appearance of the turf, shoot biomass production, soil salinity, and health risks due to reclaimed water reuse were examined. Management problems such as emitter clogging were identified. No emitters were completely clogged, and emitter clogging was not serious enough to impact visual quality. Statistical uniformity of emitters was reduced from 91.8% (for new emitters) to 85.3% after the first year and 86.2% after the third year, while flow rates remained at 3.75, 3.78, and 3.89 L/h, respectively. The amount of water applied in the subsurface drip irrigated plots to maintain acceptable visual quality was similar to that applied in the sprinkler irrigated plots. Increases in the electrical conductivity of the soil surface of the subsurface drip irrigated plots were noted after the first and second seasons. However, these increases were not high enough to negatively affect turf appearance. Inspection of the emitters at the end of the irrigation seasons found signs of root intrusion into the emitters, which may pose a threat to the long-term use of subsurface drip irrigation. 3awater reuse 3aelectrical conductivity 3awastewater irrigation 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3ahybrids 3aemitters (equipment) 3aCynodon dactylon 3asubsurface irrigation 3alawns and turf 3amicroirrigation 3asprinkler irrigation 3asoil salinity 3aroot growth 3awastewater 3aArizona 0aplant growth 0aemitter clogging1 aSuarez-Rey, E.M.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v. 47, no. 6 p.1943-1951x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02395naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178072001700195100001800212245010100230300001800331520108000349650001901429650002101448650002101469650002701490650002501517650002101542650001701563650001501580650001701595650002401612650001601636650002801652650002101680650002001701651001201721700002001733773008001753852000901833930003301842945002501875946001301900655001201913IND4367240720221123042425.0050222e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436724072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOverman, A.R.10aExtended logistic model of forage grass response to applied nitrogen as affected by soil erosion  ap. 1375-1380.  aMathematical models can be used to evaluate crop response to management factors such as applied nutrients, water availability, and tillage. The extended logistic model has proven particularly useful for this purpose. In this article, we use this model to link annual dry matter yield and plant nitrogen uptake to applied nitrogen for bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.) as affected by past soil erosion. The model describes response curves and phase relationships rather well for Pensacola and Tifton 9 bahiagrasses and Tifton 44 bermudagrass. Analysis showed that 60 kg N ha(-1) is required to raise dry matter production of the severely eroded soil up to that of the non-eroded soil, while 70 kg N ha(-1) is required to make plant N uptake equivalent for the two cases. Soil erosion has the effect of reducing N availability. We conclude that the ratio of minimum to maximum plant N concentration is the same for the three grasses and two soil conditions. The model accounts for the effect of soil erosion on forage production. 3aforage grasses 3aCynodon dactylon 3aPaspalum notatum 3afertilizer application 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aapplication rate 3aplant growth 3acrop yield 3aeroded soils 3amathematical models 3acrop models 3adry matter accumulation 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3aGeorgia1 aWilkinson, S.R.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2003 , v. 46, no. 5 p.1375-1380x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02299naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245009800172300001600270500002400286520137200310650001801682650001001700650003001710650001501740650002201755650001201777651001801789651001401807773010701821852000901928856004801937655001201985IND4413732720221123042422.0081212e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441373272DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738080800712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoroti︠a︡ev, B.

The potential of exploiting landscapes of all natural zones of the Holarctic by a low-rank taxon is exemplified by the Holarctic Ceutorhynchus cochleariae (Gyll.) species-group comprising ca. 20 species evenly distributed between the Palaearctic and Nearctic. Although neighboring with the powerful centers of tropical biota, the Holarctic fauna of the subfamily Ceutorhynchinae is formed mostly of endemic and subendemic genera which are especially abundant in the Palaearctic. This region possesses the most diversified generic and species composition of the fauna consisting of predominantly endemic and subendemic genera (in the Mediterranean and Saharo-Gobian regions, also of the highly diversified tribe Oxyonychini) up to its southern border. The existence of characteristic transitional faunas in the zones of contact of the Holarctic fauna with the faunas of the tropical regions in East Asia and Mexico is shown. These transitional faunas include a considerable number of endemic taxa of the genus and species groups. A conspicuous feature of the Palaearctic ceutorhynchine fauna is the rather numerous complex of the upland and high-latitude species. 3aCeutorhynchus 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3aArctic region 3aEast Asia0 tEntomological revue.g2008 Nov., v. 88, no. 8 p.928-947dSP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax0013-87387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0013873808080071 7aarticle02299naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245008900162300001800251520144000269650002501709650001801734650001001752650002601762650002001788700001701808773008001825852000901905930003301914945002501947946001301972655001201985IND4367237520221123032502.0050222e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436723752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCrofcheck, C.10aEvaluation of foam fractionation column scale-up for recovering bovine serum albumin  ap. 1759-1764.  aFoam fractionation is an adsorptive-bubble separation method that, according to researchers, is a feasible technique for the separation and/or concentration of proteins. The foam fractionation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in laboratory-scale foam fractionation columns (750 and 1250 mL) and the relationship between the two laboratory-scale columns and a pilot-scale column (5000 mL) were investigated. Recovery, enrichment, and performance factor values were experimentally determined with three different column volumes with varying pore sizes, gas superficial velocities, and, in the case of the 750 mL column, foam column height. As the pore size decreased, the amount of protein recovered from the dilute protein solution increased and the enrichment decreased. As the flow rate of the gas increased, the effect of the pore size decreased. For the three column volumes, the optimal column conditions were achieved with the largest pore size (145-174 micrometer) and an intermediate superficial gas velocity (7 mm/s). Increasing the foam column height increased the enrichment without sacrificing the recovery of the target protein. In the case of the largest pore size, the linear relationships between the recovery and the ratio of gas volume to initial liquid volume are parallel, such that the recovery in a pilot-scale column (5000 mL) can be predicted with the recovery found with a laboratory-scale column (750 or 1250 mL). 3abovine serum albumin 3afractionation 3afoams 3aprocessing technology 3afood processing1 aGillette, K.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2003 , v. 46, no. 6 p.1759-1764x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02800naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012800144300001600272500001500288520097600303650002501279650002701304650002201331650001101353650002201364650002101386650002401407650002501431650002801456650001201484650002101496650002401517650003901541650001801580650002901598650002301627650003301650650003101683650003301714650002101747650002901768650002801797650003801825650002701863650003401890653001201924653001901936653002801955653002501983700001702008700001402025773008102039852000902120930003302129945001302162946001102175655001202186IND2051385120221123021051.0960523e199511  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205138512DNAL7 a85415132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavanel, S.10aCloning of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding cystathionine beta-lyase by functional complementation in Escherichia coli  ap. 875-882.  a2019-12-05  aCystathionine beta-lyase, the second enzyme involved in the methionine biosynthetic pathway in plants, catalyses the synthesis of homocysteine from cystathionine. A cDNA encoding cystathionine beta-lyase was cloned from an Arabidopsis thaliana expression library by complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in this enzyme. As deduced from the full-length nucleotide sequence (1.7 kb). the polypeptide contains 464 amino acids and presents a predicted Mr of 50372. A. thaliana cystathionine beta-lyase exhibits 22% sequence identity with the E. coli corresponding enzyme and contains a 70 amino acid N-terminal additional sequence compared with the bacterial protein. Since the general features of chloroplast transit peptides could be observed in this amino-terminal extension, we propose a chloroplast localization for the cDNA-encoded enzyme. Southern blot analysis suggested that cystathionine beta-lyase is encoded by a single copy gene in A. thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3aSouthern blotting 3alyases 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLyasesxgenetics 2aMethioninexbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acloning 0agenbank/l40511 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aRuffet, M.L.1 aDouce, R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1995 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.875-882x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010000165300001800265520146800283650001101751650001101762650001501773650003601788650002001824650000901844650001601853650003101869650002401900650002601924650001301950700001901963700002801982700002302010700002302033773015502056856004602211852000902257655001202266IND60557132220221123005459.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713222DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.11.12272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, Antje10aQuantitative analysis of brain perfusion in healthy dogs by means of magnetic resonance imaging  ap. 1227-1235.  aOBJECTIVE To determine values of perfusion parameters determined via MRI in the brains of healthy dogs. ANIMALS 10 healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURES Each dog was anesthetized for MRI examination of the brain, including standard sequences and a perfusion-weighted sequence. Gadoteric acid (0.2 mmol/kg) was injected IV at a rate of 5 mL/s. A dedicated workstation was used to measure the times from contrast medium injection to arrival at an ROI (TO) and peak contrast enhancement (TTP), mean contrast medium transport time (MTT), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, piriform lobe, hippocampus, semioval center, and temporal cerebral cortex. A simple mathematical model was used to compare parameter values among the various brain regions. RESULTS T0 and time to peak contrast enhancement had a significant linear relationship. A significant negative correlation was identified between T0 and CBF and, to a lesser extent, between MTT and CBF. Differences among brain regions were significant for MTT and CBF. The CBF was lowest in the semioval center, and the piriform lobe had almost 2-fold the CBF of that region. No significant differences were identified between hemispheres of the brain. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings obtained in this study involving healthy dogs may serve as a reference for MRI perfusion measurements in specific brain regions and may help in the characterization of various brain diseases in dogs. 3aBeagle 3aadults 3ablood flow 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acerebral cortex 3adogs 3ahippocampus 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amathematical models 3aquantitative analysis 3athalamus1 aDriesen, Agnes1 aLautenschlager, Ines E.1 aScholz, Volkher B.1 aSchmidt, Martin J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2016 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1227-1235dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.11.1227  aDNAL 7aarticle04184naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002300183245018200206300001600388500002400404500001500428506007600443520140600519506003701925650002201962650001301984650001901997650001302016650002502029650001802054650001102072650002502083650002202108650003802130650002602168650001802194650001002212650001902222650001202241650002402253650001602277650001202293650003102305650002202336650002302358650003702381650005802418650002902476650002302505650001902528650001402547650004202561650003202603650002402635650006602659650002902725650002502754650005102779653002802830700002402858700001802882700001902900700002102919700001702940700001602957700002002973700003102993700002003024700002203044700002003066700002303086700002403109773010603133852000903239856008203248655001203330IND4451328820221207091501.0110325e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445132882DNAL7 a213072862pmid7 aPMC30777942pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.110.0812242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Wagner L.10aAntisense Inhibition of the Iron-Sulphur Subunit of Succinate Dehydrogenase Enhances Photosynthesis and Growth in Tomato via an Organic Acid-Mediated Effect on Stomatal Aperture  ap. 600-627.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants expressing a fragment of the Sl SDH2-2 gene encoding the iron sulfur subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase protein complex in the antisense orientation under the control of the 35S promoter exhibit an enhanced rate of photosynthesis. The rate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was reduced in these transformants, and there were changes in the levels of metabolites associated with the TCA cycle. Furthermore, in comparison to wild-type plants, carbon dioxide assimilation was enhanced by up to 25% in the transgenic plants under ambient conditions, and mature plants were characterized by an increased biomass. Analysis of additional photosynthetic parameters revealed that the rate of transpiration and stomatal conductance were markedly elevated in the transgenic plants. The transformants displayed a strongly enhanced assimilation rate under both ambient and suboptimal environmental conditions, as well as an elevated maximal stomatal aperture. By contrast, when the Sl SDH2-2 gene was repressed by antisense RNA in a guard cell-specific manner, changes in neither stomatal aperture nor photosynthesis were observed. The data obtained are discussed in the context of the role of TCA cycle intermediates both generally with respect to photosynthetic metabolism and specifically with respect to their role in the regulation of stomatal aperture.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astomatal movement 3atomatoes 3acarbon dioxide 3aproteins 3astomatal conductance 3aantisense RNA 3asulfur 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3atransgenic plants 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aenvironmental factors 3amature plants 3agenes 3aphotosynthesis 3abiomass 3atricarboxylic acids 3ametabolites 2aBiomass 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCitric Acid Cycle 2aCloning, Molecular 2aIron-Sulfur Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stomataxdrug effects 2aPlant Transpiration 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Antisensexgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSuccinate Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0asuccinate dehydrogenase1 aNunes-Nesi, Adriano1 aOsorio, Sonia1 aUsadel, Björn1 aFuentes, Daniela1 aNagy, Réka.1 aBalbo, Ilse1 aLehmann, Martin1 aStudart-Witkowski, Claudia1 aTohge, Takayuki1 aMartinoia, Enrico1 aJordana, Xavier1 aDaMatta, Fábio M.1 aFernie, Alisdair R.0 tplant cell.g2011 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.600-627dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.0812243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02791naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009300144300001600237520102100253650001601274650002201290650001801312650001901330650001001349650002501359650002501384650002001409650001801429650002001447650001101467650002401478650001801502650002301520650003301543650003801576650002801614650002901642650003301671650002901704650002501733650003301758650002701791650002301818653004101841653001701882653002801899653001901927653001901946700001301965700001301978700001401991700001302005773008102018852000902099930003302108945001302141946001102154655001202165IND2051384820221122232915.0960523e199511  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205138482DNAL7 a85415112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsing, Y.C.10aUnusual sequences of group 3 LEA mRNA inducible by maturation or drying in soybean seeds  ap. 863-868.  aTwo cDNA clones, pGmPM8 and pGmPM10, which correspond to two mRNA species in mature or dry soybean seeds, were characterized. The deduced proteins, based on DNA sequence analysis, have a molecular mass of 49 and 51 kDa for pGmPM8 and pGmPM 10, respectively. These two cDNA clones share a high homology with an amino acid identity of about 90% between the two deduced proteins. Both proteins appear to be extremely hydrophilic except at their N-termini that contain a 29 amino acid hydrophobic region at the N-terminus and the sizes of proteins decrease after co-incubating with ER membranes. These two proteins contain more than 30 similar, contiguous repeats of 11 amino acids, which is characteristic of group 3 LEA proteins. The mRNAs corresponding to pGmPM8 and pGmPM10 were expressed at high levels in dried or mature soybean seeds, but not in fresh immature seeds. The RNAs were also present in abscisic acid (ABA) treated leaves or cultured cells, and in tissues subjected to water stress or low temperatures. 3aGlycine max 3acomplementary DNA 3amessenger RNA 3aplant proteins 3aseeds 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aseed maturation 3aabscisic acid 3asodium chloride 3adrying 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSeedsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoybeansxgenetics 0alate embryogenesis abundant proteins 0alea proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z22872 0agenbank/u029661 aChen, Z.1 aShih, M.1 aHsieh, J.1 aChow, T.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1995 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.863-868x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245006300162300001800225500001500243520145700258650002101715650002201736650001101758650001301769650002101782650001501803653001201818653002601830653001501856653001501871653001701886700001601903700001801919773008001937852000902017930003302026945002502059946001302084655001202097IND4365704720221122223132.0041119e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436570472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPersson, D.A.10aEvaluation of an optical sensor for tuber yield monitoring  ap. 1851-1856.  a2019-12-05  aA sensor for monitoring the yield of tubers was tested in the laboratory and in the field. The laboratory test was designed to investigate whether the sensor varied in its measurements of tuber size, whether the recorded size differed within the width of the sensor, and whether tilting of the sensor affected the result. The test objects were spheres, and measurements were carried out on three different sizes. A statistical analysis showed how the sensor measured the sizes for the different combinations of size, position, and inclination. In the field, a harvester-mounted sensor was used to monitor yield of Bintje potatoes in terms of tuber size and weight. The results obtained were compared with those from mechanical load-cell measurements. An expression relating tuber size to weight was determined. Plot-harvesting tubers provided data for evaluation of tuber size in relation to yield. The results showed that the errors in size determination by the sensor were in the order of 1% to 2%. Different size classes were well differentiated. Some differences were noted for object position and sensor inclination. Field tests showed that the mean deviation from measured weight was about 1%. It was concluded that sensor errors were small and that the sensor could discriminate between different sizes for the spheres used in the study. In the field, the sensor worked with good consistency and is a potential option for tuber yield monitoring. 3ayield monitoring 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3apotatoes 3ayield components 3adimensions 0asensors 0aprecision agriculture 0acrop yield 0atuber size 0atuber weight1 aEklundh, L.1 aAlgerbo, P.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v. 47, no. 5 p.1851-1856x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/17  aOther US 7aarticle03156naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002400168245015000192300001800342500002400360520150700384650001801891650002101909650003101930650001501961650001001976650002501986650002302011650001102034650001002045650002002055650002702075650002302102650002302125650002602148651001002174653002802184700002702212700002502239700003302264700003902297700002602336773009602362852000902458856009002467930003302557945002502590946001102615655001202626IND4434574020221122223210.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aQ5051 aAbrodo, Pilar Arias10aCharacterisation of Asturian cider apples on the basis of their aromatic profile by high-speed gas chromatography and solid-phase microextraction  ap. 1312-1318.  aIncludes references  aHeadspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to high-speed gas chromatography with FID detector (HSGC-FID) and with quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS) was employed to study the volatile compounds in Asturian cider apples. The optimised conditions used for characterisation of cider apple were: sample equilibration at 25°C for 12h, followed by PDMS-DVB fibre exposure to the headspace above the sample for 5min and finally thermal desorption of the adsorbed substances in the injector port for GC analysis. The use of high-speed gas chromatography allowed the separation of 27 compounds in less than 8min, reducing the analysis time in 80% compared to conventional gas chromatography. A simple, rapid and reliable method to analyze volatile compounds in cider apples has been developed. The aromatic profile of 59 apple samples included in eight apple varieties was analysed. The different apples were obtained from two consecutive harvests (2005 and 2006). The apples volatile compounds together with chemometric techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA), Bayesian analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), allowed us to differentiate apples on the basis of the sweet or sharp category to which the cider apple variety belongs. Volatile compounds such as ethyl heptanoate, E-farnesene, ethyl butyrate and hexyl caprylate are closely related to cider apple cultivars of the sweet category, while propyl butyrate and butyl acetate are related to the sharp class. 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3acountry of origin labeling 3aprovenance 3afraud 3aproduct authenticity 3afood contamination 3aciders 3aodors 3amicroextraction 3asolid phase extraction 3agas chromatography 3avolatile compounds 3aequipment performance 3aSpain 0aSidra de Asturias cider1 aLlorente, Daniel Díaz1 aCorujedo, Sara Junco1 ade la Fuente, Enrique Dapena1 aÁlvarez, Maria Dolores Gutiérrez1 aGomis, Domingo Blanco0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.1312-1318dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0683Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01982naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008100143300001600224520068700240650001900927650002100946650001200967650001700979650001700996650002001013650001801033650001401051650002201065650003101087650003301118650005001151650002701201650002201228650002901250650002501279653001101304653001601315700001501331700001901346773008101365852000901446930003301455945001301488946001101501655001201512IND2056497920221122194750.0970414e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205649792DNAL7 a89805082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoss, P.K.10aExpression of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes in red and white grapes  ap. 565-569.  aThe expression of seven genes from the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was determined in different tissues of Shiraz grapevines.

In most tissues, all of the flavonoid genes except UDP glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase (UFGT) were expressed, but UFGT expression was only detected in berry skin. Similar patterns of expression were observed in the skin of other red grapes. In white grapes, UFGT expression was not detected. White grape cultivars appear to lack anthocyanins because they lack UFGT, although they also had decreased expression of other flavonoid pathway genes. 3aVitis vinifera 3astructural genes 3aenzymes 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acultivars 3aproanthocyanidins 2aAnthocyaninsxbiosynthesis 2aFruitxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aProanthocyanidins 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 0afruits 0afruit skins1 aDavies, C.1 aRobinson, S.P.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 3 p.565-569x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03529naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245027200145300001600417520153800433650002201971650002201993650004502015650001702060650002502077650002502102650001802127650002002145650002102165650002002186650002402206650001802230650002902248650003302277650002502310650003302335650009402368650002802462650002102490650002502511650005802536650004502594653001702639653002502656653002802681653001902709653001902728700001602747700001402763700001502777773008102792852000902873930003302882945001302915946001102928655001202939IND2056494720221122163721.0970414e199611  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205649472DNAL7 a89804992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaalmann, E.10aFunctional studies of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase subunits A and B expressed in Escherichia coli: formation of highly active A4 and B4 homotetramers and evidence that aggregation of the B4 complex is mediated by the B subunit carboxy terminus  ap. 505-513.  aChloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating, E.C. 1.2.1.13) (GAPDH) of higher plants exists as an A2B2 heterotetramer that catalyses the reductive step of the Calvin cycle. In dark chloroplasts the enzyme exhibits a molecular mass of 600 kDa, whereas in illuminated chloroplasts the molecular mass is altered in favor of the more active 150 kDa form. We have expressed in Escherichia coli proteins corresponding to the mature A and B subunits of spinach chloroplast GAPDH (GapA and GapB, respectively) in addition to a derivative of the B subunit lacking the GapB-specific C-terminal extension (CTE). One mg of each of the three proteins so expressed was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity with conventional methods. Spinach GapA purified from E. coli is shown to be a highly active homotetramer (50-70 U/mg) which does not associate under aggregating conditions in vitro to high-molecular-mass (HMM) forms of ca. 600 kDa. Since B4 forms of the enzyme have not been described from any source, we were surprised to find that spinach GapB purified from E. coli was active (15-35 U/mg). Spinach GapB lacking the CTE purified from E. coli is more highly active (130 U/mg) than GapB with the CTE. Under aggregating conditions. GapB lacking the CTE is a tetramer that does not associate to HMM forms whereas GapB with the CTE occurs exclusively as an aggregated HMM form. The data indicate that intertetramer association of chloroplast GAPDH in vitro occurs through GapB-mediated protein-protein interaction. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3acomplementary DNA 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3achloroplasts 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aGlyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Conformation 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxisolation & purification 2aSpinacia oleraceaxenzymologyxgenetics. 0ainteractions 0asubunit interactions 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l76552 0agenbank/l765531 aScheibe, R.1 aCerff, R.1 aMartin, W.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1996 Nov., v. 32, no. 3 p.505-513x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02829naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245009900161300001800260520174800278650001402026650001102040650001502051650001602066650001102082650001402093650001702107650001302124650001202137700002602149700002702175700002302202700003202225773015502257856004602412852000902458655001202467IND60557131420221122133028.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713142DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.77.11.11872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRe, Michela10aComparison of paravertebral blockade techniques with and without ultrasound guidance in calves  ap. 1187-1193.  aOBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of an ultrasound-guided paravertebral nerve blockade technique (UGPNB) with distal and proximal paravertebral nerve blockade techniques without ultrasound guidance (DPNB and PPNB, respectively) in calves. ANIMALS 4 calf cadavers and 7 healthy calves. PROCEDURES A suitable acoustic window was identified to facilitate access to the T13, L1, and L2 spinal nerves in cadavers and live calves. In cadavers, nerves were injected with dye under ultrasound guidance. In calves, the UGPNB, DPNB, and PPNB were performed in random order at 10-day intervals by injection of an anesthetic solution containing 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Nociceptive withdrawal responses were assessed to determine the effects of the blockades. RESULTS In cadavers, nerve staining success rates (ie, ≥ 2-cm-long dye path) achieved with ultrasound guidance were 88% (T13 [ventral branch]), 75% (T13 and L1 [dorsal branches] and L1 and L2 [ventral branches]), and 38% (L2 [dorsal branch]). The nerves were each identified as a hyperechoic band in a longitudinal plane. In calves, the UGPNB, DPNB, and PPNB reduced the withdrawal response to the noxious stimulus, mainly in the dorsal-cranial, dorsal-caudal, and ventral-cranial areas of the flank. Overall, the UGPNB resulted in a better nociceptive cumulative score, administering only one half of the local anaesthetic dose, compared with findings for the DPNB and PPNB. However, time to perform the UGPNB was longer. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The UGPNB evaluated may be an improved alternative to the DPNB and PPNB for provision of anesthesia for flank surgery in calves. However, effectiveness of the UGPNB should be evaluated in a clinical setting and in adult cattle. 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3acalves 3alidocaine 3anerve tissue 3astaining 3asurgery1 aBlanco-Murcia, Javier1 aVillaescusa, Alejandra1 aGasper, Ignacio De1 aSegura, Iganico A.

The metabolite profiles of these two cultivars were very similar. Glucose was the predominant sugar at approximately twice the concentration of fructose and sucrose. Total acid concentrations were five times lower than total sugar concentrations in ripe berries, with citrate comprising roughly two thirds of the total acid content. The maximum extractable catalytic activities of key enzymes in the relevant metabolic pathways were also quantified during berry development, in an attempt to elucidate possible correlations. Sucrose synthase activity was very low or undetected, while neutral invertase activity was relatively high, suggesting that sucrose synthase does not make a significant contribution to sink strength in these cultivars. Three enzymes, invertase, pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), showed distinct activity patterns during development and may affect sugar and acid accumulation and sugar composition of strawberries. 3aacidity 3astrawberries 3afood analysis 3asucrose 3afructose-bisphosphatase 3aphosphofructokinases 3afruit quality 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aflavor 3afruit composition 3aenzyme activity 0asugars1 aGroenewald, J-H.1 aKossmann, J.1 aCronjé, C.1 aBauer, R.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.1156-1162dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0643Available from publisher's Web site  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle04057naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245009100193300001600284500002400300520158300324650001601907650000801923650002001931650002501951650001101976650001101987650001601998650001402014650001202028650003102040650002402071650001802095650001002113650001502123650001802138650001202156650001402168650002102182650001302203650002302216650001102239650002202250650002402272650001202296650003902308650004802347650001802395650001602413650004502429650003802474650002802512650002502540650006402565650002802629650001402657650004102671650006002712650003302772650004002805650004202845650002302887650006002910650002702970650002502997700002103022700001903043700001803062700003203080773008203112852000903194856004803203655001203251IND4430709620221122100606.0100101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443070962DNAL7 a199022442pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-1041-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlachowsky, H.q(Henryk)10aOverexpression of LEAFY in apple leads to a columnar phenotype with shorter internodes  ap. 251-263.  aIncludes references  aTo break the juvenile stage of apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) we transferred the LFY gene of Arabidopsis into the genome of the apple cv. ‘Pinova'. A total of five transgenic clones constitutively overexpressing the LFY gene were obtained. Approximately, 20 shoots of each clone were rooted and transferred to the glasshouse. No flowers were obtained on transgenic plants during the first 2 years of cultivation. Evaluation of the expression of possible LFY targets revealed that no transcripts could be detected for MdAP1-1 and MdAP1-2. MdTFL1 was unaffected. Based on the absence of the LFY core-binding sequence within promoter sequences of MdAP1-1 and MdAP1-2, it was concluded that LFY was not able to induce these genes. The LFY genes of apple were unaffected in transgenic plants and sequence alignments of the C-terminal amino acid sequence showed a high conservation of these proteins. A change in binding ability to DNA can therefore be excluded. Instead of early flowering, the transgenic plants showed an altered phenotype, which is similar to the columnar phenotype of the ‘McIntosh Wijcik' mutant of apple. The transgenic plants showed shortened internodes and a significantly reduced length of the regrowing shoot. A negative correlation was observed between the length of the regrowing shoot and the LFY mRNA transcript level. Furthermore, the LFY transgenic apple plants showed an increased shoot diameter at node 20, which was positively correlated with the LFY mRNA transcript level. Based on our results, we assume an alternative role of LFY in apple. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aMalus domestica 3aamino acid sequences 3aapples 3aclones 3acorrelation 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ainternodes 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3asequence alignment 3ashoots 3atransgenic plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aClone Cells 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aMalusxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPlant Stemsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransgenesxgenetics1 aHättasch, Conny1 aHofer, Monika.1 aPeil, Andreas1 aHanke, M.-V.q(Magda-Viola)0 tPlanta.g2010 Jan., v. 231, no. 2 p.251-263dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-1041-0 7aarticle04201naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245014800200300001800348500002400366500001500390506007600405520193300481506003702414650001602451650001202467650001802479650001202497650002502509650002402534650002302558650001502581650001202596650001602608650002102624650001002645650001902655650002102674650001802695650002802713650001702741650000902758650002202767650002402789650003602813650003302849650002802882650004102910650001102951650001102962650000902973650001602982650002302998650002103021653002203042700003003064700001803094700002603112700002403138700002303162700001903185700002803204700002003232773011303252852000903365856008103374655001203455IND4460263220221207093839.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446026322DNAL7 a216286332pmid7 aPMC31386432pmcid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1396342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShea, M.

Evidence suggests circulating uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) is elevated in persons with disease characterized by vascular calcification. The primary purpose of this study was to determine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma ucMGP, vitamin K status, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in older adults without coronary heart disease. Genetic determinants of ucMGP were also explored. Cross-sectional associations among baseline plasma ucMGP, vitamin K status biomarkers [plasma phylloquinone, uncarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II), serum uncarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC)], CAC, and plausible genetic polymorphisms were examined in 438 community-dwelling adults (60-80 y, 59% women). The effect of phylloquinone supplementation (500 μg/d) for 3 y on plasma ucMGP was determined among 374 participants. At baseline, plasma phylloquinone was lower and %ucOC and PIVKA-II were greater across higher plasma ucMGP quartiles (all P < 0.001, age-adjusted). Major allele homozygotes for MGP rs1800801 and rs4236 had higher plasma ucMGP than heterozygotes or minor allele homozygotes. (P [less-than or equal to] 0.004). The decrease in plasma ucMGP was greater in the 190 participants who received phylloquinone (mean ± SD) (-345 ± 251 pmol/L) than in the 184 who did not (-40 ± 196 pmol/L) (P < 0.0001). CAC did not differ according to ucMGP quartile (P = 0.35, age-adjusted). In the phylloquinone-supplemented group, the 3-y change in ucMGP was not associated with the 3-y change in CAC [unstandard β (SE) = -0.02 (0.02); P = 0.44]. Plasma ucMGP was associated with vitamin K status biomarkers and was reduced following phylloquinone supplementation, suggesting it may be a useful marker of vitamin K status in vascular tissue. Plasma ucMGP did not reflect CAC in healthy older adults.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aosteocalcin 3aelderly 3aphylloquinone 3aalleles 3agenetic polymorphism 3amyocardial ischemia 3anutritional status 3abiomarkers 3acalcium 3aprothrombin 3avascular tissues 3awomen 3aheterozygosity 3acoronary vessels 3acalcification 3across-sectional studies 3ahomozygosity 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsxblood 2aCoronary Vesselsxmetabolism 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aVitamin Kxblood 0avascular diseases1 aO'Donnell, Christopher J.1 aVermeer, Cees1 aMagdeleyns, Elke J.P.1 aCrosier, Michael D.1 aGundberg, Caren M.1 aOrdovas, J.

  1 aWang, Y.C.10aAutomatic segmentation of touching rice kernels with an active contour model  ap. 1803-1811.  a2019-12-05  aAn approach was developed to segment touching rice kernels in an image. An inverse gradient vector flow (IGVF) was first proposed to automatically generate a field center for individual rice kernel in an image. These centers were employed as the references for setting initial deformable contours that were required for building an active contour model (ACM). In addition, to describe the formation of the initial deformable contours in detail, a complete image process for the segmentation of touching rice kernels was also developed. The result showed that as long as 50% of piecewise edge information remained in an image, the algorithm could reconstruct the whole contour successfully. Compared with the original contours, the contours generated in this study achieved more than 96% similarity. The complete contours of touching objects by the approach proposed in this study could facilitate the subsequent image processing to obtain the geometric, texture, and color characteristics of objects in an image. These features might then be used for further clustering, classification, or image understanding. 3amathematical models 3arice 3aimage analysis 3aspatial distribution 0amathematics and statistics 0ainverse gradient vector flow1 aChou, J.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v. 47, no. 5 p.1803-1811x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/17  aOther US 7aarticle02628naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002000177245014400197300001800341500002400359500001500383520126300398650001401661650001001675650001801685650001601703650002301719650001601742650002701758650002101785650001201806650002001818650002001838653002801858653002001886773009601906852000902002856009002011930003302101945002502134946001102159655001202170IND4434572120221122071817.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aSłupski, Jacek10aEffect of cooking and sterilisation on the composition of amino acids in immature seeds of flageolet bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars  ap. 1171-1176.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the work was to evaluate the amino acid content and protein quality in products of immature bean seeds with a dry matter content of 40%. The investigation included raw seeds, fresh seeds after cooking to consumption consistency and seeds after canning. Raw seeds of the cultivar Alamo contained more amino acids in 100g fresh matter than the seeds of the cultivars Flaforte and Mona. Cooking and sterilisation brought about decreases in the content of all the amino acids in the investigated cultivars; 1-50% and 9-60% respectively. Higher losses being noted in sterilised seeds. If the results were expressed in 16gN, the differences in amino acid content were much smaller. The amino acid content of Mona was lower than that of the remaining cultivars. The cooking of seeds did not bring about changes in relation to the raw material (except tyrosine which showed a decrease 35-45%); however, sterilisation affected the content of most amino acids (from −45 to +17%). Compared with the standard (), the limiting amino acid was cystine with methionine (amino acid score 70-83). Of the seeds prepared for consumption, sterilised bean seeds had a higher EAA index value, while of the cultivars, the seeds of Alamo had the highest value (147-162). 3acultivars 3aseeds 3afood analysis 3asterilizing 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aamino acids 3aamino acid composition 3afood composition 3acooking 3acooking quality 3aseed maturation 0afood processing quality 0aflageolet beans0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.1171-1176dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02793naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001500159245011200174300001600286500001500302520111200317650002701429650000901456650002101465650002101486650002001507650001001527650002401537650002001561650003801581650001801619650003501637650002001672650001801692650001801710650003101728650002001759650002801779650001301807650002801820650001501848653003201863653001501895653001401910653001401924653001501938700001801953700001601971773006901987852000902056856008102065930003302146945001302179946001102192655001202203IND2050723820221122071742.0960409s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205072382DNAL7 a85956702pmid7 a10.1007/s0029400500422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirsel, S.10aDeletion of the Cochliobolus heterostrophus mating-type (MAT) locus promotes the function of MAT transgenes  ap. 241-249.  a2019-12-04  aCochliobolus heterostrophus has alternate genes (MAT-1 and MAT-2) at its mating-type locus. Transformants of a MAT-1 or a MAT-2 strain carrying a transgene of opposite mating type can self and are dual maters; the transgene, however, promotes development of pseudothecia only, not ascospores. To determine if the resident gene interferes with the function of the transgene, transformation vectors were designed to delete different amounts (2.5 kb, 5.7 kb, and 6.3 kb) of DNA at the MAT locus. Deletions occurred at a higher frequency (about 90% of transformants) with linearized plasmid than with circular plasmid (about 15% of transformants), and all three vectors were equally efficient at gene replacement. Both MAT-1 and MAT-2 could be deleted with the same set of vectors. Re-transformation of deletion strains (regardless of deletion size) with a wild-type copy of MAT restored full mating ability, indicating that the resident MAT gene interferes with function of the MAT transgene. Moreover, sexual development was normal whether the MAT transgene integrated at the homologous or at an ectopic site. 3agenetic transformation 3aloci 3agene interaction 3aBipolaris maydis 3agene expression 3agenes 3asexual reproduction 3amating behavior 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aFungal Proteins 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Mating Type, Fungal 2aGenetic Vectors 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTransgenes 0aCochliobolus heterostrophus 0amat-1 gene 0amat locus 0adeletions 0amat-2 gene1 aTurgeon, B.G.1 aYoder, O.C.0 tCurrent genetics.g1996, v. 29, no. 3 p.241-249x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0029400500423Available from publisher's Web site  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02932naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245014300141300001600284500001500300520108100315650003801396650002101434650002701455650001301482650002501495650002301520650001801543650002501561650001101586650002401597650003601621650001801657650002301675650002801698650001501726650002101741650002801762650003101790650002401821650001901845650003901864650002401903650006301927650003401990650003602024653001602060653001502076653001202091653002802103653001902131700001702150700001702167773008102184852000902265939003302274946001102307655001202318IND9303689920221122071833.0930618e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930368992DNAL7 a84670742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, L.A.14aThe Rubisco activase (rca) gene is located downstream from rbcS in Anabaena sp. strain CA and is detected in other Anabaena/Nostoc strains  ap. 753-764.  a2019-12-04  aA gene encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase (rca) was found downstream from the rbcLrbcS operon in the heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain CA. Two unknown open reading frames were shown to be located between rbcS and rca in strain CA and all the genes, rbcLrbcS, ORF1, ORF2, and rca were in the same transcriptional orientation. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Anabaena Rubisco activase showed both similarities and differences to the plant enzyme with considerable differences at the carboxy and amino termini. Proposed ATP-binding sites were conserved in the cyanobacterial protein. Recombinant cyanobacterial Rubisco activase, however, reacted with antisera to spinach Rubisco activase. Hybridization studies, using the Anabaena sp. strain CA rca gene as a heterologous probe, detected homologous sequences in heterocystous Anabaena/Nostoc strains but not in unicellular or nonheterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria, suggestive of a close evolutionary relationship of chloroplasts and heterocystous cyanobacteria. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3astructural genes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aAnabaena 3aamino acid sequences 3achromosome mapping 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3aNostoc 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnabaenaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyanobacteriaxgenetics 2aDNA Probes 2aEscherichia coli 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlant Proteins 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0acomparisons 0aregulation 0aenzymes 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x679421 aGibson, J.L.1 aTabita, F.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1993 Mar., v. 21, no. 5 p.753-764x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02551naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245009100172300001600263520080200279650001101081650002101092650002801113650002501141650002501166650002401191650001801215650002301233650001001256650004201266650001801308650004701326650001801373650002801391650002101419650003401440650002801474650003901502650002701541650001301568650002801581653001201609653002801621653001901649653001401668700001901682700003401701700001301735773006901748852000901817856007801826930003301904945001301937946001101950655001201961IND2050723620221122071858.0960409s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205072362DNAL7 a85956692pmid7 a10.1007/BF022215532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, J.A.10aCloning and sequence analysis of the invertase gene INV1 from the yeast Pichia anomala  ap. 234-240.  aA genomic library from the yeast Pichia anomala has been constructed and employed to clone the gene encoding the sucrose-hydrolysing enzyme invertase by complementation of a sucrose non-fermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

FTIR spectra were compared with results of a gas-chromatographic head space method. Principal component analysis of whole spectra (3000 to 1000 cm-1) suggested to reduce the spectrum of analysis for acetone to 1450 to 1200 cm-1. A second derivative was applied to the spectra to remove baseline effects and further enhance the spectral features. Full cross-validation was used to compare the reference with predicted acetone concentrations of samples not included in model development. PLS applied to the full spectral range resulted in a complex 19-factor model with a cross-validation error of 0.22 mM. After reducing the spectrum and taking the second derivative, we obtained a model with seven factors that yielded a cross-validation error of 0.21 mM. This compares favorably with a previously reported model with 20 factors and an error of 0.25 mM. Using PLS predictions to identify cows with subclinical ketosis resulted in 95 to 100% sensitivity and 96 to 100% specificity when the threshold for subclinical ketosis was 0.4 to 1.0 mM. The corresponding positive predictive values were greater than or equal to 76% and the negative predictive values >98% throughout an assumed range of subclinical ketosis prevalence of 10 to 30%. 3adairy cows 3aketosis 3ascreening 3amilk 3amilk composition 3aacetone 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3adisease prevalence 3aaccuracy 3adisease diagnosis 3awavelengths 2aAcetonexanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aFemale 2aKetosisxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aModels, Biological 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 3aNetherlands1 aLuinge, H.J.1 aLutz, E.T.G.1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aMaas, J.H. van der.1 aWilmink, H.1 aNoordhuizen, J.P.T.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.575-582x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03326naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245009900148300001600247500002400263520172900287650003602016650002002052650001602072650003202088650003002120650003002150650001202180650001302192650002402205650001202229650005102241650002302292650003002315650007802345650001302423650001402436650003602450650006402486650002802550650004002578653001902618700001802637700001702655773006802672852000902740930003302749945001302782946001302795655001202808IND2324380120221122063406.0011207e200107  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232438012DNAL7 a115697472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackwood, D.J.10aUse of a genetic marker for wild-type potentially pathogenic infectious bursal disease viruses  ap. 701-705.  aSummary in Spanish.  aAn amino acid mutation at residue 284 (Ala to Thr) in the VP2 protein of infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs) has been correlated with the ability to replicate in cell culture. In this study, we designed a molecular test for this mutation. The reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) was used to amplify a 743-bp region of the VP2 gene that contained the codon for amino acid 284. The restriction endonuclease NgoMIV was selected for this study because the first three nucleotides of its six-base recognition sequence are the codon responsible for the amino acid alanine at residue 284. The RT/PCR products from 10 known pathogenic and 16 vaccine strains of IBDV were examined for the presence or absence of the NgoMIV site. We also examined 189 field strains of IBDV for the NgoMIV site. All 10 known pathogenic IBDV strains contained the NgoMIV site, indicating they contained alanine at residue 284. None of the vaccine strains had the NgoMIV site, suggesting they had threonine or another amino acid at residue 284. The results suggest that the presence of this NgoMIV site can be used as a marker for the identification of wild-type (nonvaccine) IBDV strains. The RT/PCR products from 152 (80.4%) of the field strains had the NgoMIV site and thus have the potential to be wild-type pathogenic viruses. The RT/PCR products from 37 (19.6%) of the field strains were not cleaved by NgoMIV and thus are potentially attenuated vaccine strains. Molecular diagnostic assays have been used to place IBDV strains into genetically related groups. The identification of this genetic marker now makes it possible to identify viruses that are wild-type strains that have the potential to be pathogenic viruses. 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3agenetic markers 3aamino acids 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3astrains 3amutation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aGene Amplification 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aInfectious bursal disease virusxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aRestriction Mappingxveterinary 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aVaccinationxveterinary 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgenetics 0aidentification1 aByerley, E.H.1 aSommer, S.E.0 tAvian diseases.g2001 , v. 45, no. 3 p.701-705x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle01422naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245005000148300001800198520011100216650001700327650001700344650002800361650001700389650001600406650001200422650001100434650004700445650003400492650001100526650007400537650002100611650006300632650004500695650001200740650005400752653003400806773008500840852000900925939003300934945000800967946001300975655001200988991577542260742620221122063439.0830207e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830011492DNAL7 a67595382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibb, H.C.10aGastrointestinal nematodiasis in dairy cattle  ap. 2182-2188.  agastrointestinal nematodiasis, dairy cattle, epidemiology and pathogenesis, symposium presentation, review 3adairy cattle 3aepidemiology 3agastrointestinal system 3apathogenesis 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aFemale 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxepidemiologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aNematode Infectionsxepidemiologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aOstertagiasisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aSeasons 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 0aTrichostrongylidae (Nematoda)0 tJournal of dairy science.g1982 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.2182-2188x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830207c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03562naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001600169245007600185300001600261500002300277500001500300520209200315650001202407650001802419650001802437650002002455650001302475650002502488650002302513650001702536650001402553651001202567653002702579653001002606653002202616653001302638653001402651653001802665653002102683653001902704700001502723700001802738700001602756773009502772852000902867856007502876930003302951945002502984946001103009655001203020IND4371552220221122063447.0050620e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437155222DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPerry, M.P.10aCalculating penalties for reforestation failures: an Alberta case study  ap. 557-566.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aProvincial governments across Canada rely on regeneration requirements and penalties to promote reforestation following harvesting. However, little has been written on how to determine optimal levels of penalties for noncompliance such that tenure holders have incentives to further social reforestation objectives. This paper shows how reforestation penalties may be calculated in the case of Alberta. The calculation of the penalty is shown to be dependent on (i) changes in the values of future annual allowable cuts caused by failure to promptly regenerate, (ii) the portion of stumpage values collected with stumpage fees, (iii) nontimber values influenced by reforestation, (iv) differences in private and social discount rates, (v) costs of detecting noncompliance, and (vi) the probability of detecting infractions. In the case of Alberta, (v) and (vi) are minor considerations, as detection costs are low and probability of detection is high. However, values of (i) through (iv) have large potential impacts on the optimal penalties. For example, if (i) annual allowable cuts drop by 99 m3 for a 3-year reforestation delay (vs. an acceptable 2-year delay) on a 783-ha forest, (ii) stumpage fees are $10 below stumpage value, (iii) nontimber values are zero, and (iv) the private discount is 9%, while the social rate is 6%, then the optimal penalty is $49.17CAN.ha(-1). However, if we change (ii) and (iv) such that stumpage fees are $30CAN below stumpage value and the private discount is 9%, while the social rate is 3%, then the optimal penalty is $168.58CAN.ha(-1). With zero nontimber values, zero monitoring costs, no divergence between public and private interest rates at 9%, and a probability of detection of 1.00, the current penalty of $30CAN.ha(-1).year(-1) would approximate the optimal amount if stumpage fees were $20CAN.m(-3). The variability in values of (i) through (iv) across forests and over time suggests that problems will arise in establishing a constant penalty for all provincial forests and that penalties should be revised as values change over time. 3alogging 3aforest policy 3areforestation 3alaw enforcement 3astumpage 3aenvironmental policy 3ainterest (finance) 3aforestry law 3adetection 3aAlberta 0areforestation failures 0afines 0aforest management 0aforestry 0apenalties 0anoncompliance 0anonmarket values 0adiscount rates1 aBeck, J.A.1 aLuckert, M.K.1 aWhite, W.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.557-566x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-1753Available from publisher's Web site  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01796naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245005500175300001800230520078100248650001601029650002001045650001401065650001401079650001901093650001901112650001901131650002101150650002001171650001501191653002001206700001201226773008001238852000901318930003301327945002501360946001301385655001201398IND4367243120221122063602.0050222e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436724312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Automated segmentation of the cartilage and bone areas of the thoracic vertebrae was necessary to make the technique practical. Eighty-three beef carcasses were used for imaging the thoracic vertebrae. Color and spatial features were used for image segmentation. The hue value of the HSL color system was effective in segmenting cartilage areas, while the a* value of the CIELab system gave good results for the bone areas. After applying morphological operations on both cartilage and bone areas, geometric properties of these areas were used to give the final segmented object. The results of this work contribute to an automated beef maturity grading system. 3ameat grades 3acarcass grading 3avertebrae 3acartilage 3aimage analysis 3abeef carcasses 3amaturity stage 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3aalgorithms 0amaturity grades1 aTan, J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2003 , v. 46, no. 5 p.1429-1434x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02533naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245008600153300001600239500001500255520078800270650001801058650001201076650002201088650001201110650002401122650002501146650002001171650002801191650000901219650002001228650002401248650001801272650002301290650003301313650002801346650003701374650003801411650001701449650002801466650004801494650003401542650003601576653001501612653002801627653002501655700001401680700001601694700001501710700001701725700001501742700001501757773008101772852000901853930003301862945001301895946001101908655001201919IND2051376120221122053732.0960523e199511  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205137612DNAL7 a85414902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuchi-Mizutani, M.10aSenescence-induced expression of a homologue of delta 9 desaturase in rose petals  ap. 627-635.  a2019-12-05  acDNAs for senescence-inducible genes were isolated by differential hybridization from a cDNA library derived from mRNAs from the petals of rose flowers. The amino acid sequence deduced from these cDNAs exhibited significant homology to those of delta 9 acyl-lipid desaturases of cyanobacteria and of delta 9 acyl-CoA desaturases of a yeast and mammals. There was no amino-terminal sequence indicative of a leader peptide for targeting to the chloroplasts or to mitochondria. Northern blot analysis indicated that the transcripts of the cDNAs were expressed specifically in petals at late developmental stages and during senescence. It is proposed that a delta 9 desaturase in the senescing petals play an important role in the degradation of saturated fatty acids of membrane lipids. 3amessenger RNA 3ahybrids 3acomplementary DNA 3acorolla 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3aRosa 2aAgingxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0asenescence 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aSavin, K.1 aCornish, E.1 aTanaka, Y.1 aAshikari, T.1 aKusumi, T.1 aMurata, N.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1995 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.627-635x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03229naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245012500180300001600305500001500321520160300336650002601939650002401965650001101989650001402000650001702014650001002031650002002041650001602061650002002077650001102097650001802108650001002126650002102136650002802157650001102185650003502196650003202231650007302263650003402336650002702370650002002397653001902417653001502436700001102451700001802462700001202480773007902492852000902571930003302580945002502613946001302638655001202651IND4368948220221120183343.0050413e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436894822DNAL7 a156712212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLiboni, K.C.10aGlutamine modulates LPS-induced IL-8 production through IkappaB/NF-kappaB in human fetal and adult intestinal epithelium  ap. 245-251.  a2019-12-05  aThe intestinal epithelium may serve as a nidus for inflammation that can cause local and systemic organ dysfunction. Relative to the adult, the immature intestine is exquisitely sensitive to inflammatory agents. Glutamine (Gln), an amino acid that is rapidly depleted during critical illness, modulates intestinal inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Here we relate Gln status to activation of the inhibitor of [kappa]B (I[kappa]B)/nuclear factor (NF)-[kappa]B signaling pathway in fetal-derived (H4) and adult (Caco-2) enterocytes. In the absence of Gln with or without LPS, H4 cells expressed more interleukin (IL)-8) than Caco-2 cells. Gln supplementation partially prevented the LPS-induced elevation of IL-8 in both cell types. I[kappa]B[alpha] was significantly decreased in both H4 and Caco-2 cells with Gln deprivation, and this was followed by an increase in NF-[kappa]B p65 in the nucleus. DNA binding of NF-[kappa]B was increased in both H4 and Caco-2 cells with Gln deprivation. I[kappa]B[alpha] phosphorylation was not altered by Gln status in either H4 or Caco-2 cells. Proteasomal inhibition after Gln depletion in Caco-2 cells was associated with an increase in the I[kappa]B-ubiquitin complex, but a decrease in complex formation in H4 cells, indicating that Gln deprivation alters I[kappa]B[alpha] through a pathway that differs from Caco-2 cells. We speculate that a reduced capacity of the immature enterocyte (H4) to respond to Gln deprivation with increased synthesis of I[kappa]B[alpha] rather than increased proteolysis as seen in the Caco-2 cells is the underlying mechanism. 3atranscription factors 3alipopolysaccharides 3ahumans 3aglutamine 3ainflammation 3afetus 3aimmune response 3aenterocytes 3asmall intestine 3aadults 3ainterleukin-8 2aAdult 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aGlutaminexpharmacology 2aHumans 2aI-kappa B Proteinsxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-8xbiosynthesis 2aIntestinal Mucosaxdrug effectsxembryologyximmunologyxphysiology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 0anuclear factor 0aepithelium1 aLi, N.1 aScumpia, P.O.1 aNeu, J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2005 Feb., v. 135, no. 2 p.245-251x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060120b20060202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2005/12/29  aOther US 7aarticle01660naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001200144245007600156300001800232520067900250650002200929650002600951650002300977650002801000650001801028650002201046650001901068650001801087650001401105700001901119773008001138852000901218930003301227945002501260946001301285655001201298IND4367242320221120183445.0050222e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436724232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The selective heating method proposed denatures protein constituents in the spectral range between 5.88 and 6.66 micrometer, demonstrating an enhanced (approximately 40% in 5 min heating) lethality, compared to normal infrared (IR) radiation. A thermal death kinetics model based on the dynamic temperature profile to predict survivors under time varying conditions was developed to validate the selective IR heating process. The proposed dynamic thermal death kinetics model concept can be extended to other inactivation process. 3aAspergillus niger 3aFusarium proliferatum 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afungal spores 3aheat inactivation 3aheat treatment 3afar-red light 3acorn meal1 aIrudayaraj, J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2003 , v. 46, no. 5 p.1407-1412x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02822naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245006200173300001400235500025600249520124600505650001701751650001301768650001101781650001901792650002301811650001201834650002101846650002001867650001301887650001201900650001301912650001801925650001501943650002101958650001301979650001501992650001602007650001802023700002002041700002702061700002902088700001702117773014302134856005402277852000902331655001202340IND60557133520221120153740.0161103e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713352DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1113.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzudogru, E.

The plant is traditionally propagated by rhizomes, stem nodes or embryo rescue, and none of these can fulfil today the increasing demand for its cultivation. Hence, establishment of embryogenic callus cultures has potential to speed up the propagation of selected genotypes. However, embryogenic callus requires periodic subculturing, which in turn may lead to gradual reduction of embryogenic potential. Cryopreservation offers a unique solution to this problem, as at the temperature of liquid nitrogen all the biochemical reactions are hampered, and thus the decay of cultures is avoided. Present study, therefore, aimed at developing an efficient cryopreservation protocol for Arundo donax embryogenic callus by comparing two different techniques, i.e., slow cooling and PVS2 vitrification. PVS2 vitrification proved to be the most efficient, with best post-thaw recovery of callus samples achieved when PVS2 was applied for 60 or 90 min at 0°C, prior to direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. The cryopreserved callus continued to grow normally in post-cryopreservation. 3aArundo donax 3abiofuels 3acallus 3acallus culture 3achemical reactions 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3afuel production 3agenotype 3agrasses 3anitrogen 3aovule culture 3aperennials 3aphytoremediation 3arhizomes 3astem nodes 3atemperature 3avitrification1 aRoncasaglia, R.1 aSilva, D.

In this article, the sensitivity of global estimates of terrestrial water balance components to uncertainties in meteorological forcing data and land surface parameters is investigated using the SWAP land surface model and different global datasets. The latter were prepared within the framework of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II and the Second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2). Sixteen variants of estimations of mean annual water balance components on the global scale were obtained. The discrepancies among the variants were found to be large: global annual run-off varied by 1·9 times; its surface and sub-surface components by 2·2 and 1·8 times, respectively; run-off ratio by 1·5 times and the other hydrological quantities by 1·2-1·3 times. Uncertainties in precipitation datasets translate to uncertainties in run-off and evapotranspiration depending on the ratio of real evapotranspiration to its potential value E/E₀. In the areas with high E/E₀, differences in P across precipitation datasets mainly translated to differences in R. In the areas with the lowest values of E/E₀, run-off is nearly insensitive to changes in P, while uncertainty in P mostly translates to uncertainty in E. Uncertainties in E and R due to different radiation datasets are the same in absolute units. Impact of uncertainties in soil parameters on estimations of water balance components can be comparable with the impact of uncertainties in forcing data. 3ameteorological data 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3asoil 3aparameter uncertainty 3arunoff 3asatellites 0awater balance1 aGusev, Ye.M.1 aKovalev, Ye.E.0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Mar. 30, v. 25, no. 7 p.1074-1090dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7651 7aarticle02224naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002400139245013000163300001800293500002400311520102900335650001701364650001201381650002201393650001901415650000901434650001901443650002701462650003001489650002501519650001301544651001101557700002301568700001901591700002501610773011501635852000901750856007901759655001201838IND4457911220221120153808.0110513e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445791122DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.10005332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelmas, Chloé E.L.10aIsolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in Rhododendron ferrugineum (Ericaceae) using pyrosequencing technology  ap. e120-e122.  aIncludes references  aPremise of the study: Microsatellite primers were developed for Rhododendron ferrugineum (Ericaceae) to evaluate genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and mating system of this self-compatible species. METHODS: and Results: The new-generation 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing technology was used to isolate 102 novel microsatellite loci. Two multiplex PCR sets were optimized to genotype nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. The level of genetic diversity was assessed in two populations from the Pyrenees (France). The mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.5 to 7. The mean observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0 to 0.76 and from 0.03 to 0.66, respectively. Cross-species amplification was successful for 13 other Rhododendron species and two additional genera of Ericaceae, with an average of seven pairs of primers amplifying per species. CONCLUSIONS: These markers will facilitate further studies on the evolutionary history of the large Ericaceae family and Rhododendron in particular. 3aRhododendron 3aalleles 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amating systems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3atitanium 3aFrance1 aLhuillier, Emeline1 aPornon, André1 aEscaravage, Nathalie0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2011 May, v. 98, no. 5 p.e120-e122dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.10005333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02683naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001800177245014100195300001600336500002400352520120200376650001101578650001101589650001901600650002101619650002601640650001701666650003101683650001501714650001801729650001701747650001701764650001301781700001901794700001801813700001901831700002101850700002001871700002401891773009401915852000902009856009002018930003302108945002502141946001102166655001202177IND4434574720221120153756.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aCho, Han-jin.10aHexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis licorice exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects in murine macrophages and in mouse skin  ap. 959-966.  aIncludes references  aPreviously, we prepared a hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (HEGU) containing undetectable amounts of glycyrrhizin, which is known to induce hypertension. This study assessed the effect of HEGU on inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated Raw264.7 macrophages and in mouse skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In the LPS-stimulated macrophages, HEGU (0-2μg/ml) reduced nitric oxide (NO) release and the protein expression and transcriptional activity of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). HEGU reduced prostaglandin E₂ release and phospholipase A₂ transcripts. HEGU reduced the secretion and mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. HEGU prevented IκBα degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, NFκB DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Additionally, dehydroglyasperin C, isolated from HEGU, reduced NO production, iNOS expression, and NFκB transcriptional activity. In the mouse inflammation model, HEGU suppressed skin swelling and iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. These results indicate that HEGU exerts powerful anti-inflammatory effects, probably mediated via the inhibition of NFκB signalling. 3ahexane 3aethane 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aglycyrrhizin 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell lines 3aanimal models 3acell culture 3ainflammation 3alicorice1 aLim, Soon Sung1 aLee, Yeon Sil1 aKim, Jong-Sang1 aLee, Choong Hwan1 aKwon, Dae Young1 aPark, Jung Han Yoon0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.959-966dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03733naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245010500149300001600254500001500270520110900285650001601394650002701410650001301437650001401450650002001464650002101484650002901505650002301534650002001557650002901577650002201606650002501628650002201653650001901675650001801694650002101712650002301733650002401756650001801780650001801798650002301816650003701839650003101876650003801907650001701945650002001962650006001982650002802042650003102070650003302101650001802134650003102152650002002183650004602203650003902249650003402288650002202322650003802344650002702382650002802409650002302437650002302460653001402483653001902497653001902516653001702535653001202552653001802564653002502582700002102607700002302628700001402651700001502665700001602680773008102696852000902777930003302786945001302819946001102832655001202843IND2051381620221120153613.0960523e199511  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205138162DNAL7 a85414982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoldsworth, M.J.14aThe maize transcription factor Opaque-2 activates a wheat glutenin promoter in plant and yeast cells  ap. 711-720.  a2019-12-05  aThe promoter of the wheat low-molecular-weight glutenin (LMWG1D1) gene contains a cis element called the GCN4 like motif (GLM) which has low homology to one class of binding site for the maize endosperm-specific b-ZIP transcription factor Opaque-2 (O2). Previous work has shown that the GLM element interacts with the nuclear factor ESBFII during wheat endosperm development at the time of maximum transcription of the LMWG1D1 gene. In this paper we demonstrate that O2 binds to the GLM element and can activate high levels of transcription from the wheat GLM in transient assays in plant protoplasts and in yeast cells. Lower levels of O2 activation through the GLM element in yeast containing a defective GCN4 gene showed that GCN4 was necessary for high levels of O2 transcriptional activation, indicating that O2 may need to heterodimerise with GCN4 to activate transcription in yeast. These observations provide evidence that the GLM represents a new type of O2 DNA-binding site, and support a postulate that an O2 homologue may activate endosperm-specific expression of wheat storage protein genes. 3aprotoplasts 3agenetic transformation 3aZea mays 3aglutenins 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aTriticum aestivum 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3abinding sites 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGlutensxanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aProtein Binding 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTriticumxgenetics 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aNicotiana 0aopaque-2 maize 0agcn like motif 0almwg1d1 gene 0abinding 0aSaccharomyces 0anucleotide sequences1 aMunoz-Blanco, J.1 aHammond-Kosack, M.1 aColot, V.1 aSchuch, W.1 aBevan, M.W.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1995 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.711-720x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02345naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008400170300001400254500025600268520111400524650001701638650001101655650001301666650001101679650001401690650002601704650002001730650001601750700001901766700001601785773014301801856005401944852000901998655001202007IND60557133420221120153606.0161103e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055713342DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1113.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, D.10aPropagation of Phalaenopsis ‘Puspa Tiara Kencana’ via somatic embryogenesis  ap. 21-26.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC 2014): International Symposium on Micropropagation and in Vitro Techniques held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aIn vitro propagation study of Phalaenopsis LSQUOPuspa Tiara KencanaRSQUO via somatic embryogenesis (SE) was successfully performed. Young leaf explants as the suitable explant produced embryogenic callus (EC) up to 19.9%, and 8.8% of them produced somatic embryos (SEs) directly on half-strength MS medium, supplemented with 0.5 mg L-1 of N6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1 mg L-1 of thidiazuron (TDZ) within 38 days after initiation. EC readily developed on the leaf explants 3.25 g EC weight and 0.63 cm3 EC volume, on average, while half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L-1 BAP and 1 mg L-1 TDZ stimulated 0.7 g EC weight and 3.1 cm3 EC volume. EC grew and proliferated optimally in leaf explant with a callus growth of 2.2 g month-1, and on the New Phalaenopsis (NP) medium, supplemented with 1 mg L-1 TDZ and 0.5 mg L-1 BAP, with EC growth of 1.6 g month-1. After 12 weeks of culture, 20 germinated SEs per clump were successfully established on NP medium with 0.05 mg L-1 of BAP, while more vigorous and greener plantlets were determined on half-strength MS medium, containing 0.05 mg L-1 BAP. 3aPhalaenopsis 3acallus 3aexplants 3aleaves 3aplantlets 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3athidiazuron1 aRachmawati, F.1 aWinarto, B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Mar. 22, , no. 1113 p.21-26dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1113.3  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013200145300001800277500001500295520146000310650001901770650001601789650001501805650002301820650002901843650001301872650001201885650001601897650002801913650001201941650001801953650001101971650001601982650002401998650001702022650001702039650002302056650003902079650001202118650002302130650000902153650001302162650001902175650002602194650001102220650003702231650002802268650002002296650002002316650002802336650001202364650001102376653001502387653002002402653001302422653001302435653001502448653002502463653000902488653002102497700001802518700001602536773008502552852000902637930003302646945001302679946001302692655001202705IND2290507320221120153604.0010417e200012  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229050732DNAL7 a111328672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurtaud, C.10aEffect of graded duodenal infusions of glucose on yield and composition of milk from dairy cows. 2. Diets based on grass silage  ap. 2952-2962.  a2019-12-05  aWe conducted two trials to study the effect of graded amounts of glucose infused into the duodenum on milk yield and composition as well as on plasma metabolites, using diets based on grass silage. In trial 1, four fistulated Holstein cows were arranged in a 4 x 4 Latin square design and received 0,750, 1500, and 2250 g of glucose/d in the duodenum. In trial 2, five fistulated Holstein cows were arranged in a 5 x 5 Latin square design and received 0.250, 500, 1000, and 2000 g/d of glucose. In both trials, cows were fed a basal diet of 38% grass silage, 10% dehydrated alfalfa, 49% energy concentrate, and 3% oil meal. The treatments (feed plus infusion) were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Increased amounts of glucose increased milk yield up to 2.4 and 1.6 kg/d in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Lactose content was not affected, while fat yield and content decreased linearly. The decrease in milk fat resulted from a reduced yield of C18, probably caused by a lower mobilization of fat. The glucose treatments significantly affected the profiles of medium-chain fatty acids, by enhancing the elongation process (up to C14). Glucose infusions induced an asymptotic response of protein yield (linear increase up to 1000 g of glucose, after ceiling). It appears that with poor postruminal starch diets, such as grass silage-based diets containing 35 to 40% of concentrate, the glucose supply to the mammary gland may be limiting for milk synthesis. 3amilk fat yield 3ametabolites 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3amedium chain fatty acids 3aduodenum 3aglucose 3aamino acids 3amilk protein percentage 3alactose 3ablood glucose 3acasein 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3agrass silage 3atotal solids 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxblood 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aDuodenum 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGlucosexadministration & dosage 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMedicago sativa 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPoaceae 2aSilage 0adry matter 0ablood chemistry 0ainfusion 0amilk fat 0amilk yield 0achemical composition 0adiet 0amilk composition1 aLemosquet, S.1 aRulquin, H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2000 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.2952-2962x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02673naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010800146300001600254500001500270520079500285650001601080650002101096650002801117650002001145650002901165650002001194650001901214650002201233650001201255650001701267650001901284650001801303650002301321650001801344650002801362650003801390650003101428650003201459650002801491650002901519650001901548650003001567650004601597650005001643650002901693653001901722653001601741653002801757653002501785653001401810653002701824700002001851700001701871773008101888852000901969930003301978945001302011946001102024655001202035IND2051383020221120143244.0960523e199511  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205138302DNAL7 a85415012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTregear, J.W.10aFunctional analysis of linker insertions and point mutations in the alpha-Amy2/54 GA-regulated promoter  ap. 749-758.  a2019-12-05  aFunctional analysis of a gibberellin-regulated wheat alpha-amylase promoter, alpha-Amy2/54, has indicated that three regions were essential for expression.

By converting the linker insertions to either single base point mutations or deletions using the class IIS restriction endonuclease Bsm I we have shown that nucleotides -119 and -109 within the GARE -121 GTAACAGAGTCTGG-108 and nucleotide -152 within the proposed element -156 GATTGACTTGACC-144 are essential for high level expression from this promoter. 3aprotoplasts 3apromoter regions 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3arecombinant DNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aaleurone cells 3aTriticum aestivum 3amutants 3aAvena sativa 3areporter genes 3aalpha-amylase 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aGlucuronidasexbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPoint Mutation 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aTriticumxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aalpha-Amylasesxgenetics 0agenbank/x13578 0amutagenesis 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0adeletions 0aalpha-amy2/54 promoter1 aPrimavesi, L.F.1 aHuttly, A.K.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1995 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.749-758x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002400178245013300202300001800335500001500353520120000368650001301568650002301581650001601604650002301620650002201643650002301665650001801688650001001706650002601716650002301742650002201765650001601787650002201803650001901825650001701844650001801861650004301879651001501922653001501937653001501952700001501967700001701982700001301999700001602012773008002028852000902108930003302117945002502150946001302175655001202188IND4367240320221120143319.0050222e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436724032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Monitored yield data were also collected in this field between 1996 and 1999, when it had a wheat-processing tomato-bean-sunflower crop rotation. A comparison between SSURGO-NRCS soil-unit definition and field-measured soil data showed that in this field the former are a good approximation and starting point for precision agriculture studies and management. In a second test, the EPIC model, using the SSURGO database soil type definitions, was found to reproduce the yield variability within this field with reasonable accuracy. The model's performance was not as good when tested with data from soil samples, apparently due to the way EPIC simulates water holding capacity from texture information and the lack of some key variables (not sampled), such as water content at field-capacity (FC), wilting-point (WP), and soil saturated conductivity. A set of runs was performed to simulate the yield at 13 point-locations in the field using FC, WP, and bulk density. Although the accuracy of the simulation did not improve greatly, the model reproduced the yield trend of two of the crops (wheat and sunflower). 3atomatoes 3atemporal variation 3acrop models 3aagricultural soils 3aHelianthus annuus 3asoil water content 3awilting point 3awheat 3aprecision agriculture 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aspatial variation 3afield capacity 3asoil texture 3acrop rotation 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aCalifornia 0aEPIC model 0acrop yield1 aCavero, J.1 aWilliams, J.1 aRoel, A.1 aPlant, R.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2003 , v. 46, no. 5 p.1365-1374x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02757naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008400145300001800229520145800247650001501705650001301720650001601733650002001749650002001769650001201789650001101801650001101812650002601823650002101849650000901870650001401879650002301893650001701916650002601933651001801959651001801977651001801995653002102013653002202034653001202056700001402068700001602082773008502098852000902183930003302192945001302225946001302238655001202251IND2290508020221120143227.0010417e200012  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229050802DNAL7 a111328702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, J.W.10aEffect of region, herd size, and milk production on reasons cows leave the herd  ap. 2980-2987.  aDairy Herd Improvement Holstein herd summary records (n = 11,259) were obtained for the year ending 1998. Reasons cows reportedly left the herd based on termination codes were analyzed for the effect of region, herd size, and herd milk production level. Regions were: North, Midsouth, and South. Herd sizes were: small (25 to 99), low medium (100 to 149), high medium (150 to 299), and large (greater than or equal to 300 cows). Milk production levels were: low (less than 7258 kg), medium (7258 to 9072 kg), and high (greater than 9072 kg). The overall percentage of cows leaving the herd was higher in the Midsouth than the South and increased with herd size. Low producing herds reported a lower percentage of cows left than high producing herds. Herds in the South reported more cows leaving for reproduction, death, and low production and fewer leaving for mastitis. Herds in the North and Midsouth reported more cows leaving for injury/other and disease, respectively. Cows left herds for disease less frequently in the North. Large herds in the South had a higher percentage leaving for low production than any herd size group in the North. Small herds reported more cows leaving for reproduction and mastitis than high medium and low medium size herds. The percentage of cows leaving for feet and leg problems was lowest for small size herds. High producing herds reported more cows leaving for reproduction, mastitis, feet and legs and disease. 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3adairy herds 3amilk production 3adecision making 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMastitis, Bovine 2aMilk 2aMortality 2aPopulation Density 2aReproduction 2aRetrospective Studies 3aUnited States 0aNorth America 0aSouth America 0aregional surveys 0alivestock numbers 0aculling1 aEly, L.O.1 aChapa, A.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2000 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.2980-2987x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02486naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100003200177245010100209300001700310500002400327500001500351520092800366650002101294650001801315650002501333650002001358650002801378650001801406650001301424650002601437650002201463650002501485650002301510651001101533653003601544700002201580700002101602700002701623700002901650700002601679773009501705852000901800856009001809930003301899945002501932946001101957655001201968IND4434575220221120132200.0100326e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ506 0aT300 0aX3801 aRufino, Maria do Socorro M.10aBioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities of 18 non-traditional tropical fruits from Brazil  ap. 996-1002.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities of polyphenolic extracts of 18 fresh and dry native non-traditional fruits from Brazil were determined using ABTS, DDPH, FRAP and β-carotene bleaching methods. The study provides an adaptation of these methods, along with an evaluation of the compounds related to antioxidant potential. The results show promising perspectives for the exploitation of non-traditional tropical fruit species with considerable levels of nutrients and antioxidant capacity. Although evaluation methods and results reported have not yet been sufficiently standardised, making comparisons difficult, our data add valuable information to current knowledge of the nutritional properties of tropical fruits, such as the considerable antioxidant capacity found for acerola -Malpighia emarginata and camu-camu -Myrciaria dubia (ABTS, DPPH and FRAP) and for puçá-preto -Mouriri pusa (all methods). 3afunctional foods 3afood analysis 3abioactive properties 3aMyrciaria dubia 3afree radical scavengers 3afruit quality 3aacerolas 3aequipment performance 3afruit composition 3aMalpighia emarginata 3aphenolic compounds 3aBrazil 0atropical and subtropical fruits1 aAlves, Ricardo E.1 ade Brito, Edy S.1 aPérez-Jiménez, Jara.1 aSaura-Calixto, Fulgencio1 aMancini Filho, Jorge.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 4 p.996-1002dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02466naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003300171245011400204300001200318500002000330520092700350592002801277650001701305650000901322650001301331650001901344650001601363650001801379650001201397650001201409650004001421650002301461650003001484650001101514650002601525650004701551650002801598650001901626700002301645700002201668700002301690700002501713700001901738773011701757852000901874856008901883655001201972IND2327131720221116175942.0211015e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232713172DNAL7 a118969642pmid7 a10.1046/j.0959-4493.2001.00276.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBratka‐Robia, Christine B.10aPrimary cell culture and morphological characterization of canine dermal papilla cells and dermal fibroblasts  ap. 1-6.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSkin biopsies were taken from female dogs, the primary hair follicles isolated and the dermal papilla dissected.

Dietary intake of Se within the physiological range is critical for human health and reproductive functions. Selenium levels outside the recommended range have been implicated in infertility and variety of other human diseases. However, presently it is not clear how different dietary Se sources are processed in our bodies, and in which form or how much dietary Se is optimum to maintain metabolic homeostasis and boost reproductive health. This uncertainty leads to imprecision in published dietary guidelines and advice for human daily intake of Se and in some cases generating controversies and even adverse outcomes including mortality. The chief aim for this review is to describe the sources of organic and inorganic Se, the metabolic pathways of selenoproteins synthesis, and the critical role of selenprotenis in the thyroid gland homeostasis and reproductive/fertility functions. Controversies on the use of Se in clinical practice and future directions to address these challenges are also described and discussed herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood intake 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3ahuman reproduction 3ahumans 3amortality 3aselenium 3aselenoproteins 3athyroid gland 3auncertainty1 aAu, Alice 1 aSalah, Wed 1 aWitting, Paul 1 aAhmad, Gulfam 0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 18, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130932563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245015000165520140200315592002801717650002201745650002301767650002501790650003301815650001101848650003301859650001201892650001101904700002101915700001801936773012001954856007802074852000902152655001202161IND60790920920221120193707.0220826e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079092092DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111623882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirilli, Chiara 10aConsumers’ Awareness, Behavior and Expectations for Food Packaging Environmental Sustainability: Influence of Socio-Demographic Characteristics  aPackaging is a leading factor determining the total environmental effect of food products. This study investigated consumers’ awareness, behavior and expectations in relation to the environmental sustainability aspects of food packaging. Using an online survey, responses from 646 participants were collected. The effect of socio-demographic characteristics on all variable responses was explored by ANOVA models and t-tests. Participants were segmented according to a visual approach based on a principal component analysis applied on the consumers’ behavioral data. Gender, age, and education level affected consumer awareness, behavior and expectations differently. Four groups of consumers were distinguished on the grounds of their behavior in relation to food packaging: (1) More sustainable—packaging-role-oriented; (2) More sustainable—packaging minimizers; (3) Less sustainable; and (4) Medium sustainable. The most sustainable groups were mainly composed of females, while less sustainable consumers were mainly the youngest. The four groups differed in terms of expectations for sustainability-related information that can be communicated through food labels. In conclusion, this work provided new knowledge that is useful to understand the factors that influence consumer behavior and to promote the consumers’ packaging-related sustainability choices through food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agender 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurveys 3at-test1 aMolino, Martina 1 aTorri, Luisa 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111623883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013800168520100800306592002801314650002801342650001201370650001201382650001101394650001901405650001101424650001501435650001401450653002101464653001401485653002801499653001801527653003101545700001401576700005701590773010701647856008701754852000901841655001201850IND60645035220221119172449.0200121e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064503522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1215272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinzhe10aMachine learning prediction of biochar yield and carbon contents in biochar based on biomass characteristics and pyrolysis conditions  aIn the study, machine learning was used to develop prediction models for yield and carbon contents of biochar (C-char) based on the pyrolysis data of lignocellulosic biomass, and explore inside information underlying the models. The results suggested that random forest could accurately predict biochar yield and C-char according to biomass characteristics and pyrolysis conditions. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pyrolysis conditions was higher than that of biomass characteristics for both yield (65%) and C-char (53%). For biomass characteristics, structural information was more important than elements compositions for accurately predicting biochar yield and it was inverse for C-char. The partial dependence plot analysis showed the impact way of each influential factor on the target variable and the interactions among these factors in the pyrolysis process. The present work provided new insights for understanding pyrolysis process of biomass and improving biochar yield and C-char.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 0aMachine learning 0aPyrolysis 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aBiochar yield 0aCarbon contents in biochar1 aLi, Yinan1 aWang, Xiaonan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9775-24170 tBioresource technology.g2019 Sept., v. 288 p.121527-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1215273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245015400158520195200312592002802264650001402292650001502306650001102321650001102332650001202343650001502355650001602370650001502386650001702401650001602418650001902434650001302453650001402466650001502480650001602495650001602511650001002527700001702537700001702554700001602571700001902587700001802606700001602624700001902640700001802659773012002677856007802797852000902875655001202884IND60790921020221121145613.0220826e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079092102DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Huan,10aWidely Targeted Metabolomics Profiling Reveals the Effect of Powdery Mildew on Wine Grape Varieties with Different Levels of Tolerance to the Disease  aPowdery mildew is an economic threat for viticulture because it not only affects grape yield, but also causes a series of impacts on the qualities of fruit and wine, especially the flavors and various metabolites. Different grape varieties may have different levels of powdery mildew resistance/tolerance and their components of their metabolome are also various. In this study, two wine grape varieties, Guipu No.6 (GP6) and Marselan (Mar) with different levels of powdery mildew tolerance, were used to compare the quality differences in metabolism level by using the widely targeted metabolomics method. The results show that GP6 has a better powdery mildew leaf tolerance than Mar. A total of 774 metabolites were detected by using a UPLC-QQQ-MS-based metabolomics approach, and 57 differential metabolites were identified as key metabolites that were accumulated after infection with powdery mildew in GP6 and Mar, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, stilbenes, lipids, nucleotides and derivatives, lignans and coumarins, and quinones. This finding indicates that the defense mechanisms of grape fruit are mainly associated with phenylpropane-flavonoid metabolism. Specifically, stilbenes had greater variations after powdery mildew infection in GP6; while in Mar, the variations of flavonoids, especially kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, were more remarkable. The above results demonstrate that stilbenes may play a more important role than flavonoids in resisting powdery mildew infection in GP6’s fruits, and the drastic variations of these phenolic compounds in different wine grapes after powdery mildew infection might also lead to quality difference in the flavors. This study can provide new insights into the understanding of the cause of powdery mildew tolerance in different grape varieties and the effects on the quality of wine grapes infected with the disease exerted by metabolism level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoumarins 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aleaves 3alignans 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anucleotides 3apowdery mildew 3aquinones 3astilbenes 3aterpenoids 3aviticulture 3awine grapes 3awines1 aLi, Hongyan 1 aWei, Rongfu 1 aCheng, Guo 1 aZhou, Yongmei 1 aLiu, Jinbiao 1 aXie, Taili 1 aGuo, Rongrong 1 aZhou, Sihong 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007500165300001600240520113900256592002801395650002201423650001501445650001501460650001201475650002501487650001901512650001101531650001801542650001301560650001901573650003301592650002101625650003701646700002001683700002001703773009701723856008101820990002301901852000901924655001201933IND60093219720221118070147.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009321972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyad, Mohamad10aFacile synthesis of polyaniline nanoparticles; its adsorption behavior  ap. 460-465.  aPolyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles in the bulk solution were synthesized by the oxidative polymerization of aniline and ammonium peroxodisulfate as an oxidant in aqueous medium without the aid of any acid. The scanning electron microscopy showed PANI nanoparticles with average diameters in the range of 20±5nm. Characterization of the prepared PANI nanoparticles by UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy have been carried out. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis and morphology using scanning electronic microscope are analyzed. The adsorption of a cationic dye, methylene blue (MB) using the PANI nanoparticles and conventional PANI was studied and discussed. The kinetic models: pseudo first order, pseudo-second order and the intraparticle diffusion models were applied to the experimental data. It was observed that pseudo-second order kinetic model described the adsorption process better than any other kinetic models. Results obtained indicate that PANI NPs base could be employed as an efficient adsorbent much more than the conventional PANI powder for dye removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaniline 3achemical engineering 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidants 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aEl-Hefnawy, Gad1 aZaghlol, Sawsan0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 217 p.460-465dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.0993Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245005600206300002000262520055900282592002800841650001300869650001800882650002000900700001600920700002200936700005300958700001901011773011701030856008401147852000901231655001201240IND60617034520221117214606.0181023e20180926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061703452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b022372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yongjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3485-425310aCleaning of Fluid-Infused Surfaces in Microchannels  ap. 12532-12537.  aWhen an immiscible fluid is flowing over a fluid-infused surface with transverse grooves in a microchannel, the infused fluid is either left in or cleaned away from the grooves by the flowing fluid. The cleaning status depends on the geometric parameters of the groove and the contact angle of the flowing fluids. The critical width of the grooves for the infused fluid enclosed in or driven out of the grooves is derived.

The present work focuses on the analysis of changes in triacylglycerols (TAGs) content and mycotoxins of coix seed during the processing and storage period for its quality control. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD) techniques, 42 lipid components in coix seeds were identified, and seven molecular species of TAG in coix seeds from different localities in China were measured and compared, respectively. A correlation analysis between the morphological features and TAGs contents revealed the integrity instead of the particle size of the seed, displaying a highly positive correlation with its quality. The higher contents of TAGs in hulled coix seed than in polished coix seed proposed an alternative processing way. During storage, the changes in TAGs contents of seeds indicated that the storage period should be less than 3 months, and the intact seeds could maintain lipid stability better than the powder. Furthermore, the air humidity and temperature should be controlled during coix seed storage to prevent the production of mycotoxins. These results provide significant insight into the effective control of coix seed quality during processing and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoix 3aair 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumidity 3alight scattering 3amycotoxins 3aparticle size 3aquality control 3aseed quality 3aseed size 3aseed storage 3astorage time 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerols 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aChina1 aWang, Jiancheng 1 aLi, Wei 1 aZhang, Chaojun 1 aLi, Ping 1 aChen, Jun 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167500002200292520076300314592002801077650000801105650002401113650002801137650001401165650002401179650002501203650001901228650001801247650001401265650002101279650002201300650001901322650001901341650001301360653001401373653001701387653002201404653001301426653002801439653004801467700002101515700002001536700001901556700001901575700001801594700002201612700002201634700002001656700001701676773008501693856008101778852000901859655001201868IND60528598620221120233259.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052859862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2016.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurake, Naoyuki10aCell survival of glioblastoma grown in medium containing hydrogen peroxide and/or nitrite, or in plasma-activated medium  aPre-press version  aNon-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas generate a high electron density (on the order of 1016 electrons per cm−3) using Ar gas.

The PAM remained still a somewhat difference that it should also be assessed for understanding other latent mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aargon (noble gases) 3aatmospheric pressure 3acell viability 3aculture media 3aelectrons 3aepithelial cells 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amammary glands 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrites 0aApoptosis 0aGlioblastoma 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aNitrites 0aPlasma activated medium 0aNon-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma1 aTanaka, Hiromasa1 aIshikawa, Kenji1 aKondo, Takashi1 aSekine, Makoto1 aNakamura, Kae1 aKajiyama, Hiroaki1 aKikkawa, Fumitaka1 aMizuno, Masaaki1 aHori, Masaru0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2016.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009000161300001800251520164500269592002801914650001501942650001101957650003901968650001302007650001102020650004402031650002002075650001402095650001602109700001702125700002202142700001802164700002302182700001902205700001702224700002402241773012102265856007502386852000902461655001202470IND60559138520170926000000.0161127e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055913852DNAL7 a10.1021/jp411358d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzablewski, Marek10aUltrafast Dynamics and Computational Studies on Diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (DADQs)  ap. 6815-6828.  aThree diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes, 4-(R¹R²C)-1-[(NC)₂C]-C₆H₄ (R¹,R² = H₂N, 1; R¹ = 3,5-Me₂-4-OCH₄H₆N–, R² = H₂N, 2; R¹ = 3,5-Me₂-4-OCH₄H₆N–, R² = 4-Me-C₅H₉N, 3), were investigated using carbon-13 NMR, steady-state, and ultrafast transient absorption and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopies to unravel the unusual characteristics of this class of chromophores. Computed (GIAO)B3LYP/6-31G* data for the zwitterions 1–3 using necessary solvation (PCM) models were shown to be in excellent agreement with observed structural and carbon-13 NMR data. The ground-state geometries of 1–3 contain a cationic methine group R¹R²C– twisted from the C₆H₄ ring and an anionic methine group (NC)₂C– in plane with the C₆H₄ ring in solution and solid state. The ¹³C chemical shifts of the peak corresponding to the methine carbon at the (NC)₂C– group of 1–3 are observed at 32.5–34.7 ppm, which are some 55 ppm upfield compared with the ¹³C chemical shift for the methine carbons in TCNQ, 1,4-[(NC)₂C]₂-C₆H₄. The decay of the excited state in diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes is fast and dominated by nonradiative processes on the picosecond time scale, which depends on the viscosity of the medium. The dynamics of the excited-state decay is therefore limited by conformational changes through an intramolecular twisting motion. This twisting motion is hindered by friction, which, in turn, also depends on the functional group size of the system. The dominant nonradiative pathways after excitation are due to twisted excited-state conformers according to TD-DFT computations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afriction 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3aviscosity 3azwitterions1 aFox, Mark A.1 aDias, Fernando

A novel polyelectrolyte nanosphere with magnetic function (SA@AM) was synthesized via the electrostatic reaction between the polyanionic sodium alginate (SA) and the surface of a prepared terminal amino-based magnetic nanoparticles (AMs). SA@AM showed a size of 15–22 nm with 6.85 emu·g⁻¹ of magnetization value, exhibiting a high adsorption capacity on Pb(II) ions representing a common heavy metal pollutant, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 105.8 mg g⁻¹. The Langmuir isotherm adsorption fits the adsorption curve, indicating uniform adsorption of Pb(II) on the SA@AM surfaces. Repeated adsorption desorption experiments showed that the removal ratio of Pb(II) by SA@AM was more than 76%, illustrating improved regeneration performance. These results provide useful information for the production of bio-based green magnetic nano scale adsorption materials for environmental remediation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amagnetism 3ananospheres 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asodium alginate 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aPolyelectrolytes 0aNanospheres 0aAdsorption properties 0aWater cleaning1 aGuo, Ming1 aLuo, Yonghong1 aShao, Dongwei1 aGe, Shengbo1 aCai, Liping1 aXia, Changlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7063-774X1 aLam, Su Shiung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5318-17600 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 July 01, v. 289 p.112506-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1125063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245017000158520154400328592002801872650001501900650002101915650001901936650001401955650002301969650001301992650001902005650001602024651001102040700003002051700002402081700002202105700002202127700002902149700002302178700003302201700001802234700002502252700002502277773012102302856007402423852000902497655001202506IND60791146620221120035701.0220826e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079114662DNAL7 a10.3390/v140816922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapão, Artur 10aAnalysis of Viral and Host Factors on Immunogenicity of 2018, 2019, and 2020 Southern Hemisphere Seasonal Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Adults in Brazil  aAnnual vaccination against influenza is the best tool to prevent deaths and hospitalizations. Regular updates of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) are necessary due to high mutation rates in influenza viruses. TIV effectiveness is affected by antigenic mismatches, age, previous immunity, and other host factors. Studying TIV effectiveness annually in different populations is critical. The serological responses to Southern-Hemisphere TIV and circulating influenza strains were evaluated in 2018–2020 among Brazilian volunteers, using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Post-vaccination titers were corrected to account for pre-vaccination titers. Our population achieved >83% post-vaccination seroprotection levels, whereas seroconversion rates ranged from 10% to 46%. TIV significantly enhanced antibody titers and seroprotection against all prior and contemporary vaccine and circulating strains tested. Strong cross-reactive responses were detected, especially between H1N1 subtypes. A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016, included in the 2018 TIV, induced the poorest response. Significant titer and seroprotection reductions were observed 6 and 12 months after vaccination. Age had a slight effect on TIV response, whereas previous vaccination was associated with lower seroconversion rates and titers. Despite this, TIV induced high seroprotection for all strains, in all groups. Regular TIV evaluations, based on regional influenza strain circulation, should be conducted and the factors affecting response studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ahemagglutination 3aimmunogenicity 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amutation 3aseroconversion 3avaccination 3aBrazil1 aAguiar-Oliveira, Maria L.1 aCaetano, Braulia C.1 aNeves, Thayssa K.1 aResende, Paola C.1 aAlmeida, Walquiria A.

The histological pattern and immunohistochemical profile were studied in 31 CHPs. Twenty‐three subjects were followed for 2 years to evaluate the correlation among tumour location, histotype, immunostaining and outcome of the disease. Of the 31 CHPs examined, 20 exhibited a perivascular whorled pattern, 8 were storifom and 3 were epithelioid. All tumours were positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, factor VIII‐related antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S‐100 protein. Seventeen CHPs were positive for actin and nine co‐expressed desmin. Six CHPs were also positive for CD34 antigen. The panel of immunohistochemical markers used confirmed the vascular lineage of CHP and aided in the exclusion of other mesenchymal tumours. Of the 23 dogs submitted to follow‐up, 6 had recurrence or metastases of the primary tumour. The epithelioid pattern or a noncutaneous location were associated with a poorer prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aneoplasms 3ablood vessels 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3arelapse 3ametastasis 3agender differences 3abreed differences 3aexcision 3aprognosis 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHemangiopericytomaximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aMale 2aPrognosis 2aRegistries 2aSkin Neoplasmsximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 0aItalyxepidemiology.1 aMillanta, Francesca1 aCiti, Simona1 aLorenzi, Davide1 aPoli, Alessandro0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2002 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.15-21dsBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0959-4493.2001.00281.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03646naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245017200180300001600352520177400368592002802142650003102170650002902201650003402230650004302264650001702307650001202324650001102336650001502347650001702362650001202379650001702391650001902408650001402427650002202441650001102463653003102474653001102505653002102516653004302537653002202580700002502602700003402627700006602661700006402727700006302791700002502854700002202879773010702901856008703008852000903095655001203104IND60645035620221119172549.0190620e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064503562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZetty-Arenas, Ana Maria10aTowards enhanced n-butanol production from sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate: Strain screening, and the effects of sugar concentration and butanol tolerance  ap. 190-198.  aRobust strains are essential towards success of n-butanol production from lignocellulosic feedstock. To find a suitable strain to convert a non-detoxified hemicellulosic hydrolysate of sugarcane bagasse, we first assessed the performance of four wild-type butanol-producing Clostridium strains (C. acetobutylicum DSM 6228, C. beijerinckii DSM 6422, C. saccharobutylicum DSM 13864, and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum DSM 14923) in batch fermentations containing either xylose or glucose at 30 g L−1 as sole carbon sources. C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum was selected after achieving butanol yields as high as 0.31 g g−1 on glucose and 0.25 g g−1 on xylose. In a 48-h fermentation containing a mixture of sugars (93% xylose and 7% glucose) that mimicked the hydrolysate, C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum delivered the highest butanol concentration (14.5 g L−1) when the initial sugar concentration was 50 g L−1. Moreover, the selected strain achieved the highest butanol yield (0.29 g g−1) on xylose-rich media reported so far. Meanwhile, C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum produced 5.8 g butanol L−1 (0.22 g g−1 butanol yield) when fermenting a non-detoxified sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate enriched with xylose (30 g total sugars L−1). Although sugars were not exhausted (4.7 g residual sugars L−1) even after 72 h because of the presence of lignocellulose-derived microbial inhibitors, these results show that C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum is a robust wild-type strain. This microorganism with high butanol tolerance and yield on xylose can, therefore, serve as the basis for the development of improved biocatalysts for production of butanol from non-detoxified sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aClostridium saccharobutylicum 3aClostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum 3abiocatalysts 3abutanol 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3ascreening 3asugarcane bagasse 3axylose 0aHemicellulosic hydrolysate 0aXylose 0aWild-type strain 0aClostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum 0aButanol tolerance1 aAlves, Rafael Ferraz1 aPortela, Carla Andreia Freixo1 aMariano, Adriano Pinto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2934-992X1 aBasso, Thiago Olitta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7765-42971 aTovar, Laura Plazas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1001-92501 aMaciel Filho, Rubens1 aFreitas, Sindelia0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2019 July, v. 126 p.190-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014500168300001800313520160000331592002801931650002601959650001301985650001901998650001602017650001902033650001702052650001702069650001602086650004802102650003702150650001302187700001302200700006502213700001702278700005502295773012802350856008402478852000902562655001202571IND60684312820221120083020.0200218e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068431282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b052952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yingran10aRecombinant Bacteriophage Cell-Binding Domain Proteins for Broad-Spectrum Recognition of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Strains  ap. 3340-3345.  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been well-recognized as one of the most common multiresistant bacteria threatening human health. Broad-spectrum recognition of multiple MRSA strains can meet the urgent demands for efficient diagnosis and subsequent decision of relevant treatment of MRSA-induced infections. Here, recombinant cell-binding domain (CBD) and green fluorescent protein-fused CBD of MRSA bacteriophage were expressed in soluble form. Distinct from the strain-specific MRSA bacteriophage, both recombinant CBD proteins displayed broad-spectrum recognition capability toward all five staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types of MRSA. Furthermore, they did not display any lytic activity toward the host bacteria, which facilitated the capture of whole MRSA cells with ideal flexibility for downstream manipulation and tracing. For demonstration of their application potential, a flow cytometry method employing the recombinant CBD proteins as the recognition agents was established to detect MRSA within a dynamic range of 1.5 × 10² to 1.5 × 10⁶ cfu mL–¹. The method can exclude potential interference from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains and other bacterial species. The recombinant CBD proteins were also successfully employed in antibiotic susceptibility testing of MRSA with a microplate-based method. The obtained results were consistent with those by the standard broth microdilution method. The satisfying results demonstrated their great application potential in clinical diagnosis and treatment of MRSA-induced infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3achromosomes 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aproteins1 aHe, Yong1 aBhattacharyya, Sanjib1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8738-71881 aLu, Shuguang1 aFu, Zhifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8238-79870 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 92, no. 4 p.3340-3345dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b052953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001300180245011400193300001800307506007600325520126300401592002801664506003701692650002201729650001501751650000901766650002301775650001201798650002201810650001201832700002801844700001701872773012101889856007502010852000902085655001202094IND60559138720221207095944.0161127e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055913872DNAL7 a10.1021/jp41151392doi7 aPMC40651642pmcid7 a242990132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Libo10aField-SEA: A Model for Computing the Solvation Free Energies of Nonpolar, Polar, and Charged Solutes in Water  ap. 6431-6437.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious work describes a computational solvation model called semi-explicit assembly (SEA). The SEA water model computes the free energies of solvation of nonpolar and polar solutes in water with good efficiency and accuracy. However, SEA gives systematic errors in the solvation free energies of ions and charged solutes. Here, we describe field-SEA, an improved treatment that gives accurate solvation free energies of charged solutes, including monatomic and polyatomic ions and model dipeptides, as well as nonpolar and polar molecules. Field-SEA is computationally inexpensive for a given solute because explicit-solvent model simulations are relegated to a precomputation step and because it represents solvating waters in terms of a solute’s free-energy field. In essence, field-SEA approximates the physics of explicit-model simulations within a computationally efficient framework. A key finding is that an atom’s solvation shell inherits characteristics of a neighboring atom, especially strongly charged neighbors. Field-SEA may be useful where there is a need for solvation free-energy computations that are faster than explicit-solvent simulations and more accurate than traditional implicit-solvent simulations for a wide range of solutes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical elements 3adipeptides 3aions 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysics 3asimulation models 3asolutes1 aFennell, Christopher J.1 aDill, Ken A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 June 19, v. 118, no. 24 p.6431-6437dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp41151393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014500161520186600306592002802172650001202200650001702212650002902229650001902258650001402277650001302291650001902304650001902323650001002342650001702352650001602369650001102385650001502396650001702411650001602428650002602444650002002470650001902490650000902509700002702518700002702545700002202572700001702594700002602611700002002637700002202657773012002679856007402799852000902873655001202882IND60791146820221120035702.0220826e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079114682DNAL7 a10.3390/w141624562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPretto, Patrizia 10aBioremediation of a Polluted Groundwater: Microbial Community Comparison of Treated and Untreated Aquifer through Next Generation Sequencing  aBioremediation is an active process for the detoxification of polluted ambient media employing the metabolism of microbes, while natural attenuation relies on physical, chemical and biological processes occurring without human intervention. A shallow aquifer (A0) was treated using a bioremediation approach through the amendment of whey to detoxify the most abundant contaminants: 1,1,2,2- tetrachloroethane (1,1,2,2-TeCA), perchloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). A deeper aquifer (A1), showing lower concentration of the contaminants, was left untreated. In A0, a concomitant decrease of more chlorinated molecules 1,1,2,2-TeCA, PCE and TCE and an increase of less halogenated molecules such as trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA), cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) were observed, suggesting that a reductive dechlorination took place. In contrast, the aquifer A1 did not show a significant decrease of contaminants during this period. A metagenomic approach (shot gun and 16S rRNA gene) was then used to investigate the microbial population of the two aquifers. A massive presence of the dehalogenator Dehalococcoides mccartyi (D. mccartyi) and a spectrum of different Geobacter species were detected in A0, after the treatment. The metagenome assembly of shotgun (SG) data further indicated a significant presence of methanogenic archaea, most likely from class Methanomassiliicoccales, at a level comparable to that of D. mccartyi. Instead, A1 was characterized by the species Burkholderia, Curvibacter and Flavobacterium. These results indicate that the autochthonous microbial consortia reflected the geochemistry of the two aquifers, with a dominant population thriving in an anoxic and nutrient rich environment implicated in reductive dehalogenation in A0 and a more diverse population, not able to decompose the pollutants, in A1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aBurkholderia 3aDehalococcoides mccartyi 3aFlavobacterium 3aGeobacter 3aaquifers 3abioremediation 3adechlorination 3agenes 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3atrichloroethane 3avinyl chloride 3awhey1 aSanseverino, Isabella 1 aDemichelis, Francesca 1 aLotti, Francesca 1 aLahm, Armin 1 aGarcia Perez, Angela 1 aRicci, Roberto 1 aLettieri, Teresa 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141624563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245009800202300001800300506007600318520147300394592002801867506003701895650002601932650001101958650001201969650001101981650002301992650004402015650002302059700002502082700002402107700002102131700001802152700002302170773012102193856007502314852000902389655001202398IND60559138920221207095938.0161127e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055913892DNAL7 a10.1021/jp411588b2doi7 aPMC40671532pmcid7 a247026932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenley, Andrew
T.10aCorrelation as a Determinant of Configurational Entropy in Supramolecular and Protein Systems  ap. 6447-6455.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor biomolecules in solution, changes in configurational entropy are thought to contribute substantially to the free energies of processes like binding and conformational change. In principle, the configurational entropy can be strongly affected by pairwise and higher-order correlations among conformational degrees of freedom. However, the literature offers mixed perspectives regarding the contributions that changes in correlations make to changes in configurational entropy for such processes. Here we take advantage of powerful techniques for simulation and entropy analysis to carry out rigorous in silico studies of correlation in binding and conformational changes. In particular, we apply information-theoretic expansions of the configurational entropy to well-sampled molecular dynamics simulations of a model host–guest system and the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The results bear on the interpretation of NMR data, as they indicate that changes in correlation are important determinants of entropy changes for biologically relevant processes and that changes in correlation may either balance or reinforce changes in first-order entropy. The results also highlight the importance of main-chain torsions as contributors to changes in protein configurational entropy. As simulation techniques grow in power, the mathematical techniques used here will offer new opportunities to answer challenging questions about complex molecular systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical compounds 3acattle 3aentropy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atrypsin inhibitors1 aKillian, Benjamin J.1 aHnízdo, Vladimír,1 aFedorowicz, Adam1 aSharp, Dan S.1 aGilson, Michael K.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 June 19, v. 118, no. 24 p.6447-6455dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp411588b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245013200157520131900289592002801608650002201636650001501658650001801673650001501691650001801706650001501724650001701739650001501756650001801771650003001789650000701819650001401826650001901840650001201859700001601871700002101887700001901908700001601927700002001943700001801963773012001981856007802101852000902179655001202188IND60790921620221121062542.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079092162DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Dan 10aEnhanced Extracellular Production and Characterization of Sucrose Isomerase in Bacillus subtilis with Optimized Signal Peptides  aSucrose isomerase (SIase) catalyzes the hydrolysis and isomerization of sucrose into isomaltulose, which is an important functional sugar widely used in the food industry. However, the lack of safe and efficient expression systems for recombinant SIase has impeded its production and application. In this study, enhanced expression of a SIase from Klebsiella sp. LX3 (referred to as KsLX3-SIase) was achieved in Bacillus subtilis WB800N, by optimizing the signal peptides. First, 13 candidate signal peptides were selected using a semi-rational approach, and their effects on KsLX3-SIase secretion were compared. The signal peptide WapA was most efficient in directing the secretion of KsLX3-SIase into the culture medium, producing a specific activity of 23.0 U/mL, as demonstrated by shake flask culture. Using a fed-batch strategy, the activity of KsLX3-SIase in the culture medium was increased to 125.0 U/mL in a 5-L fermentor. Finally, the expressed KsLX3-SIase was purified and was found to have maximum activity at 45 °C and pH 5.5. Its Kₘ for sucrose was 267.6 ± 18.6 mmol/L, and its kcₐₜ/Kₘ was 10.1 ± 0.2 s⁻¹mM⁻¹. These findings demonstrated an efficient expression of SIase in B. subtilis, and this is thought to be the highest level of SIase produced in a food-grade bacteria to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aKlebsiella 3aculture media 3afermenters 3afood industry 3ahydrolysis 3aisomaltulose 3aisomerases 3aisomerization 3aliquid state fermentation 3apH 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 3asucrose1 aLi, Mingyu 1 aJiang, Mengtong 1 aCong, Guilong 1 aLiu, Yuxin 1 aWang, Conggang 1 aLi, Xianzhen 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024003800169024001200207040001800219100002500237245006300262300001600325506017300341520101600514592002801530650002201558650001301580650002201593650002001615650002101635650001501656650001401671650001401685650001301699650001101712650001301723650003501736650001601771700002801787700002201815700002201837700002201859700002301881700002401904700001901928700003301947700002101980700002002001700002102021700002302042700003002065700002402095700002102119773010602140856011402246856008202360956010602442956012002548961000902668852000902677655001202686IND60575570520221214230215.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057557052DNAL7 a3312992aris7 a10113/57557052hdl7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9556-y2doi7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9556-y2chorus8 ans13940  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndelman, Jeffrey B.10aPedigree Reconstruction with Genome-Wide Markers in Potato  ap. 184-190.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aReliable pedigree information facilitates a scientific approach to breeding, but errors can be introduced in many stages of a breeding program. Our objective was to use single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to check the pedigree records of elite North American potato germplasm. A population of 719 tetraploids was genotyped with an Infinium SNP array, yielding 5063 high-quality markers. Based on pedigree records, the dataset contained 198 parent-offspring trios, of which 182 were consistent with the marker data. For 13 of the 16 trios with a pedigree error, the true parent was identified in the population. By comparing the additive relationship matrix calculated from pedigree with the genetic distance calculated from markers, an additional 24 pedigree modifications were proposed, including the paternity of several varieties developed with bulk pollen. To ensure accurate pedigree records are published in the future, we recommend that new varieties be SNP genotyped and checked against this dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3adata collection 3agenetic distance 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3apaternity 3apedigree 3apollen 3apotatoes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atetraploidy1 aSchmitz Carley, Cari A.1 aDouches, David S.1 aCoombs, Joseph J.1 aBizimungu, Benoit1 aDe Jong, Walter S.1 aHaynes, Kathleen G.1 aHolm, David G.1 aMiller, J.

The accumulation of these acids in RAS can have potential effects on its water quality, and consequently fish health and welfare. Thus, the characterization of FA is paramount for improving water quality, and subsequently fish productivity in RAS. In this study, a non-targeted analysis by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) was used to characterize the recirculating aquaculture systems fulvic acids (RASFA) and then compare their molecular fingerprints with actual reference standards of fulvic acids (FA) (Suwannee River; SRFA, Elliott soil; ESFA and Pahokee Peat; PPFA) purchased from the International Humic Substance Society (IHSS). The results of this study demonstrated the applicability of QTOF-MS as a rapid and comprehensive screening technique to characterize the FA fraction of DOM from RAS and to monitor differences in their molecular fingerprints when compared with other FA samples (SRFA, ESFA and PPFA). The QTOF-MS data from SRFA and ESFA standards matched the list of formulas obtained by 17 high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instruments with 90 and 76% accuracy, respectively, which guaranteed the power of QTOF-MS without the need for further coupling to liquid chromatography (LC). RASFA was found to be rich in low- and high-oxygen unsaturated classes of compounds (lowOC: 61.73% and highOC: 19.28%) and was similar in composition to SRFA. On the contrary, the ESFA and PPFA soil standards consisted mainly of aliphatic compounds (36.77 and 55.74%, respectively) and differed significantly in composition from the RASFA and SRFA water samples. RASFA matched with 66% of the elemental compositions obtained from the DOM of makeup waters analyzed in a previous experiment, indicating freshwater and seawater origins with a high fraction of terrestrial-derived organic matter (Tanimoto score: 0.53 between RASFA and SRFA). The unique information obtained from the molecular-level analysis of FA samples by QTOF-MS highlights the importance of this technique to characterize and compare FA from different origins rendering it possible to track the FA compositional changes along the water treatment processes of RAS. To our knowledge, this is the first study that characterizes the molecular fingerprints of the RASFA by QTOF-MS and compares them with the available FA reference standards from IHSS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3adiscoloration 3adissolved organic matter 3afeces 3afish 3afish health 3afreshwater 3ahumic substances 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apeat 3arivers 3aseawater 3asoil 3awater quality 3awater treatment1 aGonzalez, Susana V.1 aAsimakopoulos, Alexandros G.1 aMikkelsen, Øyvind 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141625493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011500158520114400273592002801417650001501445650001501460650001801475650002501493650001901518650002101537700001801558700001401576700001401590700001501604773012901619856007401748852000901822655001201831IND60653995920221119195324.0190722e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065399592DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111315992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yunwei 12aA Hybrid Model Integrating Spatial Pattern, Spatial Correlation, and Edge Information for Image Classification  aThis paper develops a novel hybrid model that integrates three spatial contexts into probabilistic classifiers for remote sensing classification. First, spatial pattern is introduced using multiple-point geostatistics (MPGs) to characterize the general distribution and arrangement of land covers. Second, spatial correlation is incorporated using spatial covariance to quantify the dependence between pixels. Third, an edge-preserving filter based on the Sobel mask is introduced to avoid the over-smoothing problem. These three types of contexts are combined with the spectral information from the original image within a higher-order Markov random field (MRF) framework for classification. The developed model is capable of classifying complex and diverse land cover types by allowing effective anisotropic filtering of the image while retaining details near edges. Experiments with three remote sensing images from different sources based on three probabilistic classifiers obtained results that significantly improved classification accuracies when compared with other popular contextual classifiers and most state-of-the-art methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acovariance 3ageostatistics 3aprobabilistic models 3aremote sensing 3avegetation types1 aJing, Linhai 1 aShi, Fan 1 aLi, Xiao 1 aQiu, Fang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 05, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111315993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008300164300001800247520116800265592002801433596007501461596005901536596016201595650002101757650003401778650001701812650001401829650002301843650001201866650001201878650001301890650002601903650001301929650001101942650001201953700001801965700001801983700001402001700001302015700001902028700001602047700005702063700001502120773011102135856008302246852000902329655001202338IND60645866420221118064756.0190824e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064586642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02472-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Yan12aA novel fiber from Bletilla striata tuber: physical properties and application  ap. 5201-5210.  aBletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) extracted from B. striata tuber, which is a traditional Chinese medicine, is used for preparing a fiber with mechanical properties through the environment-friendly method of phase inversion with ethanol as the nonsolvent. The prepared BSP fiber is woven into fabric with excellent flexibility, overcoming the considerable hardness of BSP membranes. The proposed simple method for preparing BSP fiber and fabric can enlarge the application field of the natural polysaccharide extracted from the B. striata tuber. The morphology, chemical structure, and water absorptivity of BSP fiber are characterized. The dense cross–section is beneficial for stress formation, which prevents fiber breakage during weaving. The chemical structure and water absorptivity are maintained after spinning using the phase inversion method. The weaving behavior of BSP fiber on a semiautomatic sample loom is studied, and 20-cm long BSP fabric is produced. The successful weaving of BSP fiber is significant for the design and fabrication of BSP products, which have excellent flexibility with potential application in the curing of skin wounds.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFA0101102cNational key research and development program of china  a51503163cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016002cthe young researchers foundation of zhejiang provincial key laboratory of fiber materials and manufacturing technology, zhejiang Sci-Tech university 3aBletilla striata 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aabsorptivity 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3aethanol 3afabrics 3ahardness 3amechanical properties 3aspinning 3atubers 3aweaving1 aWang, Linfeng1 aLiu, Changjun1 aWang, Han1 aXu, Yuan1 aZhou, Yingshan1 aGu, Shaojin1 aYang, Hongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2980-13841 aXu, Weilin0 tCellulose.g2019 June, v. 26, no. 9 p.5201-5210dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02472-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245018000168300001400348520157700362592002801939650002101967650002301988650002302011650001102034650001602045650002002061650001102081650002202092650002402114650001402138650002302152650001102175650001002186650001302196650001502209650002402224650002302248650001002271650001502281650001802296650001602314651001802330700002002348700001702368700001702385700001802402700001502420773011902435856008602554961001302640852000902653655001202662IND60636895520221120100910.0190411e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063689552DNAL7 a10.15232/S1080-7446(15)30190-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyatt, W.E.10aEffects of year-round stocking rate and stocking method systems on cow-calf production in the gulf coast region of the United States: Costs, returns, and labor considerations1  ap. 16-26.  aThe present research examines the effect of stocking method, i.e., continuous and rotational, and set (fixed) stocking rate on labor requirements, costs, and profits in cow-calf beef production. Two replicates of 4 adjacent pastures each, containing a mixed warm-season, perennial grass sod [common bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.; dallisgrass, Paspalum dilatatum Poir.], were overseeded to ‘Marshall’ annual ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum (Lam.)] in the autumn of 2 consecutive years. Within each replicate of 4 pastures, one of the following grazing treatments was randomly assigned each pasture: rotationally stocked (8 paddocks) at a low, medium, or high stocking rate (RL, RM, and RH) and continuously stocked at a moderate stocking rate (CM). Labor activities, expenditures, sales, and equipment usages were recorded throughout the study. On a per-cow basis, total labor usage declined (P < 0.01) in response to increases in stocking rate. However, on a per–0.40 ha basis, total labor usage only tended (P < 0.11) to increase as stocking rate increased. In both bases, total labor usage was greater (P < 0.01) for RM compared with CM. On a per–0.40 ha basis, increases in stocking rate tended (P < 0.08) to result in increased specified expenses, increased (P < 0.01) total sales revenue, and increased (P < 0.05) return over total expenses. Net returns between rotational and continuous stocking methods, at a moderate stocking rate, did not differ (P > 0.90) and would not justify the additional labor associated with rotational grazing management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aLolium multiflorum 3aPaspalum dilatatum 3aautumn 3abeef cattle 3abeef production 3acoasts 3acosts and returns 3acow-calf operations 3aequipment 3agrazing management 3aincome 3alabor 3apastures 3aperennials 3aprofits and margins 3arotational grazing 3asales 3asod strips 3astocking rate 3awarm season 3aUnited States1 aGillespie, J.M.1 aBlouin, D.C.1 aVenuto, B.C.1 aBoucher, R.W.1 aQushim, B.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2013 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.16-26dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/S1080-7446(15)30190-X3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012400152300001800276500001900294520139100313592002801704650001501732650002701747650002901774650002101803650003001824650002401854650001301878650001501891650001001906650001601916650002201932650002001954650001201974650001101986650001201997653001902009653001502028653002602043700001502069700001602084700001602100700002102116773014602137856007402283852000902357655001202366IND60710439720221118183413.0200909e20190717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071043972DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz2022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jie10aProductivity of Neoseiulus bicaudus (Acari: Phytoseiidae) Reared on Natural Prey, Alternative Prey, and Artificial Diet  ap. 2604-2613.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe predatory mite, Neoseiulus bicaudus (Wainstein), is a potential biological control agent against spider mites and thrips. The objective of this experiment was to compare the effects of three diets on the life table of N. bicaudus. The three diets were 1) Tetranychus turkestani (Ugarov & Nikolskii) (Acari: Tetranychidae), the natural prey of N. bicaudus; 2) Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Acari: Acaridae), an alternative prey; and 3) artificial diet primarily consisting of decapsulated shrimp cysts, egg yolk, and honey. The computer simulation was used to project the population growth of N. bicaudus fed on different diets. The preadult developmental time (3.83 d) of N. bicaudus was shortest, and the intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.2782 d⁻¹) and the net reproductive rate (R₀ = 18.98 offspring) were highest when reared on the alternative prey Ty. putrescentiae. The total development time (7.37 d) was longest, and the population parameters were the lowest (r = -0.0081 d⁻¹, R₀ = 0.85 offspring) when N. bicaudus was reared on artificial diet. The population projection showed that the population of N. bicaudus reared on Ty. putrescentiae could increase fast. Our results showed that the Ty. putrescentiae was the most suitable prey for mass rearing of N. bicaudus. The artificial diet could not support the N. bicaudus population and needs to be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoseiulus 3aTetranychus turkestani 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3aartificial diets 3abiological control agents 3acomputer simulation 3aegg yolk 3aentomology 3ahoney 3alife tables 3apopulation growth 3apredatory mites 3aprogeny 3ashrimp 3aspiders 0apredatory mite 0alife table 0apopulation projection1 aDong, Fang1 aLiu, Si-min1 aLu, Yan-hui1 aZhang, Jian-ping0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 July 17, v. 112, no. 6 p.2604-2613dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz2023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011100174300001800285520144500303592002801748650002601776650001501802650001801817650001201835650002301847650001701870650002801887650001301915650001601928650001701944653000801961653000901969653000901978653000901987653000901996653000802005653000802013653000902021653000802030653001102038653001202049653000702061653002102068653003402089653002202123653003002145700002002175700001902195700001802214773011802232856008602350852000902436655001202445IND60560325320221118230929.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056032532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhary, Nitika10aStructural basis of transport function in major facilitator superfamily protein from Trichoderma harzianum  ap. 1091-1100.  aTrichothecenes are the sesquiterpenes secreted by Trichoderma spp. residing in the rhizosphere. These compounds have been reported to act as plant growth promoters and bio-control agents. The structural knowledge for the transporter proteins of their efflux remained limited. In this study, three-dimensional structure of Thmfs1 protein, a trichothecene transporter from Trichoderma harzianum, was homology modelled and further Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to decipher its mechanism. Fourteen transmembrane helices of Thmfs1 protein are observed contributing to an inward-open conformation. The transport channel and ligand binding sites in Thmfs1 are identified based on heuristic, iterative algorithm and structural alignment with homologous proteins. MD simulations were performed to reveal the differential structural behaviour occurring in the ligand free and ligand bound forms. We found that two discrete trichothecene binding sites are located on either side of the central transport tunnel running from the cytoplasmic side to the extracellular side across the Thmfs1 protein. Detailed analysis of the MD trajectories showed an alternative access mechanism between N and C-terminal domains contributing to its function. These results also demonstrate that the transport of trichodermin occurs via hopping mechanism in which the substrate molecule jumps from one binding site to another lining the transport tunnel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aalgorithms 3abinding sites 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3aproteins 3arhizosphere 3atrichodermin 0aMFS 0aDPPC 0aRMSD 0aRMSF 0aAPBS 0aCBP 0aEBP 0aTCDB 0aHMM 0aPHYRE2 0aHHblits 0aR3 0aTrichoderma spp. 0aMajor facilitator superfamily 0aBio-control agent 0aTrichothecene efflux pump1 aSandhu, Padmani1 aAhmed, Mushtaq1 aAkhter, Yusuf0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Feb., v. 95 p.1091-1100dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011100162300001300273520052700286592002800813650001500841650002900856650004400885650001000929650002200939653001700961653001400978653002600992653001801018653001501036700001501051700002401066700002501090773008401115856007801199852000901277655001201286IND60519664320221120032943.0160510e20130808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051966432DNAL7 a10.2478/achi-2013-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantu, Dorina10aDiazolium Salts with Dihydroxyacetophenone Skeleton with Anticipated Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity  ap. 9-18.  aWe report herein a feasible study concerning design, syntheses and structure of some new diazolium salts with dihydroxyacetophenone skeleton of anticipated anticancer and antimicrobial activity.

In Exp. 1, 118 yearling heifers (417 ± 2.4 kg of initial BW) were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 treatments (0, 10, 20, or 30% dry-rolled field pea, DM basis; 4 pens/treatment), where field pea replaced dry-rolled and high-moisture corn. In Exp. 2, 143 beef steers (433 ± 19.1 kg of initial BW) were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 treatments (0, 10, 20, or 30% dry-rolled field pea, DM basis; 6 pens/treatment) where field pea replaced dry-rolled corn. In Exp. 1, field pea inclusion linearly decreased WBSF (P = 0.001) and linearly increased sensory taste panel tenderness (P = 0.002) and juiciness (P = 0.04) scores, whereas cook loss, flavor, and off-flavor scores were not affected by treatment (P ≥ 0.16). In Exp. 2, field pea inclusion did not affect WBSF, cook loss, or sensory taste panel scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor, or off-flavor (P ≥ 0.19); however, there was a tendency for a decrease in calpastatin activity (P = 0.10) and a tendency for an increase in troponin-T degradation (P = 0.08) with increasing dietary field pea inclusion. These results indicate that dietary field pea does not negatively affect beef palatability traits. Additional research should focus on understanding the potential mechanism by which field pea inclusion may influence beef tenderness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3acalpastatin 3acattle feeding 3acattle feeds 3acorn 3afeed concentrates 3afinishing 3aheifers 3ajuiciness 3ameat tenderness 3aoff flavors 3apalatability 3apeas 3asensory evaluation 3ashear stress 3asteers 3ataste 3atroponin T 3ayearlings1 aAnderson, V.L.1 aLarson, D.M.1 aIlse, B.R.1 aMaddock, R.J.1 aBauer, M.L.1 aLardy, G.P.0 tProfessional animal scientists.g2013 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.33-38dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56104x1080-74467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/S1080-7446(15)30192-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245011000177520154300287592002801830650000801858650001001866650001101876650001901887650002301906650001801929650001301947650001201960650001801972650001901990650000702009653002402016653001502040653002202055653002102077700002802098700003002126700003002156700002802186773009502214856008402309852000902393655001202402IND60675263820221118062250.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067526382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2019.1017172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbañez, Manuel Vicente12aA colourimetric method for the measuring of the mass transfer kinetics of carbon dioxide in aqueous media  aThe measurement of the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient of carbon dioxide in aqueous media is relevant in the field of phototrophic microorganism culture. Here, we present an approach that allowed the handling of a system composed of seven chemical reactions, in which the transfer process of CO₂ was one of them, pursuing the objective of quantifying the rate of dissolution of carbon dioxide in a designed liquid medium. A simple methodology, involving the use of an acid-base indicator, acting as a tracer, was successfully employed. It was established, that starting from a condition distant from its unique equilibrium, through the alteration of the initial pH value of a designed arbitrary state by adding onto it exact amounts of a strong base, the incorporation of CO₂, from an air current in contact with the perturbed liquid, occurred in order to restore a new balance. For each experience, achieved under the same operational conditions, it was possible to calculate nearly equal values of kinetic constants which holds information about the behaviour of the system. Collectively the results presented here suggest that this methodology could be adapted to several different systems, enlightening easier ways of incorporating the transfer kinetics of this major carbon source on the existing growth kinetic models of phototrophic microorganisms. At the same time, it highlights the fact that probably the rate-controlling step it is not the transfer reaction of CO₂ by itself, as the process of hydration of CO₂ is.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgae 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3aculture media 3akinetics 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amicroorganisms 3apH 0aAcid-base indicator 0aMicroalgae 0aReaction kinetics 0aPhotobioreactors1 aLeonardi, Rodrigo Jorge1 aMorelli, Matías Nicolás1 aIrazoqui, Horacio Antonio1 aHeinrich, Josué Miguel0 tAlgal research.g2020 Jan., v. 45 p.101717-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1017173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245008600211300001800297506007600315520104700391592002801438506003701466650003101503650002401534650001401558650001601572650001101588650002501599650002001624650001401644650003501658650001201693700002501705700001801730700002801748700002201776700002201798700002701820700001901847700002101866773007501887856008201962852000902044655001202053IND60551772720221207100932.0161019e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055177272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.0142doi7 aPMC48748682pmcid7 a271564522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoues, Olivia I.10aDistinct Gene Regulatory Pathways for Human Innate versus Adaptive Lymphoid Cells  ap. 1134-1146.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInnate lymphoid cells (ILCs) serve as sentinels in mucosal tissues, sensing release of soluble inflammatory mediators, rapidly communicating danger via cytokine secretion, and functioning as guardians of tissue homeostasis. Although ILCs have been extensively studied in model organisms, little is known about these “first responders” in humans, especially their lineage and functional kinships to cytokine-secreting T helper (Th) cell counterparts. Here, we report gene regulatory circuitries for four human ILC-Th counterparts derived from mucosal environments, revealing that each ILC subset diverges as a distinct lineage from Th and circulating natural killer cells but shares circuitry devoted to functional polarization with their Th counterparts. Super-enhancers demarcate cohorts of cell-identity genes in each lineage, uncovering new modes of regulation for signature cytokines, new molecules that likely impart important functions to ILCs, and potential mechanisms for autoimmune disease SNP associations within ILC-Th subsets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aautoimmune diseases 3acytokines 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3anatural killer cells 3aregulator genes 3asecretion 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atissues1 aCollins, Patrick L.1 aCella, Marina1 aRobinette, Michelle L.1 aPorter, Sofia I.1 aPyfrom, Sarah C.1 aPayton, Jacqueline E.1 aColonna, Marco1 aOltz, Eugene M.0 tCell.g2016 May 19, v. 165 p.1134-1146dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04974naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245012100220520299500341592002803336650001903364650002403383650001103407650001303418650002103431650001503452650001703467650001803484650002503502650003403527650003403561650002703595650001403622650001303636650001903649650000903668650001103677650001103688650001503699651001403714651001103728651001003739651001603749651001303765653001003778653002503788653002603813653002603839653002203865700006003887700001803947700003303965700001103998700002104009700002704030700002004057700001804077700001904095773010404114856008504218852000904303655001204312IND60769970120221118035311.0220606e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076997012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKifāyatullāh, K̲h̲ān,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8107-195910aFirst report of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in the Indus Drainage System: Occurrence, source and environmental risk  aPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are of global interest due to their persistence in the aquatic environment. This study assessed the occurrence of PFAAs in the Indus Drainage System and discerned their potential sources and environmental risks for the first time in Pakistan. 13 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) were analyzed to verify the dominant prevalence of short-chain PFAAs in the environment since the phase-out of long-chain perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). A significant variation (p ≤ 0.05) of individual PFAAs between the monitoring sites was confirmed by data normality tests Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk, suggesting that different locations contribute differently to individual PFAAs concentrations. ΣPFAAs concentrations in riverine water and sediments ranged from 2.28 to 221.75 ng/L and 0.78–29.19 ng/g dw, respectively. PFBA, PFPeA, and PFHxA were the most abundant PFAAs, and on average accounted for 14.64, 13.75, and 12.97 ng/L of ∑PFAAs in riverine water and 0.34, 0.64, and 0.79 ng/g dw of ∑PFAAs in sediments. ΣPFAAs mean contamination in the drainage was significantly (p < 0.05) high in River Chenab followed by River Indus > Soan > Ravi > Kabul > Swat with more prevalence of short-chain (C4–C7) PFCAs followed by PFOA, PFBS, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFUnDA, and PFDoDA. The correlation analysis determined the PFAAs' fate and distribution along the drainage, indicating that PFAAs with carbon chains C4–C12, except for PFSAs with carbon chains C6–C8, were most likely contaminated by the same source, the values of Kd and Koc increased linearly with the length of the perfluoroalkyl carbon chain, better understand the transport and partitioning of individual PFAAs between riverine water and sediments, where the HCA and PCA discerned industrial/municipal wastewater discharge, agricultural and surface runoff from nearby fields, and urban localities as potential sources of PFAAs contamination. The collective mass flux of short-chain (C4–C7) PFCAs was 5x higher than that of PFOS + PFOA, suggesting a continuous shift in the production and usage of fluorinated replacements for long-chain PFAAs with short-chain homologs. In terms of risk, individual PFAAs pollution in the drainage was within the world's risk thresholds for human health, with the exception of PFBA, PFPeA, PFHpA, PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, and PFBS, whereas for ecology, the concentrations of individual PFAAs did not exceed the ecological risk thresholds of the United States of America, Canada, European Union (EU), Italy, Australia, and New Zealand, with the exception of PFSAs, whose detected individual concentrations were significantly higher than the EU, Australian and New Zealander PFSAs guidelines of 0.002 μg/L, 0.00047 μg/L, 0.00065 μg/L, 0.00013 μg/L, and 0.00023 μg/L, respectively, which may pose chronic risks to the regional ecosystem and population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic environment 3acarbon 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3amass transfer 3amunicipal wastewater 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apollution 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3arivers 3arunoff 3asulfonates 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aItaly 3aNew Zealand 3aPakistan 0aPFAAs 0aSpatial distribution 0aIndus River watershed 0aSource identification 0aShort-chain PFCAs1 aYounas, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8988-90691 aZhou, Yunqiao1 aSharif, Hafiz Muhammad Adeel1 aLi, Xu1 aYaseen, Muhammad1 aIbrahim, Sobhy Mostafa1 aBaninla, Yvette1 aCao, Xianghui1 aLü, Yonglong,0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Aug., v. 211 p.113113-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012100169520111800290592002801408650001601436650001201452650001901464650001401483650001901497653002201516653001301538653004101551653002401592653003201616653002401648700005401672700005801726700001901784700005901803773010001862856008701962852000902049655001202058IND60683021120221118003207.0210506e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068302112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1262452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yixin10aInsight into the formation mechanism of lotus seed starch-lecithin complexes by dynamic high-pressure homogenization  aOur objective was to investigate the correlation between processing conditions and structural properties of lotus seed starch-lecithin complexes by dynamic high-pressure homogenization and explore the formation mechanism. The complexes formed with 5% lecithin at 90 MPa had the highest complex index among samples, thus protecting the integrity of the particles. The complexes inhibited the degradation of amylopectin and retrogradation of amylose, and displayed different V₆II-, V₆I- and A-type crystalline patterns. Additionally, the double helix structure was enhanced with increasing pressure, and the addition of lecithin contributed to the formation of single-helix amylose-lecithin complexes. These complexes prevented the single helix structure of starch to further form double helix structures, as demonstrated by visual correlation analysis. Moreover, a formation mechanism was established, and lotus seed starch-lecithin complexes with V₆I-type crystalline were formed under appropriate conditions, but a homogenization pressure either too low or too high was not conducive to complex formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3ahomogenization 3alecithins 3aretrogradation 0aLotus seed starch 0aLecithin 0aDynamic high-pressure homogenization 0aStructural property 0aVisual correlation analysis 0aFormation mechanism1 aGuo, Zebin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3003-44231 aZheng, Baodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3133-12191 aZeng, Shaoxiao1 aZeng, Hongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9426-81330 tFood chemistry.g2020 June 15, v. 315 p.126245-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1262453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010700206300001800313520171300331592002802044596007202072650002102144650004402165650002602209650002202235650003702257650001402294650002902308650001402337650002102351650001702372650001302389650001302402650001402415650001402429650002202443650003302465650001702498650002502515650001802540650002102558700002002579700001602599700001702615700001302632700001702645700001702662773011102679856008302790852000902873655001202882IND60645867120221118064912.0190824e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064586712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02492-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shengli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8977-022810aPreparation, characterization and antibacterial properties of cellulose membrane containing N-halamine  ap. 5621-5633.  aPolyethylenimine (PEI), a type of water-soluble chain polymer containing a great number of primary, secondary and tertiary amine groups in the molecule, was used as an N-halamine precursor. It was grafted onto dialdehyde cellulose membrane (DCM) followed by chlorination to prepare a novel N-halamine antibacterial cellulose membrane (Cl–PEI–DCM). The appropriate conditions affecting the aldehyde content of DCM and the active chlorine (Cl⁺) content of Cl–PEI–DCM were systematically studied at oxidation, grafting and chlorination stages, respectively. The structure and properties of the samples were investigated by SEM, ATR–FTIR, XRD, XPS, light transmittance measurements and tensile tests. The stability and rechargeability of the Cl–PEI–DCM were evaluated, and its antibacterial activity was tested against S. aureus and E. coli. Results showed that the Cl⁺ content of the chlorinated samples was strongly dependent on the aldehyde content of DCM and PEI concentration. Under the optimum testing condition, the Cl⁺ content of the Cl–PEI–DCM reached 1.30 wt%. The hydroxyl groups on the cellulose membrane were changed to aldehyde groups and the successful introduction of PEI and N–Cl bond were confirmed. The 1.30 wt% Cl–PEI–DCM exhibited high antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli, which can completely inactivate two bacterial pathogens within 5 min even after 15 days of storage. Moreover, the Cl–PEI–DCM membrane displayed good stability, rechargeability, transparency and high mechanical strength. These results demonstrated that the Cl–PEI–DCM can be considered as a visualized wound dressing material or antibacterial shoe insole.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016GZ0222cScience & Technology Pillar Program of Sichuan Province 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaldehydes 3aantibacterial properties 3acellulose 3achemical bonding 3achlorination 3achlorine 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apathogens 3apolyethyleneimine 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage time 3astrength (mechanics) 3atransmittance 3awater solubility1 aKai, Chengcheng1 aLiu, Bofang1 aZhang, Silue1 aWei, Wei1 aXu, Xiaoling1 aZhou, Zuowan0 tCellulose.g2019 June, v. 26, no. 9 p.5621-5633dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02492-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012200185300001600307520056900323592002800892650001700920650001300937650001600950650002200966650001500988650001601003651000901019653002101028653001901049653001401068653001501082700002201097700001701119700001801136773011101154856008601265852000901351655001201360IND60770485020221118035105.0220317e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077048502DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2022.20384362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoghmani Khouzani, Seyed Taha14aThe effect of policy incoherence on the emergence of groundwater-related subsidence phenomena: a case study from Iran  ap. 181-204.  aLand subsidence due to overexploitation of aquifers is often attributed to incoherent public policies. Taking the case of the Mahyar valley in Iran as an example, and based on a mixed-method research design, this study analyses the effects of policy incoherence on well use for agricultural irrigation and the resulting groundwater levels. Results show how an accumulation of policy incoherence over time results in an increased construction of wells, ultimately leading to a groundwater table drawdown, with a significant decrease of 7.61 m in the last 16 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3asubsidence 3awater table 3aIran 0aPolicy coherence 0aresource nexus 0aagri-food 0agovernance1 aKirschke, Sabrina1 aYousefi, Ali1 aLiedl, Rudolf0 tWater international.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 47, no. 2 p.181-204dRoutledgewJournal:J000000164x1941-17077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2022.20384363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04689naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245013800182506011100320506007600431520239700507592002802904506003702932650001502969650002002984650001603004650001503020650001603035650001303051650002103064650001303085650001303098650001303111650001003124650001403134650001603148650001503164650002403179650001303203650001803216650001303234650001003247651001003257653000903267653003003276653001103306653001303317653002203330653001603352700002303368700002303391700002103414700006203435700001803497700002303515700003103538700005903569700002203628700001903650700006603669700005803735773010403793856008503897852000903982655001203991IND60769970220221207102411.0220606e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076997022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Carrillo, Andrea10aExposure to non-persistent pesticides, BDNF, and behavioral function in adolescent males: Exploring a novel effect biomarker approach  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNumerous contemporary non-persistent pesticides may elicit neurodevelopmental impairments. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed as a novel effect biomarker of neurological function that could help to understand the biological responses of some environmental exposures. To investigate the relationship between exposure to various non-persistent pesticides, BDNF, and behavioral functioning among adolescents. The concentrations of organophosphate (OP) insecticide metabolites 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPy), malathion diacid (MDA), and diethyl thiophosphate (DETP); metabolites of pyrethroids 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (DCCA), the metabolite of insecticide carbaryl 1-naphthol (1-N), and the metabolite of ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate fungicides ethylene thiourea (ETU) were measured in spot urine samples, as well as serum BDNF protein levels and blood DNA methylation of Exon IV of BDNF gene in 15–17-year-old boys from the INMA-Granada cohort in Spain. Adolescents’ behavior was reported by parents using the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL/6–18). This study included 140 adolescents of whom 118 had data on BDNF gene DNA methylation. Multivariable linear regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) for mixture effects, and mediation models were fit. IMPy, MDA, DCCA, and ETU were detected in more than 70% of urine samples, DETP in 53%, and TCPy, 3-PBA, and 1-N in less than 50% of samples. Higher levels of IMPy, TCPy, and ETU were significantly associated with more behavioral problems as social, thought problems, and rule-breaking symptoms. IMPy, MDA, DETP, and 1-N were significantly associated with decreased serum BDNF levels, while MDA, 3-PBA, and ETU were associated with higher DNA methylation percentages at several CpGs. WQS models suggest a mixture effect on more behavioral problems and BDNF DNA methylation at several CpGs. A mediated effect of serum BDNF within IMPy-thought and IMPy-rule breaking associations was suggested. BDNF biomarkers measured at different levels of biological complexity provided novel information regarding the potential disruption of behavioral function due to contemporary pesticides, highlighting exposure to diazinon (IMPy) and the combined effect of IMPy, MDA, DCCA, and ETU. However, further research is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-naphthol 3aDNA methylation 3aadolescents 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarbaryl 3acarboxylic acids 3achildren 3adiazinon 3aethylene 3aexons 3amalathion 3ametabolites 3apyrethrins 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3athiophosphate 3athiourea 3aurine 3aSpain 0aBDNF 0aNon-persistent pesticides 0aHBM4EU 0aBehavior 0aEffect biomarkers 0aAdolescents1 aD'Cruz, Shereen C.1 aMustieles, Vicente1 aSuárez, Beatriz1 aSmagulova, Fátima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6883-19681 aDavid, Arthur1 aPeinado, Francisco1 aArtacho-Cordón, Francisco1 aLópez, Luis C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3355-02981 aArrebola, Juan P.1 aOlea, Nicolás1 aFernández, Mariana F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6417-89141 aFreire, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7370-18420 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Aug., v. 211 p.113115-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245015400174300001400328520115300342592002801495650002701523650002501550650001701575650001501592650001401607650002501621650002801646650001701674650001501691650001601706650002401722650002101746650001301767650002501780650001001805653004101815653002501856653002501881653002401906653002101930700002901951700002301980773009802003856008702101852000902188655001202197IND60591840220221120075128.0201125e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059184022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetnawa, Sunantha10aChanges on antioxidant activity of microwave-treated protein hydrolysates after simulated gastrointestinal digestion: Purification and identification  ap. 36-46.  aTwo samples of trout frame protein hydrolysates were prepared by Microwave Pretreatment followed by Conventional Enzymatic hydrolysis (MPCE) and Non-Pretreated followed by Microwave-assisted Enzymatic hydrolysis (NPME), respectively, were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Changes on degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant activity, molecular weight, and amino acid composition between undigested and after gastrointestinal digestion of peptides were investigated. Comparing to undigested peptides, a breakdown of MPCE and NPME into smaller molecules was observed. Degree of hydrolysis, ABTS⁺ radical scavenging activity and reducing power increased (P < 0.05) for both samples after gastrointestinal digestion. A purified peptide from GI-MPCE had two possible sequences, NGRLGYSEGVM or GNRLGYSWDD (1182.65 Da). Whereas GI-NPME had two peptides IRGPEEHMHR or RVAPEEHMHR (1261.77 Da) and SAGVPRHK or SARPRHK (962.63 Da). These results indicate that digested hydrolysates can be a rich source of antioxidants.

HydG generates the first organometallic intermediates in this process, ultimately producing an [Fe(CO)₂(CN)] complex. A limitation in understanding the mechanism by which this complex forms has been uncertainty regarding the precise metallocluster composition of HydG that comprises active enzyme. We herein show that the HydG auxiliary cluster must bind both l-cysteine and a dangler Fe in order to generate the [Fe(CO)₂(CN)] product.

Making wood conductive electrically and thermally is technically a new challenge to think outside the box. Here, we demonstrate that wood can be electrically and thermally conductive by dipping wood in the solution where multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is dispersed evenly. Our idea is based on the fact that wood usually absorbs water or moisture due to its hygroscopic properties. When walnut wood was dipped in the MWCNT solution, the wood started to absorb water containing MWCNT. As a result, well-networked MWCNTs were homogeneously formed in the structure of wood with natural porosity. Interestingly, superior electrical and thermal conductivity were observed along the cellulose fiber direction of the walnut wood, compared with the tangential direction perpendicular to the fiber. We found that wood has electrically and thermally anisotropic characteristics due to the grain boundary by wood fibers. Furthermore, the degree of conductivity was controllable by varying dipping times. We think that this discovery will open a new avenue to utilize wood as a nanocomposite material having electrical and thermal properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3adipping 3ahygroscopicity 3ananocomposites 3aporosity 3athermal conductivity 3awalnuts 3awood 3awood fibers1 aNa, In-Yeob1 aJang, Ho-Kyun1 aKim, Hong-dae,1 aKim, Gyu Tae0 tCellulose.g2019 June, v. 26, no. 9 p.5719-5730dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02485-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002500147245005600172300001400228520142700242592002801669650001801697650002201715650002201737650001001759650001201769650001401781650002101795650002601816650001401842650001901856650001301875650001101888650001001899650000901909650001501918650001601933651002101949651001801970700001901988700002702007773008802034856008302122852000902205655001202214IND4472958920221119234649.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447295892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2012.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuğrul, Koç Mehmet10aDetermination of soil loss by sugar beet harvesting  ap. 71-77.  aThe amount of soil delivered to sugar factories is an important problem in terms of agriculture, environment and cost. Transported soil from the field after the harvesting of taproot and tuberous root plants, such as sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), potato (Solanum tuberosum) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), has become the subject of erosion studies in recent years. The objective of this study is to estimate soil loss to crop harvesting (SLCH) in all beet growing areas in Turkey. The high amount of soil transported not only causes land degradation but also increases the cost of handling and, consequently, white sugar prices. At the same time, the adhering soil is rich in both organic matter content and major plant nutrients. In this study, a new approach is developed to determine the amount of soil transported from field to factory or beet receiving centers, and the parameters determining SLCH, mainly in sugar beet harvesting, are evaluated. Furthermore, the evaluation of soil loss due to beet harvesting by either the joint or separate application of mechanized and traditional harvesting techniques is explained. According to this approach, the amount of soil transported from the field is calculated to be 3.86Mgha⁻¹ from approximately 300,000ha of sugar beet growing area in Turkey. The annual cost of transporting the soil from field to beet reception centers is estimated to be 10 million US dollars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aCichorium intybus 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abeets 3achicory 3afactories 3aland degradation 3amechanical harvesting 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apotatoes 3aprices 3aroots 3asoil 3asugar beet 3awhite sugar 3aTurkey (country) 3aUnited States1 aİçöz, Erkan1 aPerendeci, N.

In Exp. 1 beef heifers (n = 319) received 1) GnRH and CIDR on d 0, GnRH on d 9, and 50 mg of PG on d 14 at CIDR removal (14-d GnRH-9); 2) 14-d GnRH-9 but with PG versus GnRH on d 0 (14-d PG GnRH-9); or 3) GnRH and CIDR on d 9 and 25 mg of PG at CIDR removal on d 14 (5-d CO-Synch+CIDR). Heifers (n = 452) in Exp. 2 received 1) 14-d GnRH-9, 2) 14-d GnRH-9 with GnRH on d 7 versus 9 and 25 versus 50 mg of PG on d 14 (14-d GnRH-7), or 3) GnRH and CIDR on d 7 and 25 mg of PG at CIDR removal on d 14 (7-d CO-Synch+CIDR). All heifers received GnRH at TAI. Pregnancy rate was not different (P ≥ 0.66) among treatments in either experiment. In Exp. 1, heifers in d 6 to 10 of the estrous cycle at protocol initiation had a greater (P < 0.05) TAI pregnancy rate than did heifers in d 11 to 16 and d 17 to 21 but did not differ (P > 0.10) from d 0 to 5.

However, most of the existing relevant studies focused on the adverse ecological effect of BUVSs under their single exposure, information about the bioconcentration potential of BUVSs and their joint exposure with heavy metals remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the bioconcentration kinetics of 6 frequently reported BUVSs in four main tissues of common carp under different Cu concentration. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and half-lives (t₁/₂) in the fish tissues ranged from 5.73 (UV-PS in kidney) to 1076 (UV-327 in liver), and 2.19 (UV-PS in kidney) to 31.5 (UV-320 in liver) days, respectively. Under the effect of Cu, an increase in BCF values was observed, which is mainly due to the decreased depuration rate (k₂). These results indicated that BUVSs accumulated in fish and that Cu can affect the bioconcentration of BUVSs. This study provides important insight into the co-exposure of heavy metal and BUVSs, contributing to the perfection of BUVSs risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acopper 3adepuration 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3ahalf life 3aheavy metals 3akidneys 3aliver 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3atriazoles 0aBUVSs 0aCommon carp 0aBioconcentration 0aTissue distribution 0aCopper 0aCo-exposure1 aBekele, Tadiyose Girma1 aZhao, Hongxia0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Aug., v. 211 p.113121-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016800165300001600333520070000349536010801049592002801157596001601185650002001201650001201221650001001233650002101243650001501264651001901279653003101298653001801329653003601347653002201383653002501405700002101430700001801451700001901469700002201488700001601510700001601526700001801542700001801560773011101578856008601689852000901775655001201784IND60770485320221118035201.0220317e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077048532DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2022.20412812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuay, Ray10aEvaluating the effectiveness of land and water integrative practices for achieving water sustainability within the Colorado River Basin: perceptions and indicators  ap. 257-277.  aPrinciple 12 of the OECD Principles on Water Governance calls for the evaluation of sustainable water policies, which to be effective must be salient, credible and legitimate.

Education about proper foot care can help prevent serious diabetic foot complications and assist in early detection of problems. The purpose of this project was to develop, formatively evaluate, and pilot test a self-care, take-home program for the prevention of foot problems in African Americans with diabetes. The program included a brief one-on-one orientation session and a take-home foot self-care packet. Through telephone follow-up subjects reported the following: good to excellent overall rating of the program, favorable reactions to the patient instruction booklet, an overwhelming positive response to the large hand mirror, and a positive effect on their daily foot-care practices. The Afrocentricity of the patient education materials was preferred by younger subjects; older subjects found this approach too restrictive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aamputation 3adiabetic foot 3aeducational materials 3apatient education 3apatients 3atelephones1 aWalker, Elizabeth A.,1 aBASCH, CHARLES E.0 tDiabetes educator.g1997 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.48-51dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721797023001053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245013400178520104300312592002801355650002301383650001301406650001401419650001701433650001801450650002401468650001301492650001401505650001801519650001901537650001001556650001901566650001901585650002001604650002201624650001501646650002401661650001601685653002601701653002601727653003501753700002801788700003201816700002301848700003301871700003301904700002501937773010901962856008302071852000902154655001202163IND60675264520221118062427.0200128e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067526452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1004262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro Bruni, Graziella10aElectrospun β-carotene–loaded SPI:PVA fiber mats produced by emulsion-electrospinning as bioactive coatings for food packaging  aIn this work, emulsion electrospinning was used to develop an active internal coating for food packaging applications. Specifically, the antioxidant molecule β-carotene, was encapsulated in a mixture of soy protein isolate (SPI) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) which was directly electrospun onto a polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHB92/PHV8) film. An annealing treatment was applied to improve the adhesion of the electrospun mat onto the packaging film, which contributed to modulate the release of the active compound. Stable SPI:PVA emulsions (with a 50:50 ratio) were developed using soybean oil (SBO) as carrier of the hydrophobic β-carotene. The encapsulation efficiency of β-carotene in the electrospun SPI:PVA fibers was 65.0 % ± 2.6 %, being 51.4 % ± 0.9 % effectively incorporated into their cores. Finally, the in-vitro release assay of the antioxidant in soybean oil, which simulates fatty foods, demonstrated that the heat treatment (anneling) contributed to a slower and more sustained released of the bioactive compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadhesion 3aannealing 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3acoatings 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afood packaging 3afoods 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3apackaging films 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ashelf life 3asoy protein isolate 3asoybean oil 0aActive food packaging 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aElectrohydrodynamic processing1 ade Oliveira, Jean Paulo1 aGómez-Mascaraque, Laura G.1 aFabra, Maria José1 aGuimarães Martins, Vilásia1 aZavareze, Elessandra da Rosa1 aLópez-Rubio, Amparo0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2020 Mar., v. 23 p.100426-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.1004263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001600248520067600264592002800940650001500968650001100983650001500994650001001009650002101019650002001040653003101060653002401091653004001115653004501155653001001200700002301210773011101233856008601344852000901430655001201439IND60770485520221118035122.0220317e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077048552DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2022.20421122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZentai, Fanni10aTracking water governance impacts: an example from the Kenyan water sector  ap. 321-333.  aIn 2015, the Kenyan Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) introduced a corporate governance indicator for the Kenyan water sector to measure the extent to which water service providers contribute to enhanced sector performance and the realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation.

Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology were used to obtain the maximum extractability of β-glucan. Inoculum volume, fermentation temperature, and time were evaluated as three variables. Under optimal fermentation conditions, the extractability of β-glucan in oat bran increased to 45.57 ± 1.82% and 51.10 ± 2.32% by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae, respectively. The extractability was about 3-fold of that before fermentation (16.86 ± 0.76%). Fermentation of oat bran by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae reduced the molecular weight of the extracted β-glucan from 6.74 × 10⁵ to 2.84 × 10⁵ and 2.20 × 10⁵ Da, respectively. Correspondingly, the apparent viscosity of the extracted β-glucan decreased after fermentation. But the increased extractability compensated for the reduced molecular weight in the formation of viscous solution. The molecular structure and cellotriosyl/cellotetraosyl ratio were not affected by filamentous fungi fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aRhizopus oryzae 3abeta-glucans 3achemical structure 3aexperimental design 3afermentation 3afungi 3ainoculum 3amolecular weight 3aoat bran 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aβ-Glucan 0aFilamentous fungi 0aFermentation 0aExtractability 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aJin, Shanshan1 aWu, Shanshan1 aChen, Yifan1 aChen, Ruiwei0 tFood chemistry.g2018 July 15, v. 254 p.122-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245008800216520148000304592002801784650002901812650001301841650002701854650001301881650001701894650002301911650001801934650001401952650002201966650001701988650001402005650001202019650001702031653002902048653001602077653001702093653001402110653002702124653002602151700002702177700003002204700007002234700006402304700002702368700003202395700003602427773012002463856008602583852000902669655001202678IND60769970620221118035014.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076997062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1082452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalamás-Lara, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0982-224110aAcanthamoeba castellanii: Effect of neuroactive substances on trophozoite migration  aAcanthamoeba castellanii is the etiological agent of granulomatous amebic encephalitis, amebic keratitis, and skin lesions. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that Acanthamoeba trophozoites induce contact-dependent, and contact-independent pathogenic mechanisms. We have explored the potential role neuroactive substances may have in the migration of Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites using Transwell permeable supports in the presence of physiological concentrations of dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, or taurine diluted in PBS. Quantitation of migrated amoebae was carried out in scanning electron micrographs of the upper and under compartments sides of the chamber membranes. Our results showed that at 2 h of interaction, a statistically significant larger proportion of A. castellanii trophozoites migrated through the chamber membranes when neurotransmitters were placed in the lower compartments of the chambers compared to control. This migration effect was more evident under the presence of glutamate and taurine on the three surfaces (upper/lower membrane and bottom compartment) when the percentage of migrated trophozoites was analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy of trophozoites revealed that glutamate and taurine induced the formation of large adhesion lamellas and phagocytic stomas. These observations suggest that certain neuroactive substances could stimulate the migration of A. castellanii trophozoites in the central nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aadhesion 3acentral nervous system 3adopamine 3aencephalitis 3aetiological agents 3aglutamic acid 3akeratitis 3aneurotransmitters 3aparasitology 3aserotonin 3ataurine 3atrophozoites 0aAcanthamoeba castellanii 0aEndocytosis 0aLamellipodia 0aMigration 0aNeuroactive substances 0aPathogenic mechanisms1 aLagunes-Guillén, Anel1 aChávez-Munguía, Bibiana1 aSalazar-Villatoro, Lizbeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4172-71531 aAcosta-Virgen, Karla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0813-17451 aOmaña-Molina, Maritza1 aEspinosa-Cantellano, Martha1 aMartínez-Palomo, A.q(Adolfo),0 tExperimental parasitology.g2022 May,  June, v. 236-237 p.108245-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1082453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013200165300001600297520069600313536012701009592002801136650001701164650001501181650002201196650001701218650001001235650002101245651001201266653002301278653002301301653004001324653001701364700002201381700001901403700002701422700002601449700001901475700003101494773011101525856008601636852000901722655001201731IND60770485620221118035117.0220317e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077048562DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2022.20430152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuu, Tang10aMismatches between policy planning and implementation on the actively living with flood approach in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta  ap. 297-320.  aBased on a qualitative case study in An Giang province, Vietnam, we mapped the understanding of the ‘Living with Floods’ (LWF) concept and the implementation of three projects to explain the effectiveness of water governance in Vietnam.

Diverging perceptions undermine the effectiveness of water governance. A framework and a list of indicators are proposed to measure the effectiveness of floodwater governance.

Investigating the social behavior of subterranean termites is a challenge due to the cryptic nature and large colony size. Planar arenas are commonly used to study these termites under laboratory conditions, and have provided several advantages. However, there is no means to designate areas such as a royal chamber or central nest from foraging sites because reproductives can move freely across arenas. In this study, we examined the minimum passing size of different castes of Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), in order to develop a reproductive excluder and correlated minimum passing size with head widths and heights. We found that workers and soldiers of C. formosanus were able to pass through a gap greater than or equal to 0.7 mm. Our results showed that there are significant differences in the head width and height based on castes and head height was more critical than head width to determine passing size.

Confining reproductives using the excluder in laboratory experiments will provide more chances to study the royal chamber and central nest independently of foraging sites.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlattodea 3aCoptotermes formosanus 3aentomology 3ahead 3alabor 3anests 3areproductives 3asocial behavior 3asocial insects 0aqueen excluder 0asocial insect 0abarrier 0aphysical exclusion1 aChouvenc, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3154-24891 aSu, Nan-Yao0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 July 26, v. 112, no. 6 p.2882-2887dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz2113Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245010500158300001800263520107300281592002801354650001101382650000901393650002401402650001801426650001401444650001301458650001101471700001601482700001601498700001301514700001301527700001401540700001601554700001501570773013101585856007801716852000901794655001201803IND60548756820221122045044.0160905e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054875682DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b127152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhanxi10aSynthesis of 4H/fcc Noble Multimetallic Nanoribbons for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 1414-1419.  aNoble multimetallic nanomaterials, if only consisting of Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd, typically adopt the high-symmetry face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. Here for the first time, by using the 4H/fcc Au@Ag nanoribbons (NRBs) as seeds, we report the synthesis of 4H/fcc trimetallic Au@PdAg core–shell NRBs via the galvanic reaction method under ambient conditions. Moreover, this strategy can also be used to synthesize 4H/fcc trimetallic Au@PtAg and quatermetallic Au@PtPdAg core–shell NRBs. Impressively, for the first time, these alloy shells, i.e., PdAg, PtAg, and PtPdAg, epitaxially grown on the 4H/fcc Au core with novel 4H hexagonal phase were successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the obtained 4H/fcc Au@PdAg NRBs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is even quite close to that of the commercial Pt black. We believe that our findings here may provide a novel strategy for the crystal-structure-controlled synthesis of advanced functional noble multimetallic nanomaterials with various promising applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3ananomaterials 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3asilver1 aLuo, Zhimin1 aHuang, Xiao1 aLi, Bing1 aChen, Ye1 aWang, Jie1 aHu, Yanling1 aZhang, Hua0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 138, no. 4 p.1414-1419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b127153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008500165520087300250592002801123650001401151650001501165650001401180650002301194650001701217650001401234653002501248653001501273653002101288700001801309700005701327700001501384700001401399700001401413700001701427773009201444856008601536852000901622655001201631IND60762226020221119115448.0220124e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076222602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1231982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Qian10aBiosensors for Caspase-3: From chemical methodologies to biomedical applications  aCaspase-3 plays irreplaceable roles in apoptosis and related diseases.

Only body lice, however, are vectors of the infectious Gram‐negative bacterium Bartonella quintana. Because of their near identical genomes, yet differential vector competence, head and body lice provide a unique model system to study the gain or loss of vector competence. Using our in vitro louse‐rearing system, we infected head and body lice with blood containing B. quintana in order to detect both differences in the proliferation of B. quintana and transcriptional differences of immune‐related genes in the lice. B. quintana proliferated rapidly in body lice at 6 days post‐infection, but plateaued in head lice at 4 days post‐infection. RNAseq and quantitative real‐time PCR validation analyses determined gene expression differences. Eight immunoresponse genes were observed to be significantly different with many associated with the Toll pathway: Fibrinogen‐like protein, Spaetzle, Defensin 1, Serpin, Scavenger receptor A and Apolipoporhrin 2. Our findings support the hypothesis that body lice, unlike head lice, fight infection from B. quintana only at the later stages of its proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBartonella quintana 3aPediculus humanus capitis 3abacteria 3ablood 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alice 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3avector competence1 aOlds, B.

The high cost of in vitro-plants and the absence of specialized nurseries were among the reasons for the rise of heterogeneity and spread of diseases. The aim was to help farmers to improve artichoke yield and quality by ameliorating their vegetative propagation technique with low cost methods. Three plant cuttings management methods were tested: summer ovoli (T0); spring offshoots nursery’s cuttings forced to pass a vegetative rest period by stopping irrigation (T1); and offshoots nursery’s cuttings not forced (T2). The cuttings management can affect both yield and qualitative traits of artichoke. T1 nursery plants produced the heaviest primary heads, 7% and 23% higher than T2 and T0, respectively. T1 plants exhibited the highest yield during the harvest season, with +17.7% and +12.2% compared to T0 and T2, respectively. T0 and T1 showed the highest total antioxidant capacity and inulin content; the propagation method also affected the short-chain sugars ratio. T1 is a viable and sustainable alternative to the traditional one that does not heavily impact on growing costs and improves yield and quality of artichoke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadventitious shoots 3aantioxidant activity 3aartichokes 3abuds 3acrop yield 3adeveloping countries 3adisease transmission 3afarmers 3aharvest date 3ainulin 3airrigation 3anursery crops 3aplant cuttings 3aspring 3asugars 3asummer 3avegetative propagation 3aTunisia1 aNicoletto, Carlo1 aBouzaein, Ghaith1 aSambo, Paolo1 aKhalfallah, Karima Kouki0 tAgronomy.g2017 Sept. 24, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy70400653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01127naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245005400171300001600225520031000241592002800551650001500579650001100594650001400605650002000619650001000639700002300649773007400672856008200746852000900828655001200837IND60551773420221118033558.0161019e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055177342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasiri, Marcus L.10aMultimodal Signal Integration for Feeding Control  ap. 522-523.  aFeeding is arguably one of the most well-conserved and important adaptive behaviors across all species.

The measurement of soil ρₛ is labor intensive and time-consuming. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed for estimating ρₛ from readily available soil properties during the past decades. Existing PTFs are developed mainly based on soil datasets covering wide ranges of soil organic matter (SOM) contents. For soils from subtropical regions with low SOM values the accuracy of previous PTFs remains unknown. In this study we evaluated the performance of existing ρₛ PTFs by comparing model estimates to measurements of 175 soils from a subtropical region in China. The investigated soils had relatively low SOM contents (mostly<0.02 g g⁻¹) and covered texture ranges from coarse sand to clayey soils. The Adams-based PTFs performed poorly, while the modified Adams PTFs and several simple linear or multiple regression PTFs produced relatively accurate ρₛ estimates for the 175 soils with root mean square errors (RMSEs) around 0.05 g cm⁻³ and mean biases within ± 0.03 g cm⁻³. Further multiple regressions indicated that the ρₛ of subtropical soils was simply a negative linear function of clay content. Despite conflicting several early reports, an independent dataset showed that the proposed linear model provided accurate ρₛ estimates for soils with low SOM contents from subtropical regions with a RMSE of 0.030 g cm⁻³ and mean bias of −0.013 g cm⁻³.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3adata collection 3alabor 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3asand 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pore system 3asubtropics 3atexture 3aChina 0aSoil particle density 0aPedotransfer functions 0aOrganic matter content 0aSoil texture1 aLin, Lirong1 aDing, Shuwen1 aYi, Ceng1 aChen, Jiazhou1 aTian, Zhengchao0 tGeoderma.g2022 June 15, v. 416 p.115812-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245010800156300001800264520106100282592002801343650002901371650001901400650001701419650001901436650001501455700001901470700001601489700001201505700001801517700001801535700001601553773013101569856007801700852000901778655001201787IND60548756920221122055403.0160905e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054875692DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b127272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Suli10aElectrochemiluminescence Tuned by Electron–Hole Recombination from Symmetry-Breaking in Wurtzite ZnSe  ap. 1154-1157.  aThe research of highly active electrochemiluminescence (ECL) materials with low toxicity and good solubility remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we present a synthesis method to prepare soluble wurtzite (WZ) ZnSe nanocrystals (NCs), which exhibit good ECL properties. Using high-angle annular-dark-field imaging together with electron hologram methods, we observe that the WZ ZnSe NCs exhibit an unusual symmetry-breaking phenomenon, where the translational symmetry of the polarized Zn–Se bond is broken. The formation of a symmetry-breaking region leads to an accumulation of charge. The good ECL response originates from the increased efficiency of electron–hole recombination by the excess charge redistribution in WZ ZnSe NCs. This study of the relationship between ECL behavior and the architecture of NCs suggests that careful control over the NC structures of semiconductors can tailor their charge distribution via symmetry breaking, which opens new avenues for the design of novel classes of agents for optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aimage analysis 3ananocrystals 3asemiconductors 3asolubility1 aZhang, Qinghua1 aZhang, Long1 aGu, Lin1 aZou, Guizheng1 aBao, Jianchun1 aDai, Zhihui0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 138, no. 4 p.1154-1157dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b127273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01079naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245003500171300001600206520027300222592002800495650001800523650001300541650002100554650001300575650001100588700002500599773007400624856008200698852000900780655001200789IND60551773520221118033643.0161019e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055177352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyne, Michael J.12aA New Pillar in Pilus Assembly  ap. 520-521.  aPilus assembly in bacteria typically occurs by one of four pathways.

Willd  aSaraca asoca (Roxb.) Willd. is an important tropical medicinal and ornamental species which has been threatened due to over-exploitation. Developmental changes, germination, and longevity of seeds were studied to ensure better collection, germination and storage of seeds to assist propagation of this species. Seeds were harvested at different developmental stages and fresh and dry mass, moisture content, germination and desiccation tolerance were evaluated to determine the best collection time. Fresh seeds were allowed to germinate at 15–55 °C to find out the optimum temperature for their germination. Seeds were stored to evaluate their longevity at different conditions. During maturation, dry weight of seed reached the maximum at 89 days after anthesis (DAA) after that no change in dry weight was observed till its shedding at 112 DAA. The seeds achieved mass maturity at 89 DAA following a short maturation drying phase. All seeds germinated at 79 DAA when about 64% dry weight was accumulated in seed. They were desiccation sensitive at all stages of maturity, but maximum drying tolerance was achieved 105 DAA onwards. The seeds showed no dormancy. It could germinate at 15–50 °C, and completed germination within 25 days at 30–50 °C. The time required to complete germination increased, if the seeds germinated below 30 °C. Not only temperature, maturity level, and seed moisture content also affected germination period. Storage trials indicated that longevity of seeds could be extended for 4 years at 15 °C, if stored at shedding moisture content. Partially dried mature seeds and immature brownish white seeds collected at 105 DAA also retained viability at 15 °C for 3 years. So, collection can be made a few days before dispersal (105–112 DAA) without much harm to the seed quality. The seeds at this stage of maturity turn brownish white color, a visual indicator of seed collection time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaraca asoca 3acolor 3adrought tolerance 3adrying 3aflowering 3alongevity 3aseed collecting 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseed moisture 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3atemperature 3aviability 3awater content 0aSaraca asoca 0aTropical medicinal plant 0aRecalcitrant seed 0aMaturation 0aGermination 0aStorage1 aTiwari, Shweta1 aHaldkar, Manisha0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2020 Mar., v. 16 p.100231-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2019.1002313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03924naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170520261900290592002802909650000902937650001802946650000902964650001602973650001902989650001603008650001903024650001303043650002003056650002103076650001903097650002203116651001103138653002103149653002203170653001603192653002603208700002103234700001603255700001503271773009603286856008703382852000903469655001203478IND60769970920221118035013.0220906e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076997092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Dor, Eyal10aAggregate size distribution of arid and semiarid laboratory soils (<2 mm) as predicted by VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy  aSoil aggregation is an important property, affecting issues such as soil structure and dust load. To investigate the potential to evaluate soil aggregation status via proximal sensing, we conducted a comprehensive study using the legacy soil spectral library (SSL) of Israel representing arid and semiarid environments. The SSL was segregated into six soil aggregate size fractions as follows: 2–1.4 mm, F1; 1.4–1.0 mm, F2; 1.0–0.5 mm, F3; 0.5–0.25 mm, F4; 0.25–0.1 mm, F5; <0.1 mm, F6; and the average aggregate size (AVG, in mm) was calculated. In addition, another 74 soil attributes were measured along with their sample reflectance spectra across the 0.4–2.5-μm spectral region. A comprehensive correlation matrix between all soil attributes enabled isolating four cementing agents (CAs) that bind the primary particles into aggregates: clay content, clay mineral (smectite), organic matter and free iron oxide content. Generating pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with these CAs revealed equations that fairly predicted the aggregate size fractions F1 (R² = 0.68), F2 (R² = 0.79), F3 (R² = 0.67), F5 (R² = 0.61) and AVG (R² = 0.78) with high accuracy. The six aggregate size fractions and AVG were divided into three groups based on their relation to the CAs: group A (F1, F2, F3, AVG) presenting positive correlations with the CAs, group B (F4, F6) presenting poor relationships with the CAs, and group C (F5) presenting negative correlations with the CAs. As the CAs were found to be chromophoric substances, it was possible to predict each CA from spectral-based models. A separate spectral-based analysis was also performed to evaluate the aggregate size fractions directly with no a priori information or PTF adoption. This analysis revealed high statistical agreement with spectral assignments for the four selected CAs. Whereas groups A and C were successfully predicted in the validation stage spectral-based models (F1 [R² = 0.68], F2 [R² = 0.79], F3 [R² = 0.7], F5 [R² = 0.57] and AVG [R² = 0.67]), the predictions of group B were poorer relationships against the selected CAs that present important spectral assignments. We concluded that soil aggregation stage can be assessed directly or indirectly (via PTF) using spectral analysis and a data-mining approach. Assuming that the reflectance information from hyperspectral remote-sensing means, such as EMIT (NASA initiative), will soon be available from orbit (2022), this approach may pave the way for monitoring soil aggregation status from afar, to determine the soil's potential as a dust source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3adust 3airon oxides 3aorganic matter 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asmectite 3asoil aggregates 3asoil aggregation 3asoil structure 3aspectral analysis 3aIsrael 0aSoil aggregation 0aSoil spectroscopy 0aDust source 0aPedotransfer function1 aFrancos, Nicolas1 aOgen, Yaron1 aBanin, A.,0 tGeoderma.g2022 June 15, v. 416 p.115819-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1158193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012800166300001600294520113600310592002801446650002101474650002801495650001901523650001201542650001101554650001301565650001201578650001401590650001401604650001501618650002101633650001101654650000701665650002601672650001401698650001101712650001101723650001601734650001601750650001101766650000901777653001501786653001901801653002101820700001901841700002101860700001601881700001801897700001901915700001301934700001801947700001901965700001801984773011602002856008602118852000902204655001202213IND60560326520221118231746.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056032652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Chang12aA novel alkaline surfactant-stable keratinase with superior feather-degrading potential based on library screening strategy  ap. 404-411.  aA novel keratinase was mined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) via function-driven screening with fosmid library. The catalytic properties of purified keratinase were investigated in detail following enzyme purification. The recombinant keratinase was purified to homogeneity with an estimated molecular weight of 26kDa using nickel affinity chromatography, of which the optimal reaction pH and temperature were 10.0 and 55°C, respectively. It could remain stable at pH 5.0–12.0 and 40–60°C. Metal ions such as Ca2+, Mn2+, Ag+, Na+, Mg2+, Li+, Sn2+ (1mM) displayed positive influence on keratinase, and particularly, Ca2+ exhibited remarkable improvement effect by 2.6 folds. It was strongly inhibited by PMSF as a protease inhibitor. On the contrary, it could be obviously activated by various surfactants, such as Tween 40 and Triton X-114. The recombinant keratinase showed high specificity towards casein, soluble keratin, BSA, and wool. The keratinase could efficiently degrade the feathers, which demonstrated its applicable potential for biodegradation of keratin wastes and regeneration of soluble protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3abiodegradation 3acalcium 3acasein 3afeathers 3akeratin 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apH 3aproteinase inhibitors 3ascreening 3asilver 3asodium 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3awastes 3awool 0aKeratinase 0aFosmid library 0aCharacterization1 aGong, Jin-Song1 aZhang, Rong-Xian1 aTao, Li-Yan1 aDou, Wen-Fang1 aZhang, Dan-Dan1 aLi, Heng1 aLu, Zhen-Ming1 aXu, Zheng-Hong1 aShi, Jin-Song0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Feb., v. 95 p.404-411dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008000166300001600246520162300262592002801885650001601913650001301929650002701942650003501969650001702004650001202021650001702033700002502050700002502075700001902100700001902119700002102138773010402159856004802263852000902311655001202320IND50062228720221119140546.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0958-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Corrado12aA Review on Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability by Means of RFID Technology  ap. 353-366.  aRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology which provides appealing opportunities to improve the management of information flow within the supply chain and security in the agri-food sector. Nowadays, food safety is considered a major requirement in several countries, in particular, the traceability of food products which is mandatory by law. Thus, technological implementation leading to traceability strengthening in the agri-food sector is crucial. The first aim of this review is to analyze the current developments in RFID technology in the agri-food sector, through an operative framework which organizes the literature and facilitate a quick content analysis identifying future research direction. RFID technology seems to be able to bring great opportunities to this sector; nevertheless, several constraints are slowing its adoption. This survey may provide readers with an exhaustive overview of opportunities and constraints for the wide adoption of RFID. The second aim of this review is to provide an updated analysis on the current developments of RFID technology for different product typologies within the agri-food industry, discussing at the same time its potential in technological and logistical development regarding different sectors of the production/distribution chain. As referenced here, RFID implementations in the agri-food sector are increasing at a fast rate, and technological advancement follows the applicability opportunities. However, real applications of RFID technologies are still limited because of various technical and economical obstacles which are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood safety 3aindustry 3ainformation management 3aradio frequency identification 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3atraceability1 aAntonucci, Francesca1 aPallottino, Federico1 aAguzzi, Jacopo1 aSarriá, David1 aMenesatti, Paolo0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Feb., v. 6, no. 2 p.353-366dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0958-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245008400175520126000259592002801519650001301547650001301560650001101573650000901584650001101593650001001604650001201614650001601626650001901642650001001661650002201671650002101693650002001714650001301734650002501747650002101772651001001793700002201803773012101825856007901946961001302025852000902038655001202047IND60646913220221119085522.0190614e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064691322DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy70400682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Shaughnessy, Susan A.10aPerformance of Precision Mobile Drip Irrigation in the Texas High Plains Region  aMobile drip irrigation (MDI) technology adapts driplines to the drop hoses of moving sprinkler systems to apply water as the drip lines are pulled across the field. There is interest in this technology among farmers in the Texas High Plains region to help sustain irrigated agriculture. However, information on the performance of this system and its benefits relative to common sprinkler application technologies in the region are limited. A two-year study was conducted in 2015 and 2016 to compare grain yields, crop water use (ET<inf>c</inf>) and water use efficiency (WUE) of corn (Zea Mays L.) irrigated with MDI, low elevation spray application (LESA) and low energy precision application (LEPA) methods. Irrigation amounts for each application method were based on weekly neutron probe readings. In both years, grain yield and yield components were similar among application treatment methods. Although WUE was similar for the MDI treatment plots compared with LEPA and LESA during the wet growing season (2015), MDI demonstrated improved WUE during the drier year of 2016. Additional studies using crops with less than full canopy cover at maturity (sorghum and cotton) are needed to document the performance of MDI in the Texas High Plains region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3acorn 3acotton 3acrops 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3ahoses 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3amicroirrigation 3aneutrons 3awater use efficiency 3ayield components 3aTexas1 aColaizzi, Paul D.0 tAgronomy.g2017 Oct. 20, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy70400683Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167300001800240520157300258592002801831650002501859650001701884650002501901650001401926650003601940650003801976650001502014650001002029650002202039650003802061650002202099650001502121650001402136650001902150650002002169650001402189650001102203650002602214650004002240700001602280700001702296700001302313700001602326700001602342700001502358700001302373700001302386700001702399700005302416773012802469856008402597852000902681655001202690IND60684310120221120151010.0200218e20200125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068431012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b048712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Chuanfei10aAnalytical Similarity of a Proposed Biosimilar BVZ-BC to Bevacizumab  ap. 3161-3170.  aBVZ-BC (bevacizumab-biosimilar candidate) is a proposed biosimilar to bevacizumab. Bevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) type A and prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, neutralizing angiogenesis required for the growth, persistence, and metastases of solid tumors. An analytical comparison of BVZ-BC and bevacizumab was performed using state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including biochemical and biophysical characterization, biological activity, and immunological properties. Multiple attributes of the molecules were evaluated, including amino acid sequence, disulfide structure, glycan profiles, free thiol content, isoelectric point, protein content, subvisible particles, higher-order structure such as near- and far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry, product purity and product-related impurities, and process-related impurities. Biological activity assessment employed orthogonal assays such as the VEGF cell-based bioassay and the VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Fc functional assays to interrogate all expected biological activities. An accumulation of 18 batches of bevacizumab (sourced in China, manufactured in Europe, Roche) and 10 batches of BVZ-BC representing unique drug product lots from each individual drug substance lot were utilized in this study. The analytical similarity between BVZ-BC and bevacizumab was assessed and demonstrated the similarities of all of the quality attributes between BVZ-BC and bevacizumab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aangiogenesis 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adisulfides 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aisoelectric point 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aneutralization 3aprotein content 3areceptors 3athiols 3aultraviolet radiation 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aZhang, Feng1 aXu, Gangling1 aWu, Gang1 aWang, Wenbo1 aLiu, Chunyu1 aFu, Zhihao1 aLi, Meng1 aGuo, Sha1 aYu, Xiaojuan1 aWang, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0588-48990 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 25, v. 92, no. 4 p.3161-3170dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b048713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170520106700282592002801349650001301377650001101390650001501401650002201416650001101438650002501449650001501474650001901489650001301508650001301521650001801534650001501552653002401567653001601591653003601607653001401643653002301657700001501680700001701695700002001712700003601732700005701768700002001825773010701845856008701952852000902039655001202048IND60645032820221119172303.0200121e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064503282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1214992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Dan-Dan10aVertical alignment of polyaniline nanofibers on electrode surface for high-performance microbial fuel cells  aElectrode modifications with conductive and nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) were recognized as efficient approach to improve interaction between electrode surface and electrogenic bacteria for boosting the performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC). However, it still showed undesirable performance because of the challenge to control the orientation (such as vertical alignment) of PANI nanostructure for extracellular electron transfer (EET). In this work, vertically aligned polyaniline (VA-PANI) on carbon cloth electrode surface were prepared by in-situ polymerization method (simply tuning the ratio of tartaric acid (TA) dopant). Impressively, the VA-PANI greatly improved the EET due to the increased opportunity to connect with conductive proteins. Eventually, MFC equipped with the VA-PANI electrodes delivered a power output of 853 mW/m², which greatly outperformed those electrodes modified with un-oriented PANI. This work provided the possibility to control the orientation of PANI for EET and promise to harvest energy from wastewater with MFC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acarbon 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananofibers 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproteins 3atartaric acid 3awastewater 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aPolyaniline 0aExtracellular electron transfer 0aNanofiber 0aVertical alignment1 aFang, Zhen1 aJin, Hongwei1 aYan, Zhongping,1 aKirubaharan, Christopher Joseph1 aYu, Yang-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1660-15351 aYong, Yang-Chun0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Sept., v. 288 p.121499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1214993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016600173300001600339520128400355592002801639650000901667650001301676650002301689650002201712650001001734650001301744650003101757650002201788650001101810650002001821650001301841650001301854651001801867653001101885653001301896653002101909653002701930700002101957700002401978700001802002700002702020700002102047700002402068773010702092856008502199852000902284655001202293IND50071583120221120155839.0190215e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007158312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2013.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaston, Anthony J.10aModeling foraging range for breeding colonies of thick-billed murres Uria lomvia in the Eastern Canadian Arctic and potential overlap with industrial development  ap. 134-143.  aMapping areas of conservation concern for wildlife in the Arctic is urgently required to evaluate the impact of accelerating development in northern regions. There is substantial evidence that large seabird colonies reduce the availability of food in adjacent waters, creating a zone known as “Ashmole’s Halo”. Given the existence of the halo, Central Place Foraging theory (CPF) allows us to make predictions about the distribution of food and birds at different distances from the colony. Using a time-budget approach and a CPF framework, we modeled the relationships between foraging range and colony size for thick-billed murre colonies in Eastern Canada and calibrated these predictions against foraging trip distances recorded by GPS loggers attached to incubating birds at two colonies differing in population size by an order of magnitude. Our results support the general predictions of CPF and allow us to predict maximum foraging ranges for Canadian Eastern Arctic colonies, enabling us to map likely zones of overlap between the foraging of breeding birds and future development activities in Canadian Arctic marine waters. A similar approach could be used for many seabird species where the majority of breeding birds occupy a small number of discrete colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUria 3abreeding 3aconservation areas 3afood availability 3afoods 3aforaging 3aglobal positioning systems 3aindustrialization 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aseabirds 3awildlife 3aArctic region 0aArctic 0aSeabirds 0aMarine transport 0aCentral Place Foraging1 aElliott, Kyle H.1 aRopert-Coudert, Yan1 aKatō, Akiko,1 aMacdonald, Christie A.1 aMallory, Mark L.1 aGilchrist, H.

Using the latest techniques can make very accurate flood predictions. In this study, we introduce four effective methods to evaluate the flood susceptibility of Poyang County, in China, by integrating two independent models of frequency ratio and index of entropy with multilayer perceptron and classification and regression tree models. The flood locations of the study area were identified through the flood inventory process, and 12 flood conditioning factors were used in the training and validation processes. According to the results of the linear support vector machine, elevation, slope angle, and soil have the highest predictive ability. The experimental results of the four hybrid models demonstrate that between 20% and 50% of the study area has high and very high flood susceptibility. The multilayer perceptron-probability density hybrid model is the most effective among the six comparative methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3aenvironmental management 3ahybrids 3ainventories 3aneural networks 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asupport vector machines 3aChina 0aFlood susceptibility mapping 0aHybrid methods 0aBivariate statistics 0aMachine learning1 aFang, Zhice1 aHong, Haoyuan1 aCostache, Romulus1 aTang, Xianzhe0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 July 01, v. 289 p.112449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245007400175300001400249500002000263520064900283592002800932650001300960650002300973650001100996650000901007650001801016650001401034650001901048650001301067700002001080773011901100852000901219856008901228655001201317IND2205254020221116175940.0211015e200003  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220525402DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00175.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoning, Polly R.10aBald thigh syndrome of Greyhound dogs: gross and microscopic findings  ap. 49-51.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBald thigh syndrome (BTS) is a disease limited to Greyhound dogs.

Samples of skin, thyroid glands, and adrenal glands from 43 Greyhound dogs with BTS were examined microscopically. Microscopic changes were characterized by dilatation of follicular infundibula, presence of catagen follicles and epidermal hyperplasia. Changes in the skin from these Greyhound dogs suggest an endocrinopathy as the cause; however, we were unable to confirm which one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetiology 3aendocrine diseases 3athighs 3adogs 3athyroid gland 3aGreyhound 3aadrenal glands 3aalopecia1 aCowan, Laine A.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2000 Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.49-51dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00175.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02638naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015200169520101700321592002801338650001901366650001201385650001401397650001201411650002201423650002401445650002001469650001701489650002901506650002601535650001801561650001301579650002901592650002701621650001101648650001901659650001501678653002801693653004301721653001701764653003101781653002401812700001401836700001601850700001401866700001201880700001301892773010701905856008702012852000902099655001202108IND60645033020221119172354.0200121e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064503302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1215042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingrui10aNitrogen removal in a combined aerobic granular sludge and solid-phase biological denitrification system: System evaluation and community structure  aIn the present study, the feasibility of treating high ammonia wastewater was evaluated in a combination of aerobic granular sludge nitrification reactor (AGS-SBR) and poly(butylene succinate) solid denitrification reactor (PBS-SBR). After 90 days operation, the effluent NH₄⁺-N and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies were high of 99.6% and 99.7%, respectively. According to typical cycle, N₂O emission rate in AGS nitrification process was much higher than PBS denitrification process. It was found from EEM-PARAFAC that the fluorescence intensity scores (protein-like and humic like substances) of soluble microbial products (SMP) in AGS-SBR were the significant higher than in PBS-SBR. Microbial community analysis showed that Thauera was main genus in AGS-SBR and Hydrogenophaga Simplicispira and Thiomonas were dominant genus in PBS-SBR. The obtained result implied that the combined technology is feasible to remove nitrogen compounds from wastewater to meet the stringent emission standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrogenophaga 3aThauera 3aThiomonas 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3afluorescence 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide production 3apolybutylene succinate 3asludge 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aSolid-phase biological denitrification 0aN2O emission 0aSoluble microbial products 0aMicrobial community1 aWei, Dong1 aXu, Weiying1 aFeng, Rui1 aDu, Bin1 aWei, Qin0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Sept., v. 288 p.121504-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1215043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001600280520089200296592002801188650001401216650002501230650001801255650001401273650001101287650001301298650001701311700002501328700001901353700001301372700002101385773009701406856008101503990002301584852000901607655001201616IND60093217120221118070311.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009321712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shen14aThe first experimental demonstration of beneficial effects of sub-nanometer platinum particles for photocatalysis  ap. 266-272.  aUltra small sub-1nm platinum nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized and deposited on TiO₂ support. The presence of sub-1nm clusters was confirmed by STEM. They exhibited a striking photocatalytic activity for both liquid and gas phase oxidation reactions, which have a significant potential for environmental applications. We believe that this experimental result is the first ever experimental demonstration of very promising properties of such small clusters for environmental photocatalysis. The NO₂ conversion on these catalysts was 5times higher as compared to that of unmodified catalysts, whereas 4times increase in activity was observed for liquid phase oxidation of phenol. Another distinct component of this work included a novel use of modified DRIFT spectroscopy for photocatalytic testing, which allowed us to observe both surface and gas phase processes in situ.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3aplatinum 3aspectroscopy1 aRamakrishnan, Girish1 aShen, Peichuan1 aSu, Dong1 aOrlov, Alexander0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 217 p.266-272dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016500171520159100336592002801927650002501955650002601980650001702006650002902023650001302052650002002065650002902085650001102114650002102125650002002146650003302166650002102199650001902220650001702239650002102256650002802277650002502305650002302330650002702353653001702380653002902397653002702426653003402453653002802487653003302515653000802548653000802556653000802564653000802572653000802580653000802588653000802596653000802604653000802612653000902620653000702629653000702636653000702643653001002650700001402660700002002674700002302694700002002717700002202737773011802759856008602877852000902963655001202972IND60733358420221121225645.0211206e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073335842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazumder, Payal10aEnhancement of soil physico-chemical properties post compost application: Optimization using Response Surface Methodology comprehending Central Composite Design  aThe application of compost has been recognized as one of the most promising approaches for preserving soil quality and crop production. The present study exhaustively investigates the impact of Water Hyacinth Compost (WHC), Hydrilla verticillata Compost (HVC) and Vegetable Waste Compost (VWC) on soil nutrient quality and engineering properties [Bulk Density (BD), water retention and specific gravity]. For the study, six different proportions constituting 5, 10, 15, 25, 35 and 45% of the composts by weight of the soil were taken. The soil compost mixtures were evaluated at different periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 days) for various nutrients [Na, Mg, P, K, Ca, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)], BD, water retention capacity, change in specific gravity and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) values. It was observed that when the percentage of compost was increased to 15–45%, it resulted in enhanced nutrient value of the soil. Also, for WHC, HVC and VWC 60 days was sufficient to improve the soil quality to its maximum extend. Based on the optimized physico-chemical properties generated from the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) model, it was found that compared to WHC and HVC, the VWC performed better results viz., generating low BD (0.87 g/cm³), high water retention capacity (45.63%) and degree of saturation (77.49%) of the soil. While WHC, HVC and VWC can be used to improve soil nutrient content and overall physico-chemical parameters in long terms, VWC could be more efficient and beneficial to degraded soil for restoring soil health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aHydrilla verticillata 3abulk density 3acation exchange capacity 3acomposts 3acrop production 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoil degradation 3asoil nutrients 3asoil quality 3aspecific gravity 3atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3avegetable residues 3awater holding capacity 0aBulk density 0aWater retention capacity 0aWater hyacinth compost 0aHydrilla verticillata compost 0aVegetable waste compost 0aResponse surface methodology 0aWHC 0aHVC 0aVWC 0aTOC 0aTKN 0aCEC 0aRSM 0aSOM 0aCCD 0aIITG 0aCc 0aCu 0aBD 0aANOVA1 aPM, Akhil1 aTējōvati, A.,1 aKhwairakpam, Meena1 aMishra, Umesha,1 aKalamdhad, Ajay S0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 July 01, v. 289 p.112461-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011700154300001400271500001900285520101900304592002801323650002301351650002301374650001001397650001201407650002601419700001801445700001901463700001401482700001301496773012301509856007401632852000901706655001201715IND60722955320221116185131.0210108e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072295532DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01874k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xiang10aQuantitative analysis of excipient dominated drug formulations by Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning  ap. 64-68.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOwing to the growing interest in the application of Raman spectroscopy for quantitative purposes in solid pharmaceutical preparations, an article on the identification of compositions in excipient dominated drugs based on Raman spectra is presented. We proposed label-free Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with deep learning (DL) and non-negative least squares (NNLS) as a solution to overcome the drug fast screening bottleneck, which is not only a great challenge to drug administration, but also a major scientific challenge linked to falsified and/or substandard medicines. The result showed that Raman spectroscopy remains a cost effective, rapid, and user-friendly method, which if combined with DL and NNLS leads to fast implantation in the identification of lactose dominated drug (LDD) formulations. Meanwhile, Raman spectroscopy with the peak matching method allows a visual interpretation of the spectral signature (presence or absence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and low content APIs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3alactose 3aquantitative analysis1 aZhong, Li-min1 aCao, Yong-bing1 aChen, Hui1 aLu, Feng0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Jan. 7, v. 13, no. 1 p.64-68dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01874k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01505naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245005800167300001400225520054300239592002800782650001300810650002200823650001400845650001000859650002800869650001800897650001300915650002100928650001100949773013100960856007901091852000901170655001201179IND60617032420190823000000.0181023e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061703242DNAL7 a10.1515/plass-2017-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefańczyk, Emil10aAssessment of Potato Tuber Resistance Against Dry Rot  ap. 53-56.  aFungi of the genus Fusarium display inter- and intraspecific variation in their pathogenic capabilities.

Throughout the study period, nitrification fluctuated while Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosomonas nitrosa, the two major ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities, showed resistance to changes in operational and environmental conditions. Nitrobacter populations mostly exceeded those of Nitrospira within nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) results revealed that a close association between Nitrobacter and nitrite concentration as well as a direct correlation between the quantity of AOB and influent SCN− concentration. The serial shifts of data points over time showed that the nitrification of a full-scale treatment plant has been gradually suppressed by the influence of influent COD and phenol concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrobacter 3aNitrosomonas europaea 3aNitrosomonas nitrosa 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental factors 3anitrification 3anitrites 3aphenol 3aprincipal component analysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrification 2aNitritesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxisolation & purification 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWastewaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 2aWater Purificationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Quality 0aActivated sludge 0aFull-scale process 0aNitrifying bacteria 0aNitrification 0aPCA1 aPark, Hongkeun1 aCho, Kyung Hwa1 aPark, Jong Moon0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Apr., v. 134 p.180-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245015300176300001600329520129100345592002801636650001301664650002201677650002501699650001301724650001501737650002201752650001801774650001101792650001801803650001601821700002601837700001901863700001501882700002801897773009701925856008102022990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60093217420221118070302.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009321742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeynderickx, Philippe M.10aDetermination of the sorption and desorption kinetics of perfume raw materials in the liquid phase with vesicular dispersion: Application of SIFT-MS  ap. 281-288.  aPerfume raw materials such as coumarin, hexyl acetate and octanal are used in domestic fabric softeners together with cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants during the last rinsing step of a wash cycle. Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) is used to analyze the gas phase concentration of these perfume raw materials in an experiment, mimicking this rinsing step when fabric softeners are applied together with a vesicular diethyl ester dimethyl ammonium chloride (DEEDMAC) dispersion in a bubble column. A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model is proposed to obtain sorption and desorption kinetics for the mass transfer between the liquid phase and the vesicular dispersion from experimental gas phase concentration data. Sorption coefficients of (4.8±0.3) 10⁻³, (9.4±0.1) 10⁻³ and (4.0±0.1) 10⁻³s⁻¹ are obtained for coumarin, hexyl acetate and octanal. Desorption coefficients for these components are respectively reported as (5.4±0.6) 10⁻⁵, (1.8±0.1) 10⁻⁵ and (3.5±0.2) 10⁻⁵s⁻¹. From an engineering point of view, SIFT-MS is considered to be a promising experimental technique to evaluate the dynamic behavior, i.e., the sorption and desorption kinetics, of molecules in a vesicular dispersion using the proposed CSTR model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium chloride 3achemical engineering 3acoumarin 3adesorption 3amass spectrometry 3amass transfer 3amodels 3araw materials 3asurfactants1 aClercq, Sébastien De1 aSaveyn, Pieter1 aDewulf, Jo1 aLangenhove, Herman Van,0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 217 p.281-288dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245012400167520132900291592002801620650001101648650001301659650001701672650002901689650002601718650001301744650001201757650001001769650001301779650002201792650001101814650003101825651001001856700002201866700002401888700002201912700001901934700002601953773012001979856007802099852000902177655001202186IND60790918820221120021600.0220826e20220813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091882DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTedesco, Raffaello 10aCharacterization of Botanical Origin of Italian Honey by Carbohydrate Composition and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  aHoney is a natural sweetener constituted by numerous macro- and micronutrients. Carbohydrates are the most representative, with glucose and fructose being the most abundant. Minor honey components like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), minerals, vitamins, amino acids are able to confer honey-specific properties and are useful to characterize and differentiate between honey varieties according to the botanical origin. The present work describes the chemical characterization of honeys of different botanical origin (multifloral, acacia, apple–dandelion, rhododendron, honeydew, and chestnut) produced and collected by beekeepers in the Trentino Alto-Adige region (Italy). Melissopalynological analysis was conducted to verify the botanical origin of samples and determine the frequency of different pollen families. The carbohydrate composition (fourteen sugars) and the profile of VOCs were evaluated permitting to investigate the relationship between pollen composition and the chemical profile of honey. Statistical analysis, particularly partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), demonstrates the importance of classifying honey botanical origin on the basis of effective pollen composition, which directly influences honey’s biochemistry, in order to correctly define properties and value of honeys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aCastanea 3aRhododendron 3acarbohydrate composition 3adiscriminant analysis 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahoney 3ahoneydew 3amelissopalynology 3apollen 3avolatile organic compounds 3aItaly1 aScalabrin, Elisa 1 aMalagnini, Valeria 1 aStrojnik, Lidija 1 aOgrinc, Nives 1 aCapodaglio, Gabriele 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012700176300001600303500001900319520085700338536009501195592002801290596003901318596005801357650002301415650001701438650001701455650001501472650002201487651002101509651001001530653002101540653001101561653001801572653001101590700002401601700002201625700002601647773011601673856008501789852000901874655001201883IND60709128720221118035832.0200902e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070912872DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2019.16860812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRather, Zubair Ahmad10aSmartphone-integrated field microscopy (SPFM): a low-cost and portable tool to study live biological specimens in the wild  ap. 757-765.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImages and videos of organisms recorded in the wild have relevance for biodiversity studies.

The aim of this study was to build a low‐cost solar dryer with high energy efficiency based on a previous solar dryer model. The optimization of the previous solar dryer model was characterized via temperature profiles and drying kinetics to identify gaps. Theoretical and numerical modeling was used to correct the gaps, and a new prototype was then built. The inclination angle was changed from 45° in the previous model to 20° in the new model. As compared with the old model, the results indicated that the new model improved the efficiency by 43.75% for banana fruit, thereby demonstrating the optimization of the new model. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The solar dryer developed in this study will be applied to dehydrate fruits and vegetables with a capacity of up to 10 kg. It is a dryer built with low‐cost materials, simple operation and high energy efficiency. Preserved safe products are obtained with solar dryer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3adrying 3aenergy efficiency 3afruits 3amarkets 3amathematical models 3aprototypes 3atemperature profiles 3avegetables1 aMARTINEZ‐FLORES, HÉCTOR EDUARDO1 aGARNICA‐ROMO, MA GUADALUPE1 aARANDA‐SANCHEZ, JORGE ISIDRO1 aSOSA‐AGUIRRE, CARLOS RUBÉN1 aDE JESÚS CORTÉS‐PENAGOS, CONSUELO1 aFERNÁNDEZ‐MUÑOZ, JOSÉ LUIS0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2013 Oct., v. 37, no. 5 p.489-495dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2011.00668.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168520161700275592002801892650001501920650001601935650001701951650001201968650002001980650002902000650001402029650002602043650001302069650001502082650001902097650002102116653001402137653003102151653003302182653002402215653003302239700001802272700001502290700001802305700001402323700001202337700001702349700001802366700005902384773011802443856008602561852000902647655001202656IND60733358720221122010757.0211206e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073335872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Minghan10aResponses of microbial communities and their interactions to ibuprofen in a bio-electrochemical system  aIbuprofen has caused great concerns due to their potential environmental risks. However, their removal efficiency and their effects on microbial interactions in bio-electrochemical system remain unclear. To address these issues, a lab-scale bio-electrochemical reactor integrated with sulfur/iron-mediated autotrophic denitrification (BER-S/IAD) system exposing to 1000 μg L⁻¹ ibuprofen was operated for about two months. Results revealed that the BER-S/IAD system obtained efficient simultaneous denitrification (98.93%) and phosphorus (82.67%) removal, as well as an excellent ibuprofen removal performance (96.98%). Ibuprofen had no significant impacts on the nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) removal and the ammonia (NH₄⁺-N) accumulation, but decreased the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies. MiSeq sequencing analysis revealed that ibuprofen significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the microbial community diversity and changed their overall structure. Some bacteria related to denitrification and phosphorus removal, such as Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus, decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, molecular ecological network (MEN) analysis revealed that ibuprofen decreased the network's size and complexity, and enhanced the negative correlations of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Besides, ibuprofen decreased the links of some keystone bacteria related to denitrification and phosphorus removal. This research could provide a new dimension for our comprehending of the responses of microbial communities and their interactions to ibuprofen in bio-electrochemical system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFirmicutes 3aPseudomonas 3aThiobacillus 3aammonia 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental management 3aibuprofen 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0aIbuprofen 0aBio-electrochemical system 0aWastewater nutrients removal 0aMicrobial community 0aMolecular ecological network1 aZhang, Minglu1 aYuan, Yibo1 aZhang, Peilin1 aDu, Shuai1 aYa, Tao1 aChen, Daying1 aWang, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Tingting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5249-22010 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 July 01, v. 289 p.112473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016300174520146100337592002801798650001801826650001201844650001701856650002601873650002901899650001901928650003301947650001101980650002101991650001502012653002402027653003202051653002702083653003402110653004002144653004002184700005802224700002602282700002402308700002302332700002602355700002102381700006402402773011802466856008602584852000902670655001202679IND60733358820221120200643.0211206e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073335882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1124742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeal, Cristiano S.10aAssessment of an aerobic granular sludge system in the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds by quantitative image analysis and chemometric techniques  aIn this study, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with aerobic granular sludge (AGS) was operated with synthetic wastewater containing environmental relevant concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Despite the presence of the studied PhAC, the granular fraction clearly predominated (TSSgᵣₐₙ/TSS ranging from 0.82 to 0.98) throughout the monitoring period, presenting aggregates with high organic fraction (VSS/TSS above 0.83) and good settling characteristics (SVI₅ ranging from 15 to 39 mL/gTSS). A principal component analysis (PCA) with quantitative image analysis (QIA) based data allowed to distinguish the different operational periods, namely with mature granules (CONT), and the E2, EE2, and SMX feeding periods. It further revealed a positive relationship between the biomass density, sludge settling ability, overall and granular biomass contents, granulation properties, granular biomass fraction and large granules fraction and size. Moreover, a discriminant analysis (DA) allowed to successfully discriminate not only the different operational periods, mainly by using the floccular apparent density, granular stratification and contents data, but also the PhAC presence in samples. The filamentous bacteria contents, sludge settling properties, settling properties stability and granular stratification, structure and contents parameters were found to be crucial for that purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3abiomass 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental management 3aimage analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3asludge 3asulfamethoxazole 3awastewater 0a17β-estradiol (E2) 0a17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) 0aSulfamethoxazole (SMX) 0aAerobic granular sludge (AGS) 0aBiomass structural characterization 0aMultivariate statistical techniques1 aLopes, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5054-33831 aVal del Río, Angeles1 aQuintelas, Cristina1 aCastro, Paula M.L.1 aFerreira, Eugénio C.1 aAmaral, A.

We found that band 3 protein and glycophorins A and B were the key MPO-binding targets of human red blood cells (RBCs). The interaction of MPO with RBC proteins was mostly electrostatic in nature because it was inhibited by desialation, exogenic sialic acid, high ionic strength, and extreme pH. In addition, MPO failed to interfere with the lectin-induced agglutination of RBCs, suggesting a minor role of glycan-recognizing mechanisms in MPO binding. Multiple biophysical properties of RBCs were altered in the presence of native (i.e., not hypochlorous acid-damaged) MPO. These changes included transmembrane potential, availability of intracellular Ca2+, and lipid organization in the plasma membrane. MPO-treated erythrocytes became larger in size, structurally more rigid, and hypersensitive to acidic and osmotic hemolysis. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the plasma MPO concentration and RBC rigidity index in type-2 diabetes patients with coronary heart disease. These findings suggest that MPO functions as a mediator of novel regulatory mechanism in microcirculation, indicating the influence of MPO-induced abnormalities on RBC deformability under pathological stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3acalcium 3acoronary disease 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aionic strength 3alipids 3amembrane potential 3amyeloperoxidase 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apH 3apatients 3aplasma membrane 3asialic acids 3asurface proteins 0aMyeloperoxidase 0aErythrocytes 0aCell deformability 0aCardiovascular diseases 0aLectin 0aOxidative/halogenative stress 0aMPO 0aMPO-Cl 0aRBCs 0a4-ABH 0aTEA 0aDIDS 0aSNA 0aSTA 0aWGA 0aVAA 0aPBS 0aRBCGs 0aEPR 0aAFM 0aIR 0aIHD 0aDM 0aB3 0aGp1 aSokolov, Alexey V.1 aShamova, Ekaterina V.1 aGrigorieva, Daria V.1 aMironova, Elena V.1 aKudryavtsev, Igor V.1 aGusev, Sergey A.1 aGusev, Alexander A.1 aChekanov, Andrey V.1 aVasilyev, Vadim B.1 aCherenkevich, Sergey N.1 aPanasenko, Oleg M.1 aTimoshenko, Alexander V.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 591 p.87-97dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245013200167520153500299592002801834650002301862650002301885650002201908650001101930650001501941650002201956650001001978650001501988651001602003700002702019700002602046700002002072700002902092773012302121856007402244852000902318655001202327IND60751659720221120234550.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075165972DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130932412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahnraths, Marla T. H.14aThe Effects of the Healthy Primary School of the Future on Children’s Fruit and Vegetable Preferences, Familiarity and Intake  aMere exposure is an often-described strategy to increase children’s food familiarity, preferences, and intake. Research investigating this method in less controlled settings is scarce. This study investigates the effects of repeated fruit and vegetable (FV) exposure through the Healthy Primary School of the Future (HPSF) on children’s FV familiarity, preferences, and intake. The study had a longitudinal quasi-experimental design comparing two full HPSFs (focus: nutrition and physical activity) with two partial HPSFs (focus: physical activity) in the Netherlands. Annual measurements (child-reported questionnaires) were conducted during 2015–2019 in 833 7–12-year-old children. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02800616). After correction for baseline, full HPSFs had, on average, a lower number of unfamiliar vegetable items after one (effect size (ES) = −0.28) and three years (ES = −0.35) and a higher number of disliked vegetable items after one year (ES = 0.24) than partial HPSFs. Unfavorable intervention effects were observed for fruit intake after one (odds ratio (OR) = 0.609) and four years (OR = 0.451). Repeated FV exposure had limited effects on children’s FV familiarity, preferences, and intake, likely due to insufficient taste exposure. Considering the widespread implementation of school-based mere exposure efforts, it is highly relevant to further investigate under which circumstances mere exposure effectively contributes to improvements in (determinants of) FV intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelementary schools 3aempirical research 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3aodds ratio 3aphysical activity 3ataste 3avegetables 3aNetherlands1 aWilleboordse, Maartje 1 aAssema, Patricia van,1 aWinkens, Bjorn 1 avan Schayck, Constant P.0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 17, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130932413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245012300171520154800294592002801842650001701870650002201887650001501909650001801924650001201942650002001954650001301974650001501987650001802002650001502020700003102035773012002066856007802186852000902264655001202273IND60790919120221117065105.0220826e20220813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091912DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalakrishnan, Gayathri 14aThe Role of Amaranth, Quinoa, and Millets for the Development of Healthy, Sustainable Food Products—A Concise Review  aThe selection of sustainable crops adaptable to the rapidly changing environment, which also cater to the dietary needs of the growing population, is a primary challenge in meeting food security. Grains from ancient crops such as amaranth, quinoa, and millets are positioned to address this challenge and hence have gained dietary predominance among cereals and pseudocereals due to their nutritional value and energy efficiency. From a nutritional perspective, they are recognized for their complete protein, phenolic compounds and flavonoids, prebiotic fibers, and essential micronutrients, including minerals and vitamins. Bioactive peptides from their proteins have shown antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. The nutritional diversity of these grains makes them a preferred choice over traditional cereals for developing healthy, sustainable food products such as plant-based dairy, vegan meats, and gluten-free products. With growing consumer awareness about sustainability and health, the categories mentioned above are transitioning from ‘emerging’ to ‘mainstream’; however, there is still a significant need to include such healthy grains to fulfill the nutritional gap. This review article emphasizes the health benefits of amaranth, quinoa, and millet grains and discusses the recent research progress in understanding their application in new sustainable food categories. The challenges associated with their incorporation into novel foods and future research directions are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aenergy efficiency 3aflavonoids 3afood security 3amillets 3anutritive value 3apeptides 3aprebiotics 3apseudocereals 3avegan diet1 aSchneider, Renée Goodrich0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300001600286500001900302520113700321592002801458650001501486650001101501650002001512650001301532650002101545650001501566650001701581650002601598650002401624650001701648650001301665700001901678700001501697700001801712773012501730856007401855852000901929655001201938IND60722955820221116185002.0210108e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072295582DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01996h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiafeng10aHighly sensitive electrochemical determination of methotrexate based on a N-doped hollow nanocarbon sphere modified electrode  ap. 117-123.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs an antineoplastic drug, methotrexate (MTX) is widely applied in cancer therapies; however it has potentially toxic activity, and thus the qualitative and quantitative determination of MTX is of great significance. In this paper, by using dopamine synchronously as a carbon and N source, N-doped hollow nanocarbon sphere (NHNC) hybrids were prepared via a simple self-polymerization method and used to construct a new electrochemical sensor for MTX. The prepared NHNC exhibits a uniform hollow nanostructure with high conductivity and electrocatalytic properties as well as large adsorption capacity and surface area, which are the key factors for improving the sensor sensitivity of MTX. For achieving highly sensitive determination of MTX, various conditions were optimized, and the final results show that the NHNC modified electrode has excellent sensing responses for MTX, and it has a wide linear range from 0.05 to 14.0 μM coupled with a low detection limit of 0.01 μM. Finally, studies on the reproducibility, stability and selectivity of the NHNC modified electrode show that the corresponding results are satisfactory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amethotrexate 3aquantitative analysis 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface area 3atoxicity1 aChen, Dongdong1 aZhang, Tao1 aChen, Guolong0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Jan. 7, v. 13, no. 1 p.117-123dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01996h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011300159520165800272592002801930650001401958650002001972650001701992650001302009650004102022650001602063650001602079650002502095650000902120650001902129650001002148650001602158650001102174650003302185650001502218650000902233700001702242700001602259700001602275773012002291856007802411852000902489655001202498IND60790919220221117064527.0220826e20220813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091922DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xue 10aInsight into the Influence of Lactic Acid Bacteria Fermentation on the Variations in Flavor of Chickpea Milk  aThis study aimed to evaluate the influence of fermentation on the levels of free amino acids (FAAs) and variations of volatile odorants in four groups of chickpea milk. Electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data were subjected to mutual validation. W2S and W3S sensors of E-nose were sensitive to volatile constituents in the four groups of unfermented and fermented specimens. After fermentation, the levels of FAAs in the four groups of specimens decreased to varying degrees. Additionally, there were remarkable differences in the types and contents of volatile odor substances in all specimens before and after fermentation. The principal component analysis findings based on E-nose identified the changes of volatile odorants in all specimens before and after fermentation. GC-MS identified 35 and 55 volatile flavor substances in unfermented and fermented specimens, respectively. The varieties of volatile odor substances in fermented chickpea milk (FCM) with papain treatment plus yam addition (38) were more than those in FCM (24), indicating that the coupled treatment of enzymolysis and yam addition could enrich the volatile odorants in fermented specimens. After probiotic fermentation, the contents of off-flavor substances decreased to a certain extent, and key aroma substances such as 2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-butanedione, and heptyl formate were detected. These results demonstrated that lactic acid bacterial fermentation on the basis of enzymolysis and yam addition could be utilized as a feasible approach to improve the flavor of plant-based products adopting chickpea as the original ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickpeas 3aelectronic nose 3afermentation 3aformates 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aingredients 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3apapain 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobiotics 3ayams1 aTian, Wenli 1 aXie, Bijun 1 aSun, Zhida 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014100166300001600307520188800323592002802211650002102239650002702260650002202287650002302309650002202332650002902354650001402383650002002397650001102417650001902428650000902447650002502456650001202481650001202493650000902505650001402514650001602528700001802544700002302562700002302585700002102608700002302629700002402652773011902676856008102795852000902876655001202885IND60575568620221116182444.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057556862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-017-2854-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanal, Sameer10aSSR-enriched genetic linkage maps of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × transvaalensis), and their comparison with allied plant genomes  ap. 819-839.  aKEY MESSAGE: We report SSR-enriched genetic maps of bermudagrass that: (1) reveal partial residual polysomic inheritance in the tetraploid species, and (2) provide insights into the evolution of chloridoid genomes. This study describes genetic linkage maps of two bermudagrass species, Cynodon dactylon (T89) and Cynodon transvaalensis (T574), that integrate heterologous microsatellite markers from sugarcane into frameworks built with single-dose restriction fragments (SDRFs). A maximum likelihood approach was used to construct two separate parental maps from a population of 110 F₁ progeny of a cross between the two parents. The T89 map is based on 291 loci on 34 cosegregating groups (CGs), with an average marker spacing of 12.5 cM. The T574 map is based on 125 loci on 14 CGs, with an average marker spacing of 10.7 cM. Six T89 and one T574 CG(s) deviated from disomic inheritance. Furthermore, marker segregation data and linkage phase analysis revealed partial residual polysomic inheritance in T89, suggesting that common bermudagrass is undergoing diploidization following whole genome duplication (WGD). Twenty-six T89 CGs were coalesced into 9 homo(eo)logous linkage groups (LGs), while 12 T574 CGs were assembled into 9 LGs, both putatively representing the basic chromosome complement (x = 9) of the species. Eight T89 and two T574 CGs remain unassigned. The marker composition of bermudagrass ancestral chromosomes was inferred by aligning T89 and T574 homologs, and used in comparisons to sorghum and rice genome sequences based on 108 and 91 significant blast hits, respectively. Two nested chromosome fusions (NCFs) shared by two other chloridoids (i.e., zoysiagrass and finger millet) and at least three independent translocation events were evident during chromosome number reduction from 14 in the polyploid common ancestor of Poaceae to 9 in Cynodon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3aEleusine coracana 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome number 3achromosome translocation 3aevolution 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3aparents 3aprogeny 3arice 3asugarcane 3atetraploidy1 aKim, Changsoo1 aAuckland, Susan A.1 aRainville, Lisa K.1 aAdhikari, Jeevan1 aSchwartz, Brian M.1 aPaterson, Andrew H.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2017 Apr., v. 130, no. 4 p.819-839dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-017-2854-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001400282520128800296592002801584650001601612650001701628650002601645650001301671650001601684650001301700650001401713650001101727650001101738650000901749653002601758653001401784653002601798653002201824653002101846653000801867653000801875653000901883700002301892700001801915773010701933856008102040852000902121655001202130IND60528597220221121045953.0160716e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052859722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlapp, Bryce V.10aMechanistic implications from structures of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase complexed with coenzyme and an alcohol  ap. 35-42.  aYeast alcohol dehydrogenase I is a homotetramer of subunits with 347 amino acid residues, catalyzing the oxidation of alcohols using NAD+ as coenzyme. A new X-ray structure was determined at 3.0 Å where both subunits of an asymmetric dimer bind coenzyme and trifluoroethanol. The tetramer is a pair of back-to-back dimers. Subunit A has a closed conformation and can represent a Michaelis complex with an appropriate geometry for hydride transfer between coenzyme and alcohol, with the oxygen of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol ligated at 2.1 Å to the catalytic zinc in the classical tetrahedral coordination with Cys-43, Cys-153, and His-66. Subunit B has an open conformation, and the coenzyme interacts with amino acid residues from the coenzyme binding domain, but not with residues from the catalytic domain. Coenzyme appears to bind to and dissociate from the open conformation. The catalytic zinc in subunit B has an alternative, inverted coordination with Cys-43, Cys-153, His-66 and the carboxylate of Glu-67, while the oxygen of trifluoroethanol is 3.5 Å from the zinc. Subunit B may represent an intermediate in the mechanism after coenzyme and alcohol bind and before the conformation changes to the closed form and the alcohol oxygen binds to the zinc and displaces Glu-67.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aactive sites 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalcohols 3aamino acids 3ahydrides 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3ayeasts 3azinc 0aX-ray crystallography 0aAsymmetry 0aConformational change 0aZinc coordination 0aHydride transfer 0aADH 0aTFE 0armsd1 aCharlier, Henry A.1 aRamaswamy, S.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 591 p.35-42dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009600166300001600262520145900278592002801737650002601765650001401791650002501805650001901830650001801849650001101867650001201878650002301890650001601913650001701929700001701946700002001963700001601983700001501999700001202014700001802026773009702044856008102141990002302222852000902245655001202254IND60093218120221118070440.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009321812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yue-gan10aLime pretreatment to improve methane production of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora)  ap. 337-344.  aAnaerobic conversion of smooth cordgrass (SC; Spartina alterniflora) to methane for energy production presents a viable option for effective management. The effect of lime pretreatment of SC on methane production was investigated in this study. The effect of three selected independent variables (lime loading (0.02–0.12g Ca(OH)₂/g SC), pretreatment time (7–28days) and temperature (25–55°C)) on material composition and methane production was explored. Lime pretreatment resulted in significant changes in SC composition: 5.7–60.5% hemicellulose and 10.2–36.2% lignin reductions, and 91–98.7% cellulose remaining in the solid residues after lime pretreatment. Lime pretreatment increased methane yield by between 122% and 180% and the methane production rate constant in the range of 56–212%. The highest methane yield was 218.4mL/g total solids from pretreatment conditions of lime loading 0.12g Ca(OH)₂/g SC, for 28days at 45°C. These results were based on a 30-day biochemical methane potential assay. Lime loading had the greatest influence on methane yield of the three pretreatment factors. Considering the energy balance, the optimization of pretreatment experiment was carried out under the condition of 0.10g Ca(OH)₂/g SC dry mass, at 25°C for 14days. Based on this study, the pretreatment condition of high lime loading, low temperature and short pretreatment time was a preferential consideration for lime pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3acellulose 3achemical engineering 3aenergy balance 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amethane 3amethane production 3atemperature 3atotal solids1 aZheng, Zheng1 aLuo, Xing-zhang1 aSi, You-bin1 aCao, De-ju1 aNie, Er1 aCheng, Beijiu0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 217 p.337-344dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.11.1353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013700163520140300300592002801703650001101731650002001742650001501762650001301777650001401790650001101804650001001815650001901825650002501844650001001869650002901879650001501908650000901923700001801932700002101950773012901971856007402100852000902174655001202183IND60653993820221119195321.0190722e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065399382DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111315802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPimont, François 10aAccounting for Wood, Foliage Properties, and Laser Effective Footprint in Estimations of Leaf Area Density from Multiview-LiDAR Data  aThe spatial distribution of Leaf Area Density (LAD) in a tree canopy has fundamental functions in ecosystems. It can be measured through a variety of methods, including voxel-based methods applied to LiDAR point clouds. A theoretical study recently compared the numerical errors of these methods and showed that the bias-corrected Maximum Likelihood Estimator was the most efficient. However, it ignored (i) wood volumes, (ii) vegetation sub-grid clumping, (iii) the instrument effective footprint, and (iv) was limited to a single viewpoint. In practice, retrieving LAD is not straightforward, because vegetation is not randomly distributed in sub-grids, beams are divergent, and forestry plots are sampled from more than one viewpoint to mitigate occlusion. In the present article, we extend the previous formulation to (i) account for both wood volumes and hits, (ii) rigorously include correction terms for vegetation and instrument characteristics, and (iii) integrate multiview data. Two numerical experiments showed that the new approach entailed reduction of bias and errors, especially in the presence of wood volumes or when multiview data are available for poorly-explored volumes. In addition to its conciseness, completeness, and efficiency, this new formulation can be applied to multiview TLS&mdash;and also potentially to UAV LiDAR scanning&mdash;to reduce errors in LAD estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aforestry 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation 3awood1 aSoma, Maxime 1 aDupuy, Jean-Luc 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 03, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111315803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008600155520152000241592002801761650002301789650001901812650001601831650001601847650001001863650001101873650002301884650002301907650001501930650001201945650001201957651002201969700001301991700003602004700001902040700002502059700001502084700002202099773012102121856007402242852000902316655001202325IND60791144820221120035729.0220826e20220729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079114482DNAL7 a10.3390/v140816762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weinan 10aSpillover of a Tobamovirus from the Australian Indigenous Flora to Invasive Weeds  aThe tobamovirus yellow tailflower mild mottle virus (YTMMV) was previously reported in wild plants of Anthocercis species (family Solanaceae) and other solanaceous indigenous species growing in natural habitats in Western Australia. Here, we undertook a survey of two introduced solanaceous weeds, namely Solanum nigrum (black nightshade) and Physalis peruviana (cape gooseberry) in the Perth metropolitan area and surrounds to determine if YTMMV has spread naturally to these species. At a remnant natural bushland site where both solanaceous weeds and indigenous Anthocercis hosts grew adjacent to one another, a proportion of S. nigrum and P. peruviana plants were asymptomatically-infected with YTMMV, confirming spillover had occurred. Populations of S. nigrum also grow as weeds in parts of the city isolated from remnant bushland and indigenous sources of YTMMV, and some of these populations were also infected with YTMMV. Fruit was harvested from virus-infected wild S. nigrum plants and the seed germinated under controlled conditions. Up to 80% of resultant seedlings derived from infected parent plants were infected with YTMMV, confirming that the virus is vertically-transmitted in S. nigrum, and therefore infection appears to be self-sustaining in this species. This is the first report of spillover of YTMMV to exotic weeds, and of vertical transmission of this tobamovirus. We discuss the roles of vertical and horizontal transmission in this spillover event, and its implications for biosecurity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalis peruviana 3aSolanum nigrum 3aTobamovirus 3abiosecurity 3aflora 3afruits 3aindigenous species 3ametropolitan areas 3ashrublands 3asurveys 3aviruses 3aWestern Australia1 aLi, Hua 1 aSivasithamparam, Krishnapillai 1 aTran, Dieu Thi1 aJones, Michael G.

Irrespective of such general functional assignment, a proof of function in a living organism is missing. Here, we used heat-induced orchardgrass small Hsp17.2 (DgHsp17.2). Its function in in vitro chaperone properties has shown in protecting the model substrate, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS). Overexpression of DgHsp17.2 triggering strong chaperone activity enhanced in vivo thermotolerance of yeast cells. To identify the functional domain on DgHsp17.2 and correlationship between in vitro chaperone property and in vivo thermotolerance, we generated truncation mutants of DgHsp17.2 and showed essentiality of the N-terminal arm of DgHsp17.2 for the chaperone function. In addition, beyond for acquisition of thermotolerance irrespective of sequences are diverse among the small Hsps. However, any truncation mutants of DgHsp17.2 did not exhibit strong interaction with orchardgrass heat shock protein 70 (DgHsp70) different from mature DgHsp17.2, indicating that full-length DgHsp17.2 is necessary for cooperating with Hsp70 protein. Our study indicates that the N-terminal arm of DgHsp17.2 is an important region for chaperone activity and thermotolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3adenaturation 3aheat tolerance 3aheat-shock protein 70 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amutants 3ayeasts 0aCytosolic class II small heat shock protein 0aMolecular chaperone 0aOrchardgrass 0aThermotolerance1 aLee, Sang-hoon,1 aSeo, Kyung Hye1 aChʻoe, Yong-jin,1 aCheong, Mi Sun1 aSon, Daeyoung0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 591 p.18-27dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012800167300001800295520074700313592002801060650001201088650002401100650002201124700005501146773011901201856008301320852000901403655001201412IND60617033120221117214554.0181023e20180928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061703312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Nilimesh10aStructural, Functional, and Dynamical Responses of a Protein in a Restricted Environment Imposed by Macromolecular Crowding  ap. 6078-6089.  aThe intercellular environment is known to be very different from the environment where most of the elementary biological processes are studied in the laboratory. As a result, there was a considerable effort on cell mimicking either by confinement or by introducing macromolecular crowding. In the present study, dextran of varying sizes has been used to crowd the environment of a protein, human serum albumin (HSA), and its structure, dynamics, and activity were studied as a function of crowder concentration. By employing bulk and single molecular level spectroscopic measurements, we elucidate the overall structure and local microsecond dynamics of HSA. Further, we have attempted to correlate these structural changes with its activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adextran 3ahuman serum albumin 3aspectral analysis1 aSen, Pratik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8202-18540 tBiochemistry.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 57, no. 42 p.6078-6089dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245013100167300001400298500001900312520061900331592002800950650002200978650003101000650001801031650001101049650001201060650000901072650000901081650002301090700001801113700002701131700002301158773012301181856007401304852000901378655001201387IND60722956120221116184802.0210108e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072295612DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay02018d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManaprasertsak, Auraya10aImaging the distribution of DMPBD and terpinen-4-ol inclusion complexes with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin by using TOF-SIMS  ap. 84-89.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe distribution of terpinen-4-ol (TP4ol) and DMPBD inclusion complexes with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) in human skin has been investigated using the TOF-SIMS technique.

The results mainly show accumulation of TP4ol and DMPBD inclusion complexes with HPbCD in the epidermis and dermis whereas these two compounds without cyclodextrin cannot penetrate into the epidermis.

Thereby it is involved in almost all basic cellular processes, which is facilitated by its association with various regulator complexes so that it appears in different disguises like 26S proteasome, hybrid-proteasome and others. The 20S proteasome has a cylindrical structure built up by four stacked rings composed of α- and β-subunits. Since the three active site-containing β-subunits can all or in part be replaced by immuno-subunits, three main subpopulations exist, namely standard-, immuno- and intermediate-proteasomes. Due to posttranslational modifications or/and genetic variations all α- and β-subunits occur in multiple iso- or proteoforms. This leads to the fact that each of the three subpopulations is composed of a variety of 20S proteasome subtypes. This review summarizes the knowledge of proteasome subtypes in mammalian cells and tissues and their possible biological and medical relevancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3amammals 3apost-translational modification 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3atissues 0aProteasome 0aSubpopulation 0aSubtype 0aSubunit-iso/proteoform 0aPosttranslational modification0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 591 p.132-140dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012900187300001600316500001500332520195500347592002802302650001802330650001202348650002402360650001002384650001302394650002602407650001402433650002102447650001002468650001502478650001302493650001402506650001202520650001502532650001202547650001702559650001002576650001402586650002502600650002202625650002302647650002402670651001102694653001602705700002302721700002202744700002102766700002602787700001802813700002802831700002202859700002802881700002302909773008402932856004803016852000903064655001203073IND50065097920221119015343.0130416e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006509792DNAL7 a230532392pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-012-2482-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassad, Tara Joy10aInteractions between repeated fire, nutrients, and insect herbivores affect the recovery of diversity in the southern Amazon  ap. 219-229.  a2019-12-06  aSurface fires burn extensive areas of tropical forests each year, altering resource availability, biotic interactions, and, ultimately, plant diversity. In transitional forest between the Brazilian cerrado (savanna) and high stature Amazon forest, we took advantage of a long-term fire experiment to establish a factorial study of the interactions between fire, nutrient availability, and herbivory on early plant regeneration. Overall, five annual burns reduced the number and diversity of regenerating stems. Community composition changed substantially after repeated fires, and species common in the cerrado became more abundant. The number of recruits and their diversity were reduced in the burned area, but burned plots closed to herbivores with nitrogen additions had a 14 % increase in recruitment. Diversity of recruits also increased up to 50 % in burned plots when nitrogen was added. Phosphorus additions were related to an increase in species evenness in burned plots open to herbivores. Herbivory reduced seedling survival overall and increased diversity in burned plots when nutrients were added. This last result supports our hypothesis that positive relationships between herbivore presence and diversity would be strongest in treatments that favor herbivory—in this case herbivory was higher in burned plots which were initially lower in diversity. Regenerating seedlings in less diverse plots were likely more apparent to herbivores, enabling increased herbivory and a stronger signal of negative density dependence. In contrast, herbivores generally decreased diversity in more species rich unburned plots. Although this study documents complex interactions between repeated burns, nutrients, and herbivory, it is clear that fire initiates a shift in the factors that are most important in determining the diversity and number of recruits. This change may have long-lasting effects as the forest progresses through succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanting date 3acerrado 3acommunity structure 3astems 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aseedlings 3atropical forests 3afires 3aherbivores 3asavannas 3anutrients 3ainsects 3aphosphorus 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aFires 2aHerbivory 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aPlant Development 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 0aBrazil 0arecruitment1 aBalch, Jennifer K.1 aDavidson, Eric A.1 aBrando, Paulo M.1 aMews, Cândida Lahís1 aPorto, Pábio1 aQuintino, Raimundo Mota1 aVieira, Simone A.1 aJunior, Ben Hur Marimon1 aTrumbore, Susan E.0 tOecologia.g2013 May, v. 172, no. 1 p.219-229dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2482-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008000175300001600255500001400271520138600285592002801671650001701699650002101716650002301737650002301760650001501783650002101798650002201819650000901841650001501850650002401865650002301889650001101912650002801923650001601951650001301967651001001980653003401990653001802024653001902042653003502061773015902096856008502255852000902340655001202349IND60709129520221118035751.0200902e20200817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070912952DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2020.17481362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhalkey, Neelambari10aHousehold level vulnerability in an Indian mangrove socio-ecological system  ap. 534-547.  aNAL-light  aThe Sundarbans (West Bengal) is highly vulnerable to hydro-meteorological hazards such as coastal storm surges, flooding, cyclones and other climatic events. These events often lead to loss of productivity in ecosystem-based livelihoods, biodiversity, ecosystem goods and services. Communities directly dependent on socio-ecological systems for primary livelihood need to strengthen their resilience for early recovery and prepare for the impacts of future hazards. Current policies often assume that households are equally vulnerable to hazards. However, there is no robust empirical study available on the level and distribution of vulnerability amongst marginalised households. This study compared the levels of vulnerability amongst 500 households in five villages situated in the Mangrove ecosystem of the Indian Sundarban using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVIs). The results uncover significant variations in levels and distribution of vulnerability between the villages. These findings could be used to tailor need-based bespoke adaptation and mitigation interventions to combat climate-induced variability or hazard events in the future. In order to optimise the benefits of policy or program for strengthening resilience of these households – this article recommends that policymakers consider micro-level differences in levels and distribution of vulnerability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystem services 3aempirical research 3ahouseholds 3ahydrometeorology 3aissues and policy 3alead 3alivelihood 3amangrove ecosystems 3asocial environment 3astorms 3asustainable development 3avariability 3avillages 3aIndia 0aHydro- meteorological hazards 0avulnerability 0aclimate Change 0alivelihood Vulnerability Index0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2020 Aug. 17, v. 27, no. 6 p.534-547dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2150x1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2020.17481363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009400207500001900301520184800320592002802168650001102196650000902207650001402216650001002230650001502240650002002255650002602275650001802301650001002319650001202329650000902341650001102350650002702361650002202388650001702410650001702427650001502444651001002459653001702469653001202486653001102498653001302509700001902522700005902541700006302600700002002663700002602683773009902709856008502808852000902893655001202902IND60700821120221118035207.0200907e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070082112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geodrs.2020.e003112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoomson, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9316-256410aCritical slope length for soil loss mitigation in maize-bean cropping systems in SW Kenya  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil erosion and land fragmentation threaten agricultural production of sub-Saharan African highlands. At our study site in Western Kenya, farm size is mostly < 2 ha, laid out in narrow strips in slope direction and ploughed downhill. Soil conservation measures like hedgerows and green manures can reduce effective slope length for erosion, but compete with crops for space and labour. Knowledge of critical slope length can minimise interventions and trade–offs. Hence, a maize–bean intercrop (MzBn) slope length trial on 20, 60 and 84 m long plots, replicated twice on three farms was carried out in Rongo, Migori County, during one rainy season. Soil loss from 84 m slope length (SL) plots was 250 % higher than from 60 m and 710% higher than from 20 m plots, while soil loss from 20 and 60 m plots did not differ (p < 0.05). Conversely, runoff was lower on the 84 m than on the 60 m (p < 0.05) or the 20 m SL (p < 0.05). Across all three farms slope gradient and length had highest explanatory power to predict soil loss. At individual farm level, under similar slope and soil texture, slope length and profile curvature were most influential. Regarding results of the slope length experiments, food crop plot lengths < 50 m appear essential considering soil loss, sediment load, and soil loss to yield ratio under the given rainfall, soil and slope (10–14%) conditions. Our results call for designing integrating slope length options and cropping systems for effective soil conservation. We recommend planting Mucuna and Calliandra–hedgerows as buffer strips below the critical slope length, and legume cash crops and maize uphill. Such approaches are critical against the backdrop of land fragmentation and labour limitation to sustainably maximise food production from the available land area in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMucuna 3acorn 3afarm size 3afarms 3afood crops 3afood production 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aintercropping 3alabor 3alegumes 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment contamination 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil texture 3awet season 3aKenya 0aSlope length 0aErosion 0aLegume 0aAcrisols1 aMuoni, Tarirai1 aMarohn, Carsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2823-78971 aNziguheba, Generose1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4227-22421 aÖborn, Ingrid,1 aCadisch, G.q(Georg),0 tGeoderma regional.g2020 Sept., v. 22 p.e00311-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23258x2352-00947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geodrs.2020.e003113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245018400162520137800346592002801724650002401752650000801776650002301784650002301807650001701830650002301847650001401870650001501884650001701899650002001916650002001936650003001956651000901986700001701995700002102012700002002033773012002053856007802173852000902251655001202260IND60790919620221117064103.0220826e20220814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079091962DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111624492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ga-Young 10aRapid On-Site Identification for Three Arcidae Species (Anadara kagoshimensis, Tegillarca granosa, and Anadara broughtonii) Using Ultrafast PCR Combined with Direct DNA Extraction  aGranular ark (Tegillarca granosa), broughton’s ribbed ark (Anadara broughtonii), and half-crenate ark (Anadara kagoshimensis) are important fishery resources throughout Asia; granular ark exhibiting a higher economic value due to its rarity. However, due to the similar morphological characteristics of the three species, the less valuable species could be exploited for food fraud. In this study, we developed a rapid on-site identification method based on a microfluidic chip for the detection of the three ark shell species. We designed new species-specific primers, targeting the genes encoding mitochondrial cytochrome b or cytochrome c oxidase I, for the identification of the three ark shells and estimated their specificity against 17 species, which amplified only the target species. The sensitivity of each primer was 0.001 ng. In addition, this method was further improved to develop a direct ultrafast polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for on-site food monitoring, which would allow for completing the entire procedure (from sampling to obtaining the results) within 25 min without DNA extraction. Our direct, ultrafast PCR was successfully applied to differentiate the three species from 29 commercial products. Therefore, this assay could be used as a rapid and cost-effective approach for the on-site identification of ark shells in commercial food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnadara broughtonii 3aDNA 3aTegillarca granosa 3acost effectiveness 3acytochrome b 3aeconomic valuation 3afisheries 3afood fraud 3amitochondria 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3aoxidoreductases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aAsia1 aKim, Eiseul 1 aYang, Seung-Min 1 aKim, Hae-Yeong 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 14, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111624493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008900157300001800246520138200264592002801646650002501674650001501699650001201714650002101726650002501747650001801772650003501790650001901825650003001844650001201874650001401886650001701900653001001917653002501927653001101952653001401963653001401977653000901991700001902000700001902019700001602038700001902054700001802073700001902091700002202110700002002132773012502152856007402277852000902351655001202360IND60223969720221121224349.0150613e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6022396972DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcv0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Eriko10aATML1 and PDF2 Play a Redundant and Essential Role in Arabidopsis Embryo Development  ap. 1183-1192.  aThe epidermis of shoot organs in plants develops from the outermost layer (L1) of the shoot apical meristem. In Arabidopsis, a pair of homeobox genes, ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) and PROTODERMAL FACTOR2 (PDF2), play a role in regulating the expression of L1-specific genes. atml1‐1 pdf2‐1 double mutants show striking defects in the differentiation of shoot epidermal cells. However, because atml1‐1 and pdf2‐1 have a T-DNA inserted downstream of the respective homeobox sequences, these alleles may not represent null mutations. Here we characterized additional mutant alleles that have a T-DNA insertion at different positions of each gene. Double mutants of a strong atml1‐3 allele with each pdf2 allele were found to cause embryonic arrest at the globular stage. Although with low frequency, all double mutant combinations of a weak atml1‐1 allele with each pdf2 allele germinated and showed phenotypes defective in shoot epidermal cell differentiation. We further confirmed that transgenic induction of PDF2 fused to the Drosophila Engrailed repressor domain temporarily interferes with epidermal cell differentiation in the wild-type background. These results indicate that ATML1 and PDF2 act redundantly as a positive regulator of shoot epidermal cell differentiation and at least one copy of these genes is essential for embryo development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3aapical meristems 3acell differentiation 3aembryogenesis 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahomeotic genes 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3aphenotype 3atransfer DNA 0aATML1 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aEmbryo 0aEpidermis 0aHD-Zip IV 0aPDF21 aYamada, Yusuke1 aSezaki, Noriko1 aKosaka, Sho1 aKondo, Hitoshi1 aKamata, Naoko1 aAbe, Mitsutomo1 aKomeda, Yoshibumi1 aTakahashi, Taku0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2015 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.1183-1192dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcv0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245015700203300001600360500001100376520072100387592002801108596003501136650002801171650001701199650001201216650001501228650001701243650002001260650004001280650000901320700006201329700006301391773014101454856008001595852000901675655001201684IND60754877220221116153912.0211026e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075487722DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.127552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeeney, Emma L1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3234-634014aThe cheese matrix: Understanding the impact of cheese structure on aspects of cardiovascular health – A food science and a human nutrition perspective  ap. 656-670.  aREVIEW  aHealth guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat consumption due to adverse associations with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, a marker for cardiovascular disease risk. Recently, this advice is being questioned, since it does not account for the diversity of fatty acids present in different foods and may be overly simplistic. Current research suggests that for dairy foods and cheese in particular, a matrix effect exists, whereby the other components present interact with the overall structure, leading to health benefits. This review examines how factors in cheese production and processing impact this matrix, and considers how they affect biological function, and the potential impact on human health.  aPublisher supplied data  aTC20180025cEnterprise Ireland 3acardiovascular diseases 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3afat intake 3ahuman health 3ahuman nutrition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3arisk1 aLamichhane, Prabin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4658-48921 aSheehan, Jeremiah J1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1742-28270 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2021 Nov., v. 74, no. 4 p.656-670dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55233x1364-727X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.127553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013800153300001600291520126500307592002801572650002901600650002601629650002301655650002301678650001701701650002701718650001001745650002201755650001901777650000801796650001401804650001801818651001301836700001601849700001501865700001501880773011901895856007302014852000902087655001202096IND60408538820221121024005.0150908e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040853882DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.123042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, H T10aPhenotypic characterization and genetic diversity of Flavobacterium columnare isolated from red tilapia, Oreochromis sp., in Thailand  ap. 901-913.  aFlavobacterium columnare is the aetiological agent of columnaris disease and severely affects various freshwater aquaculture fish species worldwide. The objectives of this study were to determine the phenotypic characteristics and genetic variability among F. columnare isolates isolated from red tilapia in Thailand. Forty‐four F. columnare isolates were recovered from diseased fish in different geographical locations. The isolates exhibited homologous phenotypic characteristics but exhibited genetic diversity. One isolate was assigned to genomovar I, and the remainder were assigned to genomovar II, indicating the coexistence of these genomovars but predominance of genomovar II. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S‐23S ISR sequences revealed that a subset of the Thai isolates (n = 25) contained a smaller intergenic spacer region (ISR) (523–537 bp) and formed a unique ISR phylogenetic group. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene supported the unique cluster of Thai isolates. This is the first description of the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of F. columnare isolated from red tilapia in Thailand as well as five isolates of F. columnare derived from other fish species including Nile tilapia, koi carp and striped catfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aOreochromis niloticus 3acolumnaris disease 3aetiological agents 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3akoi 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aThailand1 aLaFrentz, B1 aPirarat, N1 aRodkhum, C0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.901-913dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.123043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245017500205506007600380520143400456592002801890506003701918650001701955650002501972650001401997650002802011650001102039650001502050650001702065650004302082650001602125650000902141650001102150650001302161650002702174650002502201650002102226650001002247650001702257650002102274700001702295700002002312700002202332700002102354773011902375856007602494852000902570655001202579IND60647988320221207115253.0190625e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064798832DNAL7 a10.3390/foods61201082doi7 aPMC57427762pmcid7 a292075472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleakley, Stephen10aPredicted Release and Analysis of Novel ACE-I, Renin, and DPP-IV Inhibitory Peptides from Common Oat (<em>Avena sativa</em>) Protein Hydrolysates Using in Silico Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in regulating hypertension by controlling vasoconstriction and intravascular fluid volume. RAAS itself is largely regulated by the actions of renin (EC 3.4.23.15) and the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE-I; EC 3.4.15.1). The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV; EC 3.4.14.5) also plays a role in the development of type-2 diabetes. The inhibition of the renin, ACE-I, and DPP-IV enzymes has therefore become a key therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the bioactivity of different oat (Avena sativa) protein isolates and their ability to inhibit the renin, ACE-I, and DPP-IV enzymes. In silico analysis was carried out to predictthe likelihood of bioactive inhibitory peptides occurring from oat protein hydrolysates following in silico hydrolysis with the proteases papain and ficin. Nine peptides, including FFG, IFFFL, PFL, WWK, WCY, FPIL, CPA, FLLA, and FEPL were subsequently chemically synthesised, and their bioactivities were confirmed using in vitro bioassays. The isolated oat proteins derived from seven different oat varieties were found to inhibit the ACE-I enzyme by between 86.5 ± 10.7% and 96.5 ± 25.8%, renin by between 40.5 ± 21.5% and 70.9 ± 7.6%, and DPP-IV by between 3.7 ± 3.9% and 46.2 ± 28.8%. The activity of the synthesised peptides was also determined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAvena sativa 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3aficain 3ahydrolysis 3ahypertension 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoat protein 3aoats 3apapain 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein isolates 3arenin 3atherapeutics 3avasoconstriction1 aHayes, Maria1 aO’ Shea, Nora1 aGallagher, Eimear1 aLafarga, Tomás,0 tFoods.g2017 Dec. 04, v. 6, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods61201083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245018900158300001600347520178000363592002802143650000802171650003202179650002502211650002102236650001402257650001702271650001702288650001402305650001002319650000902329650001002338650002202348650001602370650002502386650001002411650001802421650001602439650001302455650001702468650001602485650001502501650001202516650004702528650001702575650001202592650002102604653001402625653001702639653001702656653001602673653001002689653000902699653001002708653001002718700001402728700001702742700001502759700001702774700001802791700001402809773010602823856007502929852000903004655001203013IND60615110020221122233355.0181004e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061511002DNAL7 a10.1354/vp.41-5-4712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrakowka, S.10aFeatures of Cell Degeneration and Death in Hepatic Failure and Systemic Lymphoid Depletion Characteristic of Porcine Circovirus-2–associated Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Disease  ap. 471-481.  aTissue section replicates from lymphoid tissues and livers of gnotobiotic swine were examined by immunohistochemistry for the colocalization of porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) nucleocapsid and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides (UTP) onto the 3′-exposed hydroxyl groups (nick end labeling) nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (TUNEL), a marker for apoptosis. Single- and dually stained replicates from uninfected controls, subclinically affected PCV-2-infected gnotobiotic pigs, PCV-2-infected piglets immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (Cys), and PCV-2-infected piglets with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) were evaluated. Thymuses were used as positive controls for apoptosis absent PCV-2, tissue sections from dogs given hyperthermic stress were examined as positive controls for induced TUNEL. Tissues from heat-stressed dogs contained TUNEL-positive cell nuclei in both lymphoid tissues and liver, TUNEL was greatest shortly after the delivery of the hyperthermic insult. In uninfected control and subclinically affected PCV-2-infected gnotobiotic pigs, rare hepatocytes and lymphoid cells were TUNEL positive, the frequency of these was similar to that seen in uninfected controls. In PMWS-affected and Cys-treated PCV-2 piglets, the only consistent strongly positive TUNEL signal was contained within the cytoplasm of virus-positive phagocytic mononuclear cells. In phagocytes, some PCV-2 inclusions were TUNEL positive. Collectively, these data indicate that apoptosis is not the primary mechanism of lymphoid depletion and hepatocyte loss in PMWS. Apoptosis associated with systemic viral diseases may be attributable to pyrexia rather than direct or indirect effects of viruses on target cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA nucleotidyltransferases 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aanimal pathology 3aapoptosis 3acell nucleus 3acyclosporine 3acytoplasm 3adeath 3adogs 3afever 3agerm-free animals 3ahepatocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3aliver failure 3alymphocytes 3amoieties 3anucleocapsid 3anucleotides 3aphagocytes 3apiglets 3apostweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome 3athymus gland 3atissues 3awasting syndrome 0aApoptosis 0agnotobiology 0ahyperthermia 0amacrophages 0aPCV-2 0aPMWS 0aswine 0aTUNEL1 aEllis, J.1 aMcNeilly, F.1 aMeehan, B.1 aOglesbee, M.1 aAlldinger, S.1 aAllan, G.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 41, no. 5 p.471-481dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1354/vp.41-5-4713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016900159300001600328520149700344592002801841650004601869650002301915650002001938650001701958650001301975650001901988650001202007650001302019650001402032700001302046700001602059700002102075700002402096773011902120856007302239852000902312655001202321IND60408538920221122220654.0150908e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040853892DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.123032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwenteit, J M10aConstruction of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes AsaP1‐toxoid strains and study of their ability to induce immunity in Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus L.  ap. 891-900.  aThe metalloendopeptidase AsaP1 is one of the major extracellular virulence factors of A. salmonicida subsp. achromogenes, expressed as a 37‐kDa pre‐pro‐peptide and processed to a 19‐kDa active peptide. The aim of this study was to construct mutant strains secreting an AsaP1‐toxoid instead of AsaP1‐wt, to study virulence of these strains and to test the potency of the AsaP1‐toxoid bacterin and the recombinant AsaP1‐toxoids to induce protective immunity in Arctic char. Two A. salmonicida mutants were constructed that secrete either AsaP1E₂₉₄A or AsaP1Y₃₀₉F. The secreted AsaP1Y₃₀₉F‐toxoid had weak caseinolytic activity and was processed to the 19‐kDa peptide, whereas the AsaP1E₂₉₄A‐toxoid was found as a 37‐kDa pre‐pro‐peptide suggesting that AsaP1 is auto‐catalytically processed. The LD₅₀ of the AsaP1Y₃₀₉F‐toxoid mutant in Arctic char was significantly higher than that of the corresponding wt strain, and LD₅₀ of the AsaP1E₂₉₄A‐toxoid mutant was comparable with that of an AsaP1‐deficient strain. Bacterin based on AsaP1Y₃₀₉F‐toxoid mutant provided significant protection, comparable with that induced by a commercial polyvalent furunculosis vaccine. Detoxification of AsaP1 is very hard, expensive and time consuming. Therefore, an AsaP1‐toxoid‐secreting mutant is more suitable than the respective wt strain for production of fish bacterins aimed to protect against atypical furunculosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3afish production 3afurunculosis 3aimmunity 3alethal dose 50 3amutants 3avaccines 3avirulence1 aWeber, B1 aMilton, D L1 aBornscheuer, U T1 aGudmundsdottir, B K0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2015 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.891-900dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.123033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017100166300001600337520078900353592002801142650002501170650003001195650001701225650000901242650002301251650001401274650002001288650001401308650002101322700002601343700003001369700001701399700002201416773010001438856008101538852000901619655001201628IND60123597920221120120239.0150325e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012359792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-014-9824-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeshram, S.

It is striking, therefore, that little attention has been paid to the venation patterns of mutants insensitive to this hormone, since both auxin transport and perception are crucial components in theoretical models of vascular patterning. Our finding that HEMIVENATA (HVE) is the same gene as CAND1 confirms the role of ubiquitin-mediated auxin perception in vascular patterning and sets the stage for a re-examination of the leaf venation phenotypes of other auxin-resistant mutants and additional components of the ubiquitin pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aauxins 3aleaf venation 3amutants 3aphenotype 3atheoretical models 3aubiquitin1 aAlonso-Peral, María Magdalena1 aPonce, María Rosa1 aMicol, José Luis0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2007 July 1, v. 2, no. 4 p.258-259dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.2.4.38693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245014700170300001600317500001400333520089600347592002801243650002601271650001401297650002301311650000901334650001601343650002701359650003501386650001501421650001601436650002401452650001901476650000901495650001301504653002101517653002501538653002501563653001801588653001601606653002801622700002401650700002101674700003001695700002301725773008001748856008001828852000901908655001201917IND60704997420221122065238.0200729s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070499742DNAL7 a10.1163/156854109X4333712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrera, J.

The study revealed that abamectin seed treatment at concentrations ranging between 0.3 and 1 mg a.s. seed−1 is highly effective against the three species of root-knot nematodes, retaining its efficacy in the soil for 8 weeks. The highest EC50 found was reached at 0.2 mg a.s. seed−1. The highest EC80 for the number of egg masses per g root in the three Meloidogyne species was attained at 0.51 mg a.s. seed−1. Abamectin as a seed treatment is promising for the control of root-knot nematodes in the field since only low amounts of active ingredient are required to give adequate protection in the most sensitive stages of tomato root growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aabamectin 3aactive ingredients 3aeggs 3agreenhouses 3agrowth and development 3amedian effective concentration 3anematology 3aroot growth 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseed treatment 3asoil 3atomatoes 0aCHEMICAL CONTROL 0aMELOIDOGYNE JAVANICA 0aMELOIDOGYNE ARENARIA 0aDOSE RESPONSE 0aAVERMECTINS 0aLYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM1 aKiewnick, Sebastian1 aGrimm, Christoph1 aDababat, Abd el-Fattah A.1 aSikora, Richard A.0 tNematology.g, v. 11, no. 6 p.909-915dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854109X4333713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013200207300001800339500001900357520083300376592002801209650000801237650001501245650001401260650001901274650001001293650001501303650001001318650001301328650001701341650001101358650000901369650003001378650002101408650001301429650001701442700005901459700002501518700002601543700006101569700006201630700005901692773017201751856008401923852000902007655001202016IND60700174320221122013325.0200626e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070017432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c000122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdaku, Nneoma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9287-674412aA DNA Repair Inhibitor Isolated from an Ecuadorian Fungal Endophyte Exhibits Synthetic Lethality in PTEN-Deficient Glioblastoma  ap. 1899-1908.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDisruption of the tumor suppressor PTEN, either at the protein or genomic level, plays an important role in human cancer development. The high frequency of PTEN deficiency reported across several cancer subtypes positions therapeutic approaches that exploit PTEN loss-of-function with the ability to significantly impact the treatment strategies of a large patient population. Here, we report that an endophytic fungus isolated from a medicinal plant produces an inhibitor of DNA double-strand-break repair. Furthermore, the novel alkaloid product, which we have named irrepairzepine (1), demonstrated synthetic lethal targeting in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells. Our results uncover a new therapeutic lead for PTEN-deficient cancers and an important molecular tool toward enhancing the efficacy of current cancer treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aalkaloids 3acarcinogenesis 3adeath 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenomics 3aglioblastoma 3ahumans 3alead 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amedicinal plants 3apatients 3atherapeutics1 aPark, Hyun Bong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2986-38331 aSpakowicz, Daniel J.1 aTiwari, Meetu Kaushik1 aStrobel, Scott A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8402-42261 aCrawford, Jason M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7583-12421 aRogers, Faye A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1454-98920 tJournal of natural products.g2020 May 14, v. 83, no. 6 p.1899-1908dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c000123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245007700204300001800281500002000299520150400319592002801823596004501851596005501896596004001951650001801991650002602009650001902035650003302054650001502087650001602102650001102118650000902129650001702138650001002155650000902165650001502174651001202189700005502201700005902256700005802315700005902373700005502432700006502487700002602552700002102578700001802599700002002617700006302637773013202700856008002832852000902912655001202921IND60754877520221116153626.0211026e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075487752DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.157642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarasco, Ramona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4776-751910aAridity modulates belowground bacterial community dynamics in olive tree  ap. 6275-6291.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAridity negatively affects the diversity and abundance of edaphic microbial communities and their multiple ecosystem services, ultimately impacting vegetation productivity and biotic interactions. Investigation about how plant‐associated microbial communities respond to increasing aridity is of particular importance, especially in light of the global climate change predictions. To assess the effect of aridity on plant associated bacterial communities, we investigated the diversity and co‐occurrence of bacteria associated with the bulk soil and the root system of olive trees cultivated in orchards located in higher, middle and lower arid regions of Tunisia. The results indicated that the selective process mediated by the plant root system is amplified with the increment of aridity, defining distinct bacterial communities, dominated by aridity‐winner and aridity‐loser bacteria negatively and positively correlated with increasing annual rainfall, respectively. Aridity regulated also the co‐occurrence interactions among bacteria by determining specific modules enriched with one of the two categories (aridity‐winners or aridity‐losers), which included bacteria with multiple PGP functions against aridity. Our findings provide new insights into the process of bacterial assembly and interactions with the host plant in response to aridity, contributing to understand how the increasing aridity predicted by climate changes may affect the resilience of the plant holobiont.  aPublisher supplied data  a841317cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology  a245746cSeventh Framework Programme 3aOlea europaea 3abacterial communities 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3ahost plants 3aolives 3arain 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil 3avegetation 3aTunisia1 aFusi, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7433-24871 aRolli, Eleonora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5814-97351 aEttoumi, Besma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7756-85481 aTambone, Fulvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8318-54981 aBorin, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-81991 aOuzari, Hadda‐Imene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-554X1 aBoudabous, Abdellatif1 aSorlini, Claudia1 aCherif, Ameur1 aAdani, Fabrizio1 aDaffonchio, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0947-925X0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.6275-6291dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.157643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011400165300001600279500000900295520155600304592002801860650001301888650001101901650001401912650003101926650002101957650002601978650000902004650001102013650002102024650001602045700002402061773012102085856008402206852000902290655001202299IND60665293920221119173846.0191228e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066529392DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.412289x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.F.10aInheritance and Genetic Relationships of the D8 and D2-2 Restorer Genes for Cotton Cytoplasmic Male Sterility  ap. 289-294.  aepub  aIn cotton, cytoplasmic male sterility conditioned by the D₈ alloplasm (CMS-D8) is independently restored to fertility by its specific D₈ restorer (D8R) and by the D₂ restorer (D2R) that was developed for the D₂ cytoplasmic male sterile alloplasm (CMS-D2). However, knowledge of the relationship between the two restorer genes is lacking. The objectives of these studies were to determine the inheritance and genetic relationship between D2R and D8R. A series of intercrosses and test crosses were used to determine the inheritance and relationships. CMS-D2 lines crossed with D8R resulted in all sterile F₁ plants, confirming that the D8 restorer gene does not suppress D₂ cytoplasmic dysfunction. A segregation ratio of one fertile to one sterile in three testcross combinations revealed that D2R contained one restorer gene, Rf, for both CMS-D8 and CMS-D2. The Rf gene functioned sporophytically, whereas the D8R gene is known to function gametophytically. However, Rf pollen with the D₈ or D₂ cytoplasm was preferentially effective in fertilization based on the low number of sterile plants obtained when alloplasmic F₁ plants were self-pollinated or used as the pollen-parent in crosses with CMS-D8. In tests for allelism only 8 sterile plants out of 1921 were obtained in two testcrosses of (D8R × D2R)F₁ × normal cotton. Thus, the two restorer loci are not allelic but are tightly linked with an average genetic distance of 0.93 cM. The D₂ gene Rf is redesignated Rf ₁, and Rf ₂ is assigned to the D₈ restorer gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallelism 3acotton 3acytoplasm 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3agenetic distance 3agenetic relationships 3aloci 3apollen 3aself-pollination 3atestcrosses1 aStewart, James McD.0 tCrop science.g2001 Mar., v. 41, no. 2 p.289-294dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.412289x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245011200156300001800268520184700286592002802133650001002161650000902171650001202180650002002192650001002212650002202222650001102244650001202255650001502267650001202282650002902294650002102323650001002344650001102354650001602365650001202381650002502393650001202418650002302430650001802453650001502471650002602486650001402512651001602526653002002542653001402562653001502576653001902591700001902610700002202629773009802651856007102749852000902820655001202829IND60081737220221123045048.0141014s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008173722DNAL7 a10.1071/AN144372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, David10aDecreasing methane emissions from ruminants grazing forages: a fit with productive and financial realities?  ap. 1141-1154.  aRuminants contribute to human food supply and also anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An understanding of production systems and information on animal populations has enabled global inventories of ruminant GHG emissions (methane and nitrous oxide), and dietary strategies are being developed to reduce GHG emissions from ruminants. Mitigation strategies need to consider the management/feeding systems used to ensure that these strategies will be readily accepted and adopted by farmers. Housed systems allow diets to be formulated in ways that may reduce GHG production, but the challenge is much greater for systems where animals graze outdoors for long periods. A methane mitigation option in the form of fresh forage would be desirable in livestock production systems with high reliance on grazing. A brief summary of New Zealand research, carried out on fresh grasses, legumes, herbs and crops, suggest that we have an incomplete understanding of the feed characteristics that define a ‘high’ or a ‘low’ methane feed. The variation in methane emissions measured between feeds, individual animals and experiment is large, even in controlled conditions, and the dynamic nature of sward-animal interactions will only exacerbate this variation, creating challenges beyond the identification of mitigants. Furthermore, implementation of knowledge gained from controlled studies requires validation under grazing systems to identify any trade-offs between methane reduction and animal productivity or emission of other pollutants. Therefore, investment and research should be targeted at mitigation options that can and will be adopted on-farm, and the characteristics of temperate grasslands farming suggest that these options may differ from those for intensive (high input/output) or extensive (low input/output) systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3adiet 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afeeds 3afood availability 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aherbs 3ahumans 3ainventories 3alegumes 3alivestock production 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrous oxide 3apollutants 3aproduction technology 3aruminants 3aNew Zealand 0aenteric methane 0alivestock 0amitigation 0asustainability1 aWaghorn, Garry1 aJanssen, Peter H.0 tAnimal production science.g2014, v. 54, no. 9 p.1141-1154dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN144373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009400172300001600266520154000282592002801822653002301850653001901873653001401892653001201906653002101918700001901939773010301958856008702061852000902148655001202157IND60594129920221120190544.0180510e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059412992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelinsky, A.G.10aElectrochemical oxidation of sulfite and sulfur dioxide at a renewable graphite electrode  ap. 371-378.  aElectrochemical oxidation of S(IV) species which are present in the aqueous solutions of sodium sulfite or are formed during the dissolution of gaseous sulfur dioxide was studied on a renewable graphite electrode as the dependence on the concentration of these particles, electrode potential and pH of solution. The voltammograms in acid and alkaline sulfite solutions have different shapes. In acid solutions, this is a voltammograms with a sole maximum of current near 1.0V. In alkaline solutions, this is a curve with two maxima; the first of them appears around 0.6V, while the second one is near 1.0V, similarly to the case of acid solutions. Analysis of the behavior of j-E curves and calculations of the equilibrium composition of the solution indicate that the maximum of current near 0.6V is connected with the oxidation of SO32− ions. The maximum of current near 1.0V is mainly due to the oxidation of HSO3− ions which are present in acid solutions in bulk, while in alkaline solutions they might be formed in the near-electrode layer of solution as a product of the chemical reaction that follows the reaction of oxidation of sulfite ions. The results give use reason to assume that acid or basic surface oxides that are formed on graphite surface participate not only in the processes of oxygen evolution on this electrode but also in the processes of oxidation of S(IV) species. Their participation causes substantial difference in the potentials of oxidation of the indicated particles in alkaline and acid solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 0agraphite electrode 0asulfur dioxide 0abisulfite 0asulfite 0aelectrooxidation1 aPirogov, B.Ya.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 231 p.371-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245010100157300001600258520158700274592002801861650002101889650001201910650001901922650002101941650001301962650001401975650000901989650001101998650001302009650001802022650001502040650001902055650002502074650001302099653001802112653002702130653002902157653000902186653002302195653002102218653001902239653002502258653001802283653001402301700001702315700001802332700002202350773010602372856007502478852000902553655001202562IND60615110220221122231859.0181004e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061511022DNAL7 a10.1354/vp.41-5-4902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabelle, P.10aIndicators of Malignancy of Canine Adrenocortical Tumors: Histopathology and Proliferation Index  ap. 490-497.  aTumors of the adrenal cortex account for 10–20% of the naturally occurring Cushing's syndrome diagnosed in dogs. Differentiating between adrenocortical adenoma and carcinomas is often difficult. The purposes of this study were to determine which histopathologic criteria can be used as markers for malignancy in canine adrenocortical tumors and the relevance of the proliferation marker, Ki-67, for differentiation between cortical adenomas and carcinomas. Twenty-six adrenocortical carcinomas, 23 adenomas, and 11 normal adrenal glands were examined. Morphologic criteria significantly associated with adrenocortical carcinomas included a size larger than 2 cm in diameter, peripheral fibrosis, capsular invasion, trabecular growth pattern, hemorrhage, necrosis, and single-cell necrosis, whereas hematopoiesis, fibrin thombi, and cytoplasmic vacuolation were significantly associated with adrenocortical adenomas. The mean (± SD) proliferation index, measured by immunohistochemistry for the Ki-67 antigen, was 9.3 ± 6.3% in carcinomas, 0.76 ± 0.83% in adenomas, and 0.58 ± 0.57% in normal adrenal glands. The Ki-67 proliferation index was significantly higher in carcinomas compared with adenomas and normal adrenal glands. A threshold value of the proliferation index of 2.4% reliably separated carcinomas from adenomas. Based on these results, it appears that thorough evaluation of morphologic features combined with immunohistochemical assessment of the proliferation index is extremely useful for differentiating between adrenocortical adenomas and carcinomas in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCushing syndrome 3aadenoma 3aadrenal cortex 3aanimal pathology 3aantigens 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3afibrin 3afibrosis 3ahematopoiesis 3ahemorrhage 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3anecrosis 0aAdrenal gland 0aadrenocortical adenoma 0aadrenocortical carcinoma 0adogs 0aendocrine diseases 0aendocrine system 0ahistopathology 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aKi-67 antigen 0aneoplasms1 aKyles, A.

The influence of the three‐spined stickleback CPUE by trap model, baiting and visual attractors was investigated. One trap type was found to out‐perform the other; however, baiting or attractors did not influence the CPUE. Hence, the results suggest that while the choice of trap type may have an impact on the three‐spined stickleback CPUE, baiting or attractors do not seem to improve the impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abaiting 3amodels0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2015 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.905-908dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0175-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.128103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245013800192300001600330520103300346592002801379650001801407650001901425650001001444650001101454650001001465650001701475650002101492650002301513650000901536650001901545650003201564650001201596650002601608650002201634650003001656650000901686650005101695650002101746650003501767650000901802650001701811653001801828653001101846653001301857653001701870653000801887653000901895653000901904653000801913653000801921653000801929653000801937653000901945653000901954653000801963653000901971653000801980653001001988653000801998653001002006653001002016653001302026653001202039653000802051653000802059653000802067653000902075653000802084653000902092700002502101700002502126700002402151700002602175700001902201700002602220700002402246700002302270773009002293856008402383852000902467655001202476IND60086749520221120172146.0160903e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008674952DNAL7 a237968022pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.05.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Susana P.10aDioxin-induced acute cardiac mitochondrial oxidative damage and increased activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in Wistar rats  ap. 281-290.  aThe environmental dioxin 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen and teratogenic agent. We hypothesize that TCDD-induced oxidative stress may also interfere with mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP), which are known to regulate and to be regulated by mitochondrial redox state. We investigated the effects of an acute treatment of male Wistar rats with TCDD (50 μg/kg i.p.) and measured the regulation of cardiac mitoKATP. While the function of cardiac mitochondria was slightly depressed, mitoKATP activity was 52% higher in animals treated with TCDD. The same effects were not observed in liver mitochondria isolated from the same animals. Our data also shows that regulation of mitochondrial ROS production by mitoKATP activity is different in both groups. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that TCDD increases mitoKATP activity in the heart, which may counteract the increased oxidative stress caused by the dioxin during acute exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aacute exposure 3aheart 3ahumans 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apotassium channels 3arats 3ateratogenicity 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aDioxinsxtoxicity 2aKATP Channelsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMitochondria, Liverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPotassium Channelsxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0aBioenergetics 0aDioxin 0amitoKATP 0aMitochondria 0aROS 0aTCDD 0a5-HD 0aADP 0aAhR 0aATP 0aBSA 0aΔΨ 0aDMSO 0aDNA 0aDNPH 0aDZX 0aHEPES 0aHRP 0aHW/BW 0aLW/BW 0amitoKATP 0aPCDD/Fs 0aRCR 0aROS 0aSDS 0aTCDD 0aTFA 0aTPP+1 aPereira, Gonçalo C.1 aPereira, Cláudia V.1 aCarvalho, Filipa S.1 aCordeiro, Marília H.1 aMota, Paula C.1 aRamalho-Santos, João1 aMoreno, António J.1 aOliveira, Paulo J.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Sept., v. 180 p.281-290dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012100167300001800288500002000306500000900326520161100335592002801946596003501974596004902009650002202058650001202080650001602092650001602108650001202124650001302136650001602149650002402165650001902189650001102208650001302219700002302232700002002255700002002275700002002295773013202315856008402447852000902531655001202540IND60665294020221119174036.0220805e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066529402DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2018.06.04002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidhu, Harjot10aCoating of Hulled Seeds Improved Field Plantability and Grain Yield of Extra‐Large Confectionary Sunflower Achenes  ap. 1182-1190.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aExtra‐large (XL) hybrid confection sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) achenes are popular among snack food consumers, but these achenes perform poorly with precision planters; therefore, the option of planting coated seed from XL achenes was evaluated in this study. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effect of various coating materials and buildup levels on live seed emergence, precision planting, stand establishment, and crop performance under field conditions. Based on the laboratory results on germination and plantability, four coating materials (polymer A, polymer B, zeolite, and lime) at 30 and 35% buildup levels were selected for the field trails at Prosper, ND. A separate smaller field study was conducted at Minot, ND, to verify the performance of coated seed under different growing conditions. At both Prosper and Minot locations, all the coated seed treatments resulted in significantly higher live seed emergence and grain yield than XL achenes. Live seed emergence of all the coated seed (93–99%) was significantly higher than the XL achenes (88%), and similar or higher than the large achenes (94%) at Prosper. Laboratory singulation of all the coated seed was superior to both XL achenes and large achenes, which contributed to uniform seed spacing in the field for the coated seed. Overall, this study showed that coating the hulled seeds substantially increased seed plantability and crop performance compared with XL achenes and even large achenes. A successful outcome of this study may extend this research to other sunflower seed sizes and possibly other crops.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Sunflower Association  cNorth Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station 3aHelianthus annuus 3aachenes 3agermination 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3apolymers 3asnack foods 3astand establishment 3asunflower seed 3asweets 3azeolites1 aWiesenborn, Dennis1 aJohnson, Burton1 aMonono, Ewumbua1 aEriksmoen, Eric0 tCrop science.g2019 May, v. 59, no. 3 p.1182-1190dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2018.06.04003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100002300163245012500186300001600311520141700327592002801744650001801772650002001790650002101810650002501831650002601856650001801882650001701900650000801917650001501925650001401940700002001954700002001974700002301994700002202017700002002039700001902059700001902078700002002097700002102117773012702138856004502265852000902310655001202319IND50073605720221118023130.0140304e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007360572DNAL7 a241273382pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2013003212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrassburg, Katrin10aPostprandial fatty acid specific changes in circulating oxylipins in lean and obese men after high‐fat challenge tests  ap. 591-600.  aSCOPE: Circulating oxylipins may affect peripheral tissues and are assumed to play an important role in endothelial function. They are esterified in triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins that are increased after a high‐fat (HF) meal, depending on BMI and fatty acid (FA) type. Yet, it is unclear which oxylipins appear in circulation after HF meals differing in FA composition. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a double‐blind randomized crossover challenge study, we characterized the postprandial oxylipin response after different HF challenges in lean and obese men receiving HF milkshakes, either high in saturated FAs (SFA), monounsaturated FAs (MUFA), or omega 3 (n‐3) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA). Plasma oxylipin profiles were significantly altered at 2 and 4 h after shake consumption when compared to baseline. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) derived oxylipins increased after n‐3 PUFA shake consumption. MUFA shake consumption increased levels of cytochrome P450 mediated oxylipins. SFA shake consumption led to strong increases in linoleic acid (LA) derived HODEs. No differences were observed between lean and obese individuals at baseline and after any shake consumption. CONCLUSION: We are the first demonstrating acute effects on circulating oxylipins after HF meal challenges. These changes were strongly influenced by different dietary FAs and may affect endothelial function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3abody mass index 3acytochrome P-450 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3alinoleic acid 3alipoproteins 3amen 3amilkshakes 3aoxylipins1 aEsser, Diederik1 aVreeken, Rob J.1 aHankemeier, Thomas1 aMüller, Michael,1 aDuynhoven, John1 aGolde, Jolanda1 aDijk, Susan J.1 aAfman, Lydia A.1 aJacobs, Doris M.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2014 Mar., v. 58, no. 3 p.591-600dWiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Under conditions of large-scale habitat loss, secondary vegetation can be important for woodland biodiversity conservation. This study compares avian abundance and diversity in secondary vegetation on Viti Levu, Fiji. We use avian point surveys at replicate sites in regenerating mahogany plantation (Colo-i-Suva; eastern lowlands), regenerating native forest (Koroyanitu National Heritage Park; western highlands) and grassland (Koroyanitu National Heritage Park). We ask if there are differences in avian abundance and species richness across habitat types. In total, we recorded 1063 birds from 33 bird species. Regenerating forest sites had the greatest species richness with mostly endemic and native woodland bird species and few introduced species. Regenerating plantation sites harboured a comparable number of endemic species and threatened species as regenerating forest sites but had significantly fewer native species and no introduced species. We recorded the most birds at grassland sites as well as the most introduced species. The findings of this study underscore the importance of regenerating native forest and regenerating plantation as habitats for Fiji’s endemic woodland birds. Increasing the expanse of regenerating forest sites should be considered for conservation planning to sustain Fiji’s extant birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeliaceae 3abiodiversity conservation 3abirds 3adeforestation 3aextinction 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alowlands 3aplanning 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3awoodlands 3aFiji 0aPacific Island 0aavian 0abiodiversity 0apoint survey 0aSwietenia macrophylla1 aNaikatani, Alivereti1 aKeppel, Gunnar1 aKleindorfer, Sonia0 tEmu.g2019 July 3, v. 119, no. 3 p.286-295dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2019.16077573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010700167300001600274500001400290520154100304592002801845650001301873650002601886650002501912650001501937650001401952650001801966653002301984653001802007653001402025700002402039700002302063700002002086700001802106700002402124700002602148700001702174700002102191773008002212856008002292852000902372655001202381IND60704997620221122065214.0200729s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070499762DNAL7 a10.1163/156854109X4568622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Megen, Hanny12aA phylogenetic tree of nematodes based on about 1200 full-length small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences  ap. 927-950.  aNAL-light  aAs a result of the scarcity of informative morphological and anatomical characters, nematode systematics have always been volatile. Differences in the appreciation of these characters have resulted in numerous classifications and this greatly confuses scientific communication. An advantage of the use of molecular data is that it allows for an enormous expansion of the number of characters. Here we present a phylogenetic tree based on 1215 small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences (ca 1700 bp each) covering a wide range of nematode taxa. Of the 19 nematode orders mentioned by De Ley et al. (2006) 15 are represented here. Compared with Holterman et al. (2006) the number of taxa analysed has been tripled. This did not result in major changes in the clade subdivision of the phylum, although a decrease in the number of well supported nodes was observed. Especially at the family level and below we observed a considerable congruence between morphology and ribosomal DNA-based nematode systematics and, in case of discrepancies, morphological or anatomical support could be found for the alternative grouping in most instances. The extensiveness of convergent evolution is one of the most striking phenomena observed in the phylogenetic tree presented here – it is hard to find a morphological, ecological or biological characteristic that has not arisen at least twice during nematode evolution. Convergent evolution appears to be an important additional explanation for the seemingly persistent volatility of nematode systematics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acommunication (human) 3aconvergent evolution 3anematology 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 0aNEMATODE EVOLUTION 0aDNA BARCODING 0aMOLECULAR1 avan den Elsen, Sven1 aHolterman, Martijn1 aKarssen, Gerrit1 aMooyman, Paul1 aBongers, T.q(Tom),1 aHolovachov, Oleksandr1 aBakker, Jaap1 aHelder, Johannes0 tNematology.g, v. 11, no. 6 p.927-950dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854109X4568623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245009300173300001600266520140100282592002801683653002301711653001901734653001101753653001601764700002101780700002401801700001601825773008601841856007701927852000902004655001202013IND60131103020221118182327.0151127e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013110302DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-04-210.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČiuberkis, S.q(Steponas),10aEffect of Weed Emergence Time and Intervals of Weed and Crop Competition on Potato Yield  ap. 213-218.  aA field study was conducted at Vezaiciai branch of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture from 1998 to 2000 to determine weed emergence dynamics in potato and to estimate the effect of different intervals of weed crop competition on potato tuber yield. Treatments varying in intervals of weed-free conditions and competition were laid out in a randomized complete block design with six replications. The greatest emergence of annual broadleaf weeds (62 to 86%% of the season total) in the crop was observed in the period from potato planting until flowering. Emergence of winter annuals such as field violet and scentless mayweed was greatest in the period from the 20-cm potato plant height until harvesting. Competition was most detrimental to potato tuber yield in the periods from planting until flowering, from planting until 25 d after flowering, or for the entire growing season. Potato tuber yield decreased by 8.1, 8.4, and 6.4%%, respectively, during these competition intervals compared to the weed-free treatment. The results indicated that the critical weed-free period, when weed competition was detrimental to yield, started from planting until 25 d after flowering if regular interrow cultivation was applied.Nomenclature: Field violet, Viola arvensis Mur VIOAR, scentless mayweed, Tripleurospermum perforatum (Merat) M.Lainz MATIN, Potato, Solanum tuberosum L. ‘‘Mirta’’  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrop growth stages 0aweed emergence 0apotato 0acompetition1 aBernotas, Stasys1 aRaudonius, Steponas1 aFelix, Joel0 tWeed technology.g2007 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.213-218dThe Societyx0890-037X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWT-04-210.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002600183245007100209300001600280506007600296520150000372592002801872506003701900650001201937650001301949650001701962650001401979650001101993650001602004650001502020650001602035773011702051856007602168852000902244655001202253IND60690053720221207101708.0200425e20070701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069005372DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.2.4.38722doi7 aPMC26341442pmcid7 a197046752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallejo-Marín, Mario14aThe Paradox of Clonality and the Evolution of Self-Incompatibility  ap. 265-266.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the January issue of New Phytologist Vallejo-Marín and O’Brien1 documented that in the genus Solanum (Solanaceae) clonality and self-incompatibility, a common genetic mechanism enforcing cross-fertilization, co-occur more often than expected by chance. Using a phylogenetic approach the authors showed that the statistical association between clonality and self-incompatibility persists even after taking into account phylogenetic relationships among species, uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction, and associations between clonality and life history (annual/perennial). Vallejo-Marín and O’Brien1 suggest that clonality and self-incompatibility tend to co-occur because clonality, by allowing the persistence and propagation of a genotype in environments with limited pollinator or mate availability, reduces the selective pressure favoring the breakdown of self-incompatibility. In addition to promoting the maintenance of self-incompatibility, when clonality results in the spatial aggregation of genetically identical individuals, clonality may promote its breakdown by restricting pollen transfer between different genotypes. Here I call attention to these contradictory predictions of the effects of clonality on the evolution of self-incompatibility, and suggest that the outcome of this paradox depend on both the extent to which clonal propagation compensates for limited seed production, and on the extent to which clonality reduces pollen transfer between genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum 3agenotype 3alife history 3aphylogeny 3apollen 3apollinators 3aprediction 3auncertainty0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2007 July 1, v. 2, no. 4 p.265-266dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.2.4.38723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011800159300001600277520129000293592002801583650002701611650001701638650001601655650001301671650001101684650002901695650002101724650001501745650001101760650001301771650002101784650001401805650001901819650001701838650001401855700001701869700001901886700001601905773010001921856008102021852000902102655001202111IND60123598320221123030453.0150325e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012359832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-014-9829-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Bao12aA new integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system consisting of Styela clava, microalgae, and Stichopus japonicus  ap. 471-497.  aThe possibility of the integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) model consisting of Styela clava, microalgae, and Stichopus japonicus was examined in this research, in which microalgae could remove dissolvable nutrients produced by S. clava and S. japonicus to maintain the dissolvable nutrients at a lower level, and provide sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water body through photosynthesis at the same time. S. clava helped accumulate organic matter in the sediments, and the content of total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediments was significantly higher in the groups of S. clava than that in the control without ascidian. S. japonicus were able to effectively remove the particulate organic carbon and nitrogen from the sediments, and hence an obvious decrease in TOC and total nitrogen on the surface sediments. It was also found that the reproduction of bacteria on the surface sediments attributed to the biological interference of S. japonicus. It is concluded from our experiments that the IMTA system of microalgae–S. clava–S. japonicus does not have organic matter accumulated in the sediments, or the dissolved organic matter polluted, which indicates that this IMTA model is not only an aquaculture system, but also a system purifying N and P in the water body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aStyela clava 3aaquaculture 3abacteria 3acarbon 3adissolved organic matter 3adissolved oxygen 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3areproduction 3asediments1 aChen, Lihong1 aXing, Ronglian1 aJiang, Aili0 tAquaculture international.g2015 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.471-497dSpringer-Verlagx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-014-9829-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245013600183300001600319520102800335592002801363650000801391650001601399650001201415650001201427650002901439650002301468650001001491650002501501650001401526650001401540650001001554650003101564650002901595650004701624650002901671650004101700651001101741651001101752653002001763653001601783653002301799653001801822653001901840700002101859700001701880700002501897700001601922773009001938856008402028852000902112655001202121IND60086749720221120172149.0160903e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008674972DNAL7 a237478192pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTassi, F.10aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air from Nisyros Island (Dodecanese Archipelago, Greece): Natural versus anthropogenic sources  ap. 111-121.  aThis study presents the chemical composition of VOCs in air and gas discharges collected at Nisyros Island (Dodecanese Archipelago, Greece). The main goals are i) to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic VOC sources and ii) to evaluate their impact on local air quality. Up to 63 different VOCs were recognized and quantitatively determined in 6 fumaroles and 19 air samples collected in the Lakki caldera, where fumarolic emissions are located, and the outer ring of the island, including the Mandraki village and the main harbor. Air samples from the crater area show significant concentrations of alkanes, alkenes, cyclic, aromatics, and S- and O-bearing heterocycles directly deriving from the hydrothermal system, as well as secondary O-bearing compounds from oxidation of primary VOCs. At Mandraki village, C6H6/Σ(methylated aromatics) and Σ(linear)/Σ(branched) alkanes ratios <1 allow to distinguish an anthropogenic source related to emissions from outlet pipes of touristic and private boats and buses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaromatic compounds 3aboats 3achemical composition 3aemissions 3aoxidation 3apipes 3avolatile organic compounds 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 3aGreece 0aGreece 0aVOC composition 0aAir quality 0aHydrothermal fluid 0aAir pollution 0aNisyros Island1 aCapecchiacci, F.1 aGiannini, L.1 aVougioukalakis, G.E.1 aVaselli, O.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Sept., v. 180 p.111-121dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245009000198300001800288500001100306520109000317592002801407596005401435650001601489650001901505650001901524650001601543650001801559650001501577650001401592650002101606650001701627650000901644700005801653700006101711773012601772856007301898852000901971655001201980IND60746164020221119085758.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074616402DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.134392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardi, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5508-197410aDeterminants of root system architecture for future‐ready, stress‐resilient crops  ap. 2090-2097.  aREVIEW  aClimate change hampers food safety and food security. Crop breeding has been boosting superior quantity traits such as yield, but roots have often been overlooked in spite of their role in the whole plant physiology. New evidence is emerging on the relevance of root system architecture in coping with the environment. Here, we review determinants of root system architecture, mainly based on studies on Arabidopsis, and we discuss how breeding for appropriate root architecture may help obtain plants that are better adapted or resilient to abiotic and biotic stresses, more productive, and more efficient for soil and water use. We also highlight recent advances in phenotyping high‐tech platforms and genotyping techniques that may further help to understand the mechanisms of root development and how roots control relationships between plants and soil. An integrated approach is proposed that combines phenotyping and genotyping information via bioinformatic analyses and reveals genetic control of root system architecture, paving the way for future research on plant breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aDBA.AD003.139cConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche 3aArabidopsis 3abioinformatics 3aclimate change 3afood safety 3afood security 3agenotyping 3aphenotype 3aplant physiology 3aroot systems 3asoil1 aDe Gara, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5938-71131 aLoreto, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9171-26810 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2021 Aug., v. 172, no. 4 p.2090-2097dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.134393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012300153300001800276500002000294520151500314592002801829650001701857650002001874650001301894650002101907650002201928650001301950650001101963650001701974650001801991650001502009650002302024651001602047700002102063773013002084856007202214852000902286655001202295IND60653069020221120131026.0190713e20150417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065306902DNAL7 a10.3390/w70416492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, Dan10aCombining Choice Analysis with Stakeholder Consultation to Assess Management Options for New Zealand’s Hurunui River  ap. 1649-1669.  aJournal Article  aChoice experiments can be designed using information gathered in stakeholder consultation processes. Information from these two sources can be used to consider both consultation outcomes and population preferences in environmental decision making. This approach is demonstrated using a case study of New Zealand’s Hurunui River which has been hotly contested between those who seek to divert water and increase agricultural production and those who would like to see the river undeveloped and the natural resources in the river and catchment improved. Data from the choice experiment is used to describe and quantify the preferences of Canterbury Region residents for existing conditions (good quality in the main river and poor quality in the tributaries) and potential future land use scenarios for the catchment. Six scenarios ranging from forestry to intensive irrigation could result in deterioration or improvement. Quantitative information from the choice experiment was provided to policy makers as they considered the outcomes of the consultation process. Community stakeholders agreed on a development strategy for the Hurunui catchment that would improve water quality in the tributaries and maintain quality in the main river. Results from the choice experiment support this approach. Willingness to pay for improvements in the main river was limited but residents would require substantial compensation before they would accept a decline in water quality in the main river or in the tributaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aforestry 3airrigation rates 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3arivers 3astakeholders 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awillingness to pay 3aNew Zealand1 aPhillips, Yvonne0 tWater.g2015 Apr. 17, v. 7, no. 4 p.1649-1669dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w70416493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245014700212300001400359520192200373592002802295653001102323653001602334653002402350653001402374653003102388653001402419653002502433653001802458653002902476700002102505700002202526700002602548700002202574773010402596856008202700852000902782655001202791IND60594195820221119182909.0180510e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059419582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exer.2018.03.0252doi7 aPMC59941962pmcid7 a295968502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, Carla S.10aPosterior stromal cell apoptosis triggered by mechanical endothelial injury and basement membrane component nidogen-1 production in the cornea  ap. 30-35.  aThis study was performed to determine whether cells in the posterior stroma undergo apoptosis in response to endothelial cell injury and to determine whether basement membrane component nidogen-1 was present in the cornea. New Zealand White rabbits had an olive tip cannula inserted into the anterior chamber to mechanically injure corneal endothelial cells over an 8 mm diameter area of central cornea with minimal injury to Descemet's membrane. At 1 h (6 rabbits) and 4 h (6 rabbits) after injury, three corneas at each time point were cryopreserved in OCT for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vimentin and nidogen-1, and three corneas at each time point were fixed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Uninjured corneas were controls. Stromal cells over approximately the posterior 25% of the stroma overlying to the site of corneal endothelial injury underwent apoptosis detected by the TUNEL assay. Many of these apoptotic cells were vimentin+, suggesting they were likely keratocytes or corneal fibroblasts. Stromal cells peripheral to the site of endothelial injury and more anterior stromal cells overlying the site of endothelial injury did not undergo apoptosis. Stromal cell death was confirmed to be apoptosis by TEM. No apoptosis of stromal cells was detected in control, uninjured corneas. Nidogen-1 was detected in the stroma of unwounded corneas, with higher nidogen-1 in the posterior stroma than the anterior stroma. After endothelial scrape injury, concentrations of nidogen-1 appeared to be in the extracellular matrix of the posterior stroma and, possibly, within apoptotic bodies of stromal cells. Thus, posterior stromal cells, likely including keratocytes, undergo apoptosis in response to corneal endothelial injury, analogous to anterior keratocytes undergoing apoptosis in response to epithelial injury.  aPublisher supplied data 0aStroma 0akeratocytes 0aCorneal fibroblasts 0aApoptosis 0aCorneal endothelial injury 0aNidogen-1 0aCornea wound healing 0aEndotheliitis 0aViral defense mechanisms1 aLassance, Lucian1 aSaikia, Paramanda1 aSanthiago, Marcony R.1 aWilson, Steven E.0 tExperimental Eye Research.g2018 July, v. 172 p.30-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:26736x0014-48357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010300167300001600270520118100286592002801467650002601495650001301521650001301534650002101547650001601568650002201584650001201606650001501618651001301633700002001646773009601666856004801762852000901810655001201819IND4458893520221122121743.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445889352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-011-0186-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Stephen A.10aInvasion genetics of Microstegium vimineum (Poaceae) within the James River Basin of Virginia, USA  ap. 793-803.  aPatterns of spatial genetic structure produced following the expansion of an invasive species into novel habitats reflect demographic processes that have shaped the genetic structure we see today. We examined 359 individuals from 23 populations over 370Â km within the James River Basin of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin. Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However, surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead to better management strategies for control and eradication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrostegium vimineum 3agenetics 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aoutcrossing 3asecondary contact 3aselfing 3awatersheds 3aVirginia1 aDyer, Rodney J.0 tConservation genetics.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 3 p.793-803dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-011-0186-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011300160300001600273500001500289520132600304592002801630650001201658650001701670650002401687650002101711650001501732650001101747650001301758653001401771700001801785700001701803773011001820856008101930852000902011655001202020IND60586892820221118185408.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058689282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3477-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiu10aRelative contributions of leaf litter and fine roots to soil organic matter accumulation in mangrove forests  ap. 493-503.  a2019-12-06  aAIMS: Mangrove above- and belowground litter contributes greatly to soil carbon (C) especially in systems with limited allochthonous input. This study aims to estimate the relative contributions of mangrove leaf litter vs. fine roots to the annually accumulated plant debris in the soil. METHODS: Annual production of leaf litter and fine roots in four mono-specific mangrove forests was combined with their mass remaining after one year of decomposition to make the estimation. RESULTS: Annual fine root production was 2.2–5.1 times greater than leaf litter production, which ranged between 266 and 814 g m⁻². After 391 days of decomposition, 0–41% and 75–88% of leaf litter and fine root initial mass respectively remained. Only 5.9–69 months were expected for leaf litter to reach an approximately complete decomposition, in contrast to 111–655 months expected for fine roots. Annual plant detritus accumulation in the soil amounted to 405–2812 g m⁻², with leaf litter and fine roots contributing 2.5–7.6% and 92.4–97.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fine roots are the dominant contributor to soil organic matter accumulation in mangroves due to high production and low decomposition rates. Management practices that foster fine root production are expected to accelerate soil C accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3aplant litter 3asoil organic matter 3amangrove forests 3afine roots 3acarbon 3adetritus 0amangroves1 aXiong, Yanmei1 aLiao, Baowen0 tPlant and soil.g2017 Dec., v. 421, no. 1-2 p.493-503dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3477-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010700163300001800270500001900288520055600307592002800863650001300891650002500904650001700929650001100946650001900957700001900976700001400995700001701009700002001026700005801046700005501104773012101159856008301280852000901363655001201372IND60720809720221120072327.0201220e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072080972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c035152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xia10aSynthesis of 1,3-Benzodiazepines through [5 + 2] Annulation of N-Aryl Amidines with Propargylic Esters  ap. 9506-9512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, an efficient synthesis of functionalized 1,3-benzodiazepines through an unprecedented [5 + 2] annulation of N-aryl amidines with propargylic esters is presented.

Weekday-weekend sleep times reported in 19 previously published papers for 20 samples of morning- and evening-oriented individuals were utilized as an input to the model. The results of statistical analyses and simulations of these times suggested that 1) sleep cannot be caught up on weekends and 2) evening- and morning-oriented individuals are not, in general, dissimilar on the amount of weekday sleep. We concluded that chronobiologial mechanisms underlying “social jetlag” require rethinking and that studying mathematical models of sleep-wake regulatory process allow the quantitative predictions about weekday sleep loss in different ages and diurnal types.  aAAP, EGV, and OGD were supported by a grant from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research [grant number 16-06-00235-a], and ONT and VBD were supported by a grant from the Russian Foundation for Humanities [grant number № 16-06-01054/17-ОГОН].  aPublisher supplied data  a16-06-00235-a  a16-06-01054/17-ОГОН 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3asleep 3asleep disorders 3astatistical analysis 0aSleep-wake regulation 0atwo-process model 0amorningness-eveningness 0aearly type 0alate type 0asleep timing 0asleep duration 0asleep debt 0asleep deprivation 0asimulation1 aVerevkin, Evgeniy G.1 aDonskaya, Olga G.1 aTkachenko, Olga N.1 aDorokhov, Vladimir B.0 tBiological rhythm research.g2020 July 03, v. 51, no. 5 p.709-726dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2018.15587353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245011400200300001600314520123300330592002801563650001701591650001401608650001301622650001601635650001801651650003001669650001501699650001001714650000901724650001901733650001801752650002201770653001401792653001001806653001201816653001901828653003701847700001801884700001401902700001601916773014601932856008202078852000902160655001202169IND60628060620221117031108.0190129e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062806062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0747-347910aGut dysbiosis-derived exosomes trigger hepatic steatosis by transiting HMGB1 from intestinal to liver in mice  ap. 767-772.  aIn the past decade, research on the biology of the gut-liver axis has assisted in understanding the basic biology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, in its role as a crucial injury-related molecule, displays a substantial correlation with the degree of liver steatosis. However, its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the current study of ASC−/- mice on a high-fat diet (HFD), we observed disorder of the gut microbiota along with abnormal increases in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and in Streptomyces, both of which were detected by 16S rDNA sequencing. Therefore, we investigated the intestinal mucosal injury and analyzed the NAFLD activity score and found that the ASC−/--HFD group was more severely impaired than the others. Moreover, HMGB1 increased significantly in the intestinal tissue and was co-localized with an exosomal marker. We revealed that HMGB1 was significantly elevated in the exosomes of the ASC−/--HFD group. It transported by exosomes from the intestine to the liver, thereby triggering hepatic steatosis when dysbiosis. In conclusion, the findings indicated that HMGB1 plays a crucial role in the gut-liver axis mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3adysbiosis 3aexosomes 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliver 3amice 3anucleoproteins 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 0aDysbiosis 0aHMGB1 0aExosome 0aGut-liver axis 0aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease1 aSun, Huanhuan1 aBai, Yang1 aZhi, Fachao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Feb. 12, v. 509, no. 3 p.767-772dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010100175300001600276520134400292536030501636592002801941650002101969650002101990650001102011650002002022650001102042653001302053653002102066653002502087653002002112653002102132700002202153773012002175856008502295852000902380655001202389IND60701255420221119145058.0200710e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070125542DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2018.15587422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar Swain, Rakesh10aHabitual daily ‘Good Morning’ message senders reveal the status of their own circadian clock  ap. 735-746.  aAs of October 2018, about 1.5 billion people around the world use WhatsApp (WA) for messaging, chatting, and for sharing pictures and videos. Indians send “Good Morning” messages religiously to their online friends and acquaintances almost every day. However, we hardly know about the psychophysiological basis of the behavior characterized by habitual conveyance of “Good Morning,” and “Good Night,” messages using online Apps. In this study, we attempted to analyze at the individual level if this behavior on WA reflects the user’s circadian timing system. We retrieved chats with time stamps from eight subjects and computed periods of the daily “good morning” messaging behavior of each subject. We computed deviations of average periods in each subject from the theoretical circadian period. Single sample two-tailed t-test revealed that none of the average periods of daily message sending habits of eight subjects was statistically significantly different from the theoretical circadian period of the population. All eight subjects, therefore, revealed entrained circadian rhythm in their messaging behavior. This is perhaps the first study to propose that the timings of the social media messages could be used to gauge the status of the endogenous circadian clock of the users of Social Networking Sites (SNSs).  aThis work is a part of the PhD program of one of the authors (RKS).

Although the phylogenetic composition of the rhizospheric microbiome of Acacia dealbata (an invasive Australian tree species) has been investigated, little is known about the functional potential of the constituents of these altered microbial communities. We used shotgun DNA sequencing to better understand the link between bacterial community composition and functional capacity in the rhizospheric microbiomes associated with invasive A. dealbata populations in South Africa. Our analysis showed that several genes associated with plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits were significantly overrepresented in the rhizospheric metagenomes compared to neighbouring bulk soils collected away from A. dealbata stands. The majority of these genes are involved in the metabolism of nitrogen, carbohydrates and vitamins, and in various membrane transport systems. Overrepresented genes were linked to a limited number of bacterial taxa, mostly Bradyrhizobium species, the preferred N-fixing rhizobial symbiont of Australian acacias. Overall, these findings suggest that A. dealbata enriches rhizosphere soils with potentially beneficial microbial taxa, and that members of the genus Bradyrhizobium may play an integral role in mediating PGP processes that may influence the success of this invader when colonizing novel environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aCPRR14071676470cNational Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF) 3aAcacia dealbata 3aBradyrhizobium 3abacterial communities 3acarbohydrates 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agenes 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3anitrogen 3aphylogeny 3aphysiological transport 3arhizosphere 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asymbionts 3atrees 3avitamins 3aSouth Africa1 aVikram, Surendra1 aKamgan-Nkuekam, Gilbert1 aMakhalanyane, Thulani P.1 aGreve, Michelle1 aLe Roux, Johannes J.1 aRichardson, David M.1 aCowan, Don,1 aValverde, Angel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0439-96050 tMicrobial ecology.g2019 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.191-200dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-018-1214-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245007600164300001800240500002000258500000900278520182100287592002802108650002502136650002402161650003102185650001902216650001402235650001802249650001502267650001602282650002302298650001502321650001102336650001502347650001602362650001702378700002702395773013202422856008402554852000902638655001202647IND60665411920221122032157.0220415e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066541192DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2013.05.03492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jialin10aMethiozolin Efficacy, Absorption, and Fate in Six Cool‐Season Grasses  ap. 1211-1219.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aSelective annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) control in cool‐season turfgrasses is difficult with postemergence herbicides currently available to practitioners. Methiozolin is a new isoxazoline herbicide that controls annual bluegrass in cool‐season turfgrasses but physiological effects attributed to selectivity have received limited investigation. Experiments were conducted to evaluate injury, absorption, translocation, and metabolism of methiozolin in six cool‐season grasses. The rate of methiozolin required for 50% injury (I₅₀) to annual bluegrass and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) measured 1.67 and 5.11 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, but I₅₀ values measured >6.72 kg ha⁻¹ for creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and red fescue (Festuca rubra L. var. rubra) at 4 wk after treatment (WAT). Annual bluegrass required 69 h to reach 50% foliar absorption of ¹⁴C‐methiozolin while other species required ≥90 h. At 96 h after treatment (HAT), all species retained ≥83% of foliar applied ¹⁴C‐methiozolin in the treated leaf while 7 to 13% and <5% was distributed to nontreated shoots and roots, respectively. Grasses had similar root absorption of ¹⁴C‐methiozolin and distributed <25% to shoots at 72 HAT. Metabolism in leaves was not detected at 3 or 7 d after treatment in any species. Extraction was poor (<30%) from multiple solvents evaluated in root metabolism experiments, and metabolites could not be quantified. Although differences in absorption were detected, no metabolism in shoots and poor root extraction suggest that differential target site binding or fate in roots probably contribute to methiozolin selectivity for annual bluegrass control in cool‐season grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aFestuca rubra subsp. rubra 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa annua 3aPoa pratensis 3aabsorption 3acold season 3afoliar application 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aturf grasses1 aMcCullough, Patrick E.0 tCrop science.g2014 May, v. 54, no. 3 p.1211-1219dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.05.03493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245010600214300001600320520133300336592002801669650002201697650002801719650001501747650001501762650002301777650001501800650001501815650001501830650001001845650001301855650001401868650001301882651001101895653002401906653001801930653002201948653002401970653001501994653002002009700002202029700004202051773012502093856008302218852000902301655001202310IND60532412220221116171049.0190318e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053241222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Matthew G.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3490-931410aAgricultural landscape structure affects arthropod diversity and arthropod-derived ecosystem services  ap. 144-151.  aKnowledge of how landscape structure impacts the diversity and abundance of beneficial and harmful arthropods, pest regulation, and ultimately crop yield has the potential to significantly improve management of agricultural landscapes. We examined how landscape structure in southern Québec affected soybean herbivores, predators of aphids, pest regulation including aphid and herbivory regulation, and crop production. Local-scale field characteristics and landscape structure at distances less than 2km around each field were the most important predictors for these variables. Increasing field width consistently decreased arthropod diversity and abundance for both predators of aphids and soybean herbivores, but the effects of these changes on pest regulation were inconsistent. Increased field width resulted in less damage to soybean plants from herbivores; but in contrast, aphid numbers were greatest in more complex landscapes where fields were generally narrower. Distance-from-forest within fields and no-till planting methods also decreased pest regulation. Despite these results, soybean yield was not strongly related to pest regulation and instead varied most with distance-from-forest. Thus, patterns of arthropod diversity and abundance may not necessarily coincide with those of pest regulation or crop yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aarthropods 3acrop yield 3aecosystem services 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3ano-tillage 3apests 3aplanting 3apredators 3asoybeans 3aQuebec 0aArthropod diversity 0aSoybean aphid 0aSoybean herbivore 0aLandscape structure 0aCrop yield 0aPest regulation1 aBennett, Elena M.1 aGonzalez, Andrew B.,cBrother, F.S.C.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 July 01, v. 192 p.144-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024001800126040001800144100002700162245014400189300001400333520169500347592002802042650001402070650001102084650001802095650001502113650002802128650002302156650001102179650002202190650000902212651001602221653002402237653002402261653002302285653002102308653003002329653001402359653002302373653001602396700002602412700002202438700002402460700002102484773013502505856007802640852000902718655001202727IND60597743720221119023623.0180625e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059774372DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-16-00001.12doi4 arapt-51-01-03  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConcepcion, Camille B.10aSpecies Composition, Timing, and Weather Correlates of Autumn Open-Water Crossings By Raptors Migrating Along the East-Asian Oceanic Flyway  ap. 25-37.  aRaptor migration rarely involves long-distance movements across open oceans. One exception occurs along the East-Asian Oceanic Flyway. We collected migration data at two terrestrial hawkwatch sites along this flyway to better understand open-ocean movements along this largely overwater corridor. At the northern end of the Philippines, at Basco on the island of Batan, we recorded 7587 migratory raptors in autumn 2014. Near the southern end of the Philippines, at Cape San Agustin on the island of Mindanao, we recorded 27,399 raptors migrating in autumn 2012. Chinese Sparrowhawks (Accipiter soloensis) were the most common raptors observed, making up approximately 89% and 92% of total records for Basco and Cape San Agustin, respectively. The Grey-faced Buzzard (Butastur indicus) was the second most common raptor migrant, accounting for 8% of the total counts at both watch sites. The migration period was about 1–2 wk earlier at Basco, the more northerly site, than at Cape San Agustin. Overwater flights at Basco peaked in both the morning and late afternoon, whereas at Cape San Agustin there was only a morning peak. In general, the rate of migration passage at both sites was highest with clear skies when winds were blowing from the northwest. However, we observed interspecific differences in migration behavior at both sites, with Accipiters more likely to be observed with tailwinds and eastward winds, and Grey-faced Buzzards more likely observed with headwinds. These results help to characterize poorly known aspects of raptor biology and to identify potential migratory bottlenecks or key sites for raptor conservation in little-studied Philippine tropical ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAccipiter 3aautumn 3abirds of prey 3aecosystems 3ainterspecific variation 3amigratory behavior 3aoceans 3aspecies diversity 3awind 3aPhilippines 0aChinese Sparrowhawk 0aAccipiter soloensis 0aGrey-faced Buzzard 0aButastur indicus 0aEast-Asian Oceanic Flyway 0amigration 0aoverwater crossing 0aPhilippines1 aDumandan, Patricia T.1 aSilvosa, Medel R.1 aBildstein, Keith L.1 aKatzner, Todd E.0 tJournal of raptor research.g2017 Mar., v. 51, no. 1 p.25-37dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.wJournal:19719x0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-16-00001.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012100173300001600294520144100310592002801751650000801779650004401787650001201831650002101843650001601864650002101880650001301901650001301914650001701927650002601944650001901970650002401989650001002013650003002023650002102053650003102074650001502105650001702120650001902137653002702156653003402183653002502217653002202242653002802264700002302292700002002315700005902335773010802394856008602502852000902588655001202597IND60553042520221120213149.0161021e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055304252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoradian, Hanieh10aPoly(ethyleneimine) functionalized carbon nanotubes as efficient nano-vector for transfecting mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 115-125.  aFor gene and drug delivery applications, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have to be functionalized in order to become compatible with aqueous media and bind with genetic materials. In this study, combination of polyethyleneimine (PEI) grafted multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PEI-g-MWCNTs) and chitosan substrate is used as an efficient gene delivery system for transfection of hard-to-transfect bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis and zeta potential measurements are used to characterize binding of PEI, particle size distribution and colloidal stability of the functionalized CNTs, respectively. DNA binding affinity, cellular uptake, transfection efficiency and possible cytotoxicity are also tested by agarose gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry, cytochemisty and MTT assay. The results demonstrate that cytotoxic effect of PEI-g-MWCNTs is negligible under optimal transfection condition. In consistency with high cellular uptake (>82%), PEI-g-MWCNTs give higher delivery of EGFP into the BMSCs which results in a more sustained expression of the model gene (EGFP) in short-term culture. These results suggest that PEI-g-MWCNTs in corporation with chitosan substrates would be a promising delivery system for BMSCs, a cell type with relevancy in the regenerative medicine and clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagarose 3abinding capacity 3abone marrow 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3aflow cytometry 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alight scattering 3aparticle size distribution 3astem cells 3atransfection 3azeta potential 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aGene delivery system 0aPolyethyleneimine 0aTransfection efficiency1 aFasehee, Hamidreza1 aKeshvari, Hamid1 aFaghihi, Shahab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-51070 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 122 p.115-125dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245015300193300001600346500001500362520146500377592002801842650002201870650001101892650002801903650002501931650002501956650001701981650002101998650003802019650000902057650002602066650001702092650001202109650001302121650001002134650003102144650002602175650001202201650006602213650006102279650002202340650002602362650002002388650003802408650003302446650004802479650003402527650000902561650003802570650003002608650003302638650001502671650002202686653001802708653002102726700003302747700002502780700001802805700002202823700002102845700002302866700002802889700001802917700001802935700002502953700002202978773009603000856004803096852000903144655001203153IND4449583320221118031223.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444958332DNAL7 a211615522pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0879-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucinskaite-Kodze, Indre10aCharacterization of monoclonal antibodies against hantavirus nucleocapsid protein and their use for immunohistochemistry on rodent and human samples  ap. 443-456.  a2019-12-06  aMonoclonal antibodies are important tools for various applications in hantavirus diagnostics. Recently, we generated Puumala virus (PUUV)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by immunisation of mice with chimeric polyomavirus-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) harbouring the 120-amino-acid-long amino-terminal region of the PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein. Here, we describe the generation of two mAbs by co-immunisation of mice with hexahistidine-tagged full-length N proteins of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV), their characterization by different immunoassays and comparison with the previously generated mAbs raised against a segment of PUUV N protein inserted into VLPs. All of the mAbs reacted strongly in ELISA and western blot tests with the antigens used for immunization and cross-reacted to varying extents with N proteins of other hantaviruses. All mAbs raised against a segment of the PUUV N protein presented on chimeric VLPs and both mAbs raised against the full-length AND/SNV N protein reacted with Vero cells infected with different hantaviruses. The reactivity of mAbs with native viral nucleocapsids was also confirmed by their reactivity in immunohistochemistry assays with kidney tissue specimens from experimentally SNV-infected rodents and human heart tissue specimens from hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome patients. Therefore, the described mAbs represent useful tools for the immunodetection of hantavirus infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen detection 3ahumans 3aPuumala orthohantavirus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3avirus-like particles 3anucleocapsid 3aWestern blotting 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aimmunization 3akidneys 3apatients 3aheart 3aSin Nombre orthohantavirus 3anucleocapsid proteins 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aBlotting, Western 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aCross Reactions 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aOrthohantavirusximmunology. 2aHantavirus Infectionsxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aMice 2aNucleocapsid Proteinsximmunology 2aPuumala virusximmunology 2aSin Nombre virusximmunology 2aVero Cells 2aVirologyxmethods 0aPuumala virus 0aSin Nombre virus1 aPetraityte-Burneikiene, Rasa1 aZvirbliene, Aurelija1 aHjelle, Brian1 aMedina, Rafael A.1 aGedvilaite, Alma1 aRazanskiene, Ausra1 aSchmidt-Chanasit, Jonas1 aMertens, Marc1 aPadula, Paula1 aSasnauskas, Kestutis1 aUlrich, Rainer G.0 tArchives of virology.g2011 Mar., v. 156, no. 3 p.443-456dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0879-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015200160300001400312520080000326592002801126653001601154653001401170653002401184653002601208700001901234700001801253700001701271773010601288856008101394852000901475655001201484IND60594196520221119182946.0180510e20160130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059419652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ica.2015.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wei10aStructures and magnetism of two copper(II) compounds with mixed hydroxido-carboxylate bridges derived from isomeric pyridylbenzoate N-oxide ligands  ap. 21-25.  aTwo Cu(II) coordination polymers with two isomeric pyridylbenzoate N-oxide ligands, 4-(4-pyridyl)benzoic acid N-oxide (4,4-Hopybz) or 4-(3-pyridyl)benzoic acid N-oxide (4,3-Hopybz), were synthesized and structurally and magnetically characterized.

How can someone provide an intuitive yet efficient strategy to uncover and distinguish the multiple potential functions of SFRBs under uncertainty? In this study, by exploiting both input and output uncertainties of SFRBs, the authors developed a new data-driven framework to automatically predict the multiple functions of SFRBs by using multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning. A total of 372 sustainable flood retention basins, characterized by 40 variables associated with confidence levels, were surveyed in Scotland, UK. A Gaussian model with Monte Carlo sampling was used to capture the variability of variables (i.e., input uncertainty), and the MIML-support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was subsequently applied to predict the potential functions of SFRBs that have not yet been assessed, allowing for one basin belonging to different types (i.e., output uncertainty). Experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach enables effective automatic prediction of the potential functions of SFRBs (e.g., accuracy >93%). The findings suggest that the functional uncertainty of SFRBs under investigation can be better assessed in a more comprehensive and cost-effective way, and the proposed data-driven approach provides a promising method of doing so for water resources management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abasins 3acost effectiveness 3amathematical theory 3aplanning 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awater resources 3aScotland1 aBoehm, Christian1 aScholz, Miklas1 aPlant, Claudia1 aShao, Junming0 tWater.g2015 Mar. 26, v. 7, no. 4 p.1359-1377dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w70413593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011300168300001600281520158600297592002801883596006301911596005501974596006302029596004502092650001802137650001302155650001102168650001702179650002802196650001502224650002602239650002002265650001002285650001502295650001802310650001202328650002302340650002602363650001902389650002902408650001302437650001902450650001102469650000702480650001502487650001702502650002002519650001902539650001802558700001702576700001702593700002002610700001802630773010602648856008202754852000902836655001202845IND60627264920221121022219.0190314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062726492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-018-1219-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhiloufi, Wahida10aEffects of Biological Soil Crusts on Enzyme Activities and Microbial Community in Soils of an Arid Ecosystem  ap. 201-216.  aArid ecosystems constitute 41% of land’s surface and play an important role in global carbon cycle. In particular, biological soil crusts (BSC) are known to be a hotspot of carbon fixation as well as mineralization in arid ecosystems. However, little information is available on carbon decomposition and microbes in BSC and key controlling variables for microbial activities in arid ecosystems. The current study, carried out in South Mediterranean arid ecosystem, aimed to evaluate the effects of intact and removed cyanobacteria/lichen crusts on soil properties, soil enzyme activities, and microbial abundances (bacteria and fungi). We compared five different treatments (bare soil, soil with intact cyanobacteria, soil with cyanobacteria removed, soil with intact lichens, and soil with lichens removed) in four different soil layers (0–5, 5–10, 10–15, and 15–20 cm). Regardless of soil treatments, activities of hydrolases and water content increased with increasing soil depth. The presence of lichens increased significantly hydrolase activities, which appeared to be associated with greater organic matter, nitrogen, and water contents. However, phenol oxidase was mainly controlled by pH and oxygen availability. Neither fungal nor bacterial abundance exhibited a significant correlation with enzyme activities suggesting that soil enzyme activities are mainly controlled by edaphic and environmental conditions rather than source microbes. Interestingly, the presence of lichens reduced the abundance of bacteria of which mechanism is still to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016R1D1A1A02937049cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a20110030040cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2016R1D1A1A02937049cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2017096A001719BB01cKorea Forest Service 3aCyanobacteria 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3ahydrolases 3alichen crusts 3alichens 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3asoil depth 3asoil enzymes 3asoil properties 3asoil treatment 3awater content1 aSeo, Juyoung1 aKim, Jinhyun1 aChaieb, Mohamed1 aKang, Hojeong0 tMicrobial ecology.g2019 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.201-216dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-018-1219-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245017100180300001800351520135100369592002801720650002401748650002701772650001201799650001001811650001101821650002501832650001401857650002201871650001301893650002401906650001401930650002201944650004801966650004602014650001302060650002802073650002202101700001702123700002002140700002002160700001802180700001702198700001702215700001502232773011602247856004802363852000902411655001202420IND50067474420221117231115.0140621e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006747442DNAL7 a237491182pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-4960-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Long10aDeveloping Bacillus spp. as a cell factory for production of microbial enzymes and industrially important biochemicals in the context of systems and synthetic biology  ap. 6113-6127.  aIncreasing concerns over limited petroleum resources and associated environmental problems are motivating the development of efficient cell factories to produce chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable resources in an environmentally sustainable economical manner. Bacillus spp., the best characterized Gram-positive bacteria, possesses unique advantages as a host for producing microbial enzymes and industrially important biochemicals. With appropriate modifications to heterologous protein expression and metabolic engineering, Bacillus species are favorable industrial candidates for efficiently converting renewable resources to microbial enzymes, fine chemicals, bulk chemicals, and fuels. Here, we summarize the recent advances in developing Bacillus spp. as a cell factory. We review the available genetic tools, engineering strategies, genome sequence, genome-scale structure models, proteome, and secretion pathways, and we list successful examples of enzymes and industrially important biochemicals produced by Bacillus spp. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges in developing Bacillus spp. as a robust and efficient production host, and we discuss in the context of systems and synthetic biology the emerging opportunities and future research prospects in developing Bacillus spp. as a microbial cell factory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aenzymes 3ahosts 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3apetroleum 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3arenewable resources 3asecretion 3asynthetic biology 2aBacillusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiofuels 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aSynthetic Biology1 aLiu, Yanfeng1 aShin, Hyun-dong1 aChen, Rachel R.1 aWang, Nam Sun1 aLi, Jianghua1 aDu, Guocheng1 aChen, Jian0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 97, no. 14 p.6113-6127dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4960-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011800175300001600293520179800309592002802107650002202135650002502157650001502182650002502197650001302222650001402235650001402249650002302263650001702286650002802303650001802331650001102349650001902360650001302379650001102392650001802403650001202421650002402433650001002457650001302467700002802480700002202508700002402530700002702554773008902581856008602670852000902756655001202765IND50067569620221118013608.0141111e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006756962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayaprakasha, G.K.10aRadical scavenging capacities and inhibition of human prostate (LNCaP) cell proliferation by Fortunella margarita  ap. 184-191.  aLyophilised nagami kumquat (Fortunella margarita) powder was extracted with five different solvents. Dried extracts of EtOAc and MeOH–water (4:1, v/v) had the highest and lowest total phenolics, respectively, by Folin–Ciocalteu method. LC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of different levels of rutin, narirutin, poncirin, apigenin 8-C-rutinoside and 3′,5′,di-C-β-glucopyranosyl phloretin in all the extracts except n-hexane. EtOAc and MeOH extracts exhibited the highest and the lowest 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, respectively. The order of antioxidant capacity was found to be MeOH–water (4:1, v/v)>EtOAc>MeOH>n-hexane>acetone by phosphomolybdenum complex and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values. Among five extracts, n-hexane extract exhibited the highest inhibition of human prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells (86.4%) after 96h at 100μg/mL, followed by EtOAc (82.8%), MeOH (76.7%) and MeOH–water (4:1, v/v) (68.2%). Fragmentation of DNA suggests the ability of extracts to induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The cleavage of caspase-3 was the highest in n-hexane and EtOAc extracts, whereas the ratio of Bax/Bcl2 was the highest in MeOH and MeOH–water (4:1, v/v) extracts. The results of the present study were also supported by fluorescent images of LNCaP cells treated with kumquat extracts. The maximum cell proliferation inhibition activity of n-hexane extract may be due to the presence of one or cumulative effect of β-carotene, β-cubebene and hexadecanoic acid. Remaining four extracts exhibited differential antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity which may be due to the presence of various levels of rutin, narirutin, poncirin, apigenin-8-C-rutinoside and 3′,4′-di-C-β-glucopyranosyl phloretin in each extract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aFortunella margarita 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidant activity 3aapigenin 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3afree radical scavengers 3afreeze drying 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3akumquats 3aoxygen 3apalmitic acid 3apowders 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arutin 3asolvents1 aChidambara Murthy, K.N.1 aEtlinger, Melissa1 aMantur, Shivappa M.1 aPatil, Bhimanagouda S.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 131, no. 1 p.184-191dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024001800126040001800144100002200162245013100184300001400315520147800329592002801807650001901835650001801854650001601872650001401888650002401902650000901926650001801935651001301953653002401966653001901990653001802009653002302027653002602050653002002076700001802096700002002114773013502134856007802269852000902347655001202356IND60597744020221119023121.0180625e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059774402DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-16-00009.12doi4 arapt-51-01-06  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, William P.10aAnnual Variability and the Influence of Embryonic Development On Red-Shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus) Eggshell Characteristics  ap. 61-67.  aRed-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus) eggs were examined to determine whether mass, eggshell thickness, and a thickness index corrected for egg shape and blowhole size changed as embryos developed. Four different stages of embryonic development (fresh, slight, large, and advanced) were described by the collector (C.F. Stone), or inferred from blowhole diameter measurements, for 286 Red-shouldered Hawk eggs collected in the late 1800s and early 1900s in central New York State. We examined changes in eggshell mass, thickness, and thickness index with linear mixed models with year of collection and clutch size specified as random variables. We also evaluated annual differences in eggshell characteristics with linear mixed models. There was an 8.8% decrease in eggshell mass between eggs with fresh and advanced embryos at the time of collection (F₃,₂₄₂ = 3.4, P = 0.02). Eggshell thickness tended to decrease by 7.5% between eggs with fresh and advanced embryos, but the difference was not significant (F₃,₁₁₉ = 2.06, P = 0.11). The thickness index also did not change due to stage of embryonic development. The year in which eggs were collected influenced eggshell mass (F₁₂,₁₈₇ = 2.35, P = 0.008) and the thickness index (F₁₂,₁₈₈ = 2.68, P = 0.002), but not thickness. This is the first study of eggs collected from wild raptors that demonstrates the magnitude of the effect embryonic development has on eggshell characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButeo lineatus 3abirds of prey 3aclutch size 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aNew York 0aRed-shouldered Hawk 0aButeo lineatus 0aeggshell mass 0aeggshell thickness 0aembryonic development 0athickness index1 aDiaz, Julian,1 aDe Jong, Indigo0 tJournal of raptor research.g2017 Mar., v. 51, no. 1 p.61-67dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.wJournal:19719x0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-16-00009.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006200171300001600233520063500249592002800884650001200912650001000924650001200934650001100946650003100957650001100988650001900999700001601018700002201034773012001056856008201176852000901258655001201267IND60617092520221120123124.0181023e199411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061709252DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517594064011022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDen engelsen, C.W.10aFoamability of Silica Suspensions in a Rotor-Stator Mixer  ap. 626-632.  aA procedure is described for making aqueous silica suspensions with a desired particle size distribution. The influence of silica particles in different concentrations on foam ability in a rotor-stator mixer for different rotational speeds has been studied by means of mixing characteristics. It appears that for low liquid flow rates, the solid particles have no influence on foamability. For high liquid flow rates, foamability decreases for increasing silica content; this effect becomes smaller for high rotational speeds.

Livestock productivity, however, can fluctuate due to many environmental factors, including climate variability. Current predictions of continued warming, decreased precipitation, and increased climate variability worldwide raise serious questions for scientists and producers alike. Foremost is understanding how to mitigate livestock production losses attributed to climate extremes and variability. We investigated the influence of spatial heterogeneity on livestock production over six years in tallgrass prairie of the southern Great Plains, USA. We manipulated heterogeneity by allowing fire and grazing to interact spatially and temporally at broad scales across pastures ranging from 430 to 900ha. We found that the influence of precipitation on livestock productivity was contingent upon heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was absent, livestock productivity decreased with reduced rainfall. In contrast, when heterogeneity was present, there was no relationship with rainfall and livestock productivity, resulting in heterogeneity stabilizing livestock productivity through time. With predicted increases in climate variability and uncertainty, managing for heterogeneity may assist livestock producers in adapting to climate change and in mitigating livestock productivity loss caused by climatic variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3afood security 3agrazing 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3apastures 3aprediction 3arain 3aspatial variation 3auncertainty 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States 0aCattle 0aClimatic extremes 0aDrought 0aFire-grazing interaction 0aGreat Plains 0aWeight gain1 aScasta, John Derek1 aHovick, Torre J.1 aFuhlendorf, Samuel D.1 aHamilton, Robert G.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 193 p.37-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002900120040001800149100001800167245009300185300001800278500002000296506002800316506003000344520170300374592002802077596004502105506003702150650001602187650002102203650002602224650001102250650001802261650001602279650000902295650001302304650001402317650001102331650001802342650001902360650002102379650001302400650000902413700002302422773013602445856007202581903002202653852000902675655001202684IND60598307220221207131333.0180629e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059830722DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.41492doi7 a10.1002/etc.41492chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xiaoyan10aPhytotoxicity and microbial respiration of Ni‐spiked soils after field aging for 12 yr  ap. 1933-1939.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aTo assess the impact of Ni toxicity in soils after long‐term field aging, a coarse‐textured soil was spiked with Ni salt at 100, 200, and 400 mg kg⁻¹ Ni concentrations. These soils were aged in the field along with an unspiked (control) soil under natural conditions for 12 yr, after which total soil Ni was measured and tests of Ni extractability by 0.01 M CaCl₂ and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were done. Soybean assays and soil respiration tests were performed to determine residual Ni toxicity of the aged contaminated soils. The greatest loss of Ni after 12 yr of aging occurred from the soil spiked with the highest Ni level, but substantial loss of Ni occurred from the lower Ni levels as well. Loss was attributable to leaching as the fraction of readily extractable (by 0.01 M CaCl₂) Ni diminished with long‐term aging. Readily extractable and DTPA‐extractable Ni increased with increasing soil spiking levels, but only the latter was linearly proportional to total Ni. Phytotoxicity to soybeans (Glycine max L.) in the field was initially high at all levels of added Ni but diminished over the 12 yr of aging. A greenhouse soybean assay with the 12‐yr aged soils confirmed toxicity to be statistically significant at all Ni addition levels and dose‐dependent, with 0.01 M CaCl₂‐extractable Ni >5 mg kg⁻¹ shown to be measurably phytotoxic to soybeans. Phytotoxicity may have been caused at least in part by the observed inhibition of Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn uptake by soil Ni. Soil respiration was increasingly inhibited as levels of added Ni increased from 100 to 400 mg kg⁻¹.

Texturing process conditions have been adjusted to create bulk variation in both commercial staple and bulk-continuous-filament (BCF) products. For the staple items, bulk is characterized in the fiber, in the pre- and postheat set yarns, and in the carpet tuft itself. Both the staple fiber and heat-set yam methods are new. Yarns from both carpet manufacturing processes have been implanted as tuftlines into multiple carpet backgrounds, each background made with different levels of bulk. Sixty such staple and 144 BCF implants, most obvious streaks because of their bulk differences, have been evaluated by graders for intensity and shade; these grades correlate well with those ranked instrumentally (R ² = 0.91 and 0.94, respectively) and, for the staple products, with various measures of bulk (R ² from 0.78 to 0.95). Goniophotometry has also been used to ascribe the unique optical effect commonly seen in bulk-related streaks, that of changing shade with view direction, to the carpet's surface filament configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3amanufacturing 3anylon 3atextile fibers 3atexturization 3ayams 3ayarns1 aGuelpa, E.1 aSouthern, J.H.1 aSpivak, S.M.0 tTextile research journal.g1994 Nov., v. 64, no. 11 p.633-647dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517594064011033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245008900210300001800299500001900317520054300336592002800879650001200907650001400919650001200933650001200945650001400957700002000971700001700991700006001008700006801068700002201136700006201158773012101220856008401341852000901425655001201434IND60720810620221120094003.0210323e20201208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072081062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c036112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafarpour, Farnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5242-274810aAssembly of Indole Cores through a Palladium-Catalyzed Metathesis of Ar–X σ-Bonds  ap. 9556-9561.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe the development of a new method for construction of highly substituted indole scaffolds through the strategic utilizing of the metathesis of Ar-X σ-bonds based on the dynamic nature of palladium-based oxidative addition/reductive elimination.

However, targeting EGFR as a single treatment only resulted in moderate efficacy to the disease. The underlying mechanism of low responsiveness to EGFR inhibition remains largely unclear. Tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in mediating intercellular communication between tumor and stromal cells in local microenvironment and distant metastatic niche. Extracellular vesicles mediate cell-to-cell transfer of lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Although numerous recent studies have demonstrated exchanges of extracellular vesicles between cancer cells and the recipient cells contribute to tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, yet little is known how the exosomal compartment responds to targeted therapies and their role in promoting drug resistance. In the current study we used a triple-negative breast cancer model to show that EV-encapsulated EGFR is protected from targeted inhibitors of EGFR and can trigger signaling pathway in recipient cancer cells, promoting proliferation and migration ability in vitro. Taken together, our study suggested a novel mechanism of drug resistance entailing the EV compartment, such as exosomes, as a target shelter which when released can signal for tumor promotion in the recipient cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3adrug resistance 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aexosomes 3alipids 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleic acids 3asignal transduction 3astromal cells 0aEGFR 0aExosome 0aExtracellular vesicle 0aTriple-negative breast cancer 0aProliferation 0aMigration 0aepidermal growth factor receptor 0asmall molecule inhibitors of EGFR 0aestrogen receptor 0amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 0aextracellular vesicles 0ahuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 0aprogesterone receptor 0atyrosine kinase inhibitors 0atriple-negative breast cancer 0amitogen-activated protein kinase 0amultivesicular bodies 0ananoparticle tracking analysis 0aretinoic acid-induced gene 1 0areceptor tyrosine kinase1 aWang, Yuanliang,1 aLin, You-Zhe1 aChiang, Shu-Fen1 aWu, Wan-Rong1 aWang, Shaojun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5477-16820 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 510, no. 1 p.42-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001600256520103100272592002801303650001501331650002601346650001301372650001401385650001601399773009301415856008101508852000901589655001201598IND60586893920221118185404.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058689392DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-017-0840-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Sahotra10aHaldane’s The causes of evolution and the Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology  ap. 753-763.  aThis paper argues that Haldane’s The causes of evolution was the most important founding document in the emergence of the received view of evolutionary theory which is typically referred to as the Modern Synthesis. Whether or not this historical development is characterized as a synthesis (which remains controversial), this paper argues the most important component of the emergence of the received view consisted of showing how the formal rules of Mendelian inheritance are based on (or emerge from) the material basis of heredity established by classical genetics primarily through the experimental work on Drosophila genetics of the Morgan school in the 1910s and 1920s. This is one of the most important achievements of Haldane’s book. Thus this paper rejects both (i) the view that the synthesis was a unification of biometry and Mendelism and (ii) the claim that it arose from work primarily done in the late 1930s and 1940s by naturalists rather than theoretical population and classical experimental geneticists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aMendelian inheritance 3abiometry 3aevolution 3ageneticists0 tJournal of genetics.g2017 Nov., v. 96, no. 5 p.753-763dSpringer Indiax0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-017-0840-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016300172300001400335520109000349592002801439650001201467650001001479650001501489650003501504650003501539650001601574650001101590650001701601650002601618650002001644650001601664650001401680650002401694650003601718650003201754700002301786700001901809700001601828700001801844773008601862856008501948990002302033852000902056655001202065IND60092922120221122163719.0141103s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009292212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Keita10aInhibition of interferon-γ-induced nitric oxide production by 10-hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic acid through inhibition of interferon regulatory factor-8 induction  ap. 73-78.  a10-Hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) is a major lipid component of royal jelly, a honey bee secretion used to nourish the queen bee and young larvae. In this study, we examined the effect of 10H2DA on interferon (IFN)-γ-induced nitric oxide (NO) production. IFN-γ-induced NO production and activation of the inducible NO synthase promoter were significantly inhibited by 10H2DA. IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 was not affected by 10H2DA. In contrast, IFN-γ-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation were inhibited by 10H2DA. IFN-γ-mediated induction of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-8, but not IRF-1, was also inhibited by 10H2DA. IFN-γ-induced TNF-α production followed by activation of NF-κB is known to be essential for NO production. Together, 10H2DA inhibited IFN-γ-induced NO production by inhibiting IRF-8 induction and TNF-α production. 10H2DA might modulate IFN-γ-mediated cellular responses by inhibiting the induction of IRF-8 and IRF-8-dependent genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3agenes 3ahoney bees 3ainterferon regulatory factor-1 3ainterferon regulatory factor-8 3ainterferons 3alarvae 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphosphorylation 3aroyal jelly 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aSugiyama, Tsuyoshi1 aTokoro, Shunji1 aNeri, Paola1 aMori, Hiroshi0 tCellular immunology.g2012, v. 273, no. 1 p.73-78dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.11.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245008600174300001800260520094600278592002801224650002401252650001901276650000901295650002001304650002201324650002101346650002101367650001701388650001601405650002501421650001701446700002701463700003601490773010701526856004801633852000901681655001201690IND4466803620221121230224.0121003e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0956-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCh.

An energy balance was performed using a simple reactor model previously proposed by Yiannopoulos et al. (Bioresource Technology 99:7742–7749, 2008) to estimate the size of a solar system in Patras, Greece. The main objective is to feed the reactor with warm water produced by solar energy and achieve an increase of temperature close to 35°C for the majority of the year. Model simulations indicated that the heat demand of the reactor could be balanced practically by a number of flat plate solar collectors supplying warm water at above 20°C for over 95% of the year. Therefore, the proposed system can offer a viable alternative to enhancing anaerobic treatment in wastewater facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aenergy balance 3aheat 3aheating systems 3asimulation models 3asmall businesses 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3awater supply1 aManariotis, Ioannis D.1 aChrysikopoulos, Constantinos V.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 May, v. 223, no. 4 p.1443-1454dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0956-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013300163300001300296520157900309592002801888596009801916650002602014650002402040650001502064650001002079650001002089650001202099650001002111650002602121650001902147650001302166650001802179650001402197650001902211651001402230700002102244700001502265700005202280773010302332856008202435852000902517655001202526IND60627265520221121022129.0190314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062726552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-018-1204-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aMicrobial Community Composition and Putative Biogeochemical Functions in the Sediment and Water of Tropical Granite Quarry Lakes  ap. 1-11.  aRe-naturalized quarry lakes are important ecosystems, which support complex communities of flora and fauna. Microorganisms associated with sediment and water form the lowest trophic level in these ecosystems and drive biogeochemical cycles. A direct comparison of microbial taxa in water and sediment microbial communities is lacking, which limits our understanding of the dominant functions that are carried out by the water and sediment microbial communities in quarry lakes. In this study, using the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach, we compared microbial communities in the water and sediment in two re-naturalized quarry lakes in Singapore and elucidated putative functions of the sediment and water microbial communities in driving major biogeochemical processes. The richness and diversity of microbial communities in sediments of the quarry lakes were higher than those in the water. The composition of the microbial communities in the sediments from the two quarries was highly similar to one another, while those in the water differed greatly. Although the microbial communities of the sediment and water samples shared some common members, a large number of microbial taxa (at the phylum and genus levels) were prevalent either in sediment or water alone. Our results provide valuable insights into the prevalent biogeochemical processes carried out by water and sediment microbial communities in tropical granite quarry lakes, highlighting distinct microbial processes in water and sediment that contribute to the natural purification of the resident water.  aPublisher supplied data  aL2NICCFP1-2013-3cSingapore Ministry of National Development and National Research Foundation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afauna 3aflora 3agranite 3alakes 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3aquarries 3aribosomal DNA 3asediments 3atrophic levels 3aSingapore1 aNg, Daphne H.

In this study, long-term monitoring and focused research on vegetation, soil and soil moisture from 2006 to 2012 were used to develop a model for evaluating indices of ecosystem stability using the analytical hierarchy process method. The results demonstrated that rainfall (R), vegetation coverage (C), and surface soil moisture (S) were the three most influential factors among the 14 indicators considered in a revegetated desert area in the Tengger Desert, China. A stability index (SI) was defined as SI = VAR (R) × VAR (C)/VAR (S), and a comparative study was conducted to examine the stability index of the natural vegetation community. The SI was divided into three regimes: SI < 0.006 was stable, 0.006 ≤ SI < 0.015 was semi-stable, and 0.015 ≤ SI was unstable. The stable, semi-stable and unstable periods of revegetated ecosystems in our simulations were 191, 17 and 11 years, respectively, within the total modeling period of 219 years. These results indicated that the revegetated desert ecosystem would be stable in most years during the vegetation succession, and this study presents new ideas for future artificial vegetation management in arid desert regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3adeserts 3aecological models 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3arain 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3avegetation 3aChina1 aZhang, Zhishan0 tWater.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 7, no. 5 p.1969-1990dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w70519693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245011200204506007600316520098200392592002801374506003701402650001501439650001101454650001801465650001601483650001701499650001601516650002701532650003701559650001001596650002001606650004301626650001701669650001101686650001501697650001101712650001501723700002201738773011901760856007601879852000901955655001201964IND60647985520221207062533.0190625e20170907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064798552DNAL7 a10.3390/foods60900782doi7 aPMC56152902pmcid7 a288802212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBovier, Emily R.14aThe Macular Carotenoids Lutein and Zeaxanthin Are Related to Increased Bone Density in Young Healthy Adults  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) status can be quantified by measuring their concentrations both in serum and, non-invasively, in retinal tissue. This has resulted in a unique ability to assess their role in a number of tissues ranging from cardiovascular to central nervous system tissue. Recent reports using animal models have suggested yet another role, a developmental increase in bone mass. To test this, we assessed L and Z status in 63 young healthy adults. LZ status was determined by measuring LZ in serum (using HPLC) and retina tissue (measuring macular pigment optical density, MPOD, using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry). Bone density was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Although serum LZ was generally not related to bone mass, MPOD was significantly related to bone density in the proximal femur and lumbar spine. In general, our results are consistent with carotenoids, specifically LZ, playing a role in optimal bone health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorbance 3aadults 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone health 3acentral nervous system 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemur 3aheterochromatin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alumbar spine 3alutein 3aphotometry 3aretina 3azeaxanthin1 aHammond, Billy R.0 tFoods.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 6, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods60900783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011300168300001800281500002000299500000900319520173000328592002802058596006802086650002402154650001702178650002102195650002202216650001502238650002502253650001602278650001402294650001202308650000902320650002702329650002902356650001502385650003502400650001302435700001702448700002002465700001902485700002202504700001702526700002002543700002202563700001802585700002002603773013302623856008402756852000902840655001202849IND60665290720221119173700.0220805e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066529072DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2018.03.01632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Satbeer10aGenetic Diversity Patterns and Heterosis Prediction Based on SSRs and SNPs in Hybrid Parents of Pearl Millet  ap. 2379-2390.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThe present investigation was performed to assess genetic divergence and heterosis prediction in hybrid parents of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R Br.] using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Using 56 SSR loci, 412 alleles were detected in 147 lines with an average of 7.36 alleles per locus, and 75,007 SNP loci were detected in 117 lines. Both SSR‐ and SNP‐based clustering and structure analysis partitioned all maintainer (B) and restorer (R) lines into two clear‐cut separate groups, indicating the existence of two diverse gene pools, each representing the seed and restorer parents in pearl millet. Results of analysis of molecular variance and principal coordinate analysis also showed significant diversity between B and R lines. The correlation between parental genetic distances estimated based on SSRs and SNPs was high and significant (r = 0.58, p <.01). Similar clustering pattern of hybrid parents was observed with both marker systems, although the cost of genotyping was 41% less with SNPs than with SSRs, and the ratio of loci detected with SNPs was much higher (1:364 SSR/SNP), hence the use of SNPs is indicated over SSRs for germplasm characterization. A set of 136 hybrids (including all B × B, R × R, and B × R crosses) generated crossing 17 hybrid parents (nine B lines and eight R lines) in half diallel (without reciprocal) fashion, and evaluation at two locations revealed that the correlation between genetic distance and better parent heterosis for grain yield was moderate, positive, and significant (with SSR, 0.33, p <.01; with SNP, 0.35, p <.01), hence both SSRs and SNPs were found comparable in results for heterosis prediction.  aPublisher supplied data  cICRISAT Pearl Millet Hybrid Parent Research Consortium (PMHPRC) 3aCenchrus americanus 3aclearcutting 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3agermplasm evaluation 3agrain yield 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3aprediction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance1 aGupta, S.

Pink-pigmented microbes of the genus Methylobacterium that colonize the surfaces of leaves (epiphytes) are capable of growth on this volatile C1-compound as sole source of carbon and energy. In this article the results of experiments with germ-free (gnotobiotic) sporophytes of angiosperms (sunflower, maize) and gametophytes of bryophytes (a moss and two liverwort species) are summarized. The data show that methylobacteria do not stimulate the growth of these angiosperms, but organ development in moss protonemata and in thalli of liverworts is considerably enhanced. Since methylobacteria produce and secrete cytokinins and auxin, a model of plant-microbe-interaction (symbiosis) is proposed in which the methanol-consuming bacteria are viewed as co-evolved partners of the gametophyte that determine its growth, survival and reproduction (fitness). This symbiosis is restricted to the haploid cells of moisture-dependent "living fossil" plants; it does not apply to the diploid sporophytes of higher embryophytes, which are fully adapted to life on land and apparently produce sufficient amounts of endogenous phytohormones.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBryophyta 3aHelianthus annuus 3aMethylobacterium 3aauxins 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acoevolution 3acorn 3acytokinins 3adiploidy 3aembryophytes 3aepiphytes 3agametophytes 3agerm-free animals 3ahaploidy 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amethanol 3amodels 3amosses and liverworts 3apectins 3aplant hormones 3aprotonemata 3areproduction 3asporophytes 3asymbiosis 3athallus0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2007 Mar. 1, v. 2, no. 2 p.74-78dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.2.2.40733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010500170300001800275520173700293592002802030596006002058650003202118650001302150650001602163650001702179650001502196650001102211650002202222650001402244650001802258650001902276650001602295650002302311650001202334650002602346650001602372650001202388650001502400650004302415650001402458650001902472650001202491650002202503650001302525650002002538650001102558700002402569700002402593700001902617700001902636700002102655700002202676700001802698700002402716700002602740773014602766856008202912852000902994655001203003IND60596432620221120070357.0181002e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059643262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8901-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadchenkova, Nadja10aExtracellular polymer substance synthesized by a halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter canadensis 28  ap. 4937-4949.  aHalophilic microorganisms are producers of a lot of new compounds whose properties suggest promising perspectives for their biotechnological exploration. Moderate halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter canadensis 28 was isolated from Pomorie salterns as an extracellular polymer substance (EP) producer. The best carbon source for extracellular polymer production was found to be lactose, a sugar received as a by-product from the dairy industry. After optimization of the culture medium and physicochemical conditions for cultivation, polymer biosynthesis increased more than 2-fold. The highest level of extracellular polymer synthesis by C. canadensis 28 was observed in an unusually high NaCl concentration (15% w/v). Chemical analysis of the purified polymer revealed the presence of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) fraction (14.3% w/w) and protein fraction (72% w/w). HPLC analysis of the protein fraction showed the main presence of polyglutamic acid (PGA) (75.7% w/w). EPS fraction analysis revealed the following sugar composition (% w/w): glucosamine 36.7, glucose 32.3, rhamnose 25.4, xylose 1.7, and not identified sugar 3.9. The hydrogel formed by PGA and EPS fractions showed high swelling behavior, very good emulsifying and stabilizing properties, and good foaming ability. This is the first report for halophilic bacterium able to synthesize a polymer containing PGA fraction. The synthesized biopolymer shows an extremely high hydrophilicity, due to the simultaneous presence of PGA and EPS. The analysis of its functional properties and the presence of glucosamine in the highest proportion in EPS fraction clearly determine the potential of EP synthesized by C. canadensis 28 for application in the cosmetics industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aB02/26cNational Fund for Scientific Research, Bulgaria 3aChromohalobacter canadensis 3abacteria 3abiopolymers 3abiosynthesis 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3achemical analysis 3acosmetics 3aculture media 3adairy industry 3aemulsifying 3aexopolysaccharides 3afoaming 3afunctional properties 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3ahalophiles 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3alactose 3apolyglutamic acid 3arhamnose 3asodium chloride 3axylose1 aBoyadzhieva, Ivanka1 aAtanasova, Nikolina1 aPoli, Annarita1 aFinore, Ilaria1 aDi Donato, Paola1 aNicolaus, Barbara1 aPanchev, Ivan1 aKuncheva, Margarita1 aKambourova, Margarita0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 102, no. 11 p.4937-4949dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8901-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012100171300001600292520181400308592002802122650002302150650001902173650002402192650002702216650001102243650002002254650001502274650001202289650001102301650001102312650001102323650001702334650001602351650001102367650001302378650001002391650001702401650000802418650001702426700002102443700002502464700003402489700002402523773010902547856008102656852000902737655001202746IND60574288320221122143122.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057428832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0773-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBestete, Luziani R.10aDevelopment of cotton pests exhibiting different feeding strategy on water-stressed and kaolin-treated cotton plants  ap. 139-150.  aConsistent data demonstrate the positive response of sap-sucking insects to water-stressed plants, but there is a lack of information about the performance of chewing species, including whether their responses vary according to their feeding specializations. We tested the hypothesis that herbivores with distinct feeding strategies and host specialization will respond differently to two plant conditions, i.e. water deficit and kaolin treatment, where the latter is used to reduce abiotic and biotic plant stressors. We determined the development and reproduction of four major cotton pest species with different feeding strategies (chewing and sap sucking) and with specializations ranging from monophagous to polyphagous using well-watered or water-stressed cotton plants, which were treated or not treated with kaolin. Three chewing (lepidopteran) species, Alabama argillacea (Hüb.), Heliothis virescens (Fabr.) and Chrysodeixis includens (Walk), as well as one sap-sucking species, Bemisia tabaci (Gen.), were used as models. The neonate larvae of all three chewing species exhibited lower survival when fed the leaves of water-stressed plants. In addition, the neonate larvae fed leaves from water-stressed and kaolin-treated plants did not complete their development or they exhibited low survival. Older larvae also exhibited significantly lower survival on kaolin-treated plants. The effects on life history traits were more obvious in monophagous chewing species compared with polyphagous species when fed leaves from water-stressed plants. The performance of B. tabaci was superior on water-stressed and untreated kaolin plants. Thus, water-stressed and kaolin-treated plants negatively affected all chewing species, whereas water-stressed plants only positively affected the sap-sucking species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlabama argillacea 3aBemisia tabaci 3aHeliothis virescens 3aPseudoplusia includens 3acotton 3afeeding methods 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3akaolin 3alarvae 3aleaves 3alife history 3amastication 3amodels 3aneonates 3apests 3areproduction 3asap 3awater stress1 aTorres, Jorge B.1 aSilva, Rebecca B.

Bird species are not only influenced by the remaining habitat patch size and quality but also by the habitat characteristics in the fragmented landscape. Heterogeneous matrices are known to promote connectivity among habitat fragments. However, to what extent these matrices influence species movement of different habitat guilds is not well understood. To do so, we assessed the observed movements of bird guilds in relation to Polylepis forest patch characteristics and surrounding páramo-matrix heterogeneity in an Ecuadorian High Andes biodiversity hotspot. We detected 250 individuals of 16 bird species making movements from a forest patch to the matrix. The total number of bird movements and especially the number of forest specialists moving increased with increasing heterogeneity of the páramo matrix. Forest specialists moved shorter distances between patch and matrix, and with a higher proportion of stepping-stone movements (fly–perch–fly) than generalists. Our findings suggest that structurally heterogeneous vegetation in páramo habitats is important for the Andean bird community as páramo-matrix heterogeneity enhances bird movements across the landscape of Polylepis patches, especially for forest specialist birds. We emphasise that the heterogeneity of habitats in the high-altitude Andes, particularly páramo-matrix heterogeneity, is an important factor for conservation and has a potentially positive influence on connectivity at landscape scale.  aThis study was funded by the research fund of Universidad del Azuay under grants 2013-33 and 2016-40.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013–33cUniversidad del Azuay 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aAndes region 3aEcuador 0aPáramo matrix 0aPolylepis patches 0abird habitat guilds 0anative woody plants 0astepping-stone movements1 aSchabo, Dana G.1 aSiddons, David C.1 aFarwig, Nina0 tEmu.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 119, no. 1 p.53-60dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2018.15123713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245013500203300001800338500001100356520103700367592002801404650002201432650001701454650002201471650001701493650001001510650001201520650001001532650001301542650001701555650001801572650002201590773014601612856008201758852000901840655001201849IND60596432720221120044213.0181002e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059643272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8972-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoh, Nobuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8386-194310aBiosynthesis and production of quercitols and their application in the production of pharmaceuticals: current status and prospects  ap. 4641-4651.  aReview  a(−)-vibo-Quercitol is a deoxyinositol (1L-1,2,4/3,5-cyclohexanepentol) that occurs naturally in low concentrations in oak species, honeydew honey, and Gymnema sylvestre. The author’s research group recently reported that (−)-vibo-quercitol and scyllo-quercitol (2-deoxy-myo-inositol, 1,3,5/2,4-cyclohexanepentol), a stereoisomer of (−)-vibo-quercitol, are stereoselectively synthesized from 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose by the reductive reaction of a novel (−)-vibo-quercitol 1-dehydrogenase in Burkholderia terrae and of a known scyllo-inositol dehydrogenase in Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The author’s research group therefore identified two enzymes capable of producing both stereoisomers of deoxyinositols, which are rare in nature.

Enhanced turbidity and sediment re-suspension as well as grazing by waterfowl and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus L.) have been described to hamper this process in temperate lakes. Lake Müggelsee lost its submerged vegetation following increasing eutrophication in 1970. Re-colonization, mainly with Potamogeton pectinatus L., started in 1990 after reduction of external nutrient loads. Ten years later, plant biomass and colonization depth remained low. Exclosure experiments revealed that fishes contributed to the reduction of P. pectinatus biomass, although rudd were not abundant. Underwater videos showed that the abundant species perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) plucked on the plants approximately 2 and 1 times per hour and that bream (Abramis brama L.) mechanically stressed the plants by sucking the surrounding sediment. In laboratory experiments 1+ roach consumed P. pectinatus at a maximum rate of 1.4 mg dw plant g<sup>-1</sup> fw fish d<sup>-1</sup> when discontinuously fed or not fed with zooplankton. When continuously fed with zooplankton, plant biomass was not significantly reduced, independently of the amount fed. Plant material, however, was not found to be a major food item in the guts of roach in the lake. These findings suggest that young roach and perch did not feed on the plants but started plucking leaves during their search for benthic invertebrates during periods of low zooplankton biomass. This prevented P. pectinatus from growing to the surface to survive periods with low light availability in summer. The results imply that young roach and perch contribute to a delay in the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes, at least when plants are not growing at an optimum rate due to shading by periphyton and summer cyanobacteria blooms. In this case, biomanipulation of zooplanktivorous fish abundance will not only improve conditions for macrophyte re-colonization due to enhancement of grazing zooplankton but also due to reduced plant plucking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbramis brama 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aRutilus rutilus 3aStuckenia pectinata 3abiomass 3abream 3aeutrophication 3afoods 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3aleaves 3amacrophytes 3aperch 3aperiphyton 3apollution load 3asediments 3asummer 3aturbidity 3avegetation 3awaterfowl1 aDugdale, Tony0 tHydrobiologia.g2003 Nov., v. 506-509, no. 1-3 p.497-501dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008561.67513.ec  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172300001800271520207300289592002802362650001202390650002302402650001502425650002002440650001102460650005002471650001602521650001902537650002402556650001302580700001402593700001602607700001302623700001102636773012102647856008502768852000902853655001202862IND60408536620221121103238.0150908e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040853662DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10836332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hankui K.12aA generalization of spatial and temporal fusion methods for remotely sensed surface parameters  ap. 4411-4445.  aRemotely sensed surface parameters, such as vegetation index, leaf area index, surface temperature, and evapotranspiration, show diverse spatial scales and temporal dynamics. Generally the spatial and temporal resolutions of remote-sensing data should match the characteristics of surface parameters under observation. These requirements sometimes cannot be provided by a single sensor due to the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. Many spatial and temporal fusion (STF) methods have been proposed to derive the required data. However, the methodology suffers from disorderly development. To better inform future research, this study generalizes the existing methods from around 100 studies as spatial or temporal categories based on their physical assumptions related to spatial scales and temporal dynamics. To be specific, the assumptions are related to the scale invariance of the temporal information and temporal constancy of the spatial information. The spatial information can be contexture or spatial details. Experiments are conducted using Landsat data acquired on 13 dates in two study areas and simulated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The results are presented to demonstrate the typical methods from each category. This study concludes the following. (1) Contexture methods depend heavily on how components maps (contexture) are defined. They are not recommended except when components maps can be estimated properly from observed images. (2) The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) methods belong to the temporal and spatial categories, respectively. Thus, STARFM and ESTARFM should be better applied to temporal variance – dominated and spatial variance – -dominated areas, respectively. (3) Non-linear methods, such as the sparse representation-based spatio-temporal reflectance fusion model, can successfully address land-cover changes in addition to phonological changes, thereby providing a promising option for STF problems in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aevapotranspiration 3aland cover 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 3avariance1 aHuang, Bo1 aZhang, Ming1 aCao, Kai1 aYu, Le0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 36, no. 17 p.4411-4445dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10836333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013700169300001400306520108500320592002801405653002101433653002001454653001001474653002001484653003101504700001601535700001501551700001301566700001501579700001701594700001701611700001201628700001701640700001601657773010101673856008701774852000901861655001201870IND60594127220221118014526.0180510e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059412722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tongfei10aCarbon supported ultrafine gold phosphorus nanoparticles as highly efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline ethanol oxidation reaction  ap. 13-19.  aHerein, we develop a new kind of carbon supported gold-phosphorus (Au-P/C) electrocatalyst for the alkaline ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The Au-P/C catalysts with different Au/P ratio (i.e., AuP/C, Au3P2/C and Au4P3/C) can be obtained by a facile and novel hot-reflux method with white phosphorus (P4) as reductant and ethanol as solvent. The crystal structure, composition and particle-size of the Au-P/C catalysts are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. The results demonstrate that Au-P/C catalysts present an alloy phase with the high content of P, ultrafine particle-size and high dispersity on carbon support, which results in excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the EOR compared with that of the free-phosphorus Au/C catalyst. In addition, among the various Au-P/C catalysts with different Au/P ratio, the AuP/C sample exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance in comparison with other Au3P2/C and Au4P3/C samples.  aPublisher supplied data 0awhite phosphorus 0agold-phosphorus 0aalloy 0aelectrocatalyst 0aethanol oxidation reaction1 aFu, Gengtao1 aSu, Jiahui1 aWang, Yi1 aLv, Yinjie1 aZou, Xiuyong1 aZhu, Xiaoshu1 aXu, Lin1 aSun, Dongmei1 aTang, Yawen0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 231 p.13-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011500166300001800281520167500299592002801974650001202002650002302014650002102037650002902058650001202087650001902099650001502118650001502133650001902148650001502167650001102182650000902193651001002202651001802212700001902230700001802249773012102267856008502388852000902473655001202482IND60408536720221121074015.0150908e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040853672DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10845522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chi10aMapping the land-cover distribution in arid and semiarid urban landscapes with Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery  ap. 4483-4500.  aMapping the land-cover distribution in arid and semiarid urban landscapes using medium spatial resolution imagery is especially difficult due to the mixed-pixel problem in remotely sensed data and the confusion of spectral signatures among bare soils, sparse density shrub lands, and impervious surface areas (ISAs hereafter). This article explores a hybrid method consisting of linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA), decision tree classifier, and cluster analysis for mapping land-cover distribution in two arid and semiarid urban landscapes: Urumqi, China, and Phoenix, USA. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery was unmixed into four endmember fraction images (i.e. high-albedo object, low-albedo object, green vegetation (GV), and soil) using the LSMA approach. New variables from these fraction images and TM spectral bands were used to map seven land-cover classes (i.e. forest, shrub, grass, crop, bare soil, ISA, and water) using the decision tree classifier. The cluster analysis was further used to modify the classification results. QuickBird imagery in Urumqi and aerial photographs in Phoenix were used to assess classification accuracy. Overall classification accuracies of 86.0% for Urumqi and 88.7% for Phoenix were obtained, much higher accuracies than those utilizing the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). This research demonstrates the necessity of using new variables from fraction images to distinguish between ISA and bare soils and between shrub and other vegetation types. It also indicates the different effects of spatial patterns of land-cover composition in arid and semiarid landscapes on urban land-cover classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaerial photography 3acluster analysis 3adecision support systems 3agrasses 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aChina 3aUnited States1 aChen, Yaoliang1 aLu, Dengsheng0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 36, no. 17 p.4483-4500dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10845523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016300164300001800327520151000345592002801855596005701883650001701940650002301957650001001980650001601990650001202006650001302018650001302031650001202044650002202056650001502078650001602093700002202109700005502131773014602186856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60596432920221120044128.0181002e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059643292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8988-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Kosuke10aIdentification of the protocatechuate transporter gene in Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 and effects of overexpression on production of a value-added metabolite  ap. 4807-4816.  aSphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 expresses the best characterized catabolic systems for lignin-derived aromatic compounds. However, the uptake systems for these aromatics remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized the protocatechuate (PCA) transporter gene SLG_12880 (pcaK) in SYK-6. Sequence comparisons revealed that PcaK belongs to the aromatic acid/H⁺ symporter family of major facilitator superfamily transporters. Further, pcaK was highly conserved among Sphingomonadales possessing catabolic genes for vanillate and PCA. The growth of an SYK-6 pcaK mutant was significantly delayed on PCA medium and PCA uptake rate was only 8% of wild type. In addition, vanillate uptake rate was 78% of wild type, although the pcaK mutant grew as well as the wild type on vanillate. When pcaK was expressed in Sphingobium japonicum UT26S, the transformant acquired the capacity to uptake both PCA and vanillate. These results indicate that pcaK is responsible for the major proportion of PCA uptake and a minor fraction of vanillate uptake in SYK-6. The productivity of 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (PDC), a building block of functional polymers, was evaluated using a PDC hydrolase SYK-6 mutant harboring a pcaK plasmid. The mutant exhibited 1.27-fold greater PCA conversion and 1.24-fold greater PDC production compared to the control strain, suggesting that enhanced expression of transporter genes for lignin-derived aromatics can be used to increase the production of value-added metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H04473cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aSphingomonas 3aaromatic compounds 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amutants 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3aprotons 3asequence analysis 3asymporters 3avalue added1 aKamimura, Naofumi1 aMasai, Eiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9194-74830 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 102, no. 11 p.4807-4816dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8988-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008500162300001800247520147000265592002801735650001301763650002301776650001601799650001801815650002201833650001001855650001301865650000801878650004301886650001601929650001101945650002601956650001401982650002301996651001402019651001602033700002102049700002002070700001802090773012702108856007402235852000902309655001202318IND60656727820221118224916.0190814e20140213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065672782DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41870g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Daniel B.10aNon-destructive descriptions of carotenoids in feathers using Raman spectroscopy  ap. 1301-1308.  aChemical analyses of pigments in skin, scales, feathers and fur have provided deep insight into the colouration and visual communication strategies of animals. Carotenoid pigments in particular can be important colour signals in birds and other animals. Chromatographic analyses of plumage carotenoids require the destruction of one or more feathers, which has made pigment research on threatened species or museum specimens challenging. Here we show that Raman spectroscopy, coupled with multivariate statistics, can be used to identify the most abundant carotenoid within a single feather barb without sample destruction. Raman spectra from the feathers of 36 avian species were compared to data on pigment presence from high-performance liquid chromatography. Feathers rich with α-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, canary xanthophylls, canthaxanthin, cotingin or lutein were discriminated by subtle shifts in Raman spectral band positions, and by novel bands associated with particular carotenoids. As an example application of this method, we predicted the most abundant carotenoid in the plumage of selected Australian and New Zealand songbirds. α-Doradexanthin is predicted in the plumage of Petroica robins from Australia, whereas Petroica immigrants to New Zealand display a yellow carotenoid that is likely lutein. Raman spectroscopy is useful for non-destructive studies of carotenoids and is well-suited for analysing large ornithological museum collections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetroica 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aastaxanthin 3acanthaxanthin 3achemical analysis 3acolor 3afeathers 3afur 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmigration 3alutein 3amultivariate analysis 3asongbirds 3athreatened species 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aMcGraw, Kevin J.1 aJames, Helen F.1 aMadden, Odile0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Feb. 13, v. 6, no. 5 p.1301-1308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41870g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165300001600288520165400304592002801958650002201986650001202008650002402020650001102044650001102055650001102066650001002077650001502087651001002102651001802112700001402130700001302144773010902157856008102266852000902347655001202356IND60574288720221121214413.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057428872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0780-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Gengping10aIncorporating anthropogenic variables into ecological niche modeling to predict areas of invasion of Popillia japonica  ap. 151-160.  aNiche conservatism providing support for using ecological niche modeling in biological invasions has been widely noticed; nonetheless, the impacts of human disturbance on niche changes and model predictions are not fully recognized. In this study, climate niche changes during the invasion of Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) were studied under the framework of niche unfilling, stability, and expansion situations. The beetle might undergo niche expansion because of the small native range (Japan) relative to the broad invade range (North America). Relative roles of climatic and anthropogenic factors and their interactions in determining the spread of P. japonica were investigated. Results suggest that the climate niche was conserved during P. japonica invasion, climate niche unfilling rather than niche expansion was observed, suggesting there are suitable climate space remain unoccupied. Inclusion of anthropogenic factors into climate niche model has improved niche model prediction values in areas of high human activity. During P. japonica invasion, anthropogenic factors influenced the climate niche expression and altered the effect of climate suitability. In areas of poor or unsuitable climate, the human activities facilitated the establishment of P. japonica and functioned synergistically, whereas in highly suitable areas, including anthropogenic variables decreased climate suitability. These findings are pivotal to our understanding of climate niche conservatism and niche model transferability when predicting areas of invasion of P. japonica and can be applied elsewhere for predicting other pest’s invasion potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopillia japonica 3aclimate 3aecological invasion 3ahumans 3amodels 3aniches 3apests 3aprediction 3aJapan 3aNorth America1 aLi, Huiqi1 aZhao, Li0 tJournal of pest science.g2017 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.151-160dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-016-0780-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001600173245009200189300001600281520184000297592002802137650002102165650002302186650002402209650001002233650002302243650001602266650001102282650001602293650003002309650004502339650000902384650002902393700001702422700001402439773011702453856005502570852000902625655001202634IND50067265620221121051530.0130619e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006726562DNAL7 a237612782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1758-2229.2010.00228.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yanli10aTranscriptional response of methanogen mcrA genes to oxygen exposure of rice field soil  ap. 320-328.  aMethane production in paddy soil is substantially suppressed after even a brief exposure of soil to oxygen. We hypothesized that the strong response of methanogen activity is reflected in the transcription of functional genes rather than in the composition of the community of methanogens. Therefore, we determined the community composition and the transcriptional response of methanogens in a rice field soil by targeting the mcrA gene (encoding the α subunit of methyl‐coenzyme M reductase). Transcription of mcrA genes measured by quantitative PCR decreased by an order of magnitude after brief exposure to O₂. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of mcrA genes and gene transcripts showed that although the community structure of methanogens did not change, the composition of transcripts dramatically responded to O₂ exposure. In the beginning, transcripts of Methanocellales were the relatively most abundant, indicating resistance of these hydrogenotrophic methanogens against O₂ stress. Later on, mcrA transcripts of acetoclastic methanogens became relatively more abundant coinciding with the turnover of acetate. The transcription of Methanosarcinaceae was relatively greater when acetate accumulated while Methanosaetaceae became more active when acetate concentrations decreased. In the presence of methyl fluoride, a specific inhibitor of acetoclastic methanogenesis, mcrA transcription by Methanosaetaceae was greatly suppressed while that of Methanosarcinaceae was less affected. Our study showed that in contrast to constant community structure as revealed by DNA‐based fingerprinting the transcription of functional mcrA genes strongly responded to O₂ stress and the presence of inhibitor CH₃F. The response patterns reflected the genomic and physiological traits of individual methanogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaetaceae 3aMethanosarcinaceae 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aoxygen 3apaddy soils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arice 3atranscription (genetics)1 aConrad, Ralf1 aLu, Yahai0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2011 June, v. 3, no. 3 p.320-328dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2010.00228.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009100162300001800253520098700271592002801258650002101286650002301307650003901330650001701369650001301386650002601399700002101425700002301446700001801469700002201487773012801509856007401637852000901711655001201720IND60656727920221118224844.0190814e20140424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065672792DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41872c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoussef, Rasha M.10aMicrospectrometric determination of sibutramine in an adulterated slimming formulation  ap. 3395-3400.  aValidated methods for the quantification of sibutramine have been developed using spectrometry.

These methods were applied to the analysis of a laboratory prepared slimming product for the quantitative determination of illegally added sibutramine. The calibration curve area versus concentration was found to be linear in the ranges of 1–5 μg mL⁻¹ and 0.2–0.8 μg mL⁻¹ for the spectrophotometry and spectrofluorimetry, respectively.

The current study assessed the eating rate of Dutch food, and investigated the associations between eating rate and other food properties. We also explored the opportunities for a diet with a low energy intake rate (kJ/min). Laboratory data on the eating rate of 240 foods—representing the whole Dutch diet—was obtained. The results show a wide variation in both eating rate (from 2 g/min for rice waffle to 641 g/min for apple juice) and energy intake rate (from 0 kJ/min (0 kcal/min) for water to 1766 kJ/min (422 kcal/min) for chocolate milk). Eating rate was lower when foods were more solid. Moreover, eating rate was positively associated with water content and inversely with energy density. Energy intake rate differed substantially between and within food groups, demonstrating that the available foods provide opportunities for selecting alternatives with a lower energy intake rate. These findings offer guidance when selecting foods to reduce energy intake.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapple juice 3achocolate milk 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aenergy density 3aenergy intake 3afood groups 3afood quality 3arice 3awater content1 aWerts, Melanie1 aSiebelink, Els1 ade Graaf, Cees1 aMars, Monica0 tFoods.g2017 Oct. 02, v. 6, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods61000873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009400166300001400260500001100274520178600285592002802071650001302099650001302112650001602125650002202141650001002163650001902173650001102192650001402203650001902217650001702236650001402253650001902267650001402286650003302300650002802333650002202361650002602383650002302409700003002432700002002462700002002482773010702502856008102609852000902690655001202699IND60574288820221122143124.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057428882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0782-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuche, Julien10aUse the insiders: could insect facultative symbionts control vector-borne plant diseases?  ap. 51-68.  aReview  aInsect vector-borne plant diseases, particularly those whose causative agents are viral, or phloem- and xylem-restricted bacteria, greatly impact crop losses. Since plants are immobile, the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases greatly depends on insect vectors, which are the only means of dissemination for many pathogens. The effectiveness of a vector-borne pathogen relies upon the vectorial capacity, which is affected by vector density, feeding activity on hosts, longevity before and after pathogen ingestion, duration of the incubation period, and vector competence. During the last decade, research on human vector-borne epidemics has stimulated interest in novel control strategies targeting different parts of the vector cycle, and our purpose here is to draw parallels between this field of research and agronomy. We review the literature on insect vectors of crop diseases and their symbiotic microorganisms with the aim of suggesting future integrated management techniques based on current research on insect-vectored human diseases. Vector transmission is a complex process and different modes of transmission are encountered irrespective of the pathogen. Facultative symbionts have varied effects on life history traits that could be used for vector population control. Symbiont selection, transformation, and their manner of dissemination are important when developing an integrated vector management system based on symbiont manipulation. In the short term, progress on our knowledge of the microflora of insect vectors of plant diseases must be made. In the long term, symbiont manipulation, which has been successfully demonstrated against human insect-vectored diseases, could be adapted to insect-borne plant diseases to increase sustainable crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abacteria 3acrop losses 3adisease outbreaks 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ainsect vectors 3alife history 3alongevity 3amicrosymbionts 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asustainable agriculture 3avector competence 3avector-borne diseases 3avectorial capacity1 aAuricau-Bouvery, Nathalie1 aDanet, Jean-Luc1 aThiéry, Denis,0 tJournal of pest science.g2017 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.51-68dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-016-0782-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245016700159300001600326520191300342592002802255650002502283650001802308650003002326650002102356650001002377650001402387650001602401650001302417650001902430650001902449650002502468650001002493650001002503650001602513650001502529650000902544650004402553650001102597650001302608650002102621650001202642650001302654650002302667650001602690650001702706650000902723651001802732653003002750653002502780653001702805653002902822653002502851653001802876653001502894653001502909700001902924700001602943700001902959773010602978856007503084852000903159655001203168IND60615108220221120041543.0181004e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061510822DNAL7 a10.1354/vp.41-4-3532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarner, M.

Of these, 12 (20%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three were pets submitted from private veterinary practices. The others were submitted from zoos in the United States. All were adults, ranging from young adult to 7 years of age, with average age of 5.1 years. The most common clinical signs were weight loss, lethargy, palpable abdominal mass, and respiratory difficulty. All tumors were well-differentiated HCCs in which four histologic patterns were recognized. The trabecular pattern was predominant in nine tumors, and the pseudoglandular pattern was predominant in two tumors. The pelioid pattern was also represented in eight tumors. A papillary pattern was present in one case. In seven cases vacuolar change resembling lipidosis was present in the neoplastic hepatocytes of both primary and metastatic tumors. Anaplasia was mild to moderate in most tumors, but a marked degree of anaplasia was noted in the metastatic foci of the case with papillary differentiation. Metastasis to lung was noted in five cases. One of these also had metastasis to the spleen, and another had metastasis to heart and mediastinum. In two cases there was concurrent hepatitis and in two cases, cirrhosis. All tumors and nonneoplastic liver stained negatively for woodchuck hepatitis virus surface and core antigens, and orcein and Victoria blue positive staining of hepatocytes typical of hepadnavirus infection in humans and woodchucks was not present. HCC is apparently common in captive prairie dogs. The hepatic neoplasia observed in prairie dogs was similar to that associated with hepadnaviral infection in humans, wood-chucks, and ground squirrels, but no direct evidence of hepadnaviral infection was detected. The rate of metastasis in captive prairie dogs was higher than that reported in woodchucks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynomys ludovicianus 3aMarmota monax 3aWoodchuck hepatitis virus 3aanimal pathology 3aheart 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahistopathology 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3alungs 3amediastinum 3ametastasis 3apets 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aspleen 3astaining 3asurface antigens 3atissues 3avacuoles 3aveterinary clinics 3aweight loss 3ayoung adults 3azoos 3aUnited States 0aBlack-tailed prairie dogs 0aCynomys ludivicianus 0ahepadnavirus 0ahepatocellular carcinoma 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aMarmota monax 0amorphology 0awoodchucks1 aRaymond, J.

These results and others from several eukaryotic models link lipid metabolism with membrane morphodynamics that are involved in membrane trafficking. Focus has been expanded to other lipid families, and numerous evidences are given showing lipids and lipid-modifying enzymes as key regulators of membrane homeostasis which can strongly regulate membrane morphodynamics and therefore trafficking. Beside protein-based machineries, lipid-based machineries are also shown as crucial regulatory forces involved in protein transport and sorting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGolgi apparatus 3adetergents 3afenpropimorph 3aglucosylceramides 3ahomeostasis 3alipid metabolism 3amodels 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein transport 3asterols0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2007 May 1, v. 2, no. 3 p.157-159dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.2.3.36863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014600168300001800314520141300332592002801745596003801773650002101811650002301832650001501855650002101870650002501891650001601916650002801932650002001960650001101980650000701991650002101998650001102019650001602030700002302046700002602069700001902095700001502114700001802129773014602147856008202293852000902375655001202384IND60596433120221122001917.0181002e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059643312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8987-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObeng, Eugene M.14aThe workability of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 expression platforms with autodisplayed cellulases: a comparison  ap. 4829-4841.  aThis article comparatively reports the workability of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 cell factories for the expression of three model autodisplayed cellulases (i.e., endoglucanase, BsCel5A; exoglucanase, CelK; β-glucosidase, BglA). The differentiation of the recombinant cells was restricted to their cell growth and enzyme expression/activity attributes. Comparatively, the recombinant E. coli showed higher cell growth rates but lower enzyme activities than the recombinant P. putida. However, the endo-, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase on the surfaces of both cell factories showed activity over a broad range of pH (4–10) and temperature (30–100 °C). The pH and temperature optima were pH 6, 60 °C (BsCel5A); pH 6, 60–70 °C (CelK); and pH 6, 50 °C (BglA). Overall, the P. putida cell factory with autodisplayed enzymes demonstrated higher bioactivity and remarkable biochemical characteristics and thus was chosen for the saccharification of filter paper. A volumetric blend of the three cellulases with P. putida as the host yielded a ratio of 1:1:1.5 of endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase, respectively, as the optimum blend composition for filter paper degradation. At an optical density (578 nm) of 50, the blend generated a maximum sugar yield of about 0.7 mg/ml (~ 0.08 U/g) from Whatman filter paper (Ø 6 mm, ~ 2.5 mg) within 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data  aGL00139cAutodisplay Biotech GmbH 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aabsorbance 3abeta-glucosidase 3abioactive properties 3acell growth 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3amodels 3apH 3asaccharification 3asugars 3atemperature1 aBrossette, Tatjana1 aOngkudon, Clarence M.1 aBudiman, Cahyo1 aMaas, Ruth1 aJose, Joachim0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 102, no. 11 p.4829-4841dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8987-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010300171300001600274520081500290592002801105653001901133653001701152653001801169653001501187700001501202700001501217700001401232700001501246700001701261773010301278856008701381852000901468655001201477IND60594127720221118014505.0180510e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059412772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazarkina, Y.10aFeatures of Porous Anodic Alumina Growth in Galvanostatic Regime in Selenic Acid Based Electrolyte  ap. 327-335.  aThe features of porous anodic Al2O3 formation process in galvanostatic regime in selenic acid based electrolyte under a range of anodization conditions were investigated. The growth process kinetics of porous anodic Al2O3 was characterized by chronopotentiometric curves. The effect of electrolyte concentration, current density and anodization duration on the oxide porous structure ordering was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Approximate regions of self-ordered porous Al2O3 formation process conditions were estimated. It was found that anodization parameters, at which self-ordered porous structure formation is observed, correspond to the conditions of equilibrium of oxidation and etching rates. It is shown that deviations from these conditions lead to the disordering of the porous structure.  aPublisher supplied data 0aporous alumina 0aselenic acid 0aself-ordering 0amorphology1 aKamnev, K.1 aDronov, A.1 aDudin, A.1 aPavlov, A.1 aGavrilov, S.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 231 p.327-335dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009100175300001600266500002000282520130900302592002801611650002301639650003001662650001301692650001001705650002401715650001101739650001401750650002301764650001401787650001401801650001601815650002001831650001301851700002401864700002601888773012001914852000902034856008902043655001202132IND4435155020221120073347.0180321e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443515502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01671.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMøller, Anders P.10aPredators and microorganisms of prey: goshawks prefer prey with small uropygial glands  ap. 608-613.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1. The uropygial gland of birds produces chemical substances with antimicrobial properties that have been shown to reduce the abundance of feather degrading bacteria and other microorganisms. These microorganisms would affect the flight capabilities of birds and, consequently, a relationship between size of uropygial glands and probability of capture by aerial predators should exist. 2. We tested this hypothesis by estimating the susceptibility of 56 species of prey of the goshawk Accipiter gentilis Linnaeus to predation as the observed abundance of prey relative to the expected abundance from mean population density. 3. In a comparative analysis of the relationship between relative size of the uropygial gland and susceptibility to predation we found a strong negative relationship accounting for 16% of the variance. This relationship was present in analyses that accounted for similarity due to common phylogenetic descent, the fact that prey of intermediate size were preferred, and that larger prey species have larger uropygial glands. 4. These observations are consistent with uropygial glands being under strong selection from aerial predators that are likely mediated by the effect of uropygial glands on feather degrading bacteria and therefore on flight capabilities of birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAccipiter gentilis 3aanti-infective properties 3abacteria 3abirds 3achemical substances 3aflight 3aphylogeny 3apopulation density 3apredation 3apredators 3aprobability 3auropygial gland 3avariance1 aErritzoe, Johannes,1 aTøttrup Nielsen, Jan0 tFunctional ecology.g2010 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.608-613dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44821x0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01671.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02811naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245008800174300001600262500001400278520164800292592002801940650001901968650003101987650001502018650002702033653002402060653002902084653002402113653002702137700001902164700001502183700001702198700002302215700001802238773008002256856008002336852000902416655001202425IND60704995520221122144825.0200729s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070499552DNAL7 a10.1163/156854108/3991822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgermeister, Wolfgang10aITS-RFLP analysis, an efficient tool for differentiation of Bursaphelenchus species  ap. 649-668.  aNAL-light  aRestriction analysis of amplified ribosomal ITS sequences has provided species-specific fragment patterns for nematodes of several genera, including Bursaphelenchus.

'corneolus', B. lini, B. singaporensis and B. sexdentati, additional bands in the patterns of certain isolates or individual nematodes were observed which may be explained by ITS sequence microheterogeneity, i.e., the presence of ITS sequence variants within the number of rDNA tandem repeats. Since these 'extra' bands appeared only with one out of the five restriction enzymes employed, they did not seriously impair identification of species based on the overall reference patterns. ITS-RFLP analysis has proved valuable for differentiation of the pathogenic pine wood nematode, B. xylophilus, from related species. In many recent descriptions of new Bursaphelenchus species, ITS-RFLP profiles have been used as additional species identification criteria. Comparison of profiles from isolates of many different origins has provided new information on intraspecific types or genetically distinct provenances of several Bursaphelenchus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphelenchoides 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3anematology 3aspecies identification 0aINTRASPECIFIC TYPES 0aPINE WOOD NEMATODE (PWN) 0aMOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS 0aITS MICROHETEROGENEITY1 aBraasch, Helen1 aMetge, Kai1 aGu, Jianfeng1 aSchröder, Thomas,1 aWoldt, Elvira0 tNematology.g, v. 11, no. 5 p.649-668dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854108/3991823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245016800163300001800331500001100349520153300360592002801893650001401921650002201935650001801957650001801975650001701993650001302010650001302023650002502036650001302061650000902074650002302083650002202106700002902128700002502157700006402182773012502246856007302371961000902444852000902453655001202462IND60754875620221116153523.0211026e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075487562DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.71932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssunção, Michelly10aClinical efficacy of subgingivally delivered propolis as an adjuvant to nonsurgical periodontal treatment of periodontitis: A systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 5584-5595.  aREVIEW  aThis systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluated randomized and nonrandomized studies that assessed the effect of local subgingival propolis as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) in the treatment of periodontitis. A detailed search was carried out in Cochrane Library, Embase, LILACS, LIVIVO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, with no time or language restrictions. A grey literature search was also conducted. The methodology of included studies was evaluated by the Cochrane RoB2 tool. The certainty of each clinical outcome was assessed by the GRADE system. Meta‐analyses of mean difference were conducted using the random‐effects model, through RevMan 5.4 software. Six studies met the eligibility criteria to be synthesized in the qualitative analysis, and three studies were included in the meta‐analysis. The subgingival application of propolis as an adjunct to NSPT improved probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) in most of the assessed studies. The overall mean difference in PPD reduction was 1.49 mm, 30–45 days after treatment, and 0.8 mm, 90 days after treatment, with very low level of certainty. The overall bias was scored as high risk for all included studies. The adjunctive use of locally delivered propolis associated to NSPT to treat periodontitis may improve periodontal clinical parameters, compared with NSPT alone/placebo. However, the evidence was not strong enough to safely base any clinical recommendation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3acomputer software 3ameta-analysis 3aperiodontitis 3aphytotherapy 3aplacebos 3apropolis 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3astatistical models 3asystematic review1 aCarneiro, Valéria M.

Paratuberculosis was experimentally produced in 20 crossbred lambs by oral administration of MAP to study the sequential development of lesions between 10 and 330 days postinfection and to assess commonly used diagnostic methods such as bacterial culture, lymphocyte stimulation test (LST), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during progressive stages of infection. Histologic lesions were classified into four grades from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 4 (most severe) on the basis of location of granulomatous lesions in different regions and layers of intestines, their association with intestinal lymphoid tissues, pattern and distribution of lesions, types of cellular infiltration, and presence of acid-fast bacilli. It is evident that infection first establishes in lymphoid tissues of the small intestine, possibly at multiple sites, producing segmental lesions and from there spreads to lamina propria and local lymph nodes. Wide variability in the histologic lesions in relation to postinfection periods and initial tropism of MAP to the intestinal lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches) suggests a differential susceptibility of young animals, possibly because of compositional phenotypic variation of Peyer's patches influencing subsequent course of infection. Histopathology was found to be a better indicator of paratuberculous infection than bacteriology in sheep. The LST (reflecting the cellular immune response) and ELISA (reflecting the humoral immune response) had overall sensitivities of 65% (11 of 17) and 42% (8 of 19), respectively, in sheep with different types of pathology but when employed together could detect about 88% of infected animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aPeyer's patches 3aanimal pathology 3abacterial culture 3abacteriology 3acrossbreds 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3alambs 3alymph nodes 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aoral administration 3aparatuberculosis 3apathogenesis 3aphenotypic variation 3asmall intestine 3atissues 0aBacteriologic culture 0aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0ahistopathology 0aimmune responses 0alymphocyte stimulation test 0aparatuberculosis 0apathogenesis 0asheep1 aTripathi, B.

One way to achieve this goal in crops is to enhance nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition through the mycorrhizal association. This study examined the effect of mycorrhization on post-anthesis N and P dynamics and its impact on grain yield and quality in barley. In addition, the efficiency of both N and P utilization and remobilization was evaluated. With those purposes, barley plants inoculated or not with Rhizophagus intraradices were grown in a soil poor in N and P under greenhouse conditions. Inoculation with R. intraradices in barley enhanced both N and P content in grain and vegetative tissue and reduced phloem amino acid export rate. On the other hand, both N and P vegetative tissue content and phloem amino acid and P export rates decreased during grain filling, whereas N and P grain content increased in both treatments according to the senescence process. However, whereas N grain concentration decreased during grain filling, P grain concentration did not vary, thus suggesting a differential regulation on grain filling. Inoculation with R. intraradices improved the yield and grain quality, thus demonstrating that inoculation with R. intraradices in barley is beneficial, but mycorrhization caused a diminution in nutrient utilization efficiency. As the phloem remobilization rate of amino acids and P did not decrease during grain filling in R. intraradices-inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated ones, these results suggest that nutrient utilization efficiency is most probably regulated by sink strength rather by a mycorrhizal effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilling period 3abarley 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3anutrient utilization 3asoil 3aamino acids 3aphloem 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3amycorrhizae 3aphosphorus 3anutrient use efficiency 3acrops 0asenescence1 aH.

In rivers, the extent to which dispersal processes influence local assemblage composition may depend on both the taxon and habitat in question. Poor dispersers should display greater spatial structuring than strong dispersers. Likewise, assemblages in poorly connected habitats should experience greater dispersal limitation, and therefore greater spatial structuring. We sought to test these hypotheses using two contrasting orders of aquatic insect, Odonata and Trichoptera. Odonata are believed to have greater dispersal capacity than Trichoptera. In river ecosystems, these orders inhabit both main channel habitats and more poorly connected riverine wetlands. Multi‐habitat surveys of larval Trichoptera and Odonata assemblages were conducted at 34 sites in three 5th‐order New Brunswick rivers. The degree of spatial and environmental structuring in assemblages was assessed using redundancy analysis‐based variance partitioning. We also assessed the performance of different model‐based spatial predictors (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEMs and principal coordinates of neighbourhood matrices, PCNMs). For main channel areas, variance explained purely by environmental variables was greater for Odonata, while the purely spatial component of variance was greater for Trichoptera, regardless of the class of spatial descriptor. In riverine wetlands, both the purely environmental and purely spatial components of variance explained were similar or were greater for Trichoptera than for Odonata. The component of variance explained by spatial variables was greater in riverine wetlands than main channel areas for both Odonata and Trichoptera for most spatial descriptors, suggesting that taxa inhabiting riverine wetlands may experience greater dispersal limitation. However, the magnitude of this difference was relatively small in most cases. Eigenvector‐based spatial descriptors (PCNMs, AEMs, netPCNMs) explained more variance than traditional spatial descriptors. For Trichoptera, network‐based predictors (AEMs, netPCNMs) explained more variance than PCNMs in main channel areas. Our results suggest that dispersal ability and habitat type can influence the degree of spatial structuring in aquatic insect assemblages. However, these patterns must be investigated across a wider range of insect groups and at larger spatial scales. Our results also suggest that biomonitoring programs should consider assemblage spatial structure in building reference condition models and that aquatic conservation planners must consider the type and spatial arrangement of habitats in reserve design. Eigenvector‐based spatial descriptors hold promise for interpreting biodiversity patterns in freshwater invertebrates, but more work is required to relate patterns to actual dispersal behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdonata 3aTrichoptera 3aaquatic insects 3abiodiversity 3adispersal behavior 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3amodels 3arivers 3asurveys 3avariance 3awetlands 3aNew Brunswick1 aBaird, Donald J.0 tFreshwater biology.g2015 Oct., v. 60, no. 10 p.2142-2155dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.126403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01674naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245006200163300002000225520074700245592002800992650003601020650001201056650001301068700001701081700006401098773014901162856007601311852000901387655001201396IND60746162020220218000000.0210729e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074616202DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c064742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUttry, Alexander10aLate-Stage β-C(sp³)–H Deuteration of Carboxylic Acids  ap. 10895-10901.  aCarboxylic acids are highly abundant in bioactive molecules. In this study, we describe the late-stage β-C(sp³)–H deuteration of free carboxylic acids. On the basis of the finding that C–H activation with our catalysts is reversible, the de-deuteration process was first optimized. The resulting method uses ethylenediamine-based ligands and can be used to achieve the desired deuteration when using a deuterated solvent. The reported method allows for the functionalization of a wide range of free carboxylic acids with diverse substitution patterns, as well as the late-stage deuteration of bioactive molecules and related frameworks and enables the functionalization of nonactivated methylene β-C(sp³)–H bonds for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3aligands 3asolvents1 aMal, Sourjya1 avan Gemmeren, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3080-35790 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 July 19, v. 143, no. 29 p.10895-10901dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c064743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012500162300001800287520195400305592002802259650001302287650001202300650002202312650001502334650002602349650001602375650001002391650001502401650001402416650001502430650001802445650002402463650001202487650002902499650001402528650002002542651001202562700001902574700002302593773011402616856007302730852000902803655001202812IND60408537320221121103255.0150908e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040853732DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.126332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobbaert, Danielle10aResistance to drought affects persistence of alternative regimes in shallow lakes of the Boreal Plains (Alberta, Canada)  ap. 2084-2099.  aWe examined how lake and landscape factors affected the persistence of alternative regimes in 23 predominantly fishless, shallow lake ecosystems over seven years in the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada. The alternative regimes were dominance by SAV (submerged aquatic vegetation) or by phytoplankton. The relationship between alternative regime persistence and a suite of lake and landscape variables were determined using regression tree analysis. We also compared the environmental variables and biological communities among alternative regimes using Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric tests and post hoc tests. Persistence of the SAV‐rich regime was best predicted by water level stability. Switches from a SAV‐rich regime to a phytoplankton‐rich regime have been attributed to drought, which concentrates total phosphorus (TP) and other solutes and increases turbidity, favouring phytoplankton dominance. Lakes with stable water levels are inferred as less sensitive to drought, and presumably experience less evapoconcentration during drought, which helps maintain the SAV‐rich regime. Lakes with more water level drawdown may also delay or inhibit SAV growth through physical disturbance. In contrast, the persistence of the phytoplankton‐rich regime was highest in lakes with higher TP and a lower proportion of surrounding wetlands. We postulate that lakes with less wetland in the buffer are more responsive to variations in precipitation because these systems have a smaller water storage capacity and lack peatlands that otherwise attenuate the effects of drought via shallow groundwater inputs. The relative persistence of lakes in the study area was related to lake and landscape factors that affect the relative sensitivity of the lakes to drought conditions. The biological community in these predominantly fishless lakes appears to play a weak role in maintaining the alternative regimes compared to fish‐bearing lake systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrawdown 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agroundwater 3alakes 3alandscapes 3apeatlands 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3asolutes 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aturbidity 3awetland buffers 3aAlberta1 aWong, Agnes S.1 aBayley, Suzanne E.0 tFreshwater biology.g2015 Oct., v. 60, no. 10 p.2084-2099dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.126333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012200153300001800275520046700293592002800760650002600788650003600814650002300850650002900873650002000902650001200922700001900934700001600953773013400969856007401103852000901177655001201186IND60700172720221121235418.0200626e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070017272DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02531c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu10aIr-catalyzed selective dehydrogenative cross-coupling of aryls with o-carboranes via a mixed directing-group strategy  ap. 7001-7004.  aAn efficient Ir-catalyzed selective B–H/C–H dehydrocoupling between o-carboranes and (hetero)aryls has been achieved based on a mixed directing-group strategy, leading to a wide variety of carborane-(hetero)arene combinations.

Despite their ubiquity, little is known of their at-sea foraging movement, as their small size and frequent diving behaviour have presented logistic challenges to obtaining high-resolution tracking data that reflect detailed movement patterns. We present the first attempt to collect detailed (5 min/fix) movement trajectories of Common Diving Petrels, using miniaturised global positioning system (GPS) loggers. Adult breeding Common Diving Petrels were tracked for single foraging trips from Tiritiri Matangi Island near Auckland, New Zealand. We applied a hidden Markov model to infer behavioural states from the movement data, and a kernel density estimation on the GPS fixes of area-restricted behaviour to characterise feeding hotspots. We found that Common Diving Petrels in the Hauraki Gulf are local foragers during their breeding season, and the model results indicated that foraging accounted for two-thirds of all behaviour states. At-sea foraging activities of the birds were concentrated in areas up to 30 km from their colony. Our findings reveal the utility of combining GPS tracking with behavioural models to infer the foraging behaviours and space-use patterns of small seabird taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aProcellariidae 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aforaging 3aglobal positioning systems 3aislands 3amodels 3aseabirds 3astatistical analysis 3atelemetry 3aNew Zealand 0aForaging behaviour 0asmall seabird 0aCommon Diving Petrels 0aGPS tracking 0ahidden Markov model 0akernel density1 aRayner, Matt1 aVickers, Shae1 aLanders, Todd1 aSagar, Rachael1 aStewart, John1 aDunphy, Brendon0 tEmu.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 119, no. 2 p.126-137dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2018.15589973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147242010300163245011800266300001600384520092200400592002801322650002001350650002501370650002101395650002601416650002601442650002001468650002901488650001601517650001301533650001401546650002501560650002401585650001901609650002001628650001101648650001401659650001001673650001101683700001401694700001701708700001901725773008901744856004801833852000901881655001201890IND50067478120161205000000.0130629e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND5006747812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10298-013-0777-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheurfa, M.10a Effect of essential oil of Thymus vulgaris on bacterial pathogens responsible for gastroenteritis10aEffet de l’huile essentielle de Thymus vulgaris sur les bactéries pathogènes responsables de gastroentérites  ap. 154-160.  aDifferent aromatic plants synthesize molecules that are fragrant essential oils that can have an effect equivalent to that of antibiotics, thanks to the chemical nature of their constituents. This work concerns the study of the antibacterial activity of essential oil of Thymus vulgaris against five pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus) responsible for gastro-enteritis. The chemical composition of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris was analyzed by GC/MS. The major components are Carvacrol and Thymol. The inhibition tests were carried out by the disk diffusion method, the results showed strong antibacterial activity of essential oil with diameters ranging from 22.00 and 45.00 mm. These results suggest that the use of the essential oil of thyme could better protect humans against bacteria that cause gastro-enteritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aThymus vulgaris 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acarvacrol 3achemical composition 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3agastroenteritis 3ahumans 3apathogens 3athyme 3athymol1 aAllem, R.1 aSebaihia, M.1 aBelhireche, S.0 tPhytothérapie.g2013 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.154-160dSpringer-Verlagx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-013-0777-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007000166300001600236520167700252592002801929650001801957650001601975650001901991650001502010650001202025650001502037650001002052650001202062650001502074650001202089650001502101650001602116650001202132650001002144650001702154650001002171651001602181700001602197700001402213700002302227700001902250773010902269856008102378852000902459655001202468IND60574289520221122143140.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057428952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0789-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNboyine, J.

Here, the endemic New Zealand weta, Hemiandrus sp. ‘promontorius’, and Festulolium loliaceum infected with Epichloë uncinata, were used to study the effect of endophyte-mediated resistance in grasses on this large orthopteran insect in the laboratory, and the effects of this interaction on the grass. The insect was presented with F. loliaceum with and without E. uncinata infection in no-choice and paired choice experiments. Other controls were Epichloë festucae-infected Festuca rubra and endophyte-free Lolium perenne. In no-choice experiments, persistent attempts by the insect to graze the endophyte-infected grasses (but promptly abandoning them) resulted in a significantly higher number of plants lost due to excision at their stems after the first bite (P = 0.004). The inability of affected grasses to compensate for the lost biomass resulted in a lack of significant difference between the dry biomass of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free controls (P = 0.206). However, in choice experiments, there was a preference for the endophyte-free controls when they were paired with the endophyte-infected grasses (P < 0.05). The current work shows that endophyte-infected grasses can sustain high plant losses when attacked by an orthopteran insect in the absence of an alternative food source. This contrasts other endophyte/herbivory experiments in which high herbivory occurs because chemical plant defences are at a low concentration or the endophytes have other non-toxin roles in the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca rubra 3aFestulolium 3aLolium perenne 3aOrthoptera 3abiomass 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3apests 3aplant damage 3astems 3aNew Zealand1 aSaville, D.1 aBoyer, S.1 aCruickshank, R.

A preliminary version of the scale contained 71 items covering areas identified previously as important in determining health behavior. From pretesting of the scale, 40 items were selected for further study. Items were submitted to factor analysis to determine the dimensions measured. Seven factors using 38 items emerged that were relatively independent and reliable. Validity of the scale was tested by its ability to predict compliance with medical regimens six weeks later in 120 men. Compliance was measured by self-report and nurse's evaluation as well as by metabolic control of diabetes. Different factors were associated significantly with compliance and control. Although tested only on men, the DHBS should be useful in describing the health beliefs of diabetic patients and could suggest areas where intervention was needed to improve compliance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acompliance 3adiabetes 3afactor analysis 3ahealth behavior 3ahealth beliefs 3amen 3apatients1 aLinn, Margaret W.1 aSkyler, Jay S.1 aSandifer, Richard0 tDiabetes educator.g1987 June, v. 13, no. 3 p.292-297dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721787013003103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008300171300001400254500001100268520172900279592002802008650001602036650001502052650001802067650003102085650002602116650002202142650002002164650001602184650001402200650002102214650001502235700002902250773010702279856008102386852000902467655001202476IND60574289620221122143208.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057428962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0795-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumbos, Christos I.14aThe use of entomopathogenic nematodes in the control of stored-product insects  ap. 39-49.  aReview  aThis review highlights the latest findings regarding the use of entomopathogenic nematodes against post-harvest insects. Due to their requirements for moisture, entomopathogenic nematodes had received, until lately, limited attention for application to the dry storage environment. Recent improvements of their formulation and application approaches, as well as the discovery of new, more virulent strains have enhanced the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes and renewed interest in using entomopathogenic nematodes in the stored-product environment. The nematode species tested against storage insects belong exclusively to the genera Steinernema and Heterhorhabditis. The virulence of entomopathogenic nematodes against post-harvest insects varies depending on the nematode species and strain. Usually, only a single-nematode species or strain is not equally effective against all major stored-product insect pests; therefore, one nematode strain or species cannot be suitable for controlling all species present in the storage environment, where several insect species coexist. The successful application of entomopathogenic nematodes in storage environments for controlling post-harvest insects is highly dependent on several biotic and abiotic factors, such as the host life stage, temperature, and relative humidity. Entomopathogenic nematodes have still to overcome substantial hurdles to become a reliable alternative for commercial applications in warehouses and storage facilities. However, the use of innovative, enhanced methods of formulation and application, such as encapsulation or bait traps, could boost the exploitation of entomopathogenic nematodes in storage facilities against post-harvest insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSteinernema 3abait traps 3aencapsulation 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aenvironmental factors 3arelative humidity 3astorage insects 3atemperature 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3awarehouses1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.0 tJournal of pest science.g2017 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.39-49dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-016-0795-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245010100186300001600287520170900303592002802012650002402040650001302064650001802077650003602095650001102131650001602142650001202158650001602170650001202186650002502198650001602223650001702239650001202256650001502268650001102283650001902294650001402313650002302327650002502350650001002375650001202385650002802397650004502425650003602470650004802506650002102554650004502575650002602620650003002646650004402676650004102720650003602761650004202797650004702839700001802886700001802904773010202922856008703024852000903111655001203120IND4485490920221120193355.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448549092DNAL7 a217986892pmid7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolakof, S.10aGhrelin effects on central glucosensing and energy homeostasis-related peptides in rainbow trout  ap. 126-136.  aAlthough the role of ghrelin (GHRL) on fish appetite regulation had been widely studied in past years, its involvement in the regulation of glucose metabolism had been little explored. In the present study we hypothesize that GHRL may have a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in fish. Therefore, we carried out different experimental approaches in rainbow trout to assess brain glucosensing potential and glucose metabolism in response to GHRL treatment. We found that after either systemic or central GHRL administration to trout deprived of food, glycemia remained unaffected, whereas (in clear contrast with the mammalian model) a consistent activation of the main glucosensing markers (glucose transporter 2, glucokinase, and ATP-sensitive inward rectified K⁺ channel) was noticed in both hypothalamus and hindbrain. Some of these results were further confirmed by in vitro incubations of hypothalamus and hindbrain in the presence of GHRL. Despite the lack of changes in glycemia, we suggest that the changes elicited by GHRL on the glucosensing system are direct and could be related to a helper action of this hormone when glucose arrived in the postprandial phase. Moreover, we also studied the effect of GHRL treatment on the expression of several food intake-related neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, pro-opiomelanocortin, and corticotropin-releasing factor. We observed an important variability in the effects of GHRL attributable either to the route of GHRL administration or to the brain regions assessed, which could help explain the contradictory results described in fish literature about GHRL role in food intake control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aappetite 3ablood glucose 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3aenergy 3afood intake 3aghrelin 3aglucokinase 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3amammals 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aneuropeptide Y 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3apro-opiomelanocortin 3atrout 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFood Deprivation 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGhrelinxpharmacology 2aHomeostasisxdrug effects 2aHypothalamusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNeuropeptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxphysiology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRhombencephalonxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aMíguez, J.M.1 aSoengas, J.L.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2011 Oct., v. 41, no. 3 p.126-136dElsevier Inc.x0739-72407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011100155300001800266500001500284520098000299592002801279650001201307650001901319650001401338650001701352650003101369650001501400650001001415650002201425650002301447653001001470700001801480700001701498700002001515773012701535856007401662852000901736655001201745IND60656728720221118224646.0190814e20140327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065672872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41889h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao10aRapid identification of black peanut seeds by confocal micro-Raman and near-infrared FT-Raman spectroscopy  ap. 2537-2544.  a2019-12-06  aConfocal micro-Raman spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) FT-Raman spectroscopy were used to analyse and identify cotyledons and the skins of black, white, red and ordinary pink peanut seeds. The former method was equipped with a 785 nm semiconductor laser and a 514 nm Ar⁺ laser; the latter method was equipped with a 1064 nm Nd:YVO₄ laser. These methods were also utilised to distinguish black peanut seeds from cheap and imitation coloured black peanut seeds. Significant Raman vibration peaks were detected and assigned by 785 nm Raman and 1064 nm NIR FT-Raman spectroscopy for the black peanut cotyledons. Three bands in the 1064 nm NIR FT-Raman spectra of peanut skins could have critical functions in distinguishing black peanuts from the other three peanut varieties. The two rapid, simple spectral analysis approaches were also demonstrated to distinguish black peanut seeds from coloured black peanut seeds, which is important to ensure food quality and safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeanuts 3asemiconductors 3avibration 3afood quality 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3acotyledons 3acolor 3aspectral analysis 3aRaman spectroscopy 0aseeds1 aLiu, Hongxing1 aLiu, Hanping1 aZeng, Changchun0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Mar. 27, v. 6, no. 8 p.2537-2544dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41889h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245015900204506007600363520102900439592002801468506003701496650002601533650002701559650001801586650001701604650002401621650004401645651001401689651001001703651001001713651001301723651001101736651001001747651001201757651002101769700002001790700002001810700001601830700001801846700001901864700002401883700002901907773011901936856007602055852000902131655001202140IND60647987120221207115243.0190625e20171107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064798712DNAL7 a10.3390/foods61100962doi7 aPMC57041402pmcid7 a291121342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRongai, Domenico10a<sup>1</sup>H NMR and Multivariate Analysis for Geographic Characterization of Commercial Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A Possible Correlation with Climate Data  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis has been applied in order to investigate metabolomic profiles of more than 200 extravirgin olive oils (EVOOs) collected in a period of over four years (2009–2012) from different geographic areas. In particular, commercially blended EVOO samples originating from different Italian regions (Tuscany, Sicily and Apulia), as well as European (Spain and Portugal) and non-European (Tunisia, Turkey, Chile and Australia) countries. Multivariate statistical analysis (Principal Component Analisys (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA)) applied on the NMR data revealed the existence of marked differences between Italian (in particular from Tuscany, Sicily and Apulia regions) and foreign (in particular Tunisian) EVOO samples. A possible correlation with available climate data has been also investigated. These results aim to develop a powerful NMR-based tool able to protect Italian olive oil productions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiscriminant analysis 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aleast squares 3ametabolomics 3ameteorological data 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aAustralia 3aChile 3aItaly 3aPortugal 3aSicily 3aSpain 3aTunisia 3aTurkey (country)1 aSabatini, Nadia1 aDel Coco, Laura1 aPerri, Enzo1 aDel Re, Paolo1 aSimone, Nicola1 aMarchegiani, Donato1 aFanizzi, Francesco Paolo0 tFoods.g2017 Nov. 07, v. 6, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods61100963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245012300155300001800278500001500296520187700311592002802188650000902216650001002225650001402235650001002249650002302259650001002282650002002292650001102312650001302323650001402336650001002350650001502360650001002375650001602385650001302401650001202414650001402426650000902440650001102449650001202460650001202472650002502484651001402509653001602523653001602539653002502555700002102580700002102601700002502622700002502647700002002672773009802692856007102790852000902861655001202870IND60081735720221122101125.0141014s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008173572DNAL7 a10.1071/AN143252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlanuddin, 10aSurvey of Bali bull fattening practices in central Lombok, eastern Indonesia, based on feeding of Sesbania grandiflora  ap. 1273-1277.  a2019-12-06  aA longitudinal survey was conducted in 2013 to document the productivity of the Sesbania grandiflora feeding system for cattle fattening in central Lombok. Sesbania is integrated into the intensive rice-growing region by planting it along the rice bunds surrounding the rice fields. The hamlet of Nyerot in the subdistrict of Jonggat was chosen for the study as it had a long history of successful use of sesbania for fattening Bali bulls. Parameters measured included: area of rice paddy where sesbania could be planted; forage establishment, harvesting and feeding practices; cattle purchases and sales; and monthly liveweight gain. Farmers planted an average of 406 sesbania trees on bunds surrounding 0.6 ha of rice paddy. The median values for the main forages fed (dry matter offered) were harvested elephant grass (78% of diet), sesbania (12% of diet) and other feeds (mainly rice bran) (5% of diet). Sesbania was harvested by lopping the lower side branches of ~6 trees per bull per day and never completely defoliating single trees. The farmers fattened an average of 1.6 bulls at a time achieving a yearly mean liveweight gain of 0.41 kg/bull.day. New bulls were purchased with an average liveweight of 203 kg while the average sale weight was 260 kg. Purchase and sale prices were high at A$3.27 and A$3.29, respectively, while the average fattening period was 5 months. Bull liveweight gains were related to total amount of forage fed. No direct statistically significant link between liveweight gains and amount of sesbania fed was obtained due to the multiple factors that influenced forage and bull management. This survey has provided new insights into the practice of bull fattening in central Lombok. The survey has confirmed the high productivity of the feeding system and has highlighted the opportunity to scale out the use of system to other regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3afeeds 3arice bran 3atrees 3aCenchrus purpureus 3asales 3aliveweight gain 3aforage 3aplanting 3afinishing 3abunds 3aharvesting 3abulls 3abody weight 3abranches 3apaddies 3adelimbing 3adiet 3aprices 3afarmers 3asurveys 3aSesbania grandiflora 3aIndonesia 0aBali cattle 0agrowth rate 0aPennisetum purpureum1 aYuliana, Baiq T.1 aPanjaitan, Tanda1 aHalliday, Michael J.1 avan de Fliert, Elske1 aShelton, H.

This population shares similar morphological features with P. pseudocoffeae from Japan and also has the same D3 sequences as a population from Florida (no molecular data are available for the type Japanese population). The Iranian population of P. pseudocoffeae is characterised by a labial region with two (60%) or three annuli (40%), stylet ca 16 μm long, presence of males, vulva at 80% of body, oval spermatheca and subhemispherical tail with smooth terminus. Morphologically, P. pseudocoffeae from Iran resembles P. coffeae, from which it differs in a divided face vs smooth and flat in P. coffeae. However, the morphological and biological characters of P. pseudocoffeae are more closely related to those of P. gutierrezi and the related undescribed species K1 and K2 from coffee in Costa Rica and Guatemala, respectively, from which it differs by the shorter stylet and shape of tail tip. In contrast, the comparison of molecular characteristics, including ITS-RFLP patterns and sequences of the D3 region between P. pseudocoffeae from Iran and other related species, indicates a close relationship between P. pseudocoffeae and P. hexincisus and P. agilis, in spite of the fact that the latter two species are not amphimictic and lack males and functional spermatheca. In Iran, P. pseudocoffeae causes root lesions, distinct necrosis and large cavities within the cortical parenchyma, resulting in stunting of chrysanthemum stands. The detection of P. pseudocoffeae in Iran is a new country record and also represents the second detection of this species outside Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aJapan 3aface 3agreenhouses 3anecrosis 3anematology 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aspermatheca 3astylets 3atail 3avulva 3aCosta Rica 3aFlorida 3aGuatemala 3aIran 0aMORPHOLOGY 0aMORPHOMETRICS 0aHISTOPATHOLOGY 0aSEM 0aROOT-LESION NEMATODE 0aMOLECULAR 0aORNAMENTALS 0aCHRYSANTHEMUM X MORIFOLIUM1 aDe Luca, Francesca1 aVovlas, Nicola1 aTroccoli, Alberto0 tNematology.g, v. 11, no. 5 p.757-768dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854109X4105103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002300183245012800206300001600334506007600350520131600426592002801742506003701770650002501807650001701832650002601849650001601875650003001891650001101921650002101932650001801953650001601971700002101987700002602008773011602034856007602150852000902226655001202235IND60690052020221207113811.0200425e20070501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069005202DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.2.3.39732doi7 aPMC26340532pmcid7 a197046922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Mats X.10aMembrane Contact SitesbPhysical Attachment Between Chloroplasts and Endoplasmic Reticulum Revealed by Optical Manipulation  ap. 185-187.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChloroplasts and their surrounding cell are highly interdependent. One example is lipid metabolism, where the cell depends on its chloroplasts to provide fatty acids for lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in turn, chloroplasts rely on import of lipid precursors from the ER. Despite its fundamental importance, the route for lipid trafficking into and out of chloroplasts remains unknown. Biochemical studies of plant membrane lipid metabolism have suggested the possibility of lipid transport at membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and chloroplasts. With the aid of optical manipulation, we recently could present physical evidence for this association. Leaf protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the ER lumen were observed by confocal microscopy. A laser scalpel was used to rupture the protoplasts. ER fragments associated with the released chloroplasts could be stretched out by optical tweezers but remained attached to the chloroplast surface, even when a stretching force of 400 pN was applied. We thus provided the first physical evidence for MCSs between two membranes and we propose for the ER-chloroplast pair, that such tight associations are involved in bidirectional lipid trafficking between the two compartments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achloroplasts 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afatty acids 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aleaves 3alipid metabolism 3aoptical traps 3aprotoplasts1 aGoksör, Mattias1 aSandelius, Anna Stina0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2007 May 1, v. 2, no. 3 p.185-187dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.2.3.39733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04210naa a2201225 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245015200207300001600359520126300375592002801638650001801666650002901684650001301713650002001726650001701746650001601763650001601779650001501795650001001810650000901820650001801829650001501847650002801862650000901890650001401899650001801913650001901931650001401950650001601964653001401980653001401994653002002008653002302028653000802051653001602059653000802075653000802083653000902091653000902100653000902109653000802118653000802126653000802134653000702142653000802149653001302157653000902170653001002179653000902189653000902198653000902207653000802216653001002224653001002234653001102244653000802255653000902263653000802272653000802280653000702288653000902295653000802304653000702312653000802319653000802327653001002335653000802345653000802353653000702361653000802368653000802376653000702384653000802391653001102399653000702410653001402417653001302431653000802444653000702452653000802459653001102467653000702478653000902485653000902494653000702503653000702510653000802517653000902525700006102534700002902595700002402624700002202648700001802670700001702688700005802705773011402763856008602877852000902963655001202972IND60619592920221116142842.0181207e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061959292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenne, Naomi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3635-979810aAnionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) liposomes induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells and prevent atherosclerosis in mice  ap. 135-146.  aAtherosclerosis is the predominant underlying pathology of many types of cardiovascular disease and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is characterized by the retention of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in lipid-rich macrophages (foam cells) in the intima of arteries. Autoantigens derived from oxLDL can be used to vaccinate against atherosclerosis. However, a major challenge is the induction of antigen-specific Tregs in a safe and effective way. Here we report that liposomes containing the anionic phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) induce Tregs that are specific for the liposomes' cargo. Mechanistically, we show a crucial role for the protein corona that forms on the liposomes in the circulation, as uptake of DSPG-liposomes by antigen-presenting cells is mediated via complement component 1q (C1q) and scavenger receptors (SRs). Vaccination of atherosclerotic mice on a western-type diet with DSPG-liposomes encapsulating an LDL-derived peptide antigen significantly reduced plaque formation by 50% and stabilized the plaques, and reduced serum cholesterol concentrations. These results indicate that DSPG-liposomes have potential as a delivery system in vaccination against atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aarteries 3aatherosclerosis 3aautoantigens 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acomplement 3adeath 3adiet 3aencapsulation 3afoam cells 3alow density lipoprotein 3amice 3aoxidation 3aphospholipids 3aprotein corona 3areceptors 3avaccination 0aLiposomes 0aTolerance 0aAtherosclerosis 0aRegulatory T cells 0aC1q 0aVaccination 0aACK 0aAEC 0aBCIP 0aBMDC 0aBreg 0aBSA 0aC1q 0aCFA 0aDC 0aDLS 0aDPPE-Rho 0aDPPS 0aDPTAP 0aDSPC 0aDSPG 0aEDTA 0aFCS 0aFOXP3 0aFVIII 0aGM-CSF 0aHRP 0ai.v. 0aIFA 0aIFN 0aIL 0aIMDM 0aLDL 0aLE 0aLPS 0aMHC 0aMOMA2 0aNBT 0aOCT 0aPB 0aPBS 0aPDI 0aPG 0aPMA 0apoly I 0aPS 0aRPMI 1640 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSLE 0aSR 0aTFA 0aTGF-β 0aTh 0aTIM4 0aTreg 0aWB 0aWT 0aWTD 0aZave1 avan Duijn, Janine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5097-07131 aLozano Vigario, Fernando1 aLeboux, Romain J.T.1 avan Veelen, Peter1 aKuiper, Johan1 aJiskoot, Wim1 aSlütter, Bram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3996-05030 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 291 p.135-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002100185245005300206300001200259506007600271520041600347592002800763506003700791650001600828650000800844650001500852650001600867650001100883650002700894650002500921700002200946773010200968856007901070852000901149655001201158IND60119487820221207115802.0141214e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948782DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-2142doi7 aPMC1565792pmcid7 a127340022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, Jonathan C14aThe role of DNA sequence in centromere formation  ap. 628.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCentromeres are key to the correct segregation and inheritance of genetic information.

Here, we have investigated the occurrence, distribution and function of ER bodies in root cells of Raphanus sativus using a combination of microscopic and biochemical methods. We have also assessed the response of ER bodies to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a phytohormone that mediates plant defense against wounding and pathogens. Our results show that (i) ER bodies do occur in different root cell types from the root cap region to the differentiation zone; (ii) they do accumulate a PYK10-like protein similar to the major marker protein of ER bodies that is involved in defense in Arabidopsis thaliana ; and (iii) treatment of root cells with MeJA causes a significant increase in the number of ER bodies and the activity of β-glucosidases. More importantly, MeJA was found to induce the formation of very long ER bodies that results from the fusion of small ones, a phenomenon that has not been reported in any other study so far. These findings demonstrate that MeJA impacts the number and morphology of functional ER bodies and stimulates ER body enzyme activities, probably to participate in defense responses of radish root. They also suggest that these structures may provide a defensive system specific to root cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRaphanus sativus 3abeta-glucosidase 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3amethyl jasmonate 3apathogens 3aplant hormones 3aradishes 3aroot cap 0aER bodies 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aMicroscopy 0aPYK10 0aRaphanus sativus 0aRoot1 aGhosh, Rajgourab1 aBernard, Sophie1 aNguema-Ona, Eric1 aVicré-Gibouin, Maïté1 aHara-Nishimura, Ikuko1 aDriouich, Azeddine0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.61-72dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245015400163300001600317520091400333592002801247650001601275650001501291650001501306650001901321650001501340650001301355650001101368650002601379650002201405650001601427650001101443650001401454650000901468653001501477653003901492653001901531653001501550653001401565653002801579653004601607653001401653700002701667700002401694700003401718700002801752773008601780856007601866852000901942655001201951IND60563020220221120054044.0170209e20161116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056302022DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2016-00972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimón, Cristina10aSorption/desorption hysteresis revisited.

The sorption kinetic behaviour was studied through the parallel exponential kinetics (PEK) model, which is subdivided into a fast and a slow process. The parameters obtained by PEK were interpreted based on the Kelvin-Voigt (KV) model to determine elasticity and viscosity values of the wood cell wall. The PEK data perfectly fit the experimental data. The temperature-dependent transition between the fast and slow processes is fluent. The slow process contributes more to the total hysteresis of sorption. The kinetic properties varied in relation to the type of cycle and the temperature. The moduli of elasticity and viscosity were higher in the slow process than in the fast one. In both processes, the moduli showed a decreasing tendency in relation to relative humidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinea 3acell walls 3adesorption 3ahygroscopicity 3ahysteresis 3akinetics 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3avapors 3aviscosity 3awood 0aelasticity 0aequilibrium moisture content (EMC) 0ahygroscopicity 0ahysteresis 0aisotherms 0aKelvin-Voigt (KV) model 0aparallel exponential kinetics (PEK) model 0aviscosity1 aGarcía Esteban, Luis,1 aPalacios, Paloma de1 aGarcía Fernandez, Francisco,1 aGarcía-Iruela, Alberto0 tHolzforschung.g2016 Nov. 16, v. 71, no. 2 p.171-177dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2016-00973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100001900185245008300204300001200287506007600299520058200375592002800957506003700985650002501022650002001047650001001067650001601077650000901093650001501102700002101117700001501138700001701153700002101170700001901191700002301210700002201233700002201255773010201277856007901379852000901458655001201467IND60119488420221207103016.0141214e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948842DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-r322doi7 aPMC1565882pmcid7 a127340122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKriete, Andres10aCombined histomorphometric and gene-expression profiling applied to toxicology  ap. 542.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have developed a unique methodology for the combined analysis of histomorphometric and gene-expression profiles amenable to intensive data mining and multisample comparison for a comprehensive approach to toxicology.

Results further indicated a concentration of 0.91%-1.70% omega-3 fatty acids; 15.87%-22.13% omega-6 fatty acids and 15.66%-24.17% essential fatty acids in the muscle tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aanimal research 3acarcass composition 3acolor 3acopper 3alongissimus muscle 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ameat quality 3apotassium 3azinc 0aAmino acid profile 0aFatty acid profile 0aIndigenous pig 0aMineral contents1 aBanik, S.1 aBarman, K.1 aMohan, N.H.1 aSarma, D.K.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2019 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.435-440dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-35273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100003800165245007600203300001600279500001500295520133300310592002801643650001601671650001901687650001001706650001301716650002501729650001401754650002101768650001001789650002301799650002801822650000901850650001301859650001301872650001701885650001201902650002401914650005601938650001001994650005102004650001102055650002302066650003302089650001102122650006102133650008102194650001402275650003802289650006102327650002002388650002502408653002702433653002102460653001202481653001302493653001302506653002702519700002702546773010602573852000902679856008302688655001202771IND4418839120221122180738.0181130e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441883912DNAL7 a193267352pmid7 a10.1177/0260106008019004042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ardhi, Fatma Mohammed Mahfoodh10aMaternal Fish Consumption and Prenatal Methylmercury Exposure: A Review  ap. 289-297.  a2019-12-04  aThe benefits of fish consumption have been known to be the prevention of certain heart disease, neurological disorders and a very important role in fetal brain development. However there has been, in the past, certain doubts on whether fish should be classified as a beneficial meat source as part of a pregnant woman's diet as it has been documented that fish contains harmful substances that could effect a child's cognitive and neuro development. Methylmercury (MeHg), in particular, has been singled out. As it turned-out, with the use of numerous literature reviews, MeHg is not as dangerous as we have been led to believe. It has been suggested that even during neonatal exposure to MeHg as a result of maternal fish consumption one can reverse the harmful effects of MeHg if, after birth, the child is exposed to a favorable environment and a nutritious diet. The role of antioxidants is also important as they can help in reducing the harmful effects of MeHg if administered in sufficient amounts during pregnancy. There are also many fish types that should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly predatory and dark-meat fish as they are associated with high amounts of MeHg. This review shows that the benefits of maternal fish consumption during pregnancy can outweigh the harmful effects of neonatal MeHg exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood intake 3apregnant women 3abrain 3aseafoods 3aprenatal development 3apregnancy 3adietary exposure 3afetus 3amaternal nutrition 3amethylmercury compounds 3afish 3achildren 3aneonates 3aantioxidants 2aAnimals 2aBrainxdrug effects 2aCentral Nervous System Diseasesxchemically induced 2aChild 2aDevelopmental Disabilitiesxchemically induced 2aFemale 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aPrenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aRisk Assessment 2aTeratogensxtoxicity 0agood outweighs the bad 0afish consumption 0ainfants 0amaternal 0aprenatal 0amethylmercury exposure1 aAl-Ani, Majeed Rasheed0 tNutrition and health.g, v. 19, no. 4 p.289-297dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x0260-10607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0260106008019004043Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02788naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300001400281520139000295592002801685650001601713650001801729650002401747650005101771650001201822650001401834650001301848650002001861650001801881650002101899650002201920650001701942653002401959653002501983653001502008653001002023653001002033653001802043700001602061700001802077700001902095773012102114856007402235852000902309655001202318IND60152149020221120103001.0150529e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015214902DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcu1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sun-ji10aArabidopsis Putative MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases Raf10 and Raf11 are Positive Regulators of Seed Dormancy and ABA Response  ap. 84-97.  aWe isolated an Arabidopsis ABA-insensitive mutant, ais143 , by activation tagging screen. T-DNA was found to be located in the coding region of a putative mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) gene, Raf10 , thereby abolishing its expression in the mutant. ais143 exhibited reduced seed dormancy as well as reduced ABA sensitivity. The phenotypes were complemented by the wild-type Raf10 gene, and the overexpression (OX) of Raf10 resulted in delayed seed germination and enhanced ABA sensitivity. Raf10 has high sequence identity to another MAP3K, Raf11. Parallel analysis of Raf11 knockout (KO) and OX lines showed that their phenotypes were similar to those of Raf10 KO and OX lines. An ais143 raf11 double mutant exhibited stronger phenotypes than single mutants, indicating the functional redundancy between Raf10 and Raf11. Transcript analysis revealed that the expression of many ABA-associated genes, including the key regulatory genes ABI3 and ABI5 , was altered in the Raf10 and Raf11 OX lines. Recombinant Raf10 and Raf11 proteins exhibited kinase activity, which was inhibited by the MAP3K inhibitor BAY 43-9006 but not by the MAP2K inhibitor U0126. Collectively, our data indicate that Raf10 and Raf11 kinases are important regulators of seed dormancy and ABA response and that they affect the expression of ABI3 , ABI5 and other ABA-regulated genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3agene overexpression 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aregulator genes 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3asequence analysis 3atransfer DNA 0aAbscisic acid (ABA) 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aMAP kinase 0aRaf10 0aRaf11 0aSeed dormancy1 aLee, Mi Hun1 aKim, Jeong-Il1 aKim, Soo Young0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.84-97dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu1483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245011100181300001800292520199900310592002802309650002102337650001102358650002102369650000902390650001402399650001102413650001402424650001302438650001402451650001102465650001202476650001302488650001602501651001302517700002202530700002302552700002202575773012602597856008402723852000902807655001202816IND60123438920221119080708.0150325e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343892DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9637492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurshin, Christopher W. D.10aImportance of Ultrasonic Field Direction for Guiding Juvenile Blueback Herring Past Hydroelectric Turbines  ap. 1242-1258.  aPopulations of Blueback Herring Alosa aestivalis , an important anadromous forage fish in the northeastern USA, have declined from historic levels. Measures to reduce mortality from many sources, including entrainment by hydroelectric turbines, are cited by fishery managers to be important to restoring populations. At the Crescent Hydroelectric Project (Crescent) on the Mohawk River, New York, pulsed ultrasound (122–128 kHz) was used to deter adult and juvenile Blueback Herring migrating out to sea from entering the intake channel to the headrace and turbines, where mortality may occur. To increase the deterrence rate, the sound field was extended further upriver to expose juvenile Blueback Herring to an increasing sound gradient as they migrate downriver and allow them more time to avoid the intake channel. When juvenile Blueback Herring were present upstream of Crescent and exposed to an ultrasound field, mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) by pelagic trawling in the main channel downriver of the ultrasound was 94% of the mean CPUE in the upriver trawl region and 250% of the mean CPUE in the intake channel. Repeated mobile echo sounder surveys revealed that the abundance of juvenile Blueback Herring averaged 35 times higher in the downriver main channel region than in the intake channel region. During the peak migration period of September 20 through October 14, 2012, continuous fixed-location horizontal echo sounding showed the percentage of net downstream passage of juvenile Blueback Herring that bypassed the intake channel significantly increased from 31.1% to 76.5% after redirecting the ultrasonic field upriver. These results demonstrate that pulsed ultrasound, when properly directed, can be used effectively as a fish deterrent system to provide safe downstream passage of juvenile Blueback Herring at hydropower dams. At Crescent, this could increase annual survival by tens of thousands of fish or more.

Because of concerns that the effluent would serve as a nutrient source for blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, a field monitoring program was established and laboratory bioassays were conducted. Several harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, including Prorocentrum minimum and Heterosigma akashiwo, were observed in bloom concentrations adjacent to the effluent discharge site. Blooms of diatoms were widespread throughout Bishop Harbor. K. brevis was observed with cell concentrations decreasing with increasing proximity to the effluent discharge site. Bioassays using effluent as a nutrient source for K. brevis resulted in decreased cell yields, increased growth rates, and increased time to log-phase growth. The responses of HAB species within Bishop Harbor and of K. brevis to effluent in bioassays suggested that HAB species differ in their response to phosphate-processing effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aKarenia brevis 3aProrocentrum 3aalgal blooms 3abioassays 3aenvironmental protection 3aestuaries 3amonitoring 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3aFlorida1 aWolny, Jennifer1 aTruby, Earnest1 aHeil, Cynthia1 aKovach, Charles0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.596-601dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006700161300001600228520052100244592002800765650001500793650001400808650001500822650000900837650001500846650001100861650001700872700002300889773009000912856007401002852000901076655001201085IND60439031520221119165046.0151024e199709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043903152DNAL7 a10.1007/BF012875612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodchild, D.

Our previous study indicated that LEC genes were involved in SE in citrus, but their regulatory roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we cloned one of the LEC genes, CsFUS3, and show that it is preferentially expressed during SE and in the embryogenic callus (EC) derived from citrus varieties with strong embryogenic competence. The overexpression of CsFUS3 in recalcitrant citrus callus restored embryogenic competence. Complementation of the loss-of-function Arabidopsis fus3 mutant with the CsFUS3 gene restored normal late embryogenesis, which is consistent with the CsFUS3 and AtFUS3 proteins contributing to the same regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Transcriptome profiling revealed that the expression of particular TFs that promote SE was up-regulated in the citrus overexpression (OE) line. The 104 differentially expressed genes associated with hormone biosynthesis, catabolism, and signaling are particularly noteworthy. The dynamic change in the ratio of ABA to GA during SE in wild-type callus mirrored the expression pattern of CsFUS3. In contrast, in the OE line, the ratio of ABA to GA was higher and the capacity for SE was greater when the OE line was separately treated with ABA and GA biosynthesis inhibitors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overexpression of CsFUS3 appears to establish a cellular environment favorable to SE, at least in part by promoting a high ABA to GA ratio and by regulating the expression of TFs that promote SE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCitrus 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acallus 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agibberellic acid 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3asomatic embryogenesis 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 0aSE 0aZE 0aCTD 0aTF 0aNEC 0aEC 0aEV 0aOE 0aDEGs 0aCitrus 0aCsFUS3 0aSomatic embryogenesis 0aOverexpression 0aRNA-seq 0aHormone1 aGe, Xiao-Xia1 aQiu, Wen-Ming1 aLong, Jian-Mei1 aJia, Hui-Hui1 aYang, Wei1 aDutt, Manjul1 aWu, Xiao-Meng1 aGuo, Wen-Wu0 tPlant science.g2018 Dec., v. 277 p.121-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245007200189300001800261520114700279592002801426650002501454650001701479650001701496650001701513650001901530650001801549650002801567650002301595650002201618650001501640650001101655650002001666650001101686650001801697650001701715650001501732650002701747650004101774650003101815650002001846650002201866650002601888700002001914700001701934700001901951700002201970700001801992773009202010856008602102852000902188655001202197IND4465334420221117173345.0141111e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446533442DNAL7 a234426782pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzaizeh, Hassan10aAntioxidant activity of phenolic fractions in olive mill wastewater  ap. 2226-2234.  aOlive mill wastewater (OMW) contains a substantial amount of valuable antioxidant phenols that can be recovered for industrial application as food additives and pharmaceuticals. The present study was aimed at extracting different phenolic OMW fractions, and determining their antioxidant potential. Five different OMW fractions were obtained using fractionation techniques, their antioxidant potential determined by DPPH, ORAC and a β-carotene bleaching test. The total phenol level ranged between 115 and 170mg/l. The phenolic compounds present in individual fractions were identified using the HPLC–PAD method, where the main compounds were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The five OMW fractions showed different antioxidant levels depending on the test used. DPPH test showed that the fraction of alkyl aromatic alcohols (AAAs) was the best with EC₅₀ of 20mg/l and the pure hydroxytyrosol with 2mg/l. ORAC test showed that AAA and semi hydrolysed total phenol (s-TP) fractions were significantly better than Trolox when compared to 20mg/l of Trolox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3aferulic acid 3afood additives 3afractionation 3aindustrial applications 3amilling byproducts 3amilling fractions 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphenol 3avanillic acid 3averbascoside 3awastewater 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aOleaxchemistry 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aWastewaterxanalysis.1 aHalahlih, Fares1 aNajami, Naim1 aBrunner, Doris1 aFaulstich, Martin1 aTafesh, Ahmed0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 134, no. 4 p.2226-2234dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100006700157245012300224300001400347520126800361592002801629650001201657650001801669650001701687650001401704650002101718650001601739650002201755653002201777653002101799653001801820653001101838653001101849653001301860700002701873700002201900700006901922773011101991856009202102852000902194655001202203IND60536701020221119014353.0190412e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053670102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagenkamp-Korth, Frauke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0035-932310aReduction of ammonia emissions from dairy manure using novel urease inhibitor formulations under laboratory conditions  ap. 43-51.  aAmmonia emissions from livestock manure can have detrimental effects on environment, health and reduce the value of the manure as fertiliser. A promising approach for reducing ammonia emissions from dairy farming is the use of urease inhibitors. They were tested in this study under standardised conditions in a laboratory set-up. Four selected inhibitors (designated D, L, K and E) were tested in concentrations of 0.01% and 0.1% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and at manure temperatures of 18 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C. At 0.1% [TKN] all inhibitors showed a reduction in ammonia emissions at all temperatures settings (22 %–70 %). The reference inhibitor (D) and the modified inhibitor (L) had reduction potentials of 48% and 27%. At 20 °C inhibitor E showed no improvement in the reduction potential compared to the other inhibitors used, and was therefore not tested further. At all temperature settings, inhibitor K at concentrations of 0.1% [TKN] showed the highest reduction at 64%. Mixtures of two different inhibitors (0.1% [TKN], 20 °C) did not improve the reduction effect compared to the pure inhibitors. These ammonia reduction results showed that inhibitor K was the most promising with the potential to be used in further practical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3adairy farming 3adairy manure 3aemissions 3anitrogen content 3atemperature 3aurease inhibitors 0aAmmonia reduction 0aUrease inhibitor 0aDairy farming 0aCattle 0aManure 0aEmission1 aHaeussermann, Angelika1 aHartung, Eberhard1 aReinhardt-Hanisch, Annett1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0384-87660 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 130 p.43-51dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300001600276500001900292520138800311592002801699650002801727650002101755650001701776650001001793650001601803650001901819650001401838650001301852650002801865650001901893700001801912700001201930700001301942700001701955700002001972773013801992856007402130852000902204655001202213IND60722649920221120164054.0210107e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264992DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb02097d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu12aA PEGylated alternating copolymeric prodrug of sulfur dioxide with glutathione responsiveness for Irinotecan delivery  ap. 187-194.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, an enhanced anticancer strategy combining the chemotherapy from antineoplastics with the oxidative damage from a sulfur dioxide (SO₂) prodrug is presented. Based on the characteristics of a high glutathione (GSH) level in the tumor microenvironment, a novel GSH-responsive SO₂ polymeric prodrug mPEG-b-P(PA-alt-GDNs) was designed and synthesized via a ring-opening alternating copolymerization and “click” reaction. The GSH-sensitive mechanism of the polymer was investigated in detail. Furthermore, Irinotecan was loaded into the polymeric prodrug nanoparticles by a self-assembly method with a drug loading content of 12.3 wt% and a loading efficiency of 42.2%. The drug-loaded nanoparticles showed a sensitive response to high concentrations of GSH in the tumor cells and rapidly released both Irinotecan and SO₂. The depletion of GSH and the release of SO₂ were supposed to increase the level of reactive oxygen species in the tumor cell, which, in combination with the released Irinotecan, exerted an enhanced anti-proliferative effect against HepG2 cells. Finally, Irinotecan-loaded nanoparticles exhibited a stronger antitumor effect than free antineoplastics in HepG2 cells. Thus, these results indicated that our polymeric prodrug SO₂ is a promising candidate for chemotherapeutic drug delivery and would be a new weapon in anticancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3acopolymerization 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aglutathione 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 3asulfur dioxide1 aZhang, Hongyu1 aHe, Pan1 aYi, Xuan1 aLiu, Xinming1 aXiao, Chunsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Jan. 6, v. 9, no. 1 p.187-194dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb02097d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245015000176300001400326520125600340592002801596650002001624650002201644650001101666650000901677650001801686650001101704650003101715650000901746650001501755650001001770650002201780650001801802650001401820650001801834653002301852653003101875653002101906653001801927700002601945773011101971856009202082852000902174655001202183IND60536701120221119014056.0190412e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053670112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPosom, Jetsada10aEvaluation of the moisture content of Jatropha curcas kernels and the heating value of the oil-extracted residue using near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 52-59.  aThe use of near-infrared spectroscopy for evaluation of moisture content of Jatropha curcas kernels and heating value of its residue after oil extraction were studied. In total, 100 samples of whole kernels from green, yellow and black fruits and oven-dried kernels scanned in diffuse reflection mode using a Fourier transform NIR spectrometer at wave numbers of 1,250,000–400,000 m−1 were used to develop moisture-predicting models. The corresponding residues after the oil extraction of the samples scanned in transflection mode using the same spectrometer and wave number range were used to develop the heating-value-predicting models. The models correlating the spectral data and the corresponding values measured using the reference method were developed by partial least squares regression and were validated using a test set. For the moisture content and heating value, coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.969 and 0.860, root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) were 4.0% wb and 360 J g−1, biases were −0.7% wb and −17 J g−1 and ratios of prediction to deviation (RPD) were 5.7 and 2.6, respectively. In addition, vibration bands of fibre and cellulose had important effects on the prediction of the heating value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3acellulosic fibers 3afruits 3aheat 3aleast squares 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aoils 3aprediction 3aseeds 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3avibration 3awater content 0aJatropha curcas L. 0aNear-infrared spectroscopy 0aMoisture content 0aHeating value1 aSirisomboon, Panmanas0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 130 p.52-59dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012000174300001600294520065800310592002800968650001900996650001001015650001901025650001801044650000901062650001601071650002301087650000701110650002301117650001101140650001201151650004401163650001901207653001101226653002201237653002201259653002001281700002301301700002501324700002201349700002201371773012101393856008501514852000901599655001201608IND60573724920221116164358.0170724e20170421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372492DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2016.12097982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnyanwu, Ugochukwu10aEffect of Bay (Laurus nobilis L.)

Addition of ω-3 rich oil or BEO improved the texture. Color values of the surimi seafood were improved particularly when BEO was added.

The main geochemical parameters responsible for As mobility are organic matter and oxide-forming metals such as Fe. The As distribution and its concentration were evaluated in the dissolved fraction, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment of the lower Paraíba do Sul River (PSR), its main tributaries (Muriaé, Pomba, and Dois Rios rivers), and flooded and estuarine areas. As was not detected in the dissolved fraction. The river flow influenced the As concentration in the SPM, which was higher in the dry season than in the rainy season (2.6 ± 0.69 and 1.98 ± 0.29 mg kg⁻¹, respectively). The Fe oxyhydroxides, organic carbon, and surface area measured in the sediment were positively related with As concentration (R² = 0.11, 0.34, and 0.30; p < 0.05). The highest As concentrations in the sediment occurred in the secondary estuary and flooded areas (5.16 ± 4.78 and 1.23 ± 0.44 mg kg⁻¹, respectively), in which finer granulometric fractions (silt and clay) predominated (64% and 71%, respectively), in addition to greater surface area. The measurement of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) and atomic ratio (C:N)a indicated the existence of a combination of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter composing the SPM. In general, the As concentrations in the sediment and SPM were low, with values below that permitted by Brazilian regulations (5.9 mg kg⁻¹), which suggests that the As sources in the lower basin of the PSR are diffuse and natural.  aPublisher supplied data  aE-26/010.001984/2014cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aarsenic 3abasins 3abioavailability 3aclay 3adry season 3aestuaries 3airon oxyhydroxides 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asilt 3asurface area 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aPestana, Inácio Abreu1 aAzevedo, Lucas Silva1 ade Almeida, Marcelo Gomes1 ade Souza, Cristina Maria Magalhães0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.57-57dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08830-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007700166300001600243520125900259592002801518650002801546650001201574650002001586650002201606650001101628650001401639650002101653650001301674650001001687650001001697650001301707653000701720653003101727653002201758700001701780700001801797700001901815700001801834700001801852700001401870773011901884856008502003852000902088655001202097IND60480610720221120141833.0160429e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048061072DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2015.11095892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kehui12aA newly found manganese hyperaccumulator—Polygonum lapathifolium Linn.  ap. 348-353.  aIn the present work, both field investigation and laboratory experiment were carried out to testify whether Polygonum lapathifolium L. is a potential manganese (Mn) hyperaccumulator. Results from field investigation showed that P. lapathifolium had great tolerance and accumulation to Mn. Mn concentrations in leaves were the highest, varied from 6889.2 mg kg-1 dry weight (DW) to18841.7 mg kg ⁻¹ DW with the average of 12180.6 mg kg ⁻¹. The values of translocation factor (the concentrations of Mn in leaf to that in root) ranged from 5.72 to 9.53. Results from laboratory experiment illuminated that P. lapathifolium could grow well and show no toxic symptoms even under high Mn stress (16 mmol L ⁻¹). Although the changes of antioxidant enzymes activities were triggered under Mn stress, the alterations of pigments were not significant (P > 0.05) as compared with control. Total plant biomass and plant height increased with increasing Mn supply. Mn concentrations in leaves and stems were constantly greater than those in roots, the ratio of concentrations in leaves to that in roots were 2.58–6.72 and the corresponding values in stems to that in roots were 1.45–3.18. The results showed that P. lapathifolium is a Mn-hyperaccumulator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPersicaria lapathifolia 3abiomass 3aenzyme activity 3ahyperaccumulators 3aleaves 3amanganese 3aphytoremediation 3apigments 3aroots 3astems 3atoxicity 0aMn 0aPolygonum lapathifolium L. 0ahyperaccumulation1 aYu, Fangming1 aChen, Menglin1 aZhou, Zhenming1 aChen, Chaoshu1 aLi, Mingshun,1 aZhu, Jing0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 18, no. 4 p.348-353dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.11095893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245013500159300002000294520143100314592002801745650001801773650001901791650001901810650002001829650001601849650002401865650002201889650002701911650002801938650000901966650002401975650001101999650001202010650002902022650002002051700002702071700002402098700001202122700001802134700002002152700001902172700002502191773012702216856008102343852000902424655001202433IND60556287520170606000000.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b034562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, You10aWhole-Organism Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Mechanistic Insight into the Acute Toxicity of Emamectin Benzoate in Daphnia magna  ap. 11994-12003.  aEmamectin benzoate (EMB) is an antisea lice chemical widely used in the aquaculture that may also unintentionally affect nontarget crustaceans in the environment. Although the adverse effects of this compound are well documented in various species, the full modes of action (MoAs) are still not well characterized. The current study was therefore conducted to characterize the MoAs of EMB and link perturbations of key toxicological pathways to adverse effects in the model freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. Effects on molting and survival were determined after 48 h exposure to EMB, whereas global transcriptional changes and the ecdysone receptor (EcR) binding potency was determined to characterize the MoA. The results showed that the molting frequency and survival of D. magna decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and the observed changes could not be attributed to direct interactions with the EcR. Major MoAs such as activation of glutamate-gated chloride channels and gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling, disruption of neuroendocrine regulation of molting, perturbation of energy homeostasis, suppression of DNA repair and induction of programmed cell death were observed by transcriptional analysis and successfully linked to the adverse effects. This study has demonstrated that acute exposure to intermediate and high pM levels of EMB may pose hazards to nontarget crustaceans in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute exposure 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic environment 3aecdysone receptor 3afreshwater crustaceans 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3alice 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3amolting 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aRundberget, Jan Thomas1 aEvenseth, Linn Mari1 aXie, Li1 aGomes, Tania,1 aHøgåsen, Tore1 aIguchi, Taisen1 aTollefsen, Knut Erik0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 50, no. 21 p.11994-12003dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b034563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008500166300001600251520117800267592002801445650002501473650002701498650001801525650001601543650001101559650002201570650001201592650001201604650002101616650001001637650001001647650001301657653002501670653001701695653001201712653002101724653001201745700001701757700001501774700001901789700001501808700002001823700002001843700001501863700001901878773011901897856008502016852000902101655001202110IND60480610820221120141615.0160429e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048061082DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2015.11095902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBibi, Asma10aPhytoextraction of HG by parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and its growth responses  ap. 354-357.  aThe effect of mercury (Hg) on the growth and survival of parsley (Petroselinum crispum) was explored at various treatments. The plants were grown in pots having Hoagland's solution to which various Hg treatments were applied and placed under greenhouse conditions. The treatments were: no metal applied (control) and six doses of Hg as mercuric chloride for 15 days. Linear trend of Hg accumulation was noted in roots, stems, and leaves with increasing Hg treatments. The maximum Hg concentration in root, stem and leaf was 8.92, 8.27, and 7.88 at Hg treatments of 25 mg l –¹, respectively. On the whole, Hg accumulation in different plant parts was in the following order: leaves > stem > roots. Linear trend was also observed for Bioaccumulation Factor (BF) and Translocation Factor (TF) with increasing Hg concentrations in the growth medium. The highest respective BF Hg and TF Hg values were 9.32 and 2.02 for the Hg treatments of 25 and 50 mg l –¹. In spite of the reduced growth in the presence of Hg, the plant has phytoremediation potential. It is recommended that parsley should not be cultivated in Hg contaminated sites in order to avoid dietary toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetroselinum crispum 3abioaccumulation factor 3aculture media 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3aparsley 3aphytoremediation 3aroots 3astems 3atoxicity 0aPetroselinum crispum 0aheavy metals 0amercury 0aphytoremediation 0aparsley1 aFarooq, Umar1 aNaz, Sadia1 aKhān, Āfsar,1 aKhan, Sara1 aSarwar, Rizwana1 aMahmood, Qaisar1 aAlam, Arif1 aMirza, Nosheen0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 18, no. 4 p.354-357dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.11095903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160300001300271500001900284520156600303592002801869650001501897650001501912650002101927650002201948650002001970650001401990650001302004650001902017650001702036700002402053700002002077700001902097773013502116856007402251852000902325655001202334IND60722650120221122034726.0210107e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072265012DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb02165b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGessner, Isabel10aMagnetic nanoparticle-based amplification of microRNA detection in body fluids for early disease diagnosis  ap. 9-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCirculating biomarkers such as microRNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNA strands, represent prognostic and diagnostic indicators for a variety of physiological disorders making their detection and quantification an attractive approach for minimally invasive early disease diagnosis. However, highly sensitive and selective detection methods are required given the generally low abundance of miRNAs in body fluids together with the presence of large amounts of other potentially interfering biomolecules. Although a variety of miRNA isolation and detection methods have been established in clinics, they usually require trained personnel and often constitute labor-, time- and cost-intensive approaches. During the last years, nanoparticle-based biosensors have received increasing attention due to their superior detection efficiency even in very low concentration regimes. This is based on their unique physicochemical properties in combination with their high surface area that allows for the immobilization of multiple recognition sites resulting in fast and effective recognition of analytes. Among various materials, magnetic nanoparticles have been identified as useful tools for the separation, concentration, and detection of miRNAs. Here, we review state-of-the-art technology with regard to magnetic particle-based miRNA detection from body fluids, critically discussing challenges and future perspective of such biosensors while comparing their handling, sensitivity as well as selectivity against the established miRNA isolation and detection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3adisease diagnosis 3ahuman resources 3amagnetism 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3asurface area1 aFries, Jochen W.

In this study, a comprehensive salinity dataset was compiled which covered the entire basin and included data from 1990 through 2015. The data were aggregated into daily mean salinity timeseries across Barataria Basin at a variety of spatial scales and used to analyze historic patterns. Simulations were conducted with two hydrodynamic models, the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM) and Delft3D. The Delft3D model output was overlaid with observed geo-tagged locations of bottlenose dolphins that were sampled from the southwest quadrant of the basin. The ICM simulations were used to assess the impact of existing freshwater and proposed sediment diversion projects which reintroduce riverine water into the estuary. The salinity in the uppermost portions of the basin is sensitive primarily to the existing freshwater diversion, whereas additional flows from a proposed sediment diversion result in additional freshening. The lowermost region of the basin is most sensitive to the proposed sediment diversion; however, the magnitude varies by diverted flow volumes and assumed sea levels in the Gulf of Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops truncatus 3abasins 3adata collection 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahydrologic models 3amarine mammals 3asalinity 3asediments 3atime series analysis 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi River1 aMessina, Francesca1 aMoss, Leland1 aMeselhe, Ehab0 tWater.g2018 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006300155300001600218500002000234520043900254592002800693650002100721650001000742650001900752650002200771650001000793650002500803650001400828650001000842651001000852700001700862700001400879700001600893700001500909700002200924700001400946700001200960700001400972700001400986773013501000856007401135852000901209655001201218IND60588290120221118233419.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058829012DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.125602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, E.

In this study, blue-black TiO₂ nanotube array (BNTA) electrodes are prepared by electrochemical self-doping. The 1-D structure, donor state density, and Fermi energy level position are critical for maintaining the semimetallic functionality of the BNTA. The structural strength of the BNTA is enhanced by surface crack minimization, reinforcement of the BNTA-Ti metal interface, and stabilized by a protective overcoating with nanoparticulate TiO₂ (Ti/EBNTA). Ti/EBNTA electrodes are employed as both anodes and cathodes with polarity switching at a set frequency. Oxidants are generated at the anode, while the doping levels are regenerated along with byproduct reduction at the cathode. The estimated maximum electrode lifetime is 16 895 h. Ti/EBNTA has comparable hydroxyl radical production activity (6.6 × 10–¹⁴ M) with boron-doped diamond (BDD, 7.4 × 10–¹⁴ M) electrodes. The chlorine production rate follows a trend with respective to electrode type of Ti/EBNTA > BDD > IrO₂. Ti/EBNTA electrodes operated in a bipolar mode have a minimum energy consumption of 62 kWh/kg COD, reduced foam formation due to less gas bubble production, minimum scale formation, and lower chlorate production levels (6 mM vs 18 mM for BDD) during electrolytic wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abyproducts 3acathodes 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorine 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afoams 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ananotubes 3aoxidants 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment1 aHoffmann, Michael R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 50, no. 21 p.11888-11894dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b035403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04313naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245013500177300001600312500001500328520177700343592002802120650001702148650001402165650001602179650001902195650001802214650002102232650003802253650003802291650000902329650001402338650002302352650002802375650003002403650001702433650001102450650001202461650002302473650003002496650001202526650005102538650006402589650003702653650005102690650003302741650003502774650004902809650003202858650003002890650005702920650000902977650000902986650002302995650002703018650002903045650003203074650004903106650005503155650003103210653001703241700001203258700001803270700001503288700001703303700002003320773011303340856008103453852000903534655001203543IND4479522220221118025330.0141111e20120928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447952222DNAL7 a228676342pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Pei10aAntitumor activity and immunomodulatory effects of the intraperitoneal administration of Kanglaite in vivo in Lewis lung carcinoma  ap. 680-685.  a2019-12-06  aAIMS OF THE STUDY: Kanglaite (KLT) is a useful antitumor drug with proven effects when combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery. We hypothesize that KLT has antitumor activity and immunomodulatory effects in Lewis lung carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice with Lewis lung carcinoma were divided into four groups: the control group (C), cisplatin group (1mg/kg, DDP), low KLT group (6.25ml/kg body weight [L]), and high KLT group (12.5ml/kg body weight [H]). T cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), inhibitor kappa B alpha (IκBα), IκB kinase (IKK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels were measured by western blotting. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2). RESULTS: Intraperitoneal KLT significantly inhibited the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma, and the spleen index was significantly higher in the L and H groups than in the C group. KLT stimulated T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with KLT at either 6.25 or 12.5ml/kg decreased the level of NF-κB in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner, and KLT markedly decreased the expression of IκBα, IKK and EGFR in the cytoplasm of tumor cells and overall. IL-2 was significantly increased in the supernatant of splenocytes in the H group. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that KLT has pronounced antitumor and immunostimulatory activities in C57BL/6 mice with Lewis lung carcinoma. These may affect the regulation of NF-κB/IκB expression, in addition to cytokines such as IL-2 and EGFR. Further work needs to investigate the relevant signaling pathway effects, but our findings suggest that KLT may be a promising antitumor drug for clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3acisplatin 3abody weight 3alung neoplasms 3ainterleukin-2 3aWestern blotting 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunostimulation (physiological) 3amice 3acytoplasm 3agrowth retardation 3aepidermal growth factor 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aradiotherapy 3aspleen 3asurgery 3acell proliferation 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCarcinoma, Lewis Lungxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxadministration & dosage 2aI-kappa B Kinasexmetabolism 2aI-kappa B Proteinsxmetabolism 2aImmunologic Factorsxadministration & dosage 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aInterleukin-2ximmunology 2aLung Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aErbB Receptorsxmetabolism. 2aSpleenxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aT-Lymphocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aTumor Burdenxdrug effects 0achemotherapy1 aWu, Yan1 aGuo, Zhu-Ying1 aWang, Rong1 aWang, Yu-Jie1 aYuan, Yong-Fang0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Sept. 28, v. 143, no. 2 p.680-685dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171100001700189245008300206300001600289506007600305520164600381592002802027506003702055650002602092650002102118650002002139650001702159650001202176650002502188650001202213650002002225650001202245650001102257650001502268650001202283650002402295650000902319650002302328650001902351650001602370650001202386650001402398650001102412650001402423650003802437650003302475650002402508650001702532650002602549650001702575651001202592651002702604700002602631700002102657700002002678700001602698700002802714700001802742700002602760700002002786700001702806773011002823856008402933852000903017655001203026IND4446647720221207061119.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444664772DNAL7 a208331732pmid7 aPMC30867842pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManh, Bui H.10aSocial and environmental determinants of malaria in space and time in Viet Nam  ap. 109-116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe malaria burden in Viet Nam has been in decline in recent decades, but localised areas of high transmission remain. We used spatiotemporal analytical tools to determine the social and environmental drivers of malaria risk and to identify residual high-risk areas where control and surveillance resources can be targeted. Counts of reported Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria cases by month (January 2007–December 2008) and by district were assembled. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models were developed in a Bayesian framework. Models had the percentage of the district’s population living below the poverty line, percent of the district covered by forest, median elevation, median long-term average precipitation, and minimum temperature included as fixed effects, and terms for temporal trend and residual district-level spatial autocorrelation. Strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in counts of malaria cases was apparent. Poverty and forest cover were significantly associated with an increased count of malaria cases but the magnitude and direction of associations between climate and malaria varied by socio-ecological zone. There was a declining trend in counts of malaria cases during the study period. After accounting for the social and environmental fixed effects, substantial spatial heterogeneity was still evident. Unmeasured factors which may contribute to this residual variation include malaria control activities, population migration and accessibility to health care. Forest-related activities and factors encompassed by poverty indicators are major drivers of malaria incidence in Viet Nam.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aautocorrelation 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ahealth services 3amalaria 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asocial environment 3aspace and time 3atemperature 2aClimate 2aGeography 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMalaria, Falciparumxepidemiology 2aMalaria, Vivaxxepidemiology 2aModels, Statistical 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aTime Factors 3aVietnam 0aVietnamxepidemiology.1 aClements, Archie C.A.1 aThieu, Nguyen Q.1 aHung, Nguyen M.1 aHung, Le X.1 aHay, S.

The X-ray absorption spectra indicated that the nickel(II) species present an octahedral configuration independent on aqueous pH. The UV–vis spectra and fraction-pH diagram showed that the dominant species is Ni(H2O)6²⁺, Ni(NH3)m(H2O)6-m²⁺(m=2, 3 and 4) and Ni(NH3)6²⁺ in the electrolytes of pH 3, 7.5 and 10, respectively, and chloride ions are not bonded to the inner coordination sphere of nickel species. The electrochemical behaviors and nucleation mechanism of nickel(II) species are dependent on the solution pH and species. The deposited nickel morphology and bubble evolution at the interface of electrode/electrolyte were clearly elucidated by the X-ray real-time images. The results indicate that the inner coordination sphere of nickel species can induce the morphology, growth and adherence processes of the deposited nickel. The competition process between nickel reduction and hydrogen evolution has also been discussed at the different applied potentials. The mixed coordination species and the higher applied potentials are beneficial for the formation of the well-adhered and dense nickel deposits.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNickel electrodeposition 0aAmmonium chloride 0aIn situ X-ray imaging 0aInterfacial process 0aInner coordination sphere1 aTang, Jia1 aHu, Jiugang1 aLiu, Shijun1 aFu, Yanan1 aJi, Xiaobo0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.812-820dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014000170300001600310520064900326592002800975650002101003650003001024650001701054650001201071650001301083650001601096653002101112653002101133653002301154653002501177653001101202653003001213700002601243700001901269700002001288700002301308700001801331773012101349856008501470852000901555655001201564IND60573725320221116164231.0170724e20170421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372532DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2016.12146552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJozić, Slaven14aThe Effect of Intravalvular Liquid Loss on Changes in Escherichia coli Levels in Live, Refrigerated Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)  ap. 491-500.  aWe investigated the effect of intravalvular liquid loss on changes in Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) harvested in different seasons and refrigerated (5°C) for 72 hours.

No changes in E. coli levels in mussels (flesh and intravalvular liquid), as the result of intravalvular liquid loss, were observed. Levels of E. coli in the flesh decreased, probably as a result of cells dying off, causing the maintenance of E. coli levels in flesh and intravalvular liquid to be stable throughout storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aharvest date 3amussels 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aBivalve mollusks 0aEscherichia coli 0aindicator bacteria 0aintravalvular liquid 0amussel 0aMytilus galloprovincialis1 aMilanković, Katarina1 aBrajčić, Tea1 aŠolić, Mladen1 aŠantić, Danijela1 aOrdulj, Marin0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2017 Apr. 21, v. 26, no. 4 p.491-500dTaylor & Francisx1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2016.12146553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002000159245010300179300001800282500000900300500001500309520138000324592002801704650001801732650001901750650002101769650002301790650002201813650001301835650001701848650001701865650001501882650002401897650001201921650001901933650002301952650002601975651001302001653001502014700002302029773015002052852000902202856009602211655001202307IND2047491020221119094421.0191125e199507  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204749102DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900040012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisk, Melany C.10aNitrogen Mineralization and Microbial Biomass Nitrogen Dynamics in Three Alpine Tundra Communities  ap. 1036-1043.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe alpine tundra of the Colorado Front Range supports a variety of plant communities whose distribution corresponds to their topographic position. Our objectives were to: (i) determine patterns in net N mineralization and microbial N pools among three communities, Kobresia, Acomastylis, and Carex meadows, that span a topographic gradient, and (ii) relate any patterns to soil microclimate differences among these communities. Average yearly net N mineralization rates, measured with an in situ core incubation technique, were 1.2 g N m⁻² in 1991 and 1.0 g N m⁻² in 1992. No differences were detected in yearly N mineralization rates among the three communities; however, net nitrification and other soil properties were found to differ among communities. Net N mineralization rates and microbial N showed strong temporal variation, and this variation was related to different variables for each community. Seasonal variation in N mineralization was related to soil water and microbial N in Kobresia meadows, to soil temperature and microbial N in Acomastylis meadows, and to soil water and temperature in Carex meadows. Seasonal changes in microbial N were related to soil water in Kobresia and Acomastylis meadows. Large fluctuations in microbial N indicate that periodic losses from the microbial pool may be important to N availability in this alpine tundra site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine plants 3amineralization 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3aplant communities 3anitrogen 3atundra soils 3amicroclimate 3alandscapes 3asoil microorganisms 3abiomass 3amountain soils 3alandscape position 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aColorado 0atopography1 aSchmidt, Steven K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1995 July, v. 59, no. 4 p.1036-1043dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900040012x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02979naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001700168245013400185300001600319520079700335592002801132650001601160650001901176650001801195650001301213650002101226650001301247650001201260650001001272650000901282650001801291650000901309650001901318650001301337650000901350650002101359650001101380650001601391650002601407650003001433650001201463650001401475650001601489650003801505650002101543650002101564650002501585650002701610650003101637650003401668650001301702650001101715650002201726650000901748650001901757650001201776650001901788650007401807650002001881651001101901700002101912700001601933700001901949700002701968700001801995700001802013773008402031856008502115852000902200655001202209IND4451720220221116144031.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445172022DNAL7 a213427482pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvizu, R.R.10aEffects of genotype, level of supplementation, and organic chromium on growth performance, carcass, and meat traits grazing lambs  ap. 404-408.  aThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Suffolk×Dorper (SD) and Rambouillet (R) lamb genotypes, dietary supplementation, and organic chromium on growth performance, carcass, and meat traits in male lambs grazing ryegrass pasture.

However, legumes generally have greater crude protein content relative to other species of forage plants. One of the species of legumes is alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a perennial crop that can grow from the tropics up to sub tropics. In spite of its excellent nutrient content, In Indonesia alfalfa is still not widely explored and used for feedstuff. A study was conducted to explore and evaluate of alfalfa performances in terms of the height, number of tillers, dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) productions under the effects of different plant densities and ages of defoliation”. The height of the location of study was 200 m above sea level with an average temperature of 270 C. The results showed that the ranges of the height of alfalfa, the numbers of tillers, DM and CP productions were 33.31-56.32 cm, 36.38-82.36 tillers/bunch, 556.9-1018.9 kg/ha/defoliation, and 149.75 – 291.79 kg/ha/defoliation, respectively. In general, the ages of plant at the time of defoliation and plant distances affected (P<0.05) the variables being studied. The older plants resulted in greater DM and CP yields, and more densely plantation resulted in greater DM and CP yields.

Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 %, but had no effect on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire significantly decreased ant diversity in forests—especially in tropical forests—whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not. Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests, wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast, fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire, and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature of fire effects on ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aburning 3adeserts 3afire regime 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ameta-analysis 3asavannas 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3awildfires1 aMaravalhas, Jonas B.1 aCornelissen, Tatiana0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2017 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.177-188dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1234-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156300001600245500002000261500001500281520148300296592002801779650001201807650001901819650000901838650001201847650002501859650001401884650000901898650000801907650002001915650002401935650001401959650001801973650002401991650003502015650002202050650002202072650002402094650002202118650002502140650001102165651001102176653002102187653002602208700001402234700001702248700001602265700001602281700002002297700001602317773013502333856007402468852000902542655001202551IND60588290520221118233427.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058829052DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.123222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoperto, S.10aBovine Papillomavirus Type 13 Expression in the Urothelial Bladder Tumours of Cattle  ap. 628-634.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aBovine papillomavirus type 13 (BPV‐13), a novel Deltapapillomavirus, has been found associated with urothelial tumours of the urinary bladder of cattle grazing on lands infested with bracken fern. BPV‐13 was detected in 28 of 39 urothelial tumours. Diagnosis was based on sequencing of L1 and E5 amplicons from tumour samples. The nucleotide sequences generated from these amplicons showed a 100% homology with the sequences of BPV‐13 L1 and E5 DNA found in Brazil from a fibropapilloma of the ear in a cow and from equine sarcoids in two horses. GenBank accession number of our representative BPV‐13 sequences is JQ798171.1. Furthermore, mRNA encoding BPV‐13 E5 oncoprotein was also documented, and its expression was also shown by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in the basal and suprabasal urothelial tumour cells. In twenty‐three tumours, BPV‐13 was simultaneously found with BPV‐2, a Deltapapillomavirus genus, species 4. The latter virus was detected by amplifying and sequencing a 154‐bp‐sized DNA fragment of BPV‐2 E5. In addition, BPV‐13 by itself was seen to be expressed in five BPV‐2‐negative urothelial tumours. This study shows that BPV‐13 is present in urothelial tumour cells thus sharing biological properties with BPV‐1 and BPV‐2. Although further studies are needed, BPV‐13 appears to be another worldwide infectious agent responsible for a distressing disease causing severe economic losses in cattle industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrazing 3aneoplasm cells 3acows 3abladder 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aneoplasms 3aears 3aDNA 3acattle industry 3afinancial economics 3apathogens 3amessenger RNA 3aDeltapapillomavirus 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aDNA fragmentation 3aemerging diseases 3aPteridium aquilinum 3aoncogene proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3ahorses 3aBrazil 0aPapillomaviridae 0aBovine papillomavirus1 aRusso, V.1 aLeonardi, L.1 aMartano, M.1 aCorrado, F.1 aRiccardi, M.

In this study, we optimized the expression levels of various transcription factors to improve the lactic acid tolerance of yeast by a previously developed cocktail δ-integration strategy. By optimizing the expression levels of various transcription factors, the maximum D-lactic acid production and yield under non-neutralizing conditions were improved by 1.2. and 1.6 times, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of PDR3, which is known as a transcription factor involved in multi-drug resistance, effectively improved lactic acid tolerance in yeast. In addition, we clarified for the first time that high expression of PDR3 contributes to the improvement of lactic acid tolerance. PDR3 is considered to be an excellent target gene for studies on yeast stress tolerance and further researches are desired in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18K14069cthe Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI  aJP18KK0413cthe Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacid tolerance 3abiotechnology 3afermentation 3agenes 3alactic acid 3amultiple drug resistance 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aKumata, Yuki1 aMitsui, Ryosuke1 aMatsumoto, Takuya1 aOgino, Hiroyasu0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.19-19dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02977-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300001600286500001500302520122900317592002801546650002601574650001701600650002601617650002901643650002401672650001501696650003101711650002501742650001401767650001301781650001801794700001301812700001801825700001501843700002001858700001301878700001501891700001401906700001501920700001801935773013801953856007402091852000902165655001202174IND60722650620221120194715.0210107e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072265062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb02332a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huibo10aCarbon dots with positive surface charge from tartaric acid and m-aminophenol for selective killing of Gram-positive bacteria  ap. 125-130.  agolden set  aGram-positive bacteria are one of the most common pathogens causing severe and acute infection, and hospital infection caused by Gram-positive bacteria have increased significantly. Also, as antibiotics have been widely used, abusing of antibiotics is becoming an increasingly serious problem which is followed by dangerous drug resistance. Here, we developed a series of cationic carbon dots (CDs) with high-performance as antibacterial agents by using tartaric acid and m-aminophenol as precursors. The surface charge of these CDs can be regulated from +4.5 ± 0.42 mV to +33.2 ± 0.99 mV by increasing the contents of pyridine N and pyrrolic N in CDs. Further antibacterial experiments show that 250 μg mL⁻¹ of CDs with +33.2 ± 0.99 mV can selectively kill Gram-positive bacteria and the antibacterial efficiency can reach approximately >99%. These CDs with positive surface charge can be selectively absorbed on the cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) via electrostatic interaction and then disturb their physiological metabolism, eventually leading to bacterial death. The present work provides a novel method to adjust the surface charge of CDs and apply these CDs as alternative antibacterial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aaminophenols 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3acarbon quantum dots 3acell walls 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amicrobial physiology 3apyridines 3apyrroles 3atartaric acid1 aLu, Fang1 aMa, Chongqing1 aMa, Yurong1 aZhang, Mengling1 aWang, Bo1 aZhang, Yue1 aLiu, Yang1 aHuang, Hui1 aKang, Zhenhui0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Jan. 6, v. 9, no. 1 p.125-130dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb02332a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245008700170520206200257592002802319650002302347650002002370650001502390650002602405650001802431650002202449650002602471650002602497650000902523650002302532650002002555650001502575651001302590700001602603700002602619700001902645700001902664773011902683856007302802852000902875655001202884IND60653384220221119082638.0190714e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065338422DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateru, Stanslaus Terengia10aWater Use and Rice Productivity for Irrigation Management Alternatives in Tanzania  aRice production is important for global food security but given its large water footprint, efficient irrigation management strategies need to be developed. Expansion of rice growing area is larger than any other crop in Africa due to increasing demand for rice. Three rice irrigation management alternatives with the system of rice intensification (SRI) were field-evaluated against the conventional continuously flooded system (CF) in Tanzania. Production systems included: (1) CF (50 mm ponding depth for the entire season); (2) SRI (40 mm ponding for 3 days and no irrigation for next 5 days); (3) 80% SRI (80% of the SRI ponding); and (4) 50% SRI (50% of the SRI ponding). Experimental evaluation of the four systems was conducted for both wet and dry seasons. For the dry season, the SRI and 80% SRI produced higher yields of 9.68 tons/ha and 11.45 tons/ha and saved 26% and 35% of water, respectively compared to the CF (8.69 tons/ha). The yield advantage of the 80% SRI and SRI over the CF was less during the wet season with 6.01 tons/ha and 5.99 tons/ha of production, and water savings of 30% and 14%, respectively compared to the CF (5.64 tons/ha). The 50% SRI had lowest yield of all for both seasons, 7.48 tons/ha and 4.99 tons/ha for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Statistically, the 80% SRI treatment outperformed all other treatments over the two seasons with an additional yield of 1.57 tons/ha and 33% (345 mm) water savings compared to the CF. Economic productivity of water (US$/ha-cm) over two seasons was highest for the 80% SRI ($20.27/ha-cm), while it was lowest for the CF ($12.89/ha-cm). Water saved by converting from the CF to the 80% SRI (1.98 million ha-cm) can support a 50% expansion in the current rice irrigated area in Tanzania. Even without irrigation expansion, the 80% SRI can increase rice production by 1.5 million tons annually while enhancing water availability for industrial and environmental uses (e.g., ecological preserves) and help achieve food security in Tanzania and the greater sub-Saharan Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3acrop production 3adry season 3aeconomic productivity 3afood security 3airrigated farming 3airrigation management 3aproduction technology 3arice 3awater conservation 3awater footprint 3awet season 3aTanzania1 aShukla, S.,1 aSishodia, Rajendra P.1 aTarimo, Andrew1 aTumbo, Siza D.0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170300001600286520102300302592002801325650001501353650001501368650002201383650001201405650001301417650001501430650002601445650001701471650000901488650001501497650001101512650000701523650002101530650001501551650001301566650001501579653002201594653001501616653002301631653001201654700002401666700002001690700001701710700001701727700001501744700001901759700001301778773011901791856008501910852000901995655001202004IND60480611220221119051125.0160429e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048061122DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2015.11095942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamshad, Isha10aHeavy metal uptake capacity of fresh water algae (Oedogonium westti) from aqueous solution: A mesocosm research  ap. 393-398.  aThe green macroalgae present in freshwater ecosystems have attracted a great attention of the world scientists for removal of heavy metals from wastewater. In this mesocosm study, the uptake rates of heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) by Oedogonium westi (O. westti) were measured. The equilibrium adsorption capabilities of O. westti were different for Cd, Ni, Cr, and Pb (0.974, 0.418, 0.620, and 0.261 mgg –¹, respectively) at 18°C and pH 5.0. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies for Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb were observed from 55–95%, 61–93%, 59–89%, and 61–96%, respectively. The highest removal efficiency was observed for Cd and Cr from aqueous solution at acidic pH and low initial metal concentrations. However, the removal efficiencies of Ni and Pb were higher at high pH and high concentrations of metals in aqueous solution. The results summarized that O. westti is a suitable candidate for removal of selected toxic heavy metals from the aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOedogonium 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3achromium 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amacroalgae 3anickel 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3ascientists 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aOedogonium westti 0amacroalgae 0atoxic heavy metals 0aremoval1 aK̲h̲ān, Sardār,1 aWaqas, Muhammad1 aAsma, Maliha1 aNawab, Javed1 aGul, Nayab1 aRaiz, Arjumand1 aLi, Gang0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 18, no. 4 p.393-398dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.11095943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010300156300001600259500002000275520230700295592002802602650001102630650001602641650001902657650000902676700005902685700005502744700002302799700005802822773011802880856007202998852000903070655001203079IND60790674220221119085421.0220826e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079067422DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampert, Peter10aUnderstanding students' conceptions of plant reproduction to better teach plant biology in schools  ap. 248-260.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIt is critical that people understand the importance of plants to all life on Earth, and this must be taught in an understandable and engaging way at an early age. Plant reproduction provides useful real‐life examples for teaching students about the biology of plants. However, what do students actually know about this process? We asked students to complete one of three writing tasks to ascertain their understanding of plant reproduction. Their responses provide useful insight into their conceptions of plant reproduction. Ultimately, better knowledge of students' conceptions of topics like plant reproduction can provide educators with important insights to help guide and improve teaching of plant biology in schools. Summary Teaching botany is a challenge due to the phenomenon of “plant blindness” and students' general lack of interest in plants. The reproduction of flowering plants can serve as a useful topic for teaching botany by providing a real‐life context to aid learning. However, research has shown that students have difficulties in understanding how the stages of plant reproduction are connected. This study aims to examine students' conceptions of the processes of plant reproduction. Students' conceptions were analyzed in a multi‐method approach. A total of 724 students from fifth to 12th grade (aged 10–18 years) were assessed using three different types of writing and drawing tasks. Students' conceptions were analyzed in a qualitative content analysis. Results show that students struggle to differentiate between pollination and seed dispersal. Moreover, students have better knowledge about the function of seeds than about the function of pollen. Students are most familiar with seed dispersal by wind and pollination by bees. Better knowledge of students' conceptions can greatly aid teaching. Students' awareness of the function of seeds can be used as a starting point for teaching plant reproduction. The writing and drawing tasks of the study can be used in class to assess students' conceptions in an easy way to make conceptions and their development visible to both students and teachers. Knowledge about students' conceptions of plant reproduction can serve as a basis for deeper understanding and improve how plant biology is taught in schools.  aPublisher supplied data 3apollen 3apollination 3aseed dispersal 3awind1 aScheuch, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3183-799X1 aPany, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7452-44111 aMüllner, Bernhard1 aKiehn, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0095-06180 tPlants, people, planet.g2019 July, v. 1, no. 3 p.248-260dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012800154520183100282592002802113650002902141650001102170650001702181650001202198650001602210650001502226650001102241650004302252650001102295650001502306651001002321700001702331700001702348700001502365700001502380700001702395773011902412856007302531852000902604655001202613IND60653384320221119082354.0190714e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065338432DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peng10aGIS-Based Random Forest Weight for Rainfall-Induced Landslide Susceptibility Assessment at a Humid Region in Southern China  aLandslide susceptibility assessment is presently considered an effective tool for landslide warning and forecasting. Under the assessment procedure, a credible index weight can greatly increase the rationality of the assessment result. Using the Beijiang River Basin, China, as a case study, this paper proposes a new weight-determining method based on random forest (RF) and used the weighted linear combination (WLC) to evaluate the landslide susceptibility. The RF weight and eight indices were used to construct the assessment model. As a comparison, the entropy weight (EW) and weight determined by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were also used, respectively, to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed weight-determining method. The results show that: (1) the average error rates of training and testing based on RF are 18.12% and 15.83%, respectively, suggesting that the RF model can be considered rational and credible; (2) RF ranks the indices elevation (EL), slope (SL), maximum one-day precipitation (M1DP) and distance to fault (DF) as the Top 4 most important of the eight indices, occupying 73.24% of the total, while the indices runoff coefficient (RC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), shear resistance capacity (SRC) and available water capacity (AWC) are less consequential, with an index importance degree of only 26.76% of the total; and (3) the verification of landslide susceptibility indicates that the accuracy rate based on the RF weight reaches 75.41% but are only 59.02% and 72.13% for the other two weights (EW and AHP), respectively. This paper shows the potential to provide a new weight-determining method for landslide susceptibility assessment. Evaluation results are expected to provide a reference for landslide management, prevention and reduction in the studied basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavailable water capacity 3abasins 3acase studies 3aentropy 3ahumid zones 3alandslides 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aBai, Xiaoyan1 aWu, Xiaoqing1 aYu, Haijun1 aHao, Yanru1 aHu, Bill X.,0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015500173300001600328520164400344536065401988592002802642596001202670650001202682650000902694650002202703650001402725650001602739650002302755653003002778653001602808653001802824653002802842653000902870700002202879700002502901700002302926773012002949856008603069852000903155655001203164IND60573725620221116164216.0210727e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372562DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2017.13176832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalaguier, Romain10aEffects of a Worksite Supervised Adapted Physical Activity Program on Trunk Muscle Endurance, Flexibility, and Pain Sensitivity Among Vineyard Workers  ap. 200-214.  aObjectives: In viticulture, the prevalence of low back pain is particularly high among vineyard workers exposed to sustained and awkward postures. One promising setting for low back pain prevention resides in the implementation of workplace physical activity. Methods: This nonrandomized pilot study aims at evaluating the effects of a worksite supervised adapted physical activity program among 17 vineyard workers volunteered to enter either an intervention group (n = 10) or a control group (n = 7).The intervention group followed a physical activity program for 8 weeks involving (1) 15 minutes of warm-up every working day and (2) two weekly 1-hour adapted physical activity sessions targeting trunk muscle endurance and flexibility. The control group was advised to continue normal physical activity. Evaluations were carried out at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Physical capacity was assessed using flexibility tests for the trunk, along with trunk muscle flexor and extensor endurance tests. Finally, pain sensitivity was evaluated by assessing pressure pain thresholds over 14 anatomical locations in the low back region. Results: For the intervention group, the endurance of the trunk extensor and flexor significantly increased from baseline to week 8 as well as the pressure pain thresholds. No change was observed for the control group over the same period. Conclusions: These encouraging results in combination with the high adherence rate set interesting foundations for the promotion of worksite supervised adapted physical activity and, most likely, offer a new promising approach to prevent low back pain among vineyard workers.  aThe presented work is part of the joint PhD thesis of Romain Balaguier at Université Grenoble Alpes (France) and Aalborg University (Denmark), who was supported by a grant of the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research.

This indicates that SSH can be used to clone differentially expressed cDNAs inD. involucrata bracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDavidia involucrata 3aNorthern blotting 3abracts 3acDNA libraries 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3ascreening 3asuppression subtractive hybridization1 aChen, Li1 aJuan, Lin1 aLi, Yufeng1 aChen, Fang0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2002 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.231-238dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027824583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012700157300001800284520194500302592002802247650001002275650001602285650001702301650001902318650001602337650001702353650001702370650003702387650002402424650001702448650001602465650001802481650002002499650002502519650000902544650002902553700001602582700001402598700001702612700001802629700001702647700001402664773012402678856007502802852000902877655001202886IND60772603720221121030527.0220405e20220404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077260372DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04030h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Tingting10aEvaluation of the anti-osteoporotic effect of a low-phenylalanine whey protein hydrolysate in an ovariectomized mice model  ap. 3957-3967.  aA phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet is indispensable to control the blood Phe for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), who are also confronted with progressive bone impairment. Thus, the development of a low-Phe protein substitute that could positively regulate bone metabolism is desired for their bone health. Our previous study reported the preparation of a low-Phe containing whey hydrolysate (LPH) from a selected whey protein hydrolysate (TAH). However, the effect of LPH on the bone status is unknown. In this study, we used an ovariectomized (OVX) mice model to evaluate the anti-osteoporotic potential of oral administration of whey protein concentrate (WPC, protein control), TAH, and LPH on bone physiology and bone metabolism. The results showed that after 12 weeks of treatment, the decreased bone mineral density, the deteriorated trabecular microarchitecture, and the reduced ultimate load due to ovariectomy were significantly attenuated by two whey protein hydrolysates (TAH and LPH); meanwhile, the body weight, uterine weight, bone composition, and the femoral elastic load of OVX mice had not been significantly affected by whey samples. In addition, LPH and TAH dual-regulated bone remodeling in OVX mice through triggering osteogenesis (promoted the expression of runt-related protein 2 (Runx2) and osteoformation markers) and inhibiting osteoresorption as well as inflammation. The modulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and the inhibited nuclear factor κB signaling by LPH and TAH might relate to the dual-regulatory activities on bone. Overall, in the OVX mice model, LPH exerted higher osteoprotective potential than TAH of the same dose by activating the bone formation markers and inhibiting the inflammatory status. The current study demonstrated for the first time the potential use of a low-Phe whey hydrolysate, a protein substitute for PKU individuals, in the prevention of osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abody weight 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone health 3ahydrolysates 3ainflammation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoral administration 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylketonuria 3aprotein hydrolysates 3awhey 3awhey protein concentrate1 aZhang, Ling1 aLiu, Ling1 aYu, Songfeng1 aZheng, Jiexia1 aWu, Jianping1 aYang, Kai0 tFood & function.g2022 Apr. 4, v. 13, no. 7 p.3957-3967dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04030h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013100167300001200298520073400310592002801044653003601072653002201108653001501130653002701145700001701172700001601189700001801205700001701223773010001240856008701340852000901427655001201436IND60594062520221119092536.0180510e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059406252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wen10aLight-scattering photoanodes from double-layered mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles/SiO2 nanospheres for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 1-7.  aDye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising solution to global energy and environmental problems.

Cu concentrations in the soils at this former mine ranged from 65–10107 mg kg ⁻¹. The pH and EC varied widely in the 3.9–8.4 and 152–7311 µS ranges, respectively. Nine plant species growing over the copper mine site were selected to screen for metal uptake to determine their suitability for phytoremediation. The Australian native tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis indicated enrichment factor (EF) of 2.17, 1.89, and 1.30 for Cu, Zn, and Pb, respectively, suggesting that this species of tree can accumulate these metals to some degree. The stress-resistant exotic olive, Olea europaea exhibited EF of ≤ 0.01 for Cu, Cd, and Pb, and 0.29 for Zn, which is characteristic of an excluder plant. Acacia pycnantha , the Australian pioneer legume species with EF 0.03, 0.80, 0.32, and 0.01 for Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb, respectively, emerged as another strong metal excluder and consequently as an ideal metal stabilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aOlea europaea 3acadmium 3acopper 3alead 3alegumes 3amining 3aolives 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3ascreening 3asoil 3asurveys 3atrees 3azinc 3aSouth Australia 0aabandoned mine site 0ametallophytes 0arevegetation 0aphytoremediation 0aphytostabilization1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu1 aAryal, Rupak1 aNaidu, R.,0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 18, no. 4 p.399-405dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.11095993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245007600185300001400261500001500275520092100290592002801211650000901239650003001248650002001278650001101298650001301309650001501322650001701337650002401354650003501378650003101413650000901444650005301453650004701506650002801553650003501581650001101616650004301627650005401670650001701724650002001741653001101761653001301772700001701785700002001802700001701822700002101839773011101860856004801971852000902019655001202028IND50065371220221116144116.0130420e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006537122DNAL7 a234633282pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0161-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Dong Hyun10aSilaffin Peptides as a Novel Signal Enhancer for Gravimetric Biosensors  ap. 25-31.  a2019-12-06  aApplication of biomimetic silica formation to gravimetric biosensors has been conducted for the first time. As a model system, silaffin peptides fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were immobilized on a gold quartz crystal resonator for quartz crystal microbalances using a self-assembled monolayer. When a solution of silicic acid was supplied, silica particles were successfully deposited on the Au surface, resulting in a significant change in resonance frequency (i.e., signal enhancement) with the silaffin–GFP. However, frequency was not altered when bare GFP was used as a control. The novel peptide enhancer is advantageous because it can be readily and quantitatively conjugated with sensing proteins using recombinant DNA technology. As a proof of concept, this study shows that the silaffin domains can be employed as a novel and efficient biomolecular signal enhancer for gravimetric biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3agreen fluorescent protein 3arecombinant DNA 3aquartz 3apeptides 3abiosensors 3asilicic acid 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGold 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aImmobilized Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aQuartz 2aQuartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSilicic Acid 2aSilicon Dioxide 0asilica 0aproteins1 aLee, Jeong-O1 aSang, Byoung-In1 aWon, Keehoon1 aKim, Yŏng-hwan,0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 May, v. 170, no. 1 p.25-31dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0161-y  aDNAL 7aarticle01432naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245003800161300001600199500001400215520065400229592002800883650002700911650001200938650001400950773011800964856007501082852000901157655001201166IND60790674520221119085618.0220826e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079067452DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.100592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, Dawn L.10aStanding in the shadows of plants  ap. 130-138.  aEDITORIAL  aThis special issue of Plants, People, Planet brings together a wide range of perspectives on the topic of “plant blindness”—the widest to date in one issue—with contributions from scholars working across a diverse range of disciplines, from the humanities and social sciences to plant science, conservation, and ecology.

In this study, the dewatering and low-temperature co-pyrolysis of oil-containing sludge in the presence of various agricultural biomasses, such as rice husk, walnut shell, sawdust, and apricot shell, were explored. As a result, the water content gradually decreases with the increase of biomass addition within 0–1.0 wt % in original oily sludge. Comparatively, the dewatering efficiency of sludge in the presence of four types of biomasses follows the order of apricot shell > walnut shell > rice husk > sawdust. On the other hand, rice husk and sawdust are relatively more efficient in the recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons compared with walnut shell and apricot shell. The recovery efficiency generally increased with the increase in the biomass content in the range of 0–0.2 wt %, then exhibited a gradually decreasing trend with the increase in the biomass content from 0.2 to 1.0 wt %. The results suggest that optimum amount of biomass plays an important role in the recovery efficiency. In addition, the addition of biomass (such as rice husk) also promotes the formation of CₓHy and CO, increasing the calorific value of pyrolysis residue, and controlled the pollution components of the exhaust gas discharged from residue incineration. The present work implies that biomass as addictive holds great potential in the industrial dewatering and pyrolysis of oil-containing sludge.  aThis work was supported by the West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences  [grant number 2015-XBQN-A-03]; the Xinjiang Program of Introducing High-Level Talents [grant number Y539031601], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41571446]; CAS Youth Innovation Promotion Association [grant number 2016380].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-XBQN-A-03cWest Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences   a2016380cCAS Youth Innovation Promotion Association  a41571446cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aY539031601cthe Xinjiang Program of Introducing High-Level Talents 3aapricots 3abiomass 3adewatering 3aenvironmental technology 3ahydrocarbons 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution 3apollution control 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asawdust 3asludge 3awalnut hulls 3awater content 0aOily sludge 0adewatering 0apyrolysis 0abiomass 0aoil recovery1 aZhou, Xiehong1 aWang, Chuanyi1 aJia, Hanzhong0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 39, no. 21 p.2715-2723dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13659383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013300174300001800307500001900325520084100344592002801185650001601213650001201229650001401241650001601255650002201271650002001293650001601313650002501329650001401354651001501368651001101383653002301394700002501417700002101442700002301463773012601486856008501612852000901697655001201706IND60722651120221120210509.0210107e20200717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072265112DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.18258572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakahara, Shinichi13aAn integrative taxonomic approach supports a new species of Vettius from Central America (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae: Hesperiinae)  ap. 1699-1711.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe here describe and name a new skipper butterfly in the genus Vettius Godman, 1901, currently known from two sites, one in Costa Rica and the other in Panama.

We modified a previously reported dsRNA extraction protocol and used it to detect a wide variety of plant and putative fungal viruses from infected plant tissues. The modified protocol was used successfully to extract large dsRNAs from 50 to 70 mg of desiccated plant tissues infected with acute and persistent RNA viruses and from plant tissues infected with biotrophic fungi causing rusts and powdery mildew diseases. The protocol proved to be efficient, fast, economic and versatile and requires relatively small amounts of desiccated tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOomycetes 3aRNA viruses 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aelectrophoresis 3afungi 3amycoviruses 3aplant tissues 3aplant viruses 3aplants (botany) 3apowdery mildew1 aEscalante, C.1 ade Souto and, E.

Currently, assessments are largely performed visually by human experts. Being subjective, such assessments may not always be consistent or entirely reliable. As a result, methods with a higher degree of objectivity have been investigated, and special attention has been dedicated to the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as the basis for more reliable detection strategies. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of FHB in wheat kernels using HSI. The goal was to develop a simple and accurate algorithm which gave as output an index that can be interpreted as the likelihood of the kernel being infected by FHB. With a classification accuracy above 91%, the developed algorithm was robust to factors such as shape, orientation, shadowing and clustering of kernels. It was shown that the algorithm was not only suitable for detecting FHB, but it also has the capability, albeit limited, of estimating DON concentrations in wheat kernels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium head blight 3aalgorithms 3aautomatic detection 3adeoxynivalenol 3aexperts 3ahumans 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aingestion 3arisk 3aseeds 3awheat 0aFusarium index 0aFusarium-damaged wheat kernels 0aImage processing1 aTibola, Casiane S.1 aFernandes, José M.C.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Mar., v. 131 p.65-76dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2015.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245012700194300001600321520182800337592002802165650001702193650001402210650001502224650001602239650000902255650001602264650001202280650001302292650000902305650002402314650003102338650001802369650002002387650001202407650001502419650003602434650004802470650001202518650004102530650004502571650002602616650000902642650001102651650002902662650003802691650002802729650002102757650005902778700003302837700002402870700002402894700001902918773012002937856005503057852000903112655001203121IND4470126920221116144020.0120622e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447012692DNAL7 a226424132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2012.00728.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampagnol, Daniela10aEffect of intraperitoneal or incisional bupivacaine on pain and the analgesic requirement after ovariohysterectomy in dogs  ap. 426-430.  aObjective To compare the effect of intraperitoneal (IP) or incisional (INC) bupivacaine on pain and the analgesic requirement after ovariohysterectomy in dogs. Study design Prospective, randomized clinical study. Animals Thirty female dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy (OHE). Methods Dogs admitted for elective OHE were anesthetized with acepromazine, butorphanol, thiopental and halothane. Animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 10 per group). The treatments consisted of preincisional infiltration with saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) or bupivacaine with epinephrine and/or IP administration of the same solutions, as follows: INC and IP 0.9% NaCl (control group); INC 0.9% NaCl and IP bupivacaine (5 mg kg−1, IP group); INC bupivacaine (1 mg kg−1) and IP 0.9% NaCl (INC group). Postoperative pain was evaluated by a blinded observer for 24 hours after extubation by means of a visual analog scale (VAS) and a numeric rating scale (NRS). Rescue analgesia (morphine, 0.5 mg kg−1, IM) was administered if the VAS was >5/10 or the NRS >10/29. Results At 1 hour after anesthesia, VAS pain scores were [medians (interquartile range)]: 6.4 (3.1–7.9), 0.3 (0.0–2.6) and 0.0 (0.0–7.0) in control, IP and INC groups, respectively. VAS pain scores were lower in the IP compared to the control group. Over the first 24 hours, rescue analgesia was administered to 7/10, 5/10 and 3/10 dogs of the control, INC and IP groups, respectively. Total number of dogs given rescue analgesia over the first 24 hours did not differ significantly among groups. Conclusions and clinical relevance Intraperitoneal bupivacaine resulted in lower pain scores during the first hour of the postoperative period and there was a trend towards a decreased need for rescue analgesia after OHE in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacepromazine 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3abutorphanol 3adogs 3aepinephrine 3afemales 3amorphine 3apain 3aprospective studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3arating scales 3asodium chloride 3aspaying 3athiopental 2aAnalgesiaxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Localxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBupivacainexadministration & dosage 2aConscious Sedationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxsurgery 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHysterectomyxveterinary 2aInfusions, Parenteralxveterinary 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aPain Measurement 2aPain, Postoperativexprevention & controlxveterinary.1 aTeixeira‐Neto, Francisco J1 aMonteiro, Eduardo R1 aRestitutti, Flávia1 aMinto, Bruno W0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2012 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.426-430dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2012.00728.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013400173300001600307520115500323592002801478653002201506653002301528653002801551653001901579700001801598700002001616700001901636773010401655856008701759852000901846655001201855IND60594062920221119092311.0180510e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059406292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Arup10aFacile synthesis of self-standing binder-free vanadium pentoxide-carbon nanofiber composites for high-performance supercapacitors  ap. 400-407.  aVanadium pentoxide (V2O5) thin layers were hydrothermally deposited on self-standing carbon nanofibre (CNF) paper, which was fabricated through electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor solution followed by thermal stabilization and carbonization. The prepared V2O5/CNF nanocomposite paper was characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The electrochemical performance of as-prepared free-standing nanocomposite electrode was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques for supercapacitor applications. A specific capacitance of 227F/g and 157F/g were achieved for the nanocomposite obtained from V2O5-deposition of 5 and 7-day period, respectively, using 2M KCl as electrolyte at sweep rate 1A/g. The specific capacitance of the nanocomposites was retained up to 80% over 1000 cycles. The maximum energy density of 63.6 Wh/kg and power density of 4554.6W/kg was achieved for the 5-day deposited samples.

Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi are known to improve nutrient uptake by plants from infertile soil. The objective of this study was to determine whether wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) responses to VAM fungal inoculation differ among eroded and noneroded soils from the same toposequence. Spring wheat plants were grown under growth chamber conditions in soils collected from three landscape positions of a typical toposequence in eastern Washington, with and without VAM fungal inoculation. Noninoculated soils exhibited 13 to 26% VAM root colonization, while inoculation increased VAM colonization up to 49 to 55% by 5 wk after planting. The VAM fungal inoculation of eroded soils increased shoot dry weight and tiller number, advanced the leaf stage, and increased root length compared with the noninoculated controls. Shoot concentrations of P and Zn were increased by VAM inoculation. In contrast, shoot concentrations of Cu and Mn were unchanged, while Fe was decreased. While VAM fungal inoculation also increased P, Zn, and Cu concentrations in water-stressed plants, Mn and Fe concentrations decreased. No responses to VAM fungal inoculation were observed in soil from a noneroded toeslope, although VAM colonization was similar to that observed in the eroded soils. These results indicate the potential role of VAM fungi for improving dryland wheat productivity on eroded soils. Washington State Univ.

In this work, we have biochemically and structurally characterized the dye-decolorizing peroxidase from Bacillus subtilis (BsDyP). The biochemical studies of BsDyP demonstrate that pH 4.0 is optimum for the oxidation of malachite green (MG) and methyl violet (MV). However, it oxidizes the MG with higher catalytic efficiency (kcₐₜ/Kₘ = 6.3 × 10² M⁻¹s⁻¹), than MV (kcₐₜ/Kₘ = 5.0 × 10² M⁻¹s⁻¹). While reactive black 5 (RB5) is oxidized at pH 3.0 with the catalytic efficiency of kcₐₜ/Kₘ = 3.6 × 10² M⁻¹s⁻¹. The calculated thermodynamic parameters by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) reveal the feasibility and spontaneity of dyes binding with BsDyP. Further, the crystal structures of a HEPES bound and unbound of BsDyP provide insight into the probable binding sites of the substrates. In BsDyP-HEPES bound structure, the HEPES-1 molecule is found in the heme cavity at the γ-edge, and another HEPES-2 molecule is bound ~16 Å away from the heme that is fenced by Ile231, Arg234, Ser235, Asp239, Glu334, and surface-exposed Tyr335 residues. Furthermore, the molecular docking, simulation, and MMPBSA studies support the binding of dyes at both the sites of BsDyP and produce lower-energy stable BsDyP-dyes complexes. Here, the BsDyP study allows the identification of its two potential binding sites and shows the oxidation of a variety of dyes. Structural and functional insight of BsDyP will facilitate its engineering for the improved decolorization of dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiophysics 3acalorimetry 3acatalytic activity 3adecolorization 3agentian violet 3aheme 3amalachite green 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperoxidase 3athermodynamics 3atitration 0aDye-decolorizing peroxidase 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry 0aEnzyme kinetics 0aCrystal structure 0aHEPES1 aDalal, Vikram1 aMahto, Jai Krishna1 aGurjar, Bhola Ram1 aTomar, Shailly1 aSharma, A.

Consequently, rodents may extend their breeding season, increasing population densities. An improved understanding of the effects of food availability and quality on rodent reproduction may enable better forecasts of high rodent population densities in response to asynchronous or aseasonal planting of crops. Aim The present study examined the association between the quality and quantity of food and the reproductive success of female rice-field rats, Rattus tanezumi and Rattus argentiventer, in a lowland rice landscape in the Philippines. Methods We evaluated the main dietary components of female rats on two different islands through a cropping season during the 2010 wet season. The breeding performance of 60 female R. tanezumi and 60 R. argentiventer individuals was measured. Key results Our findings indicated the following: (1) the main dietary items for females of both rodent species during the main breeding season (the booting stage to harvest) were rice panicles and rice seeds; (2) the high protein content of the rice crop at the tillering stage triggered the onset of the main breeding season, leading to the highest rates of conception during the booting and ripening stages; (3) the quantity of food available at the stubble stage provided sufficient nutrient to maintain pregnancy and lactation by females; and (4) asynchronous planting and poor harvest technology could extend the breeding season of rice-field rats. Conclusions We contend that the extension of the growing season by 3–4 weeks provides high-quality food for rodents, which in turn provides sufficient conditions for higher population densities. The availability of spilled rice grain at the stubble stage is a source of good-quality food for pregnant and lactating females, allowing extension of the breeding season. Implications Synchronous planting (within 2 weeks) with good post-harvest management of rice stubble are important to prevent high population densities of rice-field rats in lowland rice landscapes in the Philippines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRattus 3abreeding season 3aconception 3acrops 3afood availability 3afood quality 3afoods 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3ainflorescences 3aislands 3alactating females 3alactation 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3apostharvest technology 3apregnancy 3aprotein content 3arats 3areproductive performance 3arice 3aseeds 3astubble 3awet season 3aPhilippines 0abreeding ecology 0adiet composition 0afood quality 0afood quantity 0airrigated rice 0aR. tanezumi 0aR. argentiventer 0asynchronous cropping1 aSingleton, Grant R.0 tWildlife research.g2014, v. 41, no. 1 p.56-63dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR131083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03870naa a2200973 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009500163500001900258520146800277592002801745650001401773650001501787650001501802650001401817650001601831650002101847650001101868650001701879650001601896650001801912650001501930650002001945650001401965650001501979650001701994650001702011650001602028650001602044650002002060653002302080653002802103653003002131653001202161653001202173653001102185653001102196653000702207653000802214653001102222653000902233653000802242653000902250653000802259653000802267653001002275653000802285653000802293653000802301653000802309653000702317653001102324653000802335653000802343653000902351653000802360653001002368653000902378653001002387653001202397653000802409653000802417653000902425653000702434653000802441653000702449653000802456653000802464653001102472653000902483700002002492700002102512700005802533700001902591700005902610773012402669856008202793852000902875655001202884IND60712925920221117165820.0201125e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071292592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIaia, Noemi10aEfficacy of theobromine in preventing intestinal CaCo-2 cell damage induced by oxysterols  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe alteration of the intestinal barrier function is currently believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of gut diseases mainly associated with the activation of inflammation processes.Diet plays an important role in the control of human gut integrity. Theobromine is a natural methylxanthine present in dark chocolate particularly abundant in cocoa bean shell. This is a polyphenol rich by-product generated in cocoa industrial processing, which is gaining value as a functional ingredient. This study aims to highlight for the first time the capability of theobromine in protecting the intestinal cell monolayer from a mixture of dietary oxysterols showing an inflammatory action in terms of IL-8 and MCP-1 overproduction. Differentiated CaCo-2 cells were treated with 60 μM oxysterol mixture and pre-incubated with 10 μM theobromine. Intestinal barrier damage was investigated in terms of tight junction claudin 1, occludin and JAM-A protein levels, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) −2 and −9 activation and anti/pro-apoptotic protein changes.The observed cell monolayer permeability protection by theobromine may be due to its ability to inhibit the production of cytokines and MMPs that can be responsible for tight junction loss and apoptosis in intestinal cells. Our findings provide additional mechanistic hints on the healthy effect of theobromine cocoa component as an attractive natural molecule in the prevention of inflammatory gut diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiophysics 3abyproducts 3achocolate 3acocoa beans 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aingredients 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestines 3amethylxanthines 3aoccludins 3aoxysterols 3apathogenesis 3apermeability 3apolyphenols 3atheobromine 3atight junctions 0aDietary oxysterols 0aIntestinal inflammation 0aMatrix metalloproteinases 0aα-epox 0aβ-epox 0a7α-HC 0a7β-HC 0a7K 0aBax 0aBcl-xL 0acAMP 0aCBS 0aDMEM 0aDTT 0aECL 0aELISA 0aERK 0aFBS 0aHRP 0aIBD 0aIL 0aIFN-β 0aLDH 0aLDS 0amTOR 0aMMP 0aMCP-1 0aNADH 0aNF-kB 0aOxy-mix 0aPBS 0aPDE 0aPI3K 0aRT 0aSDS 0aST 0aTBS 0aTLR 0aTNF-α 0aTTBS1 aRossin, Daniela1 aSottero, Barbara1 aVenezia, Ivana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7438-66451 aPoli, Giuseppe1 aBiasi, Fiorella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8962-32330 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 694 p.108591-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1085913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245018200179300001800361520140000379592002801779650002501807650001301832650001401845650001501859650001601874650001801890650001301908650002301921650002001944650000901964650002601973650002101999650002102020650001602041653002502057653002402082653002302106653002402129653002002153653002802173700002902201700002902230700002202259700004202281700003102323700002302354700002902377700003702406700003602443773009902479856008602578852000902664655001202673IND60585831520221118035531.0190401e20171219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, Milene Tavares10aLT adjuvant modulates epitope specificity and improves the efficacy of murine antibodies elicited by sublingual vaccination with the N-terminal domain of Streptococcus mutans P1  ap. 7273-7282.  aIn this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy and peptide-based immune signatures of antibodies raised in mice after sublingual immunization with a recombinant form of the P1 (aka AgI/II, PAc) adhesin (P139-512) of Streptococcus mutans, a major etiological agent of dental caries. Sublingual administration of P139-512 in combination with the mucosal adjuvant LTK4R (a derivative of heat-labile LT toxin) induced strong and long-lasting systemic and mucosal immune responses. Incorporation of the adjuvant resulted in an enhancement of the anti-adhesive and anti-colonization activity against S. mutans as evaluated both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Incorporation of the adjuvant to the vaccine formulation also changed the epitope specificity of the induced antibodies as determined by immunological signatures of sera collected from vaccinated mice. Use of a peptide microarray library led to the identification of peptide targets recognized by antibodies in serum samples with enhanced anti-adhesive effects. Altogether, the results presented herein showed that the sublingual administration of a P1-based subunit vaccine represents a promising approach for the prevention of dental caries caused by S. mutans. In addition, the present study disclosed the role of adjuvants on the epitope specificity and functionality of antibodies raised by subunit vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aadhesins 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adental caries 3aepitopes 3aetiological agents 3aimmune response 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amucosal immunity 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccination 0aStreptococcus mutans 0aAnti-caries vaccine 0aPeptide microarray 0aEpitope specificity 0aImmunosignature 0aSublingual immunization1 aFerreira, Ewerton Lucena1 aPereira, Gisela de Souza1 aStafford, Phillip1 aMaeda, Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris1 aRodrigues, Juliana Falcão1 aBrady, L.

Due to the non-stop demand of the ever-increasing human population, the supply of certain species is not guaranteed, and mislabelling practices arise. Fillets and heavily processed products that cannot be easily authenticated are particularly vulnerable to fraudulent practices. In order to face this challenge, as a cost-effective, rapid, and easy handling tool, the MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) coupled with DNA (meta)barcoding represents a suitable option to assess seafood fraud. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of MinION sequencing to authenticate mixed seafood products by (1) evaluating MinION generated barcodes from single species that have already been Sanger sequenced and (2) performing MinION sequencing of mixed samples containing commercial seafood species in different amounts to evaluate whether all species can be detected, even when they are low abundant. Using the mitochondrial DNA gene markers Cytb and COI, 86% and 76% of the single species were correctly identified, respectively, of which 26% and 29% also showed non-target species. For the mixed samples, not all species were detected regardless of the composition of the mixtures or the marker gene used. Nevertheless, the MinION sequencing platform can be considered an additional tool to complement currently available approaches to authenticate mixed seafood samples providing that adequate measures are taken to reduce false positives and false negatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3abarcoding 3acost effectiveness 3afood safety 3afraud 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahuman population 3amitochondrial DNA 3ananopores 3anontarget organisms 3aseafoods 0aNanopore sequencing 0aMinION 0aSeafood fraud 0aSeafood authentication 0aDNA metabarcoding.1 aVanhollebeke, Joran1 aDerycke, Sofie0 tFood control.g2023 Mar., v. 145 p.109388-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.109388  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011700160300001800277520067300295592002800968650001800996650001401014650001301028650001301041650002301054650001501077700001501092700002501107773013001132856007501262852000901337655001201346IND60657845020221121001132.0190823e20140826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784502DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60330j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashidi, Hassan10aSurface engineering of synthetic polymer materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications  ap. 1318-1331.  aWhen using polymer materials as scaffolds for tissue engineering or regenerative medicine applications the initial, and often lasting, interaction between cells and the material are via surfaces.

Here we report cloning and characterizing BoMATE (KF031944), a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family gene from cabbage (Brassica oleracea). The expression of BoMATE was more abundant in roots than in shoots, and it was highly induced by Al treatment. The ¹⁴C-citrate efflux experiments in oocytes demonstrated that BoMATE is a citrate transporter. Electrophysiological analysis and SIET analysis of Xenopus oocytes expressing BoMATE indicated BoMATE is activated by Al. Transient expression of BoMATE in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that it localized to the plasma membrane. Compared with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing BoMATE enhanced Al tolerance and increased citrate secretion. In addition, Arabidopsis transgenic lines had a lower K ⁺ efflux and higher H ⁺ efflux, in the presence of Al, than control wild type in the distal elongation zone (DEZ). This is the first direct evidence that MATE protein is involved in the K ⁺ and H ⁺ flux in response to Al treatment. Taken together, our results show that BoMATE is an Al-induced citrate transporter and enhances aluminum tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana .  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica oleracea 3aXenopus 3aaluminum 3aanions 3acabbage 3acitrates 3aelectrophysiology 3aextrusion 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aonions 3aoocytes 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3aroots 3asecretion 3ashoots 3atoxic substances 0aaluminum tolerance 0aBoMATE 0acabbage 0acitrate 0aH+ flux 0aK+ flux1 aLi, Ren1 aShi, Jin1 aWang, Jinfang1 aSun, Qianqian1 aZhang, Haijun1 aXing, Yanxia1 aQi, Yan1 aZhang, Na1 aGuo, Yang-Dong0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.1426-1436dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012900165300001800294520059600312592002800908650003200936650001300968650001000981650003000991650001801021650001201039700001301051700001501064700001201079700001201091700001701103700001601120700002001136700001401156700001601170700001801186773009901204856008101303852000901384655001201393IND60439028620221119165520.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2502-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xiaoyun10aConstruction and characterization of a recombinant reticuloendotheliosis virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein  ap. 2231-2235.  aReticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) causes an immunosuppressive and oncogenic disease in chickens and other birds.

Our objectives were to quantify angler satisfaction in a fishery for Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in central Oregon and examine the factors influencing angler satisfaction. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the effect of several variables, including fishing success, on angler satisfaction. Measures of fishing success were present in all of the top candidate models. The probability of an increase in angler satisfaction rating was positively related to mean length and number of fish caught per hour. However, younger anglers tended to have higher satisfaction ratings at lower mean length and catch rates of fish than did older anglers. These models provided information on the expected percentage of anglers that will be satisfied given the average length of fish caught and the number of fish caught per hour. These results can be used to establish quantitative, measurable, management objectives that will satisfy desired percentages of anglers and lead to more effective fisheries management.

To balance the activity of the two photosystems under varying light conditions, mobile antenna complexes, light-harvesting complex IIs (LHCIIs), shuttle between the two photosystems during state transitions. PSI forms a complex consisting of PSI core and its peripheral light-harvesting complex (LHCI) in plants and algae. In a previous study, we isolated a PSI–LHCI–LHCII supercomplex containing both LHCI and LHCII from state 2 cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . In the present study, we isolated a PSI–LHCI–LHCII supercomplex associating with more LHCII complexes under a further optimized protocol. We determined its antenna size by three independent methods and revealed that the associated LHCIIs increased the antenna size by about 70 Chls and transferred light energy to the PSI core. Uniform labeling of total cellular proteins with ¹⁴C indicated that the PSI–LHCI–LHCII supercomplex contains 1.85 copies of LhcbM5 and CP29 and 1.29 copies of CP26. PSI–LHCI–LHCII also stably bound 0.4 copy of ferredoxin-NADP ⁺ oxidoreductase (FNR) that catalyzes light-induced electron transfer from PSI to NADP ⁺ in the presence of ferredoxin. We discuss the possible organization of these LHCIIs in the PSI–LHCI–LHCII supercomplex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalgae 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3alight harvesting complex 3alight intensity 3aphotosystem II 3aradionuclides 0aAntenna complex 0aIsotope labeling 0aPhosphorylation 0aPhotosystem I 0aState transitions1 aOkamuro, Akira1 aMinagawa, Jun1 aTakahashi, Yuichiro0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.1437-1449dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016600159300001800325520116900343592002801512650001301540650000901553650004401562650001501606650002001621650001901641700001601660700002001676700001701696700001901713773010801732856007501840852000901915655001201924IND60532803420221119113042.0160728e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053280342DNAL7 a10.1021/bm50127392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guang-Chen10aFully Biobased and Supertough Polylactide-Based Thermoplastic Vulcanizates Fabricated by Peroxide-Induced Dynamic Vulcanization and Interfacial Compatibilization  ap. 4260-4271.  aA fully biobased and supertough thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) consisting of polylactide (PLA) and a biobased vulcanized unsaturated aliphatic polyester elastomer (UPE) was fabricated via peroxide-induced dynamic vulcanization. Interfacial compatibilization between PLA and UPE took place during dynamic vulcanization, which was confirmed by gel measurement and NMR analysis. After vulcanization, the TPV exhibited a quasi cocontinuous morphology with vulcanized UPE compactly dispersed in PLA matrix, which was different from the pristine PLA/UPE blend, exhibiting typically phase-separated morphology with unvulcanized UPE droplets discretely dispersed in matrix. The TPV showed significantly improved tensile and impact toughness with values up to about 99.3 MJ/m³ and 586.6 J/m, respectively, compared to those of 3.2 MJ/m³ and 16.8 J/m for neat PLA, respectively. The toughening mechanisms under tensile and impact tests were investigated and deduced as massive shear yielding of the PLA matrix triggered by internal cavitation of VUPE. The fully biobased supertough PLA vulcanizate could serve as a promising alternative to traditional commodity plastics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3agels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyesters 3apolylactic acid 3athermoplastics1 aHe, Yi-Song1 aZeng, Jian-Bing1 aLi, Qiu-Tong1 aWang, Yu-Zhong0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 15, no. 11 p.4260-4271dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm50127393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245007900173300001600252520088400268592002801152650001201180650000901192650001101201650001101212650002001223650001301243650002001256650002001276650001001296650001501306650001201321650001101333650001601344650003701360650001201397651001701409653002301426653002001449653004901469653001701518700002301535700001801558700002701576700002001603773009501623856008901718852000901807655001201816IND60585831920221118035518.0190319e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorgo, Mohamed10aCredit constraints and cropland allocation decisions in rural Burkina Faso  ap. 666-674.  aThis paper examined farm households’ cropland allocation decisions under credit constraints in rural Burkina Faso. A fully observed recursive mixed-process model was used to correct for the endogeneity of credit in farm households’ land allocation decisions in a multi-cropping context. Estimating the model with survey data collected in 2011 using the conditional mixed-process estimator, the results showed that credit constraints negatively affect farm households’ decision to allocate land to maize and cotton production in rural Burkina Faso. In contrast, at the expense of maize and cotton, credit constraints encourage farm households to allocate more land to sorghum and millet. The results also showed that socio-demographic characteristics and the use of animal traction significantly determined farm households’ land allocation decisions in rural Burkina Faso.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acorn 3acotton 3acredit 3acrop production 3acropland 3adata collection 3adecision making 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3amillets 3amodels 3arural areas 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 3aBurkina Faso 0aCredit constraints 0aLand allocation 0aFully observed recursive mixed-process model 0aBurkina Faso1 aKuwornu, John K.M.1 aZahonogo, Pam1 aJatoe, John Baptist D.1 aEgyir, Irene S.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Jan., v. 70 p.666-674dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012100168300001800289520114800307592002801455650002101483650002201504650001701526650001501543650002501558650002201583650001301605650001001618650000901628650001101637650002101648650001501669650001301684650002201697650001401719653001201733653002901745653004001774700001901814700001901833700002501852700001601877773013601893856008702029852000902116655001202125IND60676628620221120044336.0200330e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067662862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Priya10aCrystal structure of Gig2 protein from Candida albicans provides a structural insight into DUF1479 family oxygenases  ap. 1272-1280.  aCandida albicans, GlcNAc inducible gene 2 (Gig2) is important for its virulence, oxidative stress adaptation and is supposed to be a part of the undefined GlcNAc metabolic network. On the basis of sequence homology, Gig2 is classified as a putative oxidoreductase of DUF1479 family (Domain of Unknown Function) with no reported structure and function. In this work, we have elucidated the crystal structure of Gig2 protein using X-ray crystallography at 1.7 Å resolution. Crystals were improved using successive macro-seeding technique. Structure was solved by molecular replacement using a template (PDBID: 2CSG) with a mere 27% identity with Gig2, followed by manual and automated model building. Gig2 exists as a monomer with a single large DUF1479 domain and is composed of a cupin like double stranded β-helix (DBSH) core fold with Iron (Fe) in the active site. This is the first report of DUF1479 family proteins which identifies and highlights its unique structural features. Crystal structure elucidation, structural comparisons, and docking studies proposes Gig2 as a non-heme Fe (II) containing 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aautomation 3abiochemical pathways 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3agenes 3airon 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygenases 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3avirulence 0aDUF1479 0aDouble stranded β-helix 0a2-Oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases1 aGautam, Gunjan1 aAnwar, Tamanna1 aGourinath, Samudrala1 aDatta, Asis0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 May 01, v. 150 p.1272-1280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010800169300001800277520172900295592002802024650001902052650001902071650001102090650001102101650002302112650001402135650001002149650001402159650001402173700001202187700001702199700005402216700005902270700005402329773011902383856008702502852000902589655001202598IND60688732120221121221336.0200416e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068873212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hengyu,10aTwo-Phase Transport Characteristic of Shale Gas and Water through Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Nanopores  ap. 4407-4420.  aPrevious attempts to characterize shale gas transport in nanopores are not fully successful due to the fact that the presence of water within shale reservoirs is generally overlooked. In addition, shale is known as a wettability-varying (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) rock depending on various components and maturity grades. Herein, toward this end, we performed a comprehensive study about two-phase transport characteristic of shale gas and water through hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopores by integrating the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and analytical models. Using MD simulations, we showed that water molecules prefer to accumulate at the walls (water film) in hydrophilic nanopores while form the water cluster at the center region of hydrophobic nanopores, which significantly alters the shale gas transport behavior. For hydrophilic nanopores, the existence of water film weakens the gas–walls collisions (slip effect), resulting in a viscosity dominant transport mechanism. In contrary, shale gas transport in hydrophobic nanopores is mainly contributed by slip effect where the gas–gas collisions (viscosity) is abated by the water cluster. On this basis, we proposed an analytical model to quantitatively depict the shale gas transport behavior in moist nanopores, which is well verified by MD simulations results. Particularly, according to our flow model, the gas transport capacity decreases to only 15% when mixing with 50% water molecules for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopores, which would be greatly overestimated by traditional models neglecting the presence of water molecules. The deep insights gained in this work will further the exploitation and development of shale reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amixing 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3ananopores 3ashale 3ashale gas 3aviscosity1 aYu, Hao1 aFan, JingCun1 aZhu, YinBo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9204-93001 aWang, Fengchao,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5954-38811 aWu, HengAn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0288-16170 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 34, no. 4 p.4407-4420dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04628naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245013200213500002200345520340100367592002803768650001703796650001203813650002603825650001603851650002303867650001103890650002303901653002403924653002403948653002803972653001704000700002304017700005804040773009404098856005304192852000904245655001204254IND60795548820221117210609.0221004e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1093982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpagnoli, Pauline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6105-658010aTowards a food safety culture improvement roadmap: Diagnosis and gap analysis through a conceptual framework as the first steps  aPre-press version  aThe food safety culture research field still remains limited in terms of the process needed to achieve food safety culture improvement. : This paper proposes a food safety culture diagnosis and gap analysis methodology, as the first two steps in the food safety culture improvement roadmap. The diagnosis identifies what dimensions are mature or underdeveloped, whilst the gap analysis reveals what caused some dimensions to obtain lower scores in the diagnosis. The assessment approach is different from previously described approaches that stop in the assessment phase, as it is specifically designed to form the basis for further food safety culture interventions. It includes all departments and hierarchical levels in a company, applies a multitude of different tools (subjective and objective, quantitative and qualitative) and is based on an encompassing conceptual framework, to be able to provide a credible, conceptually based, multilayered and multidimensional assessment of food safety culture maturity. The goal is not to obtain an estimation of the prevailing food safety culture maturity, but to achieve a detailed food safety culture analysis which includes the causes and reasons which led to the obtained maturity. A conceptual framework of food safety culture was developed by refining the model of De Boeck et al. (2017), using a mapping review. A mixed-method assessment was designed to evaluate a company's prevailing food safety culture (its building blocks and layers). Integration and interpretation of data collected in the mixed-method assessment was done through the proposed food safety culture gap analysis. The mixed-method assessment methodology and gap analysis were illustrated in a case study of a ready-to-eat meal producing company (SME, 73 employees, from which 13 managers). : The presented conceptual framework of food safety culture distinguishes three key building blocks, i.e. the food safety management system activities, the human-individual and the human-organizational building block, each containing multiple dimensions. The mixed-method assessment was designed as follows. A diagnostic tool was applied for the assessment of the food safety management system activities. The human-organizational building block was measured using the food safety climate self-assessment tool (De Boeck et al., 2015), a card-aided management interview and on-site evidence collection visits (observations, interviews and document analysis). The latter two tools are newly presented in this paper. The human-individual building block was assessed using validated self-assessment statements, complemented with four questions to evaluate employees' food safety knowledge objectively. The gap analysis based on the data collected in the mixed-method assessment revealed six important gaps in the prevailing food safety culture of the ready-to-eat meal producing company (case), relating to the following building blocks and embedded dimensions: FSMS activities: ‘control activities’, human-organizational building block: ‘commitment’, ‘adaptability’, ‘consistency’, ‘beliefs and values’ and ‘mission, vision and strategy’. This profound diagnosis methodology can be applied for the development of tailored improvement strategies (interventions), which is the next step in the improvement roadmap, to enhance the level of food safety culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adiagnostic techniques 3afood safety 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aready-to-eat foods 0aFood safety culture 0aImprovement roadmap 0aMixed-method assessment 0aGap analysis1 aJacxsens, Liesbeth1 aVlerick, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9624-10250 tFood control.g2022 Sept. 21,  p.109398-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.109398  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290500001500306520124200321592002801563650002901591650001701620650002501637650001401662650002201676650001301698650001101711650001201722650002601734650001601760650002001776650001501796650002501811650001601836650001301852653002501865700001801890700001801908700001701926700002001943773010201963856004802065852000902113655001202122IND50072203720221118123303.0140214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007220372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1424-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalem, Nidhal10aEffect of salinity on plant growth and biological activities of Carthamus tinctorius L. extracts at two flowering stages  ap. 433-445.  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study, we were interested in the effect of salt stress on phenolic and carotenoid contents, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of two varieties of Carthamus tinctorius (Jawhara and 104) flowers. For this purpose, C. tinctorius flowers from plants grown under four saline treatments (0, 5, 10 and 15 g/L NaCl) were collected at two development stages. As salinity increased up to 10 g/L, results showed that total phenols, flavonoids, condensed tannins and carotenoid contents increased with salinity. Such variability might be of great importance in terms of valorizing this plant as a source of naturally secondary metabolites. Furthermore, our results showed an enhancement of antioxidant activity which was evaluated by four different test systems (DPPH, beta-carotene-linoleic acid, chelating and reducing power assays) with increasing stress severity. Obtained results showed that, for the two varieties, salt effect was more pronounced at post flowering stage than full flowering one. The sensitivity test of the methanolic extracts of the harvested flowers was applied against seven human pathogenic bacteria and three yeast strains. Salinity reduced significantly the antimicrobial activity of flower extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aplant growth 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aflowering 3aproanthocyanidins 3asalinity 3ayeasts 3aflowers 3asecondary metabolites 3acarotenoids 3asodium chloride 3aflavonoids 3aantioxidant activity 3asalt stress 3abacteria 0adevelopmental stages1 aMsaada, Kamel1 aDhifi, Wissal1 aLimam, Ferid1 aMarzouk, Brahim0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.433-445dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1424-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012600163300001800289500001500307520124800322592002801570650001801598650004301616650002301659650001501682650002101697650001401718650005201732650001201784650001501796650002501811650001601836650002101852653001701873700001401890700001701904700001701921700001601938700001501954700001701969700001501986700001702001700001602018773009902034856008102133852000902214655001202223IND60439028920221119165518.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2499-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yufei10aDetection, discrimination and quantitation of 22 bluetongue virus serotypes using real-time RT-PCR with TaqMan MGB probes  ap. 2249-2258.  a2019-12-06  aBluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiological agent of bluetongue (BT) disease, a noncontagious insect-transmitted disease of international importance. To date, 26 BTV serotypes have been recognized worldwide. Methods to discriminate BTV serotypes in clinical samples are essential to epidemiological surveillance efforts and BTV vaccination programs. The BTV VP2 major outer capsid protein, encoded by genomic segment 2 (Seg-2), is the most highly variable BTV protein and is the primary determinant of the virus serotype. Here, we report the development of rapid and reliable real-time RT-PCR assays to detect and discriminate 22 BTV serotypes on the basis of VP2-encoding genomic sequences. Serotype-specific primers and probes detected only the targeted BTV serotype and displayed no cross-amplification of off-target BTV serotypes or other closely related Reoviridae and Bunyaviridae family members. The real-time RT-PCR assays developed were highly sensitive, and the majority of serotype-specific reactions could detect template when present at ≥10 copies. These BTV serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR assays represent a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification, differentiation and quantification of 22 BTV serotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoat proteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aetiological agents 3amonitoring 3aBluetongue virus 3aserotypes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3abluetongue 3anucleotide sequences 3avaccination 3aPeribunyaviridae 0aBunyaviridae1 aYang, Tao1 aXu, Qingyuan1 aSun, Encheng1 aLi, Junping1 aLv, Shuang1 aWang, Haixiu1 aZhang, Qin1 aZhang, Jikai1 aWu, Donglai0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Sept., v. 160, no. 9 p.2249-2258dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2499-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011600171300001600287520098400303592002801287650001001315650002401325650001001349650001601359650002001375650001101395650001101406650002901417650002101446650001001467650001401477650001601491653001801507653000801525653000801533653002101541653001701562653002301579653002601602700001801628700002001646773012501666856008501791852000901876655001201885IND60619590520221116144704.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061959052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerkech, Mohamed10aDeep leaning approach with colorimetric spaces and vegetation indices for vine diseases detection in UAV images  ap. 237-243.  aDetection of symptoms in grape leaves is a very important factor in preventing a serious disease. An epidemic spread in vineyards has huge economic consequences and therefore it is considered a major challenge for viticulture. Automatic detection of vine diseases can play an important role in addressing the issue of diseases management. This study deals with the problem of identifying infected areas of grapevines using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) images in the visible domain. In this paper we propose a method based on Convolutional neural network (CNN) and color information to detect symptoms in the vine yards. We studied and compared performances of CNNs using different color spaces, vegetation indices, as well as the combination of both information. The obtained results showed that CNNs with YUV color space combined with ExGR vegetation index, and CNNs with a combination of ExG, ExR, ExGR vegetation indices yield the best results with accuracy more than 95.8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aautomatic detection 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aeconomic impact 3agrapes 3aleaves 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation index 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 0aDeep learning 0aCNN 0aUAV 0aImage processing 0aColor spaces 0aVegetation indices 0aPrecision agriculture1 aHafiane, Adel1 aCanals, Raphael0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 155 p.237-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007300163300001800236520071400254592002800968650002300996650001401019650001301033700001501046700001601061700001301077700001801090700001501108700001901123773012001142856008201262852000901344655001201353IND60563017620221118063117.0170209e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b116432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Kaicong10aGeneral Applicable Frequency Map for the Amide-I Mode in β-Peptides  ap. 1069-1079.  aIn this work, a general applicable amide-I vibrational frequency map (GA map) for β-peptides in a number of common solvents was constructed, based on a peptide derivative, N-ethylpropionamide (NEPA). The map utilizes force fields at the ab initio computational level to accurately describe molecular structure and solute–solvent interactions, and also force fields at the molecular mechanics level to take into account long-range solute–solvent interactions. The results indicate that the GA map works reasonably for mapping the vibrational frequencies of the amide-I local-modes for β-peptides, holding promises for understanding the complicated infrared spectra of the amide-I mode in β-polypeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3amechanics 3asolvents1 aDu, Fenfen1 aZheng, Xuan1 aLiu, Jia1 aZheng, Renhui1 aZhao, Juan1 aWang, Jianping0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 120, no. 6 p.1069-1079dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b116433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03828naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001600192245016400208300001800372506007600390520162800466592002802094506003702122650003102159650001902190650003302209650001502242650002602257650001402283650003802297650001902335650003702354650002102391650002002412650001402432650001902446650001702465650001302482650004302495650001802538650001602556650001302572653001602585653001202601653002302613653002202636700001202658700001702670700001802687700001602705700002102721700001802742700001402760700002202774700001302796700001202809700002202821700001402843700002202857700001802879700001502897773009902912856008603011852000903097655001203106IND60531905420221207112442.0190319e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0382doi7 aPMC48036072pmcid7 a267213282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhenwu10aKey differences in B cell activation patterns and immune correlates among treated HIV-infected patients versus healthy controls following influenza vaccination  ap. 1945-1955.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is increasing recognition of the role of B cell dysfunction in HIV pathogenesis, but little is known about how these perturbations may influence responses to vaccinations.Healthy controls (n=16) and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated aviremic HIV-infected subjects (n=26) receiving standard-of-care annual influenza vaccinations were enrolled in the present study. Total bacterial 16S rDNA levels were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions in plasma. Serologic responses were characterized by ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI), and microneutralization, and cell-mediated responses were assessed by ELISPOT (antigen-specific IgG+ antibody-secreting cells (ASCs)) and flow cytometry at pre-vaccination (D0), day 7–10 (D7) and day 14–21 (D14) post-vaccination.Decreased peripheral CD4+ T cell absolute counts and increased frequencies of cycling and apoptotic B cells were found at baseline in HIV-infected subjects relative to healthy controls. In healthy controls, post-vaccination neutralizing activities were related to the frequencies of vaccine-mediated apoptosis and cycling of B cells, but not to CD4+ T cell counts. In patients, both baseline and post-vaccination neutralizing activities were directly correlated with plasma level of bacterial 16S rDNA. However, overall vaccine responses including antibody titers and fold changes were comparable or greater in HIV-infected subjects relative to healthy controls.B cell function correlates with measures of recall humoral immunity in response to seasonal influenza vaccination in healthy controls but not in ART-treated patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantibodies 3aantiretroviral agents 3aapoptosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3aneutralization 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHIV disease 0aB cells 0aAntibody responses 0aInfluenza vaccine1 aMa, Lei1 aZhang, Lumin1 aBarlow, Lisa,1 aWan, Zhuang1 aWarth, Stephanie1 aKilby, Andrew1 aGao, Yong1 aBhargava, Pallavi1 aLi, Zhen1 aWu, Hao1 aMeissner, Eric G.1 aLi, Zihai1 aKilby, J.

Pellets were observed at all locations visited and were generally most abundant (>1000m⁻² at the surface) on the backshores of beaches with a westerly aspect. Most pellets were disc-shaped or flattened cylinders and could be categorised as white, yellow, amber or brown. The polymeric matrix of all pellets analysed by infrared spectroscopy was polyethylene and the degree of yellowing or darkening was associated with an increase in the carbonyl index, hence extent of photo-oxidation or aging. Qualitatively, pellets are similar to those reported for other regions of the Mediterranean in surveys spanning three decades, suggesting that they are a general and persistent characteristic of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamber 3abeaches 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3apellets 3aphotooxidation 3apolyethylene 3asurveys 3awater pollution 3aMalta1 aHolmes, Luke0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.377-381dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2201057 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010900160300002200269500001900291520091500310592002801225650001401253650002201267650001101289650000901300650001501309650001101324650002001335650002501355650002801380650001001408653000901418653001501427653001601442653002201458653002001480653002401500700005701524700001801581700005401599700001201653700001401665700001801679700001501697700001601712700001601728700006201744700001901806700002001825700001901845700001801864700006301882700002201945700001801967700001901985700001702004700002102021700005302042700001602095700001502111700002002126700001802146700001702164700002002181700001802201700001702219700001702236700002002253700001802273700001302291700001602304700001702320700001802337700001402355700002002369700001802389700001602407700001202423700001902435700001902454700001902473700001702492700001802509700001502527700001302542700001902555700001802574700001202592700005802604700001702662710005902679773010302738856008302841852000902924655001202933IND60709373120221116142359.0210219e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070937312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Na10aLarge-Scale Comparative Analyses of Tick Genomes Elucidate Their Genetic Diversity and Vector Capacities  ap. 1328-1340.e13.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong arthropod vectors, ticks transmit the most diverse human and animal pathogens, leading to an increasing number of new challenges worldwide. Here we sequenced and assembled high-quality genomes of six ixodid tick species and further resequenced 678 tick specimens to understand three key aspects of ticks: genetic diversity, population structure, and pathogen distribution. We explored the genetic basis common to ticks, including heme and hemoglobin digestion, iron metabolism, and reactive oxygen species, and unveiled for the first time that genetic structure and pathogen composition in different tick species are mainly shaped by ecological and geographic factors. We further identified species-specific determinants associated with different host ranges, life cycles, and distributions. The findings of this study are an invaluable resource for research and control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestion 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3ahumans 3airon absorption 3apopulation structure 3areactive oxygen species 3aticks 0atick 0ametagenome 0ahematophagy 0agenetic diversity 0avector capacity 0atick-borne pathogen1 aWang, Jinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4909-27381 aShi, Wenqiang1 aDu, Lifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1402-29351 aSun, Yi1 aZhan, Wei1 aJiang, Jia-Fu1 aWang, Qian1 aZhang, Bing1 aJi, Peifeng1 aBell-Sakyi, Lesley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7305-04771 aCui, Xiao-Ming1 aYuan, Ting-Ting1 aJiang, Bao-Gui1 aYang, Wei-Fei1 aLam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9769-15271 aChang, Qiao-Cheng1 aDing, Shu-Jun1 aWang, Xian-Jun1 aZhu, Jin-Guo1 aRuan, Xiang-Dong1 aZhao, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0545-41941 aWei, Jia-Te1 aYe, Run-Ze1 aQue, Teng Cheng1 aDu, Chun-Hong1 aZhou, Yu-Hao1 aCheng, Jing Xia1 aDai, Pei-Fang1 aGuo, Wen-Bin1 aHan, Xiao-Hu1 aHuang, En-Jiong1 aLi, Lian-Feng1 aWei, Wei1 aGao, Yu-Chi1 aLiu, Jing-Ze1 aShao, Hong-Ze1 aWang, Xin1 aWang, Chong-Cai1 aYang, Tian-Ci1 aHuo, Qiu-Bo1 aLi, Wei1 aChen, Hai-Ying1 aChen, Shen-en,1 aZhou, Ling-Guo1 aNi, Xue-Bing1 aTian, Jun-Hua1 aSheng, Yue1 aLiu, Tao1 aPan, Yu-sheng,1 aXia, Luo-Yuan1 aLi, Jie1 aZhao, Fangqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6216-12351 aCao, Wu-Chun2 aTick Genome and Microbiome Consortium (TIGMIC)eauthor0 tCell.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 182, no. 5 p.1328-1340.e13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245014200177300001600319520096900335592002801304650001701332650001701349650002001366650002301386650001501409650001301424650002201437650001501459650002301474650002001497651001901517700001801536700001801554700002301572773009701595856008701692852000901779655001201788IND60088457320221121033025.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008845732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkins, Jonathan P.10aManagement of the marine environment: Integrating ecosystem services and societal benefits with the DPSIR framework in a systems approach  ap. 215-226.  aEver increasing and diverse use of the marine environment is leading to human-induced changes in marine life, habitats and landscapes, making necessary the development of marine policy that considers all members of the user community and addresses current, multiple, interacting uses. Taking a systems approach incorporating an understanding of The Ecosystem Approach, we integrate the DPSIR framework with ecosystem services and societal benefits, and the focus this gives allows us to create a specific framework for supporting decision making in the marine environment. Based on a linking of these three concepts, we present a set of basic postulates for the management of the marine environment and emphasise that these postulates should hold for marine management to be achieved. We illustrate these concepts using two case studies: the management of marine aggregates extraction in UK waters and the management of marine biodiversity at Flamborough Head, UK.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amarine environment 3awater pollution 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBurdon, Daryl1 aElliott, Mike1 aGregory, Amanda J.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.215-226dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01342naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002400185245006400209300001200273506007600285520026800361592002800629506003700657650002300694650001400717650001100731650002500742700001900767700002700786773010300813856007900916852000900995655001201004IND60119485320221207103352.0141214e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011948532DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-2082doi7 aPMC1534532pmcid7 a126200982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCañestro, Cristian10aSeeing chordate evolution through the Ciona genome sequence  ap. 622.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA draft sequence of the compact genome of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, a non-vertebrate chordate that diverged very early from other chordates, including vertebrates, illuminates how chordates originated and how vertebrate developmental innovations evolved.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCiona intestinalis 3aevolution 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences1 aBassham, Susan1 aPostlethwait, John H.,0 tGenome biology.g2003 Mar., v. 4, no. 3 p.622-622dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010300177300001800280520079100298592002801089650002301117650002001140650003301160650001601193650001901209650001101228650002501239650003201264700001801296700002201314700002201336700002501358773009901383856008101482852000901563655001201572IND60439029120221119165127.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2497-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Zyl, Leonardo Joaquim10aIdentification and characterization of a novel Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius bacteriophage, GVE3  ap. 2269-2282.  aThe study of extremophilic phages may reveal new phage families as well as different mechanisms of infection, propagation and lysis to those found in phages from temperate environments.

The genome size is 141,298 bp (G+C 29.6 %), making it the largest Geobacillus spp-infecting phage known. GVE3 appears to be most closely related to the recently described Bacillus anthracis phage vB_BanS_Tsamsa, rather than Geobacillus-infecting phages described thus far. Tetranucleotide usage deviation analysis supports this relationship, showing that the GVE3 genome sequence correlates best with B. anthracis and Bacillus cereus genome sequences, rather than Geobacillus spp genome sequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus thermoglucosidasius 3aGeobacillus 3abacteriophages 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences 3athermophilic microorganisms1 aSunda, Falone1 aTaylor, Mark Paul1 aCowan, Don Arthur1 aTrindade, Marla Iris0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Sept., v. 160, no. 9 p.2269-2282dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2497-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245009100178300001600269520075300285592002801038650002501066650001101091650002001102650002901122650001601151653002201167653001601189653003301205653001801238700002901256773009501285856008901380852000901469655001201478IND60585832320221118035423.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadowski, Arkadiusz10aFood and environmental function in world agriculture—Interdependence or competition?  ap. 578-583.  aThe paper discusses the implementation of the food and environmental function in agriculture. The author’s method to determine the amount of energy produced by agriculture was used. In 1961–2009 the amount of energy generated by agriculture all over the world increased more than the population, which means that the sector fulfilled the food function. Conducted research leds to the conclusion that on all continents the production of 1000kcal was accompanied by decreasing emission of greenhouse gases. There are relatively high ecological costs of agricultural energy production in less economically developed regions. This fact points to the need to diffuse progress both in terms of intensified production and pro-environmental activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3afood production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland policy 0aWorld agriculture 0aEnvironment 0aEmission of greenhouse gases 0aFood security1 aBaer-Nawrocka, Agnieszka0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.578-583dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300001800283520183600301592002802137650001602165650001402181650001502195650002302210650001702233650001602250650001002266650001002276650002202286650000902308650001402317650001402331650001902345650001902364650002202383650001402405650003102419653001702450653001902467653002902486653001502515653001902530653001902549700001202568700001802580700002002598700001402618700001402632700001902646700001602665700001702681700001902698700001902717773012502736856007402861852000902935655001202944IND60152144420221120204520.0150529e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015214442DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcu0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xian-Feng10aEctopic Expression of RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8.1 Confers Resistance to Fungal and Oomycete Pathogens in Arabidopsis  ap. 1484-1496.  aBroad-spectrum disease resistance is a highly valuable trait in plant breeding and attracts special attention in research. The Arabidopsis gene locus RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8) contains two adjacent homologous genes, RPW8.1 and RPW8.2 , and confers broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. Remarkably, the RPW8.2 protein is specifically localized to the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) encasing the feeding structure of powdery mildew whereby RPW8.2 activates haustorium-targeted defenses. Here, we show that ectopic expression of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged RPW8.1 from the native promoter leads to unique cell death lesions and enhances resistance to virulent fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause powdery mildew and downy mildew diseases, respectively. In powdery mildew-infected plants, RPW8.1–YFP accumulates at higher levels in the mesophyll cells underneath the infected epidermal cells where RPW8.2–YFP is mainly expressed. This cell type-preferential protein accumulation pattern largely correlates with that of H ₂O ₂ accumulation, suggesting that RPW8.1 may spatially collaborate with RPW8.2 in activation of resistance to powdery mildew. Interestingly, when ectopically expressed from the RPW8.2 promoter, RPW8.1–YFP is also targeted to the EHM of powdery mildew and the transgenic plants display resistance to both powdery mildew and downy mildew. Using YFP as a reporter, we further reveal that the RPW8.1 promoter is constitutively active but induced to higher levels in cells at the infection site, whereas the RPW8.2 promoter is activated specifically in cells at the infection site. Taken together, our results suggest that RPW8.1 (and its promoter) is functionally distinct from RPW8.2 and may have a higher potential in engineering broad-spectrum resistance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOomycetes 3acell death 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3aengineering 3afungi 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aloci 3amesophyll 3apathogens 3aplant breeding 3apowdery mildew 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence 3ayellow fluorescent protein 0aDowny mildew 0aEpidermal cell 0aExtrahaustorial membrane 0aHaustorium 0aMesophyll cell 0aPowdery mildew1 aLi, Yan1 aSun, Jin-Long1 aWang, Ting-Ting1 aFan, Jing1 aLei, Yang1 aHuang, Yan-Yan1 aXu, Yong-Ju1 aZhao, Ji-Qun1 aXiao, Shunyuan1 aWang, Wenming,0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.1484-1496dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005100153245016000204300001800364520147600382592002801858650001401886650001101900650000901911650002101920650002501941650002101966650001201987650001101999650001502010650001702025650001602042650001502058651002002073700005302093700001802146700001902164700002602183700002202209773011902231856008802350852000902438655001202447IND60688732420221121221238.0200423e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068873242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4110-747210aGas Production from Hot Water Circulation through Hydraulic Fractures in Methane Hydrate-Bearing Sediments: THC-Coupled Simulation of Production Mechanisms  ap. 4448-4465.  aMethane hydrates, widely found in permafrost and deep marine sediments, have great potential as a future energy source. Conventional production schemes perform poorly for challenging hydrate reservoirs with low permeability. We propose an efficient production scheme by combining hydraulic fracturing from horizontal wells and hot water circulation through fractures. A fully coupled thermo-hydro-chemical (THC) model is developed to simulate the key physical processes during gas production from a hydrate reservoir representative of typical geological settings in Shenhu, South China Sea. We found that the gas production process has two distinct stages divided by thermal breakthrough: a relatively short prebreakthrough stage and a postbreakthrough stage yielding stable gas production. Heat advection along and near the hydraulic fracture dominates the prebreakthrough stage, whereas conduction-driven thermal recovery in the volume around fractures dominates the postbreakthrough stage. We identified that the steady-state injection temperature has a strong effect on the performance of the proposed scheme while the fluid mass circulation rate has a moderate impact beyond a threshold. The proposed scheme proves to be efficient and robust over a range of reservoir conditions with respect to initial hydrate saturation and intrinsic permeability, including their spatial heterogeneities, thereby offering a promising solution for challenging reservoir conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahorizontal wells 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amarine sediments 3amethane 3amodels 3apermafrost 3apermeability 3atemperature 3awater flow 3aSouth China Sea1 aLiu, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1149-30341 aFu, Pengcheng1 aWhite, Mark D.1 aSettgast, Randolph R.1 aMorris, Joseph P.0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Mar. 23, v. 34, no. 4 p.4448-4465dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245010800220300001600328520195200344592002802296650001702324650002302341650001102364650003402375650002202409650001302431650001102444650001102455650000902466650001602475650001302491650002602504651001402530653001102544653002002555653002602575653001402601700002702615700002602642700002602668773009602694856008602790852000902876655001202885IND60531905620221120160320.0190319e20160127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrellano, Pablo Wenceslao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8911-663X10aCost-utility analysis of dengue vaccination in a country with heterogeneous risk of dengue transmission  ap. 616-621.  aDengue is one of the most important vector-borne diseases worldwide, and annually, nearly 390 million people are infected and 500,000 patients are hospitalized for severe dengue. Argentina has great variability in the risk of dengue transmission due to eco-climatic reasons. Currently no vaccines are available for dengue even though several vaccines are under development.The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a dengue vaccine in a country with heterogeneous risk of dengue transmission like Argentina.The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective using a Markov model that included both vaccine and disease parameters. Utility was measured as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the vaccination was expressed in 2014 American dollars (US$) per DALY averted. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty in model outcomes, and a threshold analysis was conducted to estimate the highest possible price of the vaccine.The ICER of the vaccination program was found to be US$ 5714 per DALY averted. This value is lower than 3 times the per capita GDP of Argentina (US$ 38,619 in 2014); 54.9% of the simulations were below this value. If a vaccination program would be implemented the maximum vaccine price per dose has to be US$1.49 for a vaccination at national level or US$28.72 for a targeted vaccination in high transmission areas.These results demonstrate that vaccination against dengue would be cost-effective in Argentina, especially if carried out in predetermined regions at high risk of dengue transmission. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there was considerable uncertainty around the ICER value. The influence of variations in vaccine efficacy, cost and other important parameters are discussed in the text.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3acost effectiveness 3adengue 3adisability-adjusted life year 3amodel uncertainty 3apatients 3apeople 3aprices 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avector-borne diseases 3aArgentina 0aDengue 0aDengue vaccines 0aCost-utility analysis 0aArgentina1 aReynoso, Julieta Itati1 aStahl, Hans-Christian1 aSalomon, Oscar Daniel0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 27, v. 34, no. 5 p.616-621dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245012600198300001800324520175900342592002802101650001502129650002702144650001402171650002302185650002402208650002402232650002302256650001502279650001202294650001302306650001302319650002102332650001502353650002202368650001602390651001802406700001302424700001402437700001602451700002802467773013202495856008202627852000902709655001202718IND60594637320221121051209.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1612-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasc, A.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8369-493010aCricket calling communities as an indicator of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata in an insular biodiversity hotspot  ap. 1099-1111.  aInvasive species are a major concern for the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity but are difficult to mitigate. Upstream solutions to prevent their impact, including their detection, are needed. Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant living in vagile supercolonies, is especially hard to track and is a major threat for tropical ecosystems and local animal communities. As part of such tropical communities, crickets are sensitive to ecological conditions, easy to collect, detectable and identifiable through their species-specific calls. Here, we evaluated the use of an acoustic community of crickets as an indicator of the presence of W. auropunctata in New Caledonia. We evaluated the dominance of the crickets in the soundscape, describe the cricket community structure and diversity along a shrubland to forest gradient, characterize these cricket communities structure and diversity in the light of ongoing invasion by W. auropunctata, and identify cricket species’ indicators of the invasion. Acoustic recordings collected on 24 sites were described using human-listening and spectrographic visualization. The results demonstrated a clear dominance of the cricket group in the New Caledonian nocturnal soundscapes. Each habitat harbored a specific acoustic cricket community related to specific environmental attributes including vegetation height, daily variation of humidity and temperature. The presence of W. auropunctata was significantly associated with a lower cricket acoustic activity and species richness at night. Of the 19 species detected, four nocturnal species were identified as indicator of non-invaded forests and preforests. This work supports the use of acoustic as an alternative method to detect invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3aWasmannia auropunctata 3aacoustics 3aanimal communities 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3ainvasive species 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aNew Caledonia1 aAnso, J.1 aSueur, J.1 aJourdan, H.1 aDesutter-Grandcolas, L.0 tBiological invasions.g2018 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1099-1111dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1612-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010900174300001600283520168500299592002801984650002602012650001602038650001902054650001402073650001202087650001002099650001802109650001302127650002502140650001602165650001202181650002802193651001102221653001302232653002202245653001802267653003302285653002002318653003102338700003202369700002102401773009502422856008902517852000902606655001202615IND60585832420221118035519.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058583242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorais, Manoela10aUsing the reasoned action approach to understand Brazilian successors’ intention to take over the farm  ap. 445-452.  aFamily farming is the predominant form of farm ownership in many countries and it plays an important role in global food security. In family farming, farm transfer usually occurs intergenerational and, therefore, the survival of family farming depends on the availability of a successor within the family. However, an ageing farmer population and out-migration of rural areas characterizes the agricultural sector in many countries, including Brazil. Together, the out-migration and the ageing of farmers are considered as barriers to a more sustainable agriculture and land use. This study used the reasoned action approach (RAA) as a framework to identify the impact of psychological factors, socioeconomic and farm characteristics on Brazilian successors’ intention to take over the farm. The RAA hypothesizes that intention is determined by three psychological constructs: attitude, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control. A survey with 227 potential successors was conducted. Potential successors were recruited via snowball sampling, as this population is hard to reach. Results show that the intention of potential successors in taking over the farm was manly determined by their positive evaluations of taking over the farm (attitude), followed by their positive perceptions about their own capability in taking over the farm (perceived behavioral control), and their perceptions about the social pressure to take over the farm (perceived norms). Moreover, farm size is positively correlated with potential successors’ intention to take over the farm, indicating that the larger the farm is, the higher the intention of potential successors to take it over.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3acorrelation 3afarm ownership 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3afood security 3aland use 3apsychosocial factors 3arural areas 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3aBrazil 0aAttitude 0aFarmer succession 0aFarm transfer 0aPerceived behavioral control 0aPerceived norms 0aTheory of planned behavior1 aBorges, João Augusto Rossi1 aBinotto, Erlaine0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.445-452dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011100160300001600271500001400287520079900301592002801100650002401128650002001152650001601172650000901188650001501197650001501212650002301227650001301250651001001263653002101273653001701294653002601311700002801337700001601365700002401381700002201405773014901427856007701576852000901653655001201662IND60710114420221122052904.0200908e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071011442DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.

People in developing countries like Bangladesh still have a higher risk of lead exposure. Previous research has suggested that the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) genotype can modify lead toxicity and individual susceptibility. As children are more susceptible to lead-induced toxicity, this study investigated whether the ALAD genotype influenced urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (U-ALA) among children exposed to environmental lead in Bangladesh.Subjects were elementary schoolchildren from a semi-urban industrialized area in Bangladesh. A total of 222 children were studied. Blood and urine were collected to determine ALAD genotypes, blood lead levels and urinary aminolevulinic acid (U-ALA).The mean BPb level was 9.7µg/dl for the study children. BPb was significantly positively correlated with hemoglobin (p<0.01). In total, allele frequency for ALAD 1 and 2 was 0.83 and 0.17 respectively. The mean U-ALA concentration was lower in ALAD1-2/2-2 carriers than ALAD1-1 carriers for boys (p=0.001). But for girls, U-ALA did not differ significantly by genotype (p=0.26). When U-ALA was compared by genotype at the same exposure level in a multiple linear regression analysis, boys who were ALAD1-2/2-2 carriers still had a lower level of U-ALA compared to ALAD1-1carriers.This study provides information about the influence of ALAD polymorphism and its association with U-ALA in Bangladeshi children. Our results indicate that the ALAD1-2/2-2 genotype may have a protective effect in terms of U-ALA for environmentally lead exposed boys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminolevulinic acid 3ablood 3aboys 3achildren 3acorrelation 3adeveloping countries 3aelementary students 3aexcretion 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3agirls 3ahemoglobin 3aindustrialization 3alead 3apollutants 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atoxicity 3aurine 3aBangladesh 0aBPb 0aHb 0aALAD 0aALA 0aU-ALA 0aHPLC 0aICP-MS 0aPCR–RFLP 0aBlood lead level 0aALAD polymorphism 0aUrinary ALA 0aChildren 0aBangladesh1 aFurusawa, Hana1 aAhmad, Sk.

Inactivation of rabies virus is a critical step in the production of vaccines and other research reagents. Beta-propiolactone (βPL); the currently used inactivating agent for rabies virus is expensive and proved to be carcinogenic in animals. This study aimed to investigate the ability of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to irreversibly inactivate rabies virus without affecting its antigenicity and immunogenicity in pursuit of finding safe, effective and inexpensive alternative inactivating agents. H2O2 3% rapidly inactivated a Vero cell adapted fixed rabies virus strain designated as FRV/K within 2h of exposure without affecting its antigenicity or immunogenicity. No residual infectious virus was detected and the H2O2-inactivated vaccine proved to be safe and effective when compared with the same virus harvest inactivated with the classical inactivating agent βPL. Mice immunized with H2O2-inactivated rabies virus produced sufficient level of antibodies and were protected when challenged with lethal CVS virus. These findings reinforce the idea that H2O2 can replace βPL as inactivating agent for rabies virus to reduce time and cost of inactivation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aantibodies 3ahydrogen peroxide 3avaccines 3amice 3aviruses 3aimmune response 3apathogens 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aImmunity 0aRabies 0aRabies virus 0aInactivation 0aVaccine1 aAli, Amal E.1 aBoseila, Abeer A.1 aAmin, Magdy A.0 tVaccine.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 34, no. 6 p.798-802dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011700166300001800283520146700301592002801768650003201796650002201828650001801850650000901868650001401877650002401891650001101915650001301926651001301939700001701952700001601969700001801985773014202003856008402145852000902229655001202238IND60123436820221120083811.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343682DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9438632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRugg, M. L.10aValidation of Annuli Formation in Pectoral Fin Rays from Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Lower Platte River, Nebraska  ap. 1028-1032.  aFish age is commonly estimated by counting bands on calcified structures. Age estimates are used to calculate information on population dynamics such as growth, mortality, and recruitment. Pectoral fin rays are the most frequently used structure to age sturgeon species, yet little work has been done to validate annuli formation. We collected Shovelnose Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus monthly from the lower Platte River, Nebraska, during 2011 and 2012 and removed the leading, left pectoral fin ray from each fish captured. We used marginal increment analysis to assess the validity of annual deposition of growth marks on pectoral fin rays. There were two complete cycles of increasing and decreasing increment values between March and November within each year. Mean marginal increments showed minimal peaks in March, July, and October followed by a decrease in increment length during April, September, and November. However, mean marginal increments were similar between months in both years. These results suggest there is no discernible pattern in growth ring deposition for Shovelnose Sturgeon in the lower Platte River and that their use for age and growth analyses would likely lead to biased estimates. Inaccuracies in age assignment can lead to errors when calculating population dynamic parameters and, ultimately, misguided management decisions. We recommend that alternate methods for estimating the ages of Shovelnose Sturgeon be explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaphirhynchus platorynchus 3aage determination 3aage structure 3afins 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asturgeon 3aNebraska1 aHamel, M.

The activity intake, effective dose and cancer risk was found lesser than international guidelines and the seafood intake was considered to be safe for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3afood intake 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alead 3anuclear power 3apolonium 3apower plants 3aradionuclides 3arisk 3aseafoods 3awater pollution 3aIndia1 aGodwin Wesley, S.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.399-404dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245009200212300001800304520177100322592002802093650003102121650002002152650002002172650001602192650000902208650001502217650002402232650001402256650001802270650001802288650001502306650002202321650001102343650001502354650002602369650001002395650001202405650003302417650001502450650001002465651001802475700002202493773013202515856008202647852000902729655001202738IND60594637520221121051240.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1630-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisichelli, NicholasA.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7031-703610aWeeds, worms, and deer: positive relationships among common forest understory stressors  ap. 1337-1348.  aBiotic global change agents, such as non-native plants (‘weeds’), non-native earthworms (‘worms’), and overabundant herbivores (white-tailed ‘deer’), can be major stressors in the forest understory. The status and relationships among these global change stressors across large spatial extents and under naturally varying conditions are poorly understood. Here, through an observational study using a network of U.S. National Park Service forest health monitoring plots (n = 350) from eight parks in seven northeastern states, we modeled causal pathways among global change stressors through model selection in a structural equation (SEM) framework. Weeds, worms, and, deer were common across all parks in the study—46% of plots had non-native plants, 42% of plots had evidence of earthworms, and all parks had plots with high deer browse damage. All biotic global change stressors were significantly and positively correlated with one another (all Spearman rank correlations ≥ 0.44). Consequently, 28% of plots had a combination of earthworms absent, low deer browse, and no non-native plants, and 29% of plots included earthworms, non-native plants, and moderate or greater browse damage. Through SEM, we found strong support for pathways among global change stressors, e.g., deer browse positively influenced earthworm presence and both deer and earthworms promoted non-native plants. Warmer air temperatures and higher soil pH also facilitated non-natives. This research highlights the tremendous multipronged management challenge for areas already experiencing the combined effects of weeds, worms, and deer and the future vulnerability of other areas as temperatures warm and conditions become more amenable to biotic global change stressors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aU.S. National Park Service 3aair temperature 3abrowsing damage 3acorrelation 3adeer 3aearthworms 3aecological invasion 3aequations 3aforest health 3aglobal change 3aherbivores 3aintroduced plants 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3aparks 3asoil pH 3astructural equation modeling 3aunderstory 3aweeds 3aUnited States1 aMiller, KathrynM.0 tBiological invasions.g2018 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1337-1348dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1630-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245015000204300001800354520173000372592002802102650001702130650001702147650002802164650001602192650002102208650002402229650002402253650002602277650002102303650002102324650001502345650003102360650001102391650001102402650002302413650001402436650002302450650000902473650001102482700002402493700001902517700002302536700002202559700002302581773013202604856008202736852000902818655001202827IND60594637620221121051216.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1629-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichter, Luise1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4891-926514aThe very hungry amphipod: the invasive Dikerogammarus villosus shows high consumption rates for two food sources and independent of predator cues  ap. 1321-1335.  aThe invasion of the Ponto–Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus in European rivers is assumed to reduce macroinvertebrate diversity and to alter ecosystem functions. D. villosus shows an extraordinarily flexible feeding behavior including the ability to use various food sources. On the other hand, its response to predation risk seems to depend on environmental factors. To evaluate the ecological function of D. villosus, we estimated the daily food consumption for different food sources and analyzed potential effects of predator avoidance behavior on feeding. D. villosus consumption of willow leaves or chironomid larvae was quantified in 24-h laboratory experiments with and without kairomones of the European bullhead (Cottus gobio). Consumption rates were estimated based on gut content and gut evacuation rate under semi-natural laboratory conditions enabling the animals to feed over the whole time of the evacuation rate experiment. We observed very high evacuation rates and consequently high consumption rates up to 89% of body weight per day. Consumption rates differed significantly between food sources: D. villosus ingested more leaves than chironomid larvae. In contrast, predator cues did not affect the feeding of D. villosus. This might be explained by its strong refuge affinity and probably benefits its successful invasion. A comparison of the estimated consumption rates with results of an own consumption experiment (and other studies) under more artificial conditions indicated that more natural conditions result in higher consumption rates. Consequently, feeding rates from highly artificial experiments should be used with great caution to assess the ecosystem function of D. villosus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aCottus gobio 3aDikerogammarus villosus 3abody weight 3adigestive system 3aecological function 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3afeeding behavior 3afood consumption 3akairomones 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amacroinvertebrates 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3arisk 3arivers1 aSchwenkmezger, Lisa1 aBecker, Jochen1 aWinkelmann, Carola1 aHellmann, Claudia1 aWorischka, Susanne0 tBiological invasions.g2018 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1321-1335dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1629-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003000191245016500221300001600386506007600402520173400478592002802212506003702240650000802277650001002285650001402295650001302309650002702322650001402349650001702363650000902380650001202389650001102401650001502412650001202427650003702439650001402476650002402490650002102514653001702535653001602552653001702568700002502585700002102610700002602631700002002657700001902677700001602696700001902712773008902731856008402820852000902904655001202913IND60544848120221207121820.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0472doi7 aPMC42626372pmcid7 a254606302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJedrychowski, Wiesław A.10aDepressed height gain of children associated with intrauterine exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals: The cohort prospective study  ap. 141-147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFetal exposure to environmental toxicants may program the development of children and have long-lasting health impacts. The study tested the hypothesis that depressed height gain in childhood is associated with prenatal exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals (lead and mercury).The study sample comprised 379 children born to non-smoking mothers among whom a total of 2011 height measurements were carried out over the 9-year follow-up period. Prenatal airborne PAH exposure was assessed by personal air monitoring of the mother in the second trimester of pregnancy and heavy metals were measured in cord blood. At the age of 3 residential air monitoring was done to evaluate the level of airborne PAH, and at the age 5 the levels of heavy metals were measured in capillary blood.The effect estimates of prenatal PAH exposure on height growth over the follow-up were adjusted in the General Estimated Equation (GEE) models for a wide set of relevant covariates. Prenatal exposure to airborne PAH showed a significant negative association with height growth, which was significantly decreased by 1.1cm at PAH level above 34.7ng/m3 (coeff.=−1.07, p=0.040). While prenatal lead exposure was not significantly associated with height restriction, the effect of mercury was inversely related to cord blood mercury concentration above 1.2μg/L (coeff.=−1.21, p=0.020),The observed negative impact of prenatal PAH exposure on height gain in childhood was mainly mediated by shorter birth length related to maternal PAH exposure during pregnancy. The height gain deficit associated with prenatal mercury exposure was not seen at birth, but the height growth was significantly slower at later age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3ablood 3achildhood 3achildren 3aenvironmental exposure 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amothers 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apregnancy 3aprospective studies 3atoxic substances 0aPrenatal PAH 0aHeight gain 0aHeavy metals1 aPerera, Frederica P.1 aMajewska, Renata1 aMrozek-Budzyn, Dorota1 aMroz, Elżbieta1 aRoen, Emily L.1 aSowa, Agata1 aJacek, Ryszard0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Jan., v. 136 p.141-147dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009100167300001800258520163300276592002801909650003201937650003101969650002102000650002402021650000902045650001502054650002302069650001302092650001502105650001202120651001902132700002002151700002402171700002002195700002202215700002102237700001802258773013202276856008202408852000902490655001202499IND60594637720221121051314.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1624-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera, JoséM.10aWater guns affect abundance and behavior of bigheaded carp and native fish differently  ap. 1243-1255.  aWater guns have shown the potential to repel nuisance aquatic organisms. This study examines the effects of exposure to a 1966.4 cm³ seismic water gun array (two guns) on the abundance and behavior of Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Silver Carp H. molitrix (collectively referred to as bigheaded carp) and native fishes (e.g., Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus). Water guns were deployed in a channel that connects the Illinois River to backwater quarry pits that contained a large transient population of bigheaded carp. To evaluate the effect of water guns, mobile side-looking split-beam hydroacoustic surveys were conducted before, during and between replicated water gun firing periods. Water guns did not affect abundance of bigheaded carp, but abundance of native fish detected during the firing treatment was 43 and 34% lower than the control and water guns off treatments, respectively. The proximity of bigheaded carp to the water gun array was similar between the water guns on and water guns off treatments. In contrast, the closest detected native fish were detected farther from the water guns during the water guns on treatment (mean ± SE, 32.38 ± 3.32 m) than during the water guns off treatment (15.04 ± 1.59 m). The water gun array had a greater impact on native fish species than on bigheaded carp. Caution should be taken to the extrapolation of these results to other fish species and to fish exposed to water guns in different environments (e.g., reduced shoreline interaction) or exposure to a larger array of water guns, or for use of water guns for purposes other than a barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aIctiobus bubalus 3aecological invasion 3afish 3ageophysics 3aindigenous species 3aquarries 3ashorelines 3asurveys 3aIllinois River1 aGlover, DavidC.1 aKocovsky, PatrickM.1 aGarvey, JamesE.1 aGaikowski, MarkP.1 aJensen, NathanR.1 aAdams, RyanF.0 tBiological invasions.g2018 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1243-1255dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1624-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006900173300001800242520114900260592002801409650002201437650002001459650002301479650001701502650002101519650002001540650001301560650001101573650001101584700001701595700002201612700002201634773012701656856008401783852000901867655001201876IND60123437020221119080426.0150325e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343702DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9446792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudnik, Richard R.10aAssessment of Paddlefish Reintroduction into Allegheny Reservoir  ap. 1055-1062.  aGillnetting and radiotelemetry were used to evaluate the reintroduction of Paddlefish Polyodon spathula into Allegheny Reservoir, New York–Pennsylvania. Gillnetting produced 86 total captures over 6,943 h of effort in the spring and early summer of 2008–2011. Forty-four of these individuals received implanted radio transmitters and were tracked from May 2008 to August 2011. Paddlefish showed a strong preference for reservoir sections where depths ranged from 6 to 18 m; only one individual was located in water greater than 18 m in depth. One sexually mature Paddlefish was identified, but telemetry data showed no evidence of reproduction, with only one individual making use of available riverine habitat that was predicted to be ideal for spawning. Paddlefish were susceptible to passage through Kinzua Dam: 46% of radio-tracked individuals left the reservoir during the study period. Continued efforts to evaluate Paddlefish reintroduction in Allegheny Reservoir should now focus on (1) assessing natural reproduction and (2) determining movement and survival through Kinzua Dam.

We have used a Ecopath-with-Ecosim model to hypothesize an invasion by lionfish and to predict the likely impact of this potential generalist mesopredator in a subtropical food-web model. With thirty-three functional groups, the initial Ecopath model was balanced with a low biomass of lionfish (0.07 t/km²). In Ecosim, three scenarios of different vulnerability settings for the linkages between the introduced fish and its prey were tested, representing the default setting, a top-down control, and an extreme top-down control. The scenarios were tested using different assumptions on the ability of the invasive fish to change the proportions of prey consumed according to prey availability. Our model predicted that the hypothesized lionfish invasion would have a strong impact on this subtropical marine food web: (1) by reducing prey populations and, consequently, food for native predators, and; (2) by predating on key species, causing direct impacts and possibly cascading trophic effects. Reef fish were the most affected, including some groups ecologically and economically important, like lutjanids and groupers. However, some adaptations in the fishing strategy of fishermen are expected which may affect other fish groups. Stakeholders should be warned of the potential ecological and socio-economic impacts that may arise from a lionfish invasion and various strategies and policy options should be immediately developed and applied (1) to prevent the arrival and establishment of the lionfish, and; (2) to make the ecosystem more resilient to this and other possible exotic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterois volitans 3aaquatic food webs 3abiomass 3aecological invasion 3afishermen 3agrouper 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3amoieties 3apredators 3aprediction 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3aBrazil1 ada Rocha, RosanaMoreira1 aBornatowski, Hugo1 aRobert, Maurício deCastro1 aAinsworth, Cameron0 tBiological invasions.g2018 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.1257-1274dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1625-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245014500211300001600356520142900372592002801801650001601829650002101845650001801866650002501884650001601909650001601925650002301941650001401964650002401978650002102002650001402023650001202037650004302049650001302092650001602105653001302121653002102134653001502155653001802170653000802188653002402196653002302220700001902243700002502262700002202287700002202309773009602331856008602427852000902513655001202522IND60531906020221120164627.0190319e20160127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Bikramjit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5144-263X10aOral vaccination of first-feeding Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., confers greater protection against yersiniosis than immersion vaccination  ap. 599-608.  aYersinia ruckeri is a ubiquitous pathogen of finfish capable of causing major mortalities in farmed fish stocks. It can be transmitted vertically from parent to progeny as well as horizontally in the water column from both clinically infected fish and asymptomatic carriers, and is consequently capable of infecting fish at early stages of development. Immunisation strategies that can protect small fry are therefore critical for the effective management of fish health, as is the ability to detect covertly infected fish. In this study, first-feeding Atlantic salmon fry (<0.5g) were immunised either by oral administration of a microencapsulated Y. ruckeri vaccine formulation (0.38g initial weight), or via immersion in bacterin suspension (0.26g), with and without a booster immersion vaccination at 1g size. Protection in groups receiving only immersion immunisation did not differ significantly from untreated controls when challenged with Y. ruckeri at approximately 5g size, while orally immunised fish were significantly better protected than untreated controls (F=4.38, df=4,10, P=0.026), with RPS varying between 29.4% (ORAL) and 51% (ORAL+DIP). A quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to successfully detect covertly infected fish among challenge survivors, indicating more than 50% of surviving fish in each group were infected with no significant differences between immunised fish and untreated controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aYersinia ruckeri 3acarrier state 3adevelopmental stages 3afarmed fish 3afish health 3amicroencapsulation 3amortality 3aoral administration 3aoral vaccination 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avaccines 3ayersiniosis 0aS. salar 0aOral vaccination 0aY. ruckeri 0aFirst feeding 0aFry 0aMucosal vaccination 0aMicroencapsulation1 aNguyen, Thu D.1 aCrosbie, Philip B.B.1 aNowak, Barbara F.1 aBridle, Andrew R.0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 27, v. 34, no. 5 p.599-608dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001800271520127200289592002801561650002101589650001901610650002501629650002501654650002901679650001401708650001001722650002001732650001201752650001701764650002401781650001601805650000901821650001401830650002001844650003601864650002401900650003601924650002401960650001201984700002801996700002102024700001902045700002602064773009902090856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60439029820221119165038.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2507-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStruzik, Justyna10aModulation of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling by ectromelia virus in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages  ap. 2301-2314.  aMacrophages are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a crucial role in the innate immune response and may be involved in both clearance and spread of viruses. Stimulation of macrophages via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) results in activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. In this work, we show modulation of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling by a member of the family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus – ectromelia virus (ECTV) – in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. ECTV interfered with p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation induced by TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) (TLR3) and diacylated lipopeptide Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6). We observed that ECTV modulates phosphorylation of Ser32 of inhibitor of κB (IκBα) and Ser536 of p65. Interference of ECTV with TLR signaling pathways implied that proinflammatory cytokine synthesis was inhibited. Our studies provide new insights into the strategies of proinflammatory signaling modulation by orthopoxviruses during their replication cycle in immune cells. Understanding important immune interactions between viral pathogens and APCs might contribute to the identification of drug targets and the development of vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEctromelia virus 3aIKappaB kinase 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantigen-presenting cells 3acytokines 3adrugs 3ainnate immunity 3aligands 3alipopeptides 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3apathogens 3aphosphorylation 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avaccine development 3aviruses1 aSzulc-Dąbrowska, Lidia1 aPapiernik, Diana1 aWinnicka, Anna1 aNiemiałtowski, Marek0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Sept., v. 160, no. 9 p.2301-2314dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2507-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010600175300001400281520123600295592002801531650002001559650002901579650002201608650001701630650001201647650002101659650001301680650001201693650001801705650001401723653001201737653001101749653001201760653001601772653001301788700002501801700002801826773008701854856008401941852000902025655001202034IND60544848320221120175539.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer-Pinto, Mariana14aThe matrix influences direct and indirect effects of an anthropogenic disturbance on marine organisms  ap. 15-20.  aThe magnitude and direction of direct and indirect effects of disturbances can be context-dependent, with the matrix (surrounding habitat) in which populations are embedded either mitigating or worsening the impacts of disturbances. Chemical disturbances are particularly harmful and can affect organisms directly or indirectly. We used bleach, a common stressor in marine systems, to test hypotheses about direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic disturbances on intertidal grazers and the influence of the surrounding macro-algal matrix on such effects. We manipulated the contaminant, food (biofilm) and surrounding macro-algal matrix. Fewer limpets were found in contaminated areas. Bleach had a strong direct negative effect on limpets and caused a reduction in biofilm food, indirectly affecting limpets. This effect was strongest in the presence of macro-algal matrix. Anthropogenic disturbances can have major consequences via direct and indirect effects on key interacting species. We showed that such effects are, however, context-dependent. Capsule: Pollution is a major driver of biodiversity declines. We show that direct and indirect effects of contaminants on organisms depend on the context in which they occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic organisms 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3ableaching agents 3ahabitats 3alimpets 3alittoral zone 3apollution 0aBiofilm 0aBleach 0aGrazers 0aContaminant 0aLimpets.1 aUnderwood, Antony J.1 aMarzinelli, Ezequiel M.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2015 Jan., v. 136 p.15-20dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012600168300001500294520081200309592002801121650001901149650002001168650001301188650002501201650001901226653002301245653001801268653000901286653000901295653002801304653001201332653001801344700002201362700002401384700002301408773008701431856008301518852000901601655001201610IND60083305720221120103213.0161023e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegl, Theresa10aDesign, construction and characterisation of a synthetic promoter library for fine-tuned gene expression in actinomycetes  ap. 98-106.  aWe developed a synthetic promoter library for actinomycetes based on the −10 and −35 consensus sequences of the constitutive and widely used ermEp1 promoter.

The lower surface of the ultimate rachis, the midrib and secondary veins is covered with triangular, trapezoid, rounded, or ligulate subepidermal swellings, which show different natures from intercalary pinnules. Lepidopteris is one of typical elements of the Late Permian Euramerican flora. Since Schimper erected the genus Lepidopteris in 1869, the entire epidermal structure of subepidermal swellings had been unclear. The new species L. baodensis clearly showing the distinguished epidermal structure of subepidermal swellings, not only enlarges and supplements our knowledge in biology and taxonomy of Lepidopteris as well as the Upper Permian stratigraphy of China, but also provides an opportunity to understand the relationship between Euramerican floras and Cathaysian floras in paleoclimatic, paleoenvironmental and paleogeographic context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflora 3anew species 3astratigraphy 3aChina1 aZheng, Shaolin,1 aNaugolnykh, Serge V.0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Sept., v. 57, no. 27 p.3603-3609dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5282-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245007600208300001800284500001100302520211800313592002802431596005402459650001702513650001002530650002402540650001402564650002002578650001602598650001702614700006502631773010902696856007302805852000902878655001202887IND60750792220221120210837.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079222DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín‐Gómez, Oscar H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0743-835012aA global synthesis of the impacts of urbanization on bird dawn choruses  ap. 1133-1154.  aREVIEW  aUrbanization drives changes in acoustic communication systems in some animal species. Noise and light pollution are among the main urban factors known to disrupt the timing and structure of avian singing behaviour. Despite our understanding of the ways in which urbanization can drive variations in avian acoustic communication, our ability to generalize the underlying causes of such variation and its consequences is still limited. Here, we reviewed the literature focused on the study of avian dawn choruses in urban settings at a global scale. Our findings reveal that avian dawn chorus research has focused on the impact of anthropogenic noise on dawn chorus traits (i.e. timing, peak, song output, song frequencies); relationships between light pollution and chorus timing; the effects of temperature, cloudiness, moonlight and natural light on chorus timing; relationships between nocturnal noise and light, and dawn chorus timing; the effects of chemical pollution and supplementary feeding on dawn chorus activity; and ecological patterns of dawn choruses in soundscapes across urban–non‐urban gradients. We identified important knowledge gaps in the study of avian dawn choruses in urban settings and thus suggest future research directions, including frameworks (e.g. the urbanization intensity gradient) and consideration of a wider array of urban conditions and variables. Given the complexity of urban settings, we encourage further studies to address the role that all sources of pollution can have on avian acoustic communication at dawn. Additionally, a central question to resolve is whether the function of avian dawn choruses in urban areas differs, and if so how, from non‐urban counterparts. Given that most research has been performed across Holarctic cities and towns, studies from tropical and subtropical regions are needed if we aim to understand the phenomenon globally. Finally, studies at the community‐ and soundscape‐level across cities could advance understanding of the way in which urban birds use the acoustic space during the most critical singing time period, dawn.  aPublisher supplied data  a417094cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3abioacoustics 3abirds 3adietary supplements 3apollution 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aurbanization1 aMacGregor‐Fors, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3198-73220 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1133-1154dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012200164300001600286520141600302592002801718650002401746650001901770650001801789650001201807650000901819650001601828650001501844650001001859650001101869650001601880651001001896653002101906653002101927653002101948653001601969653002401985653001202009653002202021700001802043700001802061773012702079856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60478477720221120212353.0160121e20051001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847772DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.3.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, F.

The effect of four seeding densities (250, 500, 750 and 1000 viable seeds/m<sup>2</sup>) and three row spacings (12, 15 and 20 cm) were evaluated at Morfa Mawr field station at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, UK during the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons. Number of capsules per plant, number of seeds per capsule, thousand-seed weight and seed yield were examined during the study. Capsule index (CI) and harvest index (HI) were calculated from the observed data. During the first year, capsules per plant, seeds per capsule and capsule index were increased by decreasing the seed density, while the maximum seed yield of 3.9 t/ha was recorded at the highest seed density of 1000 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>. An increase in row spacing led to an almost linear increase in most of the yield attributes of the crop. During the second year, the response of yield and yield attributes to seeding densities was similar to that recorded during the first year. Seed yield increased with decreasing row spacing, while the rest of the components did not show any consistent response. During the first year, the overall performance and production of the crop was higher than in the second year because of the better weather conditions, with mild temperature and high rainfall during the season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3agrowing season 3aharvest index 3alinseed 3arain 3arow spacing 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asowing 3atemperature 3aWales 0ayield components 0ayield components 0ayield components 0arow spacing 0aLinum usitatissimum 0alinseed 0aseeding densities1 aLeitch, M.

However, the glyoxylate shunt, which allows for the synthesis of four-carbon TCA cycle intermediates from acetyl-CoA, has not been found to be reversible to date. As a result, glucose can only be converted to acetyl-CoA via the decarboxylation of the three-carbon molecule pyruvate in heterotrophs. A reverse glyoxylate shunt (rGS) could be extended into a pathway that converts C4 carboxylates into two molecules of acetyl-CoA without loss of CO2. Here, as a proof of concept, we engineered in Escherichia coli such a pathway to convert malate and succinate to oxaloacetate and two molecules of acetyl-CoA. We introduced ATP-coupled heterologous enzymes at the thermodynamically unfavorable steps to drive the pathway in the desired direction. This synthetic pathway in essence reverses the glyoxylate shunt at the expense of ATP. When integrated with central metabolism, this pathway has the potential to increase the carbon yield of acetate and biofuels from many carbon sources in heterotrophic microorganisms, and could be the basis of novel carbon fixation cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adecarboxylation 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3aglyoxylate cycle 3aheterotrophs 3amalates 3apyruvic acid 3asuccinic acid 3athermodynamics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aGlyoxylate shunt 0aCentral metabolism 0aNon-native pathways 0aAcetyl-coA biosynthesis 0aReversibility 0aPrimary metabolism1 aGronenberg, Luisa S.1 aWong, Sio Si1 aLiao, James C.0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 Sept., v. 19 p.116-127dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171300001400267520219900281592002802480650001002508650002402518650001902542650002102561650001202582650001302594650001002607650002302617650002202640650001302662650002102675650001802696650002202714650001702736650001902753650002202772650001102794650002902805650002102834650001502855650001202870650001102882650001602893653001802909653001402927653002302941653001102964653002302975700001802998700001603016773009703032856008603129852000903215655001203224IND60525796820221120220702.0190319e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Geoff10aSubmerged macrophyte decline in shallow lakes: What have we learnt in the last forty years?  ap. 37-45.  aOver the last 40 years there has been substantial evidence that high biomasses of submerged aquatic plants and phytoplankton rarely occur together in shallow lakes, but it is clear that when present, plants have a competitive advantage over algae.Aquatic plants provide habitat structure, which influences the fish community such that zooplankton and other macroinvertebrates maintain a top-down control on algal growth, and this control is largely independent of the nutrient supply to the lake. Nonetheless it is clear that many, but not all, lakes lose their vegetation as nutrient loading increases. However, in eutrophic lakes, the subsequent dominance by phytoplankton is more likely to be a result of the loss of vegetation rather than the cause.At higher nutrient levels, grazing or mechanical damage can reduce plant cover allowing rapid development of algae. Changes to fish community structure or the influence of toxic chemicals can reduce invertebrate algal grazers, overcoming the positive feedback loops that stabilise the plant dominance.The longer-term stability of macrophyte dominance is also reduced if there are few surviving plant species. Such loss of species richness is associated with increased nitrogen loading. Submerged plants also depend on a spring clear-water phase to become established, and local weather conditions during winter and spring may determine the relative success of phytoplankton and plant growth, leading to a progressively longer period of algal dominance and fewer surviving plant species.The loss of submerged vegetation from lakes, although often perceived as a rapid change, is more likely to be the final conclusion of a process in which the competitive advantage of a diverse plant community is eroded by many pressures that are collectively interpreted as eutrophication.In attempts to manage our environment we hope to find simple, closed stable systems that will respond to measures designed to meet our perceptions of improved ecological quality. What we increasingly find are more complex open systems, which do not necessarily respond as expected. We look for simple and widely applicable explanations where none are likely to exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3acommunity structure 3aeutrophication 3afish communities 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amechanical damage 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphytoplankton 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3apollution load 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3atoxic substances 3avegetation 3aweather 3awinter 3azooplankton 0aShallow lakes 0aNutrients 0aAlternative states 0aChange 0aMacrophyte ecology1 aWillby, Nigel1 aMoss, Brian0 tAquatic botany.g2016 Nov., v. 135 p.37-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245014500196300001800341500002000359520136100379592002801740596006201768596005701830596004301887650002401930650001401954650001201968650001001980650001301990650001902003650001702022651001702039700002102056700002002077700002002097700002202117700006002139700005502199700005602254773010902310856007302419852000902492655001202501IND60750792320221120210822.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079232DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavaro, Livio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8698-472X10aPassive acoustic monitoring of the endangered African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) using autonomous recording units and ecoacoustic indices  ap. 1472-1480.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAfrican Penguins Spheniscus demersus are endangered and declining seabirds which make extensive use of vocal signals for intra‐specific vocal communication. Accordingly, passive acoustic monitoring tools could be developed as robust population monitoring methods that cause minimal disturbance to the birds. In this study, we collected soundscape recordings at the Stony Point penguin colony (Betty’s Bay, South Africa) during the breeding season in 2019 to document the circadian rhythms of vocal activity of this species and to investigate whether the magnitude of variation of three different ecoacoustic indices correlates with the number of ecstatic and mutual display songs counted in recordings, which might inform on the breeding activity of the colony. Indeed, whereas ecstatic display songs are produced by males during intersexual competition and territorial defence, mutual display songs are given by parents returning to the nest after foraging trips. We found that the vast majority of the display songs (> 80%) occurred between 04:00–08:00 and 17:30–21:30 h. We also found that the Acoustic Entropy Index was a good predictor of the number of penguins’ songs within a recording. Overall, our study shows that African Penguins vocalizations have the potential to assist the monitoring of this species while minimizing disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data  aPES_D_RIC_N_COMP_16_01cUniversità degli Studi di Torino  aIDEXLYON ANR‐16‐IDEX‐0005cUniversité de Lyon  aJ86G16000160009cRegione Lazio (Italy) 3aSpheniscus demersus 3aacoustics 3aentropy 3anests 3apenguins 3aterritoriality 3avocalization 3aSouth Africa1 aCresta, Eleonora1 aFriard, Olivier1 aLudynia, Katrin1 aMathevon, Nicolas1 aPichegru, Lorien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3815-98451 aReby, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9261-17111 aGamba, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9545-22420 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1472-1480dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015100209300001800360520061700378592002800995650002201023650001101045650002901056650001301085650001201098650002301110650002301133650002101156650001801177650002201195650003301217650001201250650001201262653001701274653002101291653003901312653002901351700002001380700002301400700002301423773011201446856008401558852000901642655001201651IND60599486120221119021520.0180702e20140618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059948612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.04.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmiglak, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4444-535410aCationic derivatives of the plant resistance inducer benzo[1,2,3]thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) as bifunctional ionic liquids  ap. 3565-3568.  aWe have synthesized, new salt derivatives of benzo[1,2,3]thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) containing BTH as the cation in combination with anions, which modify the physical and antibacterial properties of the resulting product while preserving the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) induction properties.

In the present study, the production of sucrose by the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, and Anabaena sp. PCC7120 was examined. The three species displayed different growth curves and intracellular sucrose accumulation rates in response to NaCl. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was used to examine the impact of modifying the metabolic pathway on the levels of sucrose production. The co-overexpression of sps (slr0045), spp (slr0953), and ugp (slr0207) lead to a 2-fold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation, whereas knockout of ggpS (sll1566) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the production of this sugar. When combined, these genetic modifications resulted in a fourfold increase in intracellular sucrose accumulation. To explore methods for optimizing the transport of the intracellular sucrose to the growth medium, the acid-wash technique and the CscB (sucrose permease)-dependent export method were evaluated using Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Whereas the acid-wash technique proved to be effective, the CscB-dependent export method was not effective. Taken together, these results suggest that using genetic engineering, photosynthetic cyanobacteria can be optimized for efficient sucrose production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aSynechococcus sp.

Combined characterizations of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ²⁷Al, ²⁹Si, ¹⁹F MAS NMR, N₂ sorption, and NH₃-tempeature-programmed desorption (NH₃-TPD) techniques show that the structure, texture, and acidity of HZSM-5 catalysts can be adjusted with the loading of AlF₃. A suitable amount of AlF₃ modification (2 wt %) could increase the framework aluminum content and the surface area of HZSM-5. However, when the loading of AlF₃ came to 3 wt % or more, the contrary results were obtained, which could be ascribed to the dealumination of the zeolitic framework. The catalytic activities for dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME) show that suitable amount of AlF₃-modified HZSM-5 exhibited much higher activity and better stability than parent HZSM-5. The combination of “tunable” synthesis and “superior” properties is very much valuable in the academic and industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3afluorides 3aindustry 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3asurface area 3atexture 3azeolites1 aKong, Meng1 aFan, Zheyong1 aMeng, Xiangju1 aFei, Jinhua1 aXiao, Feng-Shou0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4475-4480dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef30063833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245003400187300001600221520132800237592002801565650001301593650002701606650002501633650002201658650001501680650002501695650001201720650001601732650002501748650001601773650001701789650001601806650001101822650002001833650003001853650001201883650002301895650001801918650001601936650001401952650002301966650001201989650003702001650001102038650003402049650002702083650003502110700002502145700002102170700002502191773010002216856004802316852000902364655001202373IND50062760920221118061134.0130323e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006276092DNAL7 a224271202pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-012-1390-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiancheri, Paolo10aProteases and the gut barrier  ap. 269-280.  aSerine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartic proteases and matrix metalloproteinases play an essential role in extracellular matrix remodeling and turnover through their proteolytic action on collagens, proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin and laminin. Proteases can also act on chemokines, receptors and anti-microbial peptides, often potentiating their activity. The intestinal mucosa is the largest interface between the external environment and the tissues of the human body and is constantly exposed to proteolytic enzymes from many sources, including bacteria in the intestinal lumen, fibroblasts and immune cells in the lamina propria and enterocytes. Controlled proteolytic activity is crucial for the maintenance of gut immune homeostasis, for normal tissue turnover and for the integrity of the gut barrier. However, in intestinal immune-mediated disorders, pro-inflammatory cytokines induce the up-regulation of proteases, which become the end-stage effectors of mucosal damage by destroying the epithelium and basement membrane integrity and degrading the extracellular matrix of the lamina propria to produce ulcers. Protease-mediated barrier disruption in turn results in increased amounts of antigen crossing into the lamina propria, driving further immune responses and sustaining the inflammatory process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aaspartic proteinases 3abasement membrane 3achemokines 3acysteine proteinases 3aelastin 3aenterocytes 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3afibronectins 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alaminin 3ametalloproteinases 3aproteoglycans 3aproteolysis 3areceptors 3aserine proteinases 2aAnimals 2aExtracellular Matrixxenzymology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxenzymology 2aIntestinesxenzymology 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism1 aDi Sabatino, Antonio1 aCorazza, Gino R.1 aMacDonald, Thomas T.0 tCell and tissue research.g2013 Feb., v. 351, no. 2 p.269-280dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1390-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014800171520112800319592002801447650001201475650001901487650001501506650001501521650001101536650002201547650001801569650001401587650002001601650002101621650001701642651001001659653001201669653001401681653001601695653003501711653001801746700003601764700001901800773013301819856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60715958820221117163043.0220726e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071595882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŁaska, Weronika10aBioerosion structures from the Pliocene of the Agua Amarga Subbasin (Almería, SE Spain): Palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental implications  aThe bioerosion trace fossils are described from the Pliocene cropping out at the Agua Amarga Subbasin (Betic Cordillera, Almería Province, SE Spain). They are associated with limestone clasts (pebbles and cobbles) and molluscs constituting a shallow marine conglomerate and an overlying composite shell bed that were deposited in a shallow marine setting. The ichnotaxa include borings produced by sponges (Entobia cateniformis, E. geometrica, E. laquea, E. form A and E. form B), bivalves (Gastrochaenolites torpedo, and G. lapidicus) and polychaete annelids (Caulostrepsis taeniola, Meandropolydora ?decipiens, M. cf. elegans, and M. cf. sulcans). Encrustations by bryozoans and tube annelids are also present. The bioerosion trace fossils assemblages from the conglomerate and the shell bed can be ascribed to the Entobia subichnofacies, which is typical of Neogene rocky-shore settings. Bioerosion analysis allows improved interpretation of palaeoenvironmental (ecological and depositional) conditions i.e. hydrodynamic energy, rate of sedimentation, and exposure time, in the Agua Amarga Subbasin during the Pliocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryozoa 3aPliocene epoch 3aPolychaeta 3abioerosion 3aenergy 3aexposure duration 3ahydrodynamics 3alimestone 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aSpain 0aEntobia 0aShell bed 0aRocky shore 0aPalaeoenvironmental conditions 0aTransgression1 aRodríguez-Tovar, Francisco J.,1 aUchman, Alfred0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 562 p.110071-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245012500177300001600302520173800318592002802056650001202084650001502096650001502111650002402126650001202150773009202162856008802254990002302342852000902365655001202374IND60091569920221123042858.0141103e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009156992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIchikawa, Kazuhisa10aLocalized activation of proteins in a free intracellular space: Dependence of cellular morphologies and reaction schemes  ap. 173-180.  aLocalized activation of proteins in a cell is crucial for the segregation of cellular functions leading, for example, to the development of polarized cells and chemotaxis. If there is a physical diffusion barrier, localized activation of proteins will emerge. In case of no physical barrier, however, it is not clear to what extent the protein activation is localized within a three dimensional intracellular space. In the previous report we showed a simulation result of localized activation of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) within a dendritic spine of a neuron, and this localization was enhanced by the diffusion of calmodulin. However, a dendritic spine will act as a physical diffusion barrier. Here, we report that the localization of activated proteins is seen in more simplified morphology with no diffusion barrier. Furthermore, this localization was seen with a simple reaction scheme. In case that a Ca²⁺ source was located at the center of the spherical cell with diameter of 20μm, which is the extreme case without any physical diffusion barrier, the simulation results showed localized activation of a protein around the Ca²⁺ source. This localized activation was also enhanced by the diffusion of calmodulin. These localizations were not blurred with time within the tested time range. The reason for the increase in the localization by the diffusion of calmodulin was the replenishment of free calmodulin from surrounding regions. These simulation results indicate that the localized activation of proteins emerges in biological cells without any physical diffusion barrier, and the replenishment of proteins by diffusion can act as an enhancer of localized activation of downstream proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3achemotaxis 3aintracellular space 3aneurons0 tBioSystems.g2011 Sept., v. 105, no. 3 p.173-180dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.10.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015700169300001600326520080000342592002801142650002601170650001301196650002201209650001901231650001201250650001101262650001101273650001001284651000901294653001101303653001501314653000901329653001801338653002401356653002001380700001701400700001801417773011701435856005101552852000901603655001201612IND50087183320221119162042.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008718332DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2013.7641872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidarpour, O.10aChanges in Content and Constituents of Essential Oil in Different Plant Parts of Lovage (Levisticum officinale Koch.

The objective is to use the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr dataset to determine ages to improve correlation to equivalent European ammonite zones to better link paleogeographic, paleoceanographic, and ecological events across the Tethys Ocean. The results show a scattered vertical pattern of ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr, most likely caused by the introduction of radiogenic ⁸⁷Sr during postdepositional (post-Jurassic) diagenetic modification. Data collected from mud-dominated facies not associated with subaerial exposure surfaces with pedogenesis or subaqeous marine firmground surfaces with Glossifungites Ichnofacies show a smoother sample-to-sample variation, is interpreted to be less altered by meteoric diagenesis. These data show distinct ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ranges that fall within the stratigraphic ranges and are in stratigraphic order. The absolute ages estimated from these data, however, show discrepancies with the ages previously interpreted by biostratigraphic data. The two age estimations (from ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr and biostratigraphy) for the studied succession agree when the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr values are corrected for radiogenic (rubidium) contribution to mass 87. The corrected ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr values are used to estimate the numerical ages and assign the ammonite zones of the studied succession. The proposed ammonite zones provide a temporal framework to link events that occurred in the Middle–Late Jurassic at different geographic locations in the Tethys Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJurassic period 3abiostratigraphy 3acarbonates 3adata collection 3adiagenesis 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoceanography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3arubidium 3astrontium 3aSaudi Arabia 0aOxfordian 0aBiostratigraphic markers 0aTethys Ocean 0aHanifa formation 0aChemostratigraphy1 aGonzález, Luis A.,1 aHasiotis, Stephen T.1 aWalker, Douglas J.1 aAndrew, Joseph E.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 564 p.110083-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245006500186300001600251520047400267592002800741650001000769650001900779650001400798650002400812650002000836650001200856650001100868650002000879650001000899650002200909650001600931650000900947650001400956650005300970650005201023773011601075856005501191852000901246655001201255IND4478943720221118033302.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447894372DNAL7 a217711112pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01873.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdogan, G10aUltrasonic Assessment During Pregnancy in Goats – A Review  ap. 157-163.  aObstetric ultrasonography is the most common diagnostic approach used in veterinary reproduction because it is a simple, reliable and non‐invasive imaging technique.

The oil has a typically pungent odour and is amber red in colour. Among identified compounds, eight are found to be major constituents of the volatile oil. The results revealed that the predominant components in the T. patula flowers oil are β-ocimene, α-terpinolene, trans-caryophyllene, Z-ocimenone, dl-limonene, piperitenone, β-pinene and car-3-en-2-one.

A negative pressure of ca. −0.16bar is formed in reset traps, but its direct measurement is very difficult. We present a method of a gradual external application of negative pressure of −0.56 to −0.84mbars−1 through a fine capillary to cut off aquatic Utricularia traps to determine the critical negative pressure (CNP) at which the traps (located in air) fire and aspirate an air bubble. Using an electronic pressure sensor, we simulated the physiologically formed negative pressure needed for spontaneous trap firing in 15 aquatic Utricularia species of four generic sections. Mean CNP values ranged from −0.069bar in giant traps of U. reflexa to −0.346bar in U. dichotoma. The average in all 20 species or variants tested was −0.195±0.018bar, while that in 13 species or variants of the generic section Utricularia was −0.165±0.015bar and significantly differed from that of three populations of two species (U. dichotoma, U. volubilis) of the generic section Pleiochasia (−0.335±0.006bar). CNP differed significantly between giant and smaller traps of U. reflexa and young and old traps of U. vulgaris. Pooled data for 20 species or variants showed a significant negative linear correlation between trap length and CNP value. Within each species, high variability of the CNP was found: the lowest values were usually 2–3 times lower than the highest ones. This variability can represent three types of spontaneous firings described in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUtricularia 3aair 3aaquatic plants 3abotany 3acarnivores 0aLentibulariaceae 0aAquatic carnivorous plants 0aTrap functioning 0aSpontaneous trap firing 0aTaxonomic differences 0aTest of trap firing1 aPoppinga, Simon0 tAquatic botany.g2016 Aug., v. 133 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009000166300001800256506011700274506007600391520161300467592002802080506003702108650001102145650001902156650001802175650001302193650001802206650002502224650001602249653001802265653002402283653002202307653001602329653001802345653003402363653004102397653000902438653000802447653001002455653000802465653000902473653001002482700001802492700002002510773012802530856008302658852000902741655001202750IND60782213720221207081721.0220714s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078221372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yin-Chun10aEvaluating statistical significance in a meta-analysis by using numerical integration  ap. 3615-3620.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMeta-analysis is a method for enhancing statistical power through the integration of information from multiple studies. Various methods for integrating p-values (i.e., statistical significance), including Fisher’s method under an independence assumption, the permutation method, and the decorrelation method, have been broadly used in bioinformatics and computational biotechnology studies. However, these methods have limitations related to statistical assumption, computing efficiency, and accuracy of statistical significance estimation. In this study, we proposed a numerical integration method and examined its theoretical properties. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate its Type I error, statistical power, computational efficiency, and estimation accuracy, and the results were compared with those of other methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method performs well in terms of Type I error, statistical power, computing efficiency (regardless of sample size), and statistical significance estimation accuracy. P-value data from multiple large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and transcriptome-wise association studies (TWASs) were analyzed. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can be used to identify critical genomic regions associated with rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, increase statistical significance in individual GWASs and TWASs, and control for false-positives more effectively than can Fisher’s method under an independence assumption.

Marine Cyanobacterium  ap. 2587-2593.  aIheyamide A (1) is an antitrypanosomal linear peptide isolated from a Dapis sp. marine cyanobacterium by our group in 2020, and based on structure–activity relationships of its natural analogues, the C-terminal pyrrolinone moiety has been identified as the phamacophore for its antiparasitic activity. Further, we isolated this pyrrolinone moiety by itself as a new natural product from the marine cyanobacterium and named it iheyanone (2). As expected, iheyanone (2) showed antitrypanosomal activity, but its potency was weaker than iheyamide A (1). To clarify more detailed structure–activity relationships, we completed a total synthesis of iheyamide A (1) along with iheyanone (2) and evaluated the antitrypanosomal activities of several synthetic intermediates. As a result, we found that the longer the peptide chain, the stronger the antitrypanosomal activity. As iheyamide A (1) showed selective toxicity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, these findings can provide design guidelines for antitrypanosomal drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma rhodesiense 3aantitrypanosomal properties 3amoieties 3apeptides 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxicity1 aTeranuma, Kazuya1 aKurisawa, Naoaki1 aRahmawati, Yulia1 aJeelani, Ghulam1 aNozaki, Tomoyoshi1 aGerwick, William H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1403-44581 aSuenaga, Kiyotake1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5343-58900 tJournal of natural products.g2021 Sept. 06, v. 84, no. 9 p.2587-2593dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c007923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245011400188300001600302520132900318592002801647650001301675650001801688650001701706650001101723650001901734650002501753650002101778650001801799650003301817650003001850650000901880651001001889651002101899651001001920700001401930700001501944700001401959700001601973700001501989773010602004856008702110852000902197655001202206IND4466988820221123004456.0141112e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446698882DNAL7 a222451602pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarnevale, C.10aIntegrating Saharan dust forecasts into a regional chemical transport model: A case study over Northern Italy  ap. 224-231.  aThe Po Valley in Northern Italy is frequently affected by high PM10 concentrations, where both natural and anthropogenic sources play a significant role. To improve air pollution modeling, 3D dust fields, produced by means of the DREAM dust forecasts, were integrated as boundary conditions into the mesoscale 3D deterministic Transport Chemical Aerosol Model (TCAM). A case study of the TCAM and DREAM integration was implemented over Northern Italy for the period May 15–June 30, 2007. First, the Saharan dust impact on PM10 concentration was analyzed for eleven remote PM10 sites with the lowest level of air pollution. These remote sites are the most sensitive to Saharan dust intrusions into Northern Italy, because of the absence of intensive industrial pollution. At these remote sites, the observed maxima in PM10 concentration during dust events is evidence of dust aerosol near the surface in Northern Italy. Comparisons between modeled PM10 concentrations and measurements at 230 PM10 sites in Northern Italy, showed that the integrated TCAM–DREAM model more accurately reproduced PM10 concentration than the base TCAM model, both in terms of correlation and mean error. Specifically, the correlation median increased from 0.40 to 0.65, while the normalized mean absolute error median dropped from 0.5 to 0.4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3acase studies 3amodels 2aDustxanalysis 2aForecastingxmethods 2aModels, Chemical 2aParticle Size 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aSilicon Dioxidexanalysis 2aWind 3aItaly 0aAfrica, Northern 0aItaly1 aFinzi, G.1 aPisoni, E.1 aVolta, M.1 aKishcha, P.1 aAlpert, P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 417-418 p.224-231dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014200162300001800304520116300322592002801485650001401513650002901527650001301556650001801569650001501587650001801602650001401620650001801634700001701652773010401669856007501773852000901848655001201857IND60534013120221116185543.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401312DNAL7 a10.1021/ef30065642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReaume, Stephen
J.10aSynergistic Effects of Skeletal Isomerization on Oleic and Palmitic Acid Mixtures for the Reduction in Cloud Point of Their Methyl Esters  ap. 4514-4520.  aBiodiesel is composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters, both of which have significant effects on the cloud point of biodiesel. These two classes of fatty acids also react differently to isomerization reactions for cloud point improvement. This study examines the effects of isomerization and hydroisomerization on the two most common saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that make up vegetable oils, i.e., palmitic and oleic acids, respectively. The two fatty acids are placed under two different reactions and analyzed both separately and mixed for the cloud point improvement of their esters. The two reactions, isomerization and hydroisomerization, are run at 250 °C and 1 MPa H₂ and at 300 °C and 4 MPa H₂, respectively. Negative and positive results were shown, i.e., cis to trans isomerization, causing an increase in cloud point, and branching, causing a reduction in cloud point. A 7.5 °C reduction in cloud point is achieved on the esters of a 55:45 (%) oleic acid/palmitic acid ratio, showing that isomerization and hydroisomerization reactions can successfully lower the cloud point of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3afatty acid methyl esters 3ahydrogen 3aisomerization 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3asynergism 3avegetable oil1 aEllis, Naoko0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4514-4520dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef30065643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011700188300001400305520099600319592002801315650002901343650002401372650001001396650001101406650002701417650002201444650001101466650001801477650002001495650001601515650003901531650001901570650002801589650004201617650001401659650002101673650003501694650004101729650004801770650002501818700002601843700002301869700003101892700002701923700002201950773008901972856004802061852000902109655001202118IND4483118820221118061453.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448311882DNAL7 a222150102pmid7 a10.1007/s00294-011-0363-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNizhnikov, Anton A.10a[NSI +] determinant has a pleiotropic phenotypic manifestation that is modulated by SUP35, SUP45, and VTS1 genes  ap. 35-47.  aWe recently discovered the novel non-chromosomal determinant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [NSI +] (nonsense suppression inducer), which causes omnipotent nonsense suppression in strains where the Sup35 N-terminal domain is deleted. [NSI +] possesses yeast prion features and does not correspond to previously identified yeast prion determinants. Here, we show that [NSI + ] enhances nonsense codon read-through and inhibits vegetative growth in S. cerevisiae. Using a large-scale overexpression screen to identify genes that impact the phenotypic effects of [NSI +], we found that the SUP35 and SUP45 genes encoding the translation termination factors eRF3 and eRF1, respectively, modulate nonsense suppression in [NSI +] strains. The VTS1 gene encodes an NQ-enriched RNA-binding protein that enhances nonsense suppression in [NSI +] and [nsi −] strains. We demonstrate that VTS1 overexpression, like [NSI +] induction, causes translational read-through and growth defects in S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aprions 3atranslation (genetics) 3avegetative growth 3ayeasts 2aBase Sequence 2aCodon, Nonsense 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenome, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Termination Factorsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPrionsxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexphysiology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgenetics 2aSuppression, Genetic1 aMagomedova, Zalina M.1 aRubel, Alexandr A.1 aKondrashkina, Alexandra M.1 aInge-Vechtomov, S.

Based on the PCR and dCAPs analyses of two waxy loci on different genomes we concluded that there were at least two possible lineages in Asian continent that had independent dispersal pathways into Japan.

The distribution of 58 sites is also commented on in relation to the origin of palaeolakes, the nature of their infillings and their palaeolandscape. Most (90%) of these palaeolakes were created by the melting of buried ice remaining after the Wartanian (Late Saalian, MIS 6) ice-sheet. It has been determined, from palynostratigraphy, that the decline of postglacial lakes may have taken more than 75,000 years. In the key palaeolakes, the beginning of Cladocera succession started at the end of the Wartanian and finished in the Middle Plenivistulian (MIS 3). The Middle and Late Eemian was a period of intense Cladocera development in terms of biodiversity and specimen frequency. The significant differences in Cladocera succession and development of lakes reflect in detail the significant climate changes taking place between cold and warm periods, and the most pronounced differences result from variations in the morphometry and thus hydrological stability of the investigated palaeolakes. In the largest lakes (Kubłowo) the survival chances of organisms increased in difficult times. The studied sediments are characterised by similar geochemical and isotopic features. The Early Eemian warming is expressed by a positive trend in δ¹⁸Ocₐᵣb and δ¹³Ccₐᵣb and an increasing amount of organic matter. The Late Eemian isotopic fluctuations are probably affected by the sedimentary infilling of the palaeolakes. The Vistulian cooling is reflected by distinctly lower values of δ¹⁸Ocₐᵣb than in the Eemian. The lowest amounts of total organic carbon are recorded in the coldest periods during the Herning, Rederstall and Schalkholz Stadials, but increased systematically during the warmer periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3acold 3acooling 3aflora 3ahydrology 3aice 3amorphometry 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3atotal organic carbon 3aPoland 0aLake origin 0aSediments 0aStable isotopes 0aEemian-Vistulian1 aMirosław-Grabowska, Joanna1 aNiska, Monika0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 561 p.110087-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245005400178300001600232520075900248592002801007650002101035650001101056650001901067650002201086700001701108773009201125856008801217990002301305852000901328655001201337IND60091570420221122124419.0141103e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009157042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoñi-Moreno, Angel10aModel for a population-based microbial oscillator  ap. 286-294.  aGenetic oscillators are a major theme of interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Until recently, most work has been carried out using intra-cellular oscillators, but this approach restricts the broader applicability of such systems. Motivated by a desire to develop large-scale, spatially distributed cell-based computational systems, we present an initial design for a population-level oscillator which uses three different bacterial strains. Our system is based on the client–server model familiar to computer science, and uses quorum sensing for communication between nodes. Importantly, it is robust to perturbation and noise. We present the results of extensive in silico simulation tests, which confirm the feasibility of our design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer science 3amodels 3aquorum sensing 3asynthetic biology1 aAmos, Martyn0 tBioSystems.g2011 Sept., v. 105, no. 3 p.286-294dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009300170300001400263520088000277592002801157650002401185650001601209650002201225650002201247650001501269650001001284650001801294650002701312650001601339650001401355650001201369650002801381650001201409650001601421653000801437653002701445653002301472653000801495700002601503700001701529700001801546700002501564773011401589856009001703852000901793655001201802IND50065080720221119101156.0190405e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006508072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser, C.10aQuantitative trait loci associated with pre-weaning growth in South African Angora goats  ap. 15-20.  aThis study aimed to identify chromosomal regions associated with genetic variation in pre-weaning growth traits in Angora goats.

Phenotypes were recorded at birth (BW) and weaning (WW) and analysed using GridQTL software. A total of six putative QTL were detected on six different chromosomes, all at chromosome-wide significance level. Four QTL were identified for BW on CHI 4, 8, 17 and 27 and two QTL for WW on CHI 16 and 19. QTL effects ranged from −0.32 to 0.25 in units of residual standard deviation in different families. Some of these QTL correspond to chromosomes where QTL associated with growth have been identified in other species. These chromosomal segments hold potential to influence weight gain in young goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngora (goat breed) 3achromosomes 3acomputer software 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3agoats 3agrowth traits 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparturition 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aquantitative trait loci 3aweaning 3aweight gain 0aMAS 0aMicrosatellite markers 0aPre-weaning growth 0aQTL1 aVan Marle-Köster, E.1 aSnyman, M.A.1 aBovenhuis, H.1 aCrooijmans, R.P.M.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 May, v. 112, no. 1-3 p.15-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012400162300001600286520150300302592002801805650001101833650002801844650001501872650001601887650001301903650002301916650002001939650001501959650003101974650001702005650001702022650001702039650001302056650001902069653001402088653001402102653001402116653001102130653001302141653001602154700001602170773012702186856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60478478420221120212305.0160121e20051201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847842DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.4.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalifa, K.10aN<sub>2</sub>fixation in faba bean grown under saline and non-saline conditions using a <sup>15</sup>N-tracer technique  ap. 393-403.  aA pot experiment was conducted to study the performance of faba bean and barley growing under saline conditions, in terms of dry matter yield, total N, and percentages and amount of N derived from the soil, fertilizer and atmosphere using a <sup>15</sup>N isotope dilution method. Three saline treatments were employed: 1) plants were grown on saline soil and irrigated with saline water (SsWs); 2) plants were grown on saline soil and irrigated with non-saline water (SsWn); and 3) plants were grown on non-saline soil and irrigated with saline water (SnWs). Furthermore, a control treatment was employed by growing the plants on non-saline soil and irrigating them with non-saline water (SnWn). The different salinity treatments reduced plant growth and the reduction was more pronounced in faba bean than in barley. However, the relative growth reduction of plants grown only on saline soil, using non-saline water, did not exceed 50% of the control, whereas the reduction exceeded 50% when plants were grown under completely saline conditions. The percentage of N<sub>2</sub>fixed (%Ndfa) was not affected negatively by saline conditions.the results clearly demonstrated that the effect of salinity on faba bean was more evident on plant growth than on N<sub>2</sub>-fixing activity. Further studies are needed to obtain more salt-tolerant faba bean genotypes that possess a higher growth rate. This could simultaneously improve yield and N<sub>2</sub>fixation under severely saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3adry matter accumulation 3afaba beans 3afertilizers 3agenotype 3agrowth retardation 3airrigated soils 3airrigation 3aisotope dilution technique 3aplant growth 3asaline soils 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 0afaba bean 0afaba bean 0afaba bean 0abarley 0asalinity 0aN2 fixation1 aKurdali, F.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2005 Dec. 1, v. 53, no. 4 p.393-403dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.53.2005.4.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012600168300001800294520196600312592002802278596005902306596005902365596006102424596005602485596007502541650001302616650002202629650001102651650002402662650001302686650001802699650002002717650002402737650001702761650001102778650001902789650001402808651001002822651001502832700001202847700001602859700001402875700001702889700001802906700002102924700001502945773013102960856008203091852000903173655001203182IND60676915420221122054707.0191122e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067691542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-019-01683-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Fenliang10aHabitat use by migrating Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) as determined by bio-tracking at a stopover site in the Yellow Sea  ap. 1109-1119.  aStopover sites are critical for refueling and resting by migrating birds. Clarifying the habitat requirements of migratory birds during stopover is important for understanding migration ecology and for conservation management. Habitat use by migratory birds at stopover sites, however, has been inadequately studied, and individual variation in habitat use among species is largely unexplored. We tracked the movement of migrating Whimbrels, Numenius phaeopus, using Global Positioning System–Global System for Mobile Communication tags at Chongming Dongtan, an important stopover site in the South Yellow Sea, China, in spring 2016 and in spring and autumn 2017. Multinomial logistic regression and multimodel inference were used to detect the effects of the individual bird, the diel factor (day vs. night), and tide height on the habitat use by Whimbrels during the stopover. The activity intensity of Whimbrels was lower during the night than during the day, while the maximum distance that tagged Whimbrels moved was similar between day and night. The saltmarsh and mudflat were intensively used by all of the individuals in all three seasons: > 50% and 20% of all records were obtained from the saltmarsh and mudflat, respectively. Habitat use significantly differed among individuals; the farmland and woodland were used by some individuals in spring 2016, while the restoration wetland near the intertidal area was used by some individuals in 2017. In general, the saltmarsh, farmland, and woodland were more frequently used in the daytime, while the mudflat was more frequently used at night. As tide height increased, the use of the mudflat decreased while the use of the saltmarsh increased. The results suggest that individual-based bio-tracking can provide detailed data on habitat use both during the day and at night. Differences in habitat use among individuals and periods highlight the importance of diverse habitats for bird conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  a31830089cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31772467cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18DZ1205002cScience & Technology Department of Shanghai  a10003881cWorld Wide Fund for Nature Beijing Office  a2018YFC1406402cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aNumenius 3aagricultural land 3aautumn 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amigratory birds 3aregression analysis 3asalt marshes 3aspring 3astopover sites 3awoodlands 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aWu, Wei1 aKe, Wanjuan1 aMa, Qiang1 aChen, Weipin1 aFeng, Xuesong1 aZhang, Zhengwang1 aMa, Zhijun0 tJournal of ornithology.g2019 Oct., v. 160, no. 4 p.1109-1119dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01683-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245008900170300001600259520117700275592002801452650000801480650002101488650002001509650001101529650001101540650001601551650002101567650002701588700001601615700001701631700001401648773009201662856008801754990002301842852000901865655001201874IND60091570520221122161342.0141103e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009157052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongde10aRole of 10–11bp periodicities of eukaryotic DNA sequence in nucleosome positioning  ap. 295-299.  a10–11bp repeating patterns of the particular dinucleotides were suggested in positioning nucleosomes in eukaryotes. In order to assess the role, the 10–11bp periodicities of the dinucleotides were examined both in human well-positioned nucleosome DNA sequences and in promoter DNA sequences of eight species. Our results indicated that the periodical occurrence of the particular dinucleotides correlates to positioning nucleosome. The signals of 10–11bp periodicities are more pronounced in the nucleosome DNA sequences than in the linker DNA sequences. Near the transcription start site, the signals reveal a similar feature that the nucleosome organization exhibits. But, it seems that the species do not share the same dinucleotides patterns. Furthermore, the dinucleotides patterns are dominant at the specific region of genome, indicating their diverse roles in forming and organizing nucleosomes. Moreover, the 10–11bp periodicities signals near the translation start negatively correlate with gene expression, demonstrating a vital role in transcription regulation. Our study reveals some details about the roles of DNA sequence in positioning nucleosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenome 3ahumans 3anucleosomes 3apromoter regions 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLin, Shuhai1 aCai, Zongwei1 aSun, Xiao0 tBioSystems.g2011 Sept., v. 105, no. 3 p.295-299dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012500170300002000295520099800315592002801313650001401341650001401355650001001369650001301379650001901392650002501411650001201436650002101448650001301469650003101482700006501513700001901578700006201597773017201659856008001831852000901911655001201920IND60650861420190814000000.0190710e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065086142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b009682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe San Luis, Alicia10aRemoval of Volatile Organic Compounds from Bulk and Emulsion Polymers: A Comprehensive Survey of the Existing Techniques  ap. 11601-11623.  aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are mostly toxic and hazardous substances that generally have a strong odor and can cause health and environmental problems. It is thus of upmost importance for the polymer manufacturing industry to eliminate these volatiles from the synthesized polymers. The properties and the application of the polymer, as well as the nature and the concentration of volatiles, govern the choice of the most appropriate elimination technique to avoid any modification or degradation of the polymer. In this review, we take stock of the most suitable purification methods currently used to remove VOCs from polymers in bulk and in emulsion with particular emphasis on the equipment and experimental requirements for each method, as well as the theoretical considerations that motivate the use of the method. In addition to conventional techniques, we are also presenting our efforts to identify potentially promising alternatives for reducing the VOC content from polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3aequipment 3aodors 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3apurification methods 3asurveys 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3avolatile organic compounds1 aSantini, Catherine C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3070-48481 aChalamet, Yvan1 aDufaud, Véronique1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5312-71770 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 May 27, v. 58, no. 27 p.11601-11623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b009683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012200179300001500301520141600316592002801732650003501760650001901795650002201814650001101836650004201847650001501889650001301904650002401917650001801941650002001959650001201979651001301991651001002004651001102014653001302025653002102038653001102059700002202070700002502092700002202117700002102139700002702160700002302187700002902210700002602239700002502265700001802290773009602308856008602404852000902490655001202499IND60567127020221118022858.0170710e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056712702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAralaguppe, Shambhu G.10aMultiplexed next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly to obtain near full-length HIV-1 genome from plasma virus  ap. 98-104.  aAnalysing the HIV-1 near full-length genome (HIV-NFLG) facilitates new understanding into the diversity of virus population dynamics at individual or population level. In this study we developed a simple but high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) protocol for HIV-NFLG using clinical specimens and validated the method against an external quality control (EQC) panel. Clinical specimens (n=105) were obtained from three cohorts from two highly conserved HIV-1C epidemics (India and Ethiopia) and one diverse epidemic (Sweden). Additionally an EQC panel (n=10) was used to validate the protocol. HIV-NFLG was performed amplifying the HIV-genome (Gag-to-nef) in two fragments. NGS was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 after multiplexing 24 samples, followed by de novo assembly in Iterative Virus Assembler or VICUNA. Subtyping was carried out using several bioinformatics tools. Amplification of HIV-NFLG has 90% (95/105) success-rate in clinical specimens. NGS was successful in all clinical specimens (n=45) and EQA samples (n=10) attempted. The mean error for mutations for the EQC panel viruses were <1%. Subtyping identified two as A1C recombinant. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a simple NGS-based HIV-NFLG that can potentially be used in the molecular surveillance for effective identification of subtypes and transmission clusters for operational public health intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abioinformatics 3adisease outbreaks 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apopulation dynamics 3apublic health 3aquality control 3aviruses 3aEthiopia 3aIndia 3aSweden 0aHIV-NFLG 0aDe novo assembly 0aPlasma1 aSiddik, Abu Bakar1 aManickam, Ashokkumar1 aAmbikan, Anoop T.1 aKumar, Milner M.1 aFernandes, Sunjay Jude1 aAmogne, Wondwossen1 aBangaruswamy, Dhinoth K.1 aHanna, Luke Elizabeth1 aSönnerborg, Anders,1 aNeogi, Ujjwal0 tJournal of virological methods.g2016 Oct., v. 236 p.98-104dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010700164300001600271500001500287520183000302592002802132650001302160650001902173650000902192650001402201650001302215650001402228650001002242650002402252650002402276650002602300650001802326650001602344650001302360650001002373650002602383650001002409650002202419650001002441651001002451653002202461653002202483653002502505653002102530653001302551700002402564773012702588856008202715852000902797655001202806IND60478478520221120212258.0160121e20051201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847852DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.4.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJānaki, Pi.,10aEffect of N management approaches and planting densities on nitrogen accumulation by transplanted rice  ap. 405-415.  a2019-12-06  aField experiments were conducted during 1998 and 1999 in June-September with rice variety ASD18 at the wetland farm, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India to find out theeffect of N management approaches and planting densities on N accumulation by transplanted rice in a split plot design.The main plot consisted of three plant populations (33, 66 and 100 hills m<sup>-2</sup>) and the sub-plot treatments of five N management approaches. The results revealed thatthe average N uptake in roots and aboveground biomass progressively increased with growth stages. The mean root and aboveground biomass Nuptake were 26.1 to 130.6 and 6.4 to 17.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The N uptake of grain and straw was higher in the<i>Sesbania rostrata</i>green manuring + 150 kg N treatment, but it was not effective in increasing the grain yield. The mean total N uptake was found to be significantly lower at 33 hills m<sup>-2</sup>(76.9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and increased with an increase in planting density (100.9 and 117.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>at 66 and 100 hills m<sup>-2</sup>density). N application had a significant influence on N uptake and the time course of N uptake in all the SPAD-guided N approaches. A significant regression coefficient was observed between the crop N uptake and grain yield. The relationship between cumulative N uptake at the flowering stage and the grain yield was quadratic at all three densities. The N uptake rate (µ<sub>N</sub>) was maximum during the active tillering to panicle initiation period and declined sharply after that. In general, µ<sub>N</sub>increased with an increase in planting density and the increase was significant up to the panicle initiation to flowering period.thereafter, the N uptake rate was similar at densities of 66 and 100 hills m<sup>-2</sup>.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3ainflorescences 3arice 3aflowering 3anitrogen 3atillering 3afarms 3aaboveground biomass 3aregression analysis 3afield experimentation 3aplant density 3agrain yield 3aplanting 3astraw 3aagricultural colleges 3ahills 3aSesbania rostrata 3aroots 3aIndia 0atransplanted rice 0achlorophyll meter 0adevelopmental stages 0aplanting density 0aN uptake1 aThiyagarajan, T.

Two subspecies that differ in underpart coloration are recognized. Both subspecies occur in Iran, P. m. moabiticus in western Iran and P. m. yatii in eastern Iran. Here we document the population genetics of this poorly known species using a multilocus approach. We used seven microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus to quantify population structure and gene flow within and between both subspecies. Our study reveals significant genetic differentiation in both nuclear and mitochondrial markers between P. m. moabiticus and P. m. yatii. Our results support the occurrence of two genetic clusters, corresponding to the two subspecies, and suggest the absence of admixed individuals, implying no recent or current gene flow between the two subspecies. Our results support a phylogeographical scenario in which the two lineages diverged from each other about 0.3–0.4 million years ago during a period of extreme aridity in two small allopatric refugia. We suggest that moabiticus and yatii may deserve species status and advocate for additional studies investigating in‐depth phenotypic and behavioural variation. We stress that P. m. yatii, which possesses a small and isolated range, may deserve special conservation attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser 3aallopatry 3acolor 3adry environmental conditions 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aphenotype 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3arefuge habitats 3aIran 3aMiddle East1 aPons, Jean‐Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4916-30061 aAbdelkrim, Jawad1 aFuchs, Jérôme1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1972-00780 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1355-1368dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245006100174520159600235592002801831650003601859650002301895650001801918650001801936650003301954650003301987650001702020650003302037650001702070650001302087651001102100700003202111700003102143773012702174856007402301852000902375655001202384IND60652341420221118021754.0190712e20180706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065234142DNAL7 a10.3390/su100723562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdez Juárez, Luis Enrique,10aCSR and the Supply Chain: Effects on the Results of SMEs  aCurrently, companies and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) are looking to be more competitive. To achieve this, they are adopting new business models and strategies that allow them to move towards sustainability. Strategies such as CSR (Corporate social responsibility) and supply chain management have become essential for ensuring a company’s permanence and financial consolidation. The literature has stated that theories on stakeholders and sustainability are fundamental pillars for the development and sustained growth of business. The purpose of this article is to examine the effects of CSR and SCMM (supply chain management) on innovation, image and reputation, and, in turn, their influences on profitability in SMEs. An additional purpose is to verify the bidirectional relationship that exists between CSR and SCM in SMEs. This research was based on a sample of 143 companies in the city of Guaymas Sonorain Mexico. For the analysis and validation of the results, we used the ordinal least squares method (OLS) through multiple linear regressions and SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) statistical technique based on the variance, through PLS (Partial Least Squares) (using SmartPLS version 3.2.6 Professional). The findings show that SMEs that develop social and sustainable practices increase their level of innovation, and improve their image, their reputation, and their financial profitability. The results also indicate that CSR and SCM have a strong interdependence. This work contributes mainly to the development of the literature on stakeholders and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporate social responsibility 3aeconometric models 3aleast squares 3aprofitability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmall and medium enterprises 3astakeholders 3astructural equation modeling 3asupply chain 3avariance 3aMexico1 aGallardo Vázquez, Dolores,1 aRamos-Escobar, Elva Alicia0 tSustainability.g2018 July 06, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100723563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005600168300001800224500001100242520127300253592002801526596003401554596003601588596003501624650002001659650001601679650002001695650001301715650001201728650002501740650002501765650001201790650001501802700002701817700002101844700002201865700001701887700005801904773013101962856008202093852000902175655001202184IND60676915620221122054747.0191122e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067691562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-019-01684-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepers, Bernice10aAvian ecological epigenetics: pitfalls and promises  ap. 1183-1203.  aReview  aEpigenetic mechanisms can alter gene expression without a change in the nucleotide sequence and are increasingly recognized as important mechanisms that can generate phenotypic diversity. Most of our current knowledge regarding the origin and role of epigenetic variation comes from research on plants or mammals, often in controlled rearing conditions. Epigenetic research on birds in their natural habitats is still in its infancy, but is needed to answer questions regarding the origin of epigenetic marks and their role in phenotypic variation and evolution. Here we review the potential for studying epigenetic variation in natural bird systems. We aim to provide insights into (1) the origin of epigenetic variation, (2) the relationship between epigenetic variation and trait variation, and (3) the possible role of epigenetic variation in adaptation to changing environments. As there is currently little research on epigenetics in wild birds, we examine how findings on other taxa such as plants and mammals relate to birds. We also examine some of the pros and cons of the most commonly used methods to study patterns of DNA methylation in birds, and suggest some topics we believe need to be addressed to develop the field of wild avian epigenetics further.  aPublisher supplied data  a239974cNorges Forskningsråd  aALWOP.314cNWO open competition  around 2017cKNAW Research Fund 3aDNA methylation 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahabitats 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotypic variation 3arearing 3awild birds1 avan den Heuvel, Krista1 aLindner, Melanie1 aViitaniemi, Heidi1 aHusby, Arild1 avan Oers, Kees1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6984-906X0 tJournal of ornithology.g2019 Oct., v. 160, no. 4 p.1183-1203dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01684-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013100160300001600291520057400307592002800881650002000909650001900929650001100948650001100959650001800970650001800988650001301006650001601019650001001035650002101045653001801066653001801084653001801102653003301120653003701153700001701190773012701207856008201334852000901416655001201425IND60478478620221120212336.0160121e20051201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847862DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.53.2005.4.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKizil, S.10aEffect of different planting densities on yield and yield components of wild thyme (<i>Thymbra spicata</i>var. <i>spicata</i>)  ap. 417-422.  aThe study reports the effect of the planting density of wild thyme (<i>Thymbra spicata</i>var. <i>spicata</i>) on plant height, fresh herbage yield, dry herbage yield, dry leaf yield, essential oil content and essential oil yield.

This problem can be circumvented by imputing the missing genotypes with estimated genotypes. When implementing imputation, the criteria used for SNP data quality control and whether to perform imputation before or after data quality control need to consider. In this paper, we compared six strategies of imputation and quality control using different imputation methods, different quality control criteria and by changing the order of imputation and quality control, against a real dataset of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. The results demonstrated that, no matter what imputation method and quality control criteria were used, strategies with imputation before quality control performed better than strategies with imputation after quality control in terms of accuracy of genomic selection. The different imputation methods and quality control criteria did not significantly influence the accuracy of genomic selection. We concluded that performing imputation before quality control could increase the accuracy of genomic selection, especially when the rate of missing genotypes is high and the reference population is small.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3acattle 3adata collection 3agenotype 3amarker-assisted selection 3amilk production 3aquality control 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aZhang, Zhe1 aDing, Xiangdong1 aFu, Weixuan1 aMa, Peipei1 aWang, Chonglong1 aZhang, Qin0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2012 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.8-8dSpringer-Verlagx2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2049-1891-3-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01112naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245012900170300001300299500001900312520025000331592002800581650001000609650001400619650001800633773010100651856008500752852000900837655001200846IND6036835720221118061249.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603683572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBevelacqua, J.J.10aApplicability of health physics lessons learned from the Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident to the Fukushima Daiichi accident  ap. 6-10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe TMI-2 and Fukushima Daiichi accidents appear to be dissimilar because they involve different reactor types.

However, less is known about the role of wildlife and livestock in spreading the virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess how the interactions between African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and cattle may influence the seroprevalence of CCHF across livestock-wildlife management systems in Kenya. The study included archived sera samples from buffalo and cattle from wildlife only habitats (Lake Nakuru National Park and Solio conservancy), open wildlife-livestock integrated habitats (Maasai Mara ecosystem and Meru National Park), and closed wildlife-livestock habitats (Ol Pejeta Conservancy) in Kenya. We analyzed 191 buffalo and 139 cattle sera using IDvet multispecies, double-antigen IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence toward Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was significantly higher for buffalo compared to cattle (75.3% and 28.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). We obtained the highest seroprevalence among buffalo of 92.1% in closed wildlife only systems compared to 28.8% and 46.1% prevalence in closed-integrated and open-integrated systems, respectively. The regression coefficients were all negative for cattle compared to buffalo in both closed-integrated and open-integrated compared to wildlife only system. Our results show that CCHFV circulates among the diverse animal community in Kenya in spatially disconnected foci. The habitat overlap between cattle and buffalo makes cattle a “bridge species” or superspreader host for CCHFV and increases transmission risks to humans. The effect of animal management system on prevalence is depended on tick control on the cattle and not the animal per se.

The product is characterized by PXRD, UV–vis, FTIR, N₂ adsorption–desorption, FESEM, and TEM studies. The material showed the generation of identical mesopores at 3.9 nm. The titanium phosphate material showed brilliant catalytic activity for the synthesis of cyclic organic carbonates and carbamates with high yields up to 97% and 93%, respectively, via chemical fixation of the greenhouse gas CO₂ over different epoxide and amine substrates, respectively, in a solvent-free state at room temperature within a short reaction period.

About 45% gasification efficiency was achieved at 75 min with a catalyst loading (mass of Ru/C catalyst/mass of dry algal biomass) of 1 g/g, a water density of 0.096 g/cm³, and a 4.3 wt % loading of algae. Longer reaction times, higher catalyst loadings and water densities, and lower algae loadings provided higher gas yields. The level of catalyst loading had the most significant effect on both the yields and composition of the gaseous products. Complete gasification of the microalga was achieved with a catalyst loading of 2 g/g. The Ru/C catalyst recovered from an experiment and then reused in a new experiment was less active than fresh Ru/C. This loss of activity is, in large part, due to deactivation by sulfur, which is present in the microalga at about 0.5 wt %. A simple two-step catalytic gasification mechanism, along with a step for catalyst poisoning by sulfur, led to a rate equation that was consistent with the experimental results for gasification efficiency. The presence in algae of sulfur and perhaps other elements, such as Cl, that are not as prevalent in terrestrial biomass indicates that efficient and effective gasification of microalgae could present new challenges in engineering and catalyst design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3aengineering 3aequations 3agasification 3amicroalgae 3apoisoning 3asulfur1 aWei, Chaohai1 aSavage, Phillip E.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4575-4582dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef30079923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008400173300001600257520058500273592002800858650002200886650001700908650002000925650002500945650001200970650001900982650002301001650001501024650001101039650001301050650002201063650001301085650000901098651000901107653002201116653001401138653001801152653001001170700002601180700001801206700002101224773011701245856005101362852000901413655001201422IND50087184420221119162244.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008718442DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2013.8132332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafavi, Hossein10aChemical Composition of Essential Oil of Stachys byzantina from North-West Iran  ap. 334-337.  aThe paper reports the composition of the essential oil from aerial parts (leaves) of Stachys byzantina (Lamiaceae) from North-West of Iran.

Yet evidence suggests that display between partners is in fact most commonly observed following mate choice, and is often just as elaborate. In many bird species, allopreening, when one member of a pair preens the other, is a major component of display both pre‐ and post‐pair formation. Despite this, there has been little investigation into its functions. Explanations that have been put forward tend to focus on its role in feather hygiene, which has limited phylogenetic support, or its function in the maintenance of the pair bond, though how this might occur or indeed what this actually represents has not been adequately explained. Phylogenetic evidence reveals that allopreening is most commonly observed in those species exhibiting high levels of partner retention and biparental care, and it appears to be functional in maintaining cooperation in parental behaviour in at least one species. In our observational study, we explored the patterns and putative functions of allopreening during the nest‐relief displays of breeding pairs of Black‐browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris during incubation and chick‐provisioning. Allopreening was an important feature of displays, constituting 30% of display time. We found that the bird returning from its foraging trip usually initiated allopreening, and preened more than its partner prior to change‐over of nesting duties. We further found a positive relationship between the amount of time the pair spent in display and the duration of the subsequent foraging trip, providing tentative support for a function in maintaining cooperative parental behaviour between the parents. Although we cannot be conclusive as to its exact functions, we add to a limited literature the first exploration of functions for this conspicuous behaviour in albatrosses.  aPublisher supplied data  aUIDB/04292/2020cFalkland Islands Government (Environmental Studies Budget)  aUIDP/04292/2020cFalkland Islands Government (Environmental Studies Budget)  aBB/M011224/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 3abirds 3ahygiene 3amating behavior 3aobservational studies 3aparental behavior 3aphylogeny 3apreening 3asexual selection1 aGuilford, Tim1 aCatry, Paulo0 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1175-1188dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015300159520234600312592002802658650001502686650001102701650001502712650001802727650001202745650002402757650001102781650001302792650001502805651001002820700001702830700001902847700001902866700001602885700001802901700001802919700001702937773012802954856007503082852000903157655001203166IND60763568420221122232526.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356842DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140202422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Haiyang 10aEstimating Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Contents of West–East Grassland Transect in Inner Mongolia Based on Sentinel-2 and Meteorological Data  aEstimating the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents of a large-span grassland transect is essential for evaluating ecosystem functioning and monitoring biogeochemical cycles. However, the field measurements are scattered, such that they cannot indicate the continuous gradient change in the grassland transect. Although remote sensing methods have been applied for the estimation of nutrient elements at the local scale in recent years, few studies have considered the effective estimation of C, N, and P contents over large-span grassland transects with complex environment including a variety of grassland types (i.e., meadow, typical grassland, and desert grassland). In this paper, an information enhancement algorithm (involving spectral enhancement, regional enhancement, and feature enhancement) is used to extract the weak information related to C, N, and P. First, the spectral simulation algorithm is used to enhance the spectral information of Sentinel-2 imagery. Then, the enhanced spectra and meteorological data are fused to express regional characteristics and the fractional differential (FD) algorithm is used to extract sensitive spectral features related to C, N, and P, in order to construct a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) model. Finally, the C, N, and P contents are estimated over a West–East grassland transect in Inner Mongolia, China. The results demonstrate that: (i) the contents of C, N, and P in large-span transects can be effectively estimated through use of the information enhancement method involving spectral enhancement, regional feature enhancement, and information enhancement, for which the estimation accuracies (R²) were 0.88, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. Compared with the estimation results of raw Sentinel-2 imagery, the RMSE was reduced by 3.42 g/m², 0.14 g/m², and 13.73 mg/m², respectively; and (ii) the continuous change trend and spatial distribution characteristics of C, N, and P contents in the west–east transect of the Inner Mongolia Plateau were obtained, which showed decreasing trends in C, N, and P contents from east to west and the characteristics of meadow > typical grassland > desert grassland. Thus, the information enhancement algorithm can help to improve estimates of C, N, and P contents when considering large-span grassland transects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aleast squares 3ameadows 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aChina1 aZhang, Aiwu 1 aYin, Shengnan 1 aZhang, Jiaxin 1 aDong, Gang 1 aHe, Nianpeng 1 aQin, Wenxuan 1 aWei, Dandan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140202423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015800165520147700323592002801800650002301828650000901851650001301860650001801873650001601891650002601907650001901933650001901952650001301971650001501984650001201999650001702011650003402028653000902062653002202071653002602093653002402119653003102143700001502174700001602189700002002205700002002225700001502245700002102260700001302281700001702294773011102311856008602422852000902508655001202517IND60727686720221117164335.0220606e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jina10aEffects of spraying lactic acid and peroxyacetic acid on the quality and microbial community dynamics of vacuum skin-packaged chilled beef during storage  aA long shelf life for fresh meat products is very important both to processors, retailers and consumers. In this work, the effect of repeat acid spraying on the shelf life of vacuum skin-packaged (VSP) chilled beef, as well as the quality and microbial community dynamics was evaluated. Carcasses were sprayed with 300 ppm peroxyacetic acid (PA) or 3% lactic acid (LA) three times during the chilling process, or one more time of LA spray before packaging (LLA). Quality, sensory attributes and microbial load of VSP beef during 32 days of storage at 4 °C were evaluated. The results showed that quality and sensory scores decreased over time for all treatments, but LLA treated samples were still above the rejection threshold at the end of the storage period. Moreover, the total volatile basic nitrogen value and the total viable counts were 15.0 mg/100 g and 7.2 log CFU/g for the control group, while acid treated groups remained below these two values until the end of the storage period. In particular LLA treated beef steaks exhibited the best preservation potential even at the end of storage. This is attributed to the reduction of Proteobacteria in LLA beef steaks shown by the bacterial diversity analysis via high-throughput sequencing, as well as the lower counts of B. thermosphacta and Enterobacteriaceae during storage. This indicates that LLA treatment has the potential to achieve a shelf life extension of VSP steaks without impacting on quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3abeef 3adynamics 3afood research 3alactic acid 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial load 3aperacetic acid 3araw meat 3ashelf life 3astorage 3astorage time 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aBeef 0aLactic acid spray 0aVacuum skin packaging 0aBacterial diversity 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aLiu, Yunge1 aZhu, Lixian1 aLiang, Rongrong1 aDong, Pengcheng1 aNiu, Lebao1 aHopkins, David L1 aLuo, Xin1 aZhang, Yimin0 tFood research international.g2021 Apr., v. 142 p.110205-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010300205300001200308500001900320520183100339592002802170650001202198650001902210650001202229650001502241650002002256650003002276650002102306650002702327650001502354650001102369650001102380650002702391650001402418650000902432650001702441650002502458650002002483650001802503650001502521651000902536773013502545856008302680852000902763655001202772IND60696459520221122050334.0200608e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-08997-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatemi, Akram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1675-800610aStrategies and policies for water quality management of Gharasou River, Kermanshah, Iran: a review  ap. 254.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater quality of rivers depends on land use, sediment load, natural hazards such as flooding and drought, water pollution and eutrophication, and multiple use. The water quality management of the Gharasou River in a basin-scale approach was reviewed. Both non-point and point sources were investigated in terms of management, land use, and patterns of land use change, soil erosion and sediment load, the changes of water compositions, and sources of water pollution. The role of local farmers in planning and implementing management strategies and policies and vulnerability management was also reviewed. The results showed that in the Gharasou River Basin, conversion of rangelands to rain-fed lands is the main factor that produces sediment loads in the hilly area as they are the most sensitive areas to soil erosion. Sub-basins producing the most considerable runoff and sediment in the main outlet are now evident. The position of point pollution sources and sources responsible for non-point pollution of the Gharasou River is determined. Conversion of rain-fed lands to forest, prohibiting improper agricultural activities, organic farming, government investment for rangelands, wastewater treatment plants, phytoremediation, considering the factors for vulnerability management of drought, and participation of rural communities are suggested as some management strategies and policies for water quality management. This study is likely to help government and policy-makers to have a realistic picture of the water quality of the Gharasou River, its problems, and the reasons responsible for present conditions. The government and policy-makers could/should plan and fulfill the best policies regarding local peoples’ needs and participation to manage natural resources such as soil, water, and land cover/land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aeutrophication 3aforests 3aland cover 3aland use change 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphytoremediation 3apoint source pollution 3arangelands 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aIran0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 June, v. 79, no. 11 p.254-254dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-08997-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010700161500001900268520116900287592002801456650003001484650001701514650000901531650002201540650001501562650002401577650001701601650001101618650001701629650001401646650001701660650001701677700002901694700001701723773012101740856007901861852000901940655001201949IND60732032920221119234840.0210326e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073203292DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100302282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegani, Gad10aMarkers of Genetic Variation in Blue Gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus) as a Model for Labyrinth Fish  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarkers of genetic variation between species are important for both applied and basic research. Here, various genes of the blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus, suborder Anabantoidei, a model labyrinth fish), many of them involved in growth and reproduction, are reviewed as markers of genetic variation. The genes encoding the following hormones are described: kisspeptins 1 and 2, gonadotropin-releasing hormones 1, 2, and 3, growth hormone, somatolactin, prolactin, follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, as well as mitochondrial genes encoding cytochrome b and 12S rRNA. Genetic markers in blue gourami, representing the suborder Anabantoidei, differ from those in other bony fishes. The sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene of blue gourami is often used to study the Anabantoidei suborder. Among the genes involved in controlling growth and reproduction, the most suitable genetic markers for distinguishing between species of the Anabantoidei have functions in the hypothalamic–pituitary–somatotropic axis: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and growth hormone, and the 12S rRNA gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichogaster trichopterus 3acytochrome b 3afish 3agenetic variation 3akisspeptin 3aluteinizing hormone 3amitochondria 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3aprolactin 3areproduction 3asomatotropin1 aVeksler-Lublinsky, Isana1 aMeerson, Ari0 tBiology.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100302283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166520135700273592002801630650000901658650001101667650001001678650001901688650001101707650001001718650001201728650001801740650000901758650001001767650001701777650001201794650001301806650000901819650002301828650001201851650001501863650002301878653002101901653001001922653001101932653001701943653001701960653002501977700001402002700001802016700001802034700002102052700001902073773011102092856008602203852000902289655001202298IND60727686820221117164334.0220606e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, L.G.10aIdentification of volatiles and odor-active compounds of aromatic rice by OSME analysis and SPME/GC-MS  aDuring cooking, aromatic rice has a pleasant and characteristic aroma, a relevant factor to add sale value and attract consumer interest. This work studied the volatile compounds of aromatic rice (IAC 500) aiming at identifying those responsible for the aroma and flavor of the cooked rice. The description of the aromatic notes of the IAC 500 rice was carried out by a trained and selected sensory panel, followed by olfactometry (OSME) and identification by GC-MS of the rice volatile compounds extracted by SPME. A total of 80 volatiles was sensorially perceived and/or detected in the chromatographic effluent, of which 65 were identified, 44 presented some odor, and 36 were odorless. Among the odorous compounds, 15 were not detected by GC-FID or GC-MS. This study confirmed the compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline as the impacting volatile compound to the aroma of aromatic rice since it presented a very low percentage of area in the chromatogram and a high odor intensity. Other 43 compounds presented odor in lower intensities, but also contributed to the overall aroma of IAC 500 rice. From the 11 aromatic notes mentioned by the trained panel (cooked vegetable/seed, corn, hominy, green, porridge, popcorn, fresh baked cake/bread, milk, caramel, tapioca flour and flower), eight were related to the volatile compounds responsible for their aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3abreads 3acakes 3achromatography 3aflavor 3aflour 3aflowers 3afood research 3amilk 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3apopcorn 3aporridge 3arice 3asensory evaluation 3atapioca 3avegetables 3avolatile compounds 0aVolatile profile 0aAroma 0aFlavor 0aOlfactometry 0aOryza sativa 0a2-acetyl-1-pyrroline1 aHacke, A.1 aBergara, S.F.1 aVillela, O.V.1 aMariutti, L.R.B.1 aBragagnolo, N.0 tFood research international.g2021 Apr., v. 142 p.110206-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013800209300001200347500001900359520210100378592002802479650002202507650001302529650003002542650001902572650002802591650001602619650001602635650001102651650002202662650001302684650001102697650001302708650002302721650001702744650002402761650002202785650001202807650002102819651001702840700005702857700005702914773013502971856008303106852000903189655001203198IND60696459720221122064357.0200608e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-08998-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Rooyen, J.

A robust method for evaluating groundwater vulnerability therefore requires the incorporation of multiple indices into one holistic evaluation. In this study, a model for groundwater vulnerability in South Africa was developed, calculating the combined weighted averages of nine spatial datasets; namely: (1) mean annual precipitation, (2) mean annual surface temperature, (3) tritium distribution in groundwater, (4) potential evaporation, (5) aquifer type and yield, (6) terrain slope, (7) electrical conductivity, (8) population density and (9) cultivated land use. The model was run through 36 different weighting scenarios and indicates that on average 22.4% of South Africa’s groundwater is predicted to have a very high vulnerability to depletion in quantity and deterioration in quality (12.2% very low; 35.4% low; 16.8% moderate and 13.1% high). A single weighting scenario (M-I/C-2/P-2) was chosen that showed good alignment to the previous assessments that predicted that 20.9% of groundwater resources in South Africa have very high vulnerability (1.5% very low; 35.7% low; 24.9% moderate and 17.0% high). The model was adjusted to reflect climate conditions 50 years into the future, resulting in a 3% increase in very high vulnerability areas and a 6% decrease in low vulnerability areas. The results suggest that large areas of South Africa have high groundwater vulnerability, especially in areas where groundwater supplements domestic supply and agriculture. The implementation of this method to evaluate groundwater vulnerability across diverse natural environments and political boundaries will supplement comprehensive groundwater vulnerability assessments and the development of effective groundwater management policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaquifers 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3aelectrical conductivity 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amodels 3apolitics 3apopulation density 3aspatial data 3asurface temperature 3atopographic slope 3atritium 3awater management 3aSouth Africa1 aWatson, A.

Survival of off-host stages of Ixodid ticks depends on microclimate driven in part by extrinsic factors resulting from weather, such as temperature, humidity, drought, and floods. The impact of some of these abiotic factors is unclear for D. albipictus. The effect of water submergence on biological parameters of engorged, adult, females, and unfed larvae was assessed in the laboratory. Survival of adult females after submergence for 3 days was 88% with significant effects on their ability to oviposit. After 5 weeks, 63% of larvae (1-month-old) survived submergence in water, whereas survival of larvae (3-month-old) was reduced to 23% after 7 days. The off-host stages of D. albipictus have variable tolerance to periods of submergence that may influence the number of larvae available on the landscape for recruitment to moose in autumn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aDermacentor albipictus 3aadults 3aautumn 3adrought 3ahumidity 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3aoviposition 3asubmergence 3atemperature 0awinter tick 0aIxodidae 0aunderwater survival 0amoose 0aclimate change1 aParker, B.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1395-61381 aSkinner, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4578-84740 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2022 Apr. 29, v. 100, no. 7 p.474-479dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2022-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010300163520181700266592002802083650002402111650002302135650002402158650002302182650003002205650002502235650001302260650000902273650001902282650002102301650002602322650001702348650002502365700002402390700001802414700001902432700003502451700002102486773011802507856007702625852000902702655001202711IND60771337620221116140009.0220325e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077133762DNAL7 a10.3390/land110304492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinart, Daniel 10aHabitat Management of the Endemic and Critical Endangered Montseny Brook Newt (Calotriton arnoldi)  aCalotriton arnoldi is an endemic amphibian inhabiting Montseny Natural Park and Biosphere Reserve (PNRBM), listed as “critically endangered (CR)” by IUCN. At the end of 2016, the Life Tritó del Montseny (LIFETM) project (LIFE15 NAT/ES/000757) was launched. The aim of the project was to promote around fifty actions to ensure the conservation of C. arnoldi and its natural habitat, and this entailed five strategic lines: (1) Increasing the scientific and technical knowledge with regard to C. arnoldi’s conservation status and its habitat management. (2) Expanding its geographic distribution. (3) Involving and engaging stakeholders in the conservation of the Montseny brook newt. (4) Eliminating or minimizing threats that exist in the riparian habitat. (5) Establishing proper legal coverage and defining long-term strategic planning. The successes and failures experienced throughout the process provide us with essential information that will enable us to develop an adaptive management of the habitat. In order to eliminate or minimize threats to the newt’s habitat, some of the actions that are currently being carried out are: (a) Land acquisitions and land exchanges with private properties.

Here, we report the first Fe-based functional mimic of the active site of [Fe]-hydrogenase, which was developed based on a mechanistic understanding. The activity of this iron model complex is enabled by its unique ligand environment, consisting of biomimetic pyridinylacyl and carbonyl ligands, as well as a bioinspired diphosphine ligand with a pendant amine moiety.

Data are derived from two independent studies that simultaneously measured PM2.5 and nicotine concentrations in the air as airborne markers of second-hand smoke exposure in public places and workplaces, including health care centres, bars, public administration offices, educational centres, and transportation. We obtained 213 simultaneous measures of airborne nicotine and PM2.5. Nicotine in the air was measured with active samplers containing a sodium bisulphate-treated filter that was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. PM2.5 was measured with a SidePak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor. We calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and its 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between both measures for overall data and stratified by setting, type of environment (indoors/outdoors), and intensity of second-hand smoke exposure (low/high, according to the global median nicotine concentration). We also fitted generalized regression models to further explore these relationships. The median airborne nicotine concentration was 1.36µg/m3, and the median PM2.5 concentration was 32.13µg/m3. The overall correlation between both markers was high (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0.709; 95% CI: 0.635–0.770). Correlations were higher indoors (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0.739; 95% CI: 0.666–0.798) and in environments with high second-hand smoke exposure (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0.733; 95% CI: 0.631–0.810). The multivariate analysis adjusted for type of environment and intensity of second-hand smoke exposure confirmed a strong relationship (7.1% increase in geometric mean PM2.5 concentration per µg/m3 nicotine concentration), but only in indoor environments in a stratified analysis (6.7% increase; 95% CI: 4.3–9.1%). Although the overall correlation between airborne nicotine and PM2.5 is high, there is some variability regarding the type of environment and the intensity of second-hand smoke exposure. In the absence of other sources of combustion, air nicotine and PM2.5 measures can be used indoors, while PM2.5 should be used outdoors with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aworking conditions 3acorrelation 3ainhalation exposure 3anicotine 3asamplers 3aaerosols 3aconfidence interval 3aregression analysis 3aparticulates 3acombustion 3aair 3asodium 3ahealth services 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3agovernment and administration 0aCorrelation 0aAir nicotine 0amultivariate analysis 0aSecond-hand smoke 0aParticulate matter1 aMartínez-Sánchez, Jose M.1 aGalán, Iñaki1 aPérez-Ríos, Mónica1 aSureda, Xisca1 aLópez, María J.,1 aSchiaffino, Anna1 aMoncada, Albert1 aMontes, Agustín,1 aNebot, Manel1 aFernández, Esteve0 tEnvironmental Research.g2013 Nov., v. 127 p.49-55dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245010300194500002000297520168100317592002801998596006502026596006302091596002402154596006702178650001002245650001502255650001302270650001302283650002302296650001302319651001602332651001702348700005602365700005602421700005902477700005602536700005802592700005502650700005402705700005602759700005402815700005402869700005402923773013602977856007703113852000903190655001203199IND60791721620221119095031.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172162DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0185562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoh, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5995-192510aSeasonal Cycle of the Confluence of the Tsugaru Warm, Oyashio, and Kuroshio Currents East of Japan  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Sanriku Confluence east of Japan is the region of confluence of the Tsugaru Warm Current from the Sea of Japan, the Oyashio Current from the western subarctic gyre and the Sea of Okhotsk, and Kuroshio water that has detached from the subtropical gyre. It is a field of vigorous stirring driven by variability in current systems, but transition processes between water masses have yet to be clarified. High‐resolution underwater conductivity‐temperature‐depth observations were undertaken during each of the four seasons to test a hypothesis that the water‐mass gradient in the Sanriku Confluence is set without full stirring. Analyses in isopycnal coordinates indicate the seasonal occurrence of prominent fronts of both salinity and displacement, related to the emergence of various water masses. After fitting error functions to frontal features, the seasonally emerging isopycnal salinity fronts often became extremely sharp with widths typically narrower than 3 km, supporting the hypothesis. Disturbances distinguished from frontal structures indicate variance peaks with ranges similar to or slightly greater than the baroclinic Rossby radius, likely stirring the large‐scale tracer gradient at this scale. Elevated variances in isopycnal salinity were often observed around the fronts, and variances caused by isolated patches with salinity anomalies were also large. By determining the horizontal scales at which the effects of internal wave heaving becomes dominant, we were able to calculate the potential vorticity (PV) of the balanced flow field. As the PV becomes negative or near zero around the fronts, symmetric instability might have developed.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18H04912cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  a22H05201cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science  cUniversity of Tokyo  cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aJapan 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3avariance 3aOkhotsk Sea 3aSea of Japan1 aTsutsumi, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2141-11891 aMasunaga, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5759-81251 aSakamoto, T.

Yet, many biological systems challenge this competitive exclusion principle. Insectivorous bats from the Northern Hemisphere typically form local assemblages of multiple species sharing highly similar functional traits and pertaining to identical feeding guilds. Although their trophic niche can be accessed with unprecedented details using genetic identification of prey, the underlying mechanisms of resource partitioning remain vastly unexplored. Here, we studied the differential diet of three closely‐related bat species of the genus Plecotus in sympatry and throughout their entire breeding season using DNA metabarcoding. Even at such a small geographic scale, we identified strong seasonal and spatial variation of their diet composition at both intra‐ and interspecific levels. Indeed, while the different bats fed on a distinct array of prey during spring, they showed higher trophic niche overlap during summer and fall, when all three species switched their hunting behaviour to feed on few temporarily abundant moths. By recovering 19 ecological traits for over 600 prey species, we further inferred that each bat species used different feeding grounds and hunting techniques, suggesting that niche partitioning was primarily habitat‐driven. The two most‐closely related bat species exhibited very distinct foraging habitat preferences, while the third, more distantly‐related species was more generalist. These results highlight the need of temporally comprehensive samples to fully understand species coexistence, and that valuable information can be derived from the taxonomic identity of prey obtained by metabarcoding approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aPlecotus 3acompetitive exclusion 3adiet 3agenetic testing 3ainsectivores 3aprey species 3aspring 3asummer 3asympatry1 aMichaux, Johan R.1 aRuedi, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3283-77640 tMolecular ecology.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 18 p.4584-4600dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.160733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013600177520171700313592002802030650002202058650002302080650002502103650001302128650001502141650001902156650002002175650001702195650001402212650000902226650001702235650001002252650003002262650001602292650002802308650002802336650001002364650001902374650001002393650001702403650001402420650002402434650002102458650002802479650001902507650001802526650002102544653001402565653001502579700003402594700002502628700003802653700002502691700003002716700002702746700002302773700003902796773012202835856008502957852000903042655001203051IND60674151620221120192433.0191214e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1098472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Fernanda Chaves10aImpacts of the biocide chlorothalonil on biomarkers of oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and sperm quality in guppy Poecilia vivipara  aChlorothalonil is a fungicide present in antifouling paints and other formulations used in agriculture, although studies have shown this chemical to be toxic to fish species. To clarify the deleterious effects of chlorothalonil for these non-target organisms, the present study evaluated the toxic effects of this biocide for the estuarine guppy Poecilia vivipara in terms of an acute mortality test (96 h) and the analysis of biomarkers of oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and sperm quality. The LC50 calculated for P. vivipara was 40.8 μg/L of chlorothalonil. For the analysis of biomarkers, fish were exposed (96 h) to 1 and 10 μg/L of chlorothalonil. It was observed that chlorothalonil alters the levels of pro- and antioxidants towards oxidative stress. In the gills, a negative effect on total antioxidant capacity (ACAP) was detected, while there was a reduction in the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the liver. However, levels of glutathione (GSH) and the activity and glutamate-cysteine-ligase (GCL) increased in both tissues, as a possible detoxification response. Following chlorothalonil exposure, oxidative damage measured by lipoperoxidation (LPO) significantly increased at the cellular level only (red blood cells (RBCs) and sperm cells). An increase in fluidity of membranes, reactive oxygen species concentration and micronuclei (MNs) incidence were also seen in RBCs. In sperm cells, LPO increased, while membrane and mitochondrial functionality as well as sperm motility decreased. Based on these results, chlorothalonil can be considered as a toxic compound for fish, causing genotoxicity and affecting the RBCs physiology and the fertility of males of P. vivipara.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia vivipara 3aantifouling agents 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocides 3abiomarkers 3achlorothalonil 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3aestuaries 3afish 3agenotoxicity 3agills 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3alethal concentration 50 3aliver 3amale fertility 3amales 3amitochondria 3amortality 3anontarget organisms 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3atoxic substances 0aBiomarker 0aDNA damage1 aJunior, Antonio Sergio Varela1 aCorcini, Carine Dahl1 aSánchez, Jessica Andrea Albañil1 aPires, Diego Martins1 aPereira, Jéssica Ribeiro1 aPrimel, Ednei Gilberto1 aFillmann, Gilberto1 aMartins, Camila De Martinez Gaspar0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 188 p.109847-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1098473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012900161300001800290520104000308592002801348650002901376650002901405650002901434650002301463650001801486650001701504650002301521650001801544650002101562650001601583653000901599653002701608653003601635653002601671700001701697700002601714700001501740700001401755700005801769773014701827856008001974852000902054655001202063IND60684912320221118052001.0200226e20200204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b076572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shuqi10aMicrobial Synthesis of Antibacterial Phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic Acid and the Role of PhzG in Pseudomonas chlororaphis GP72AN  ap. 2373-2380.  aPseudomonas chlororaphis have been demonstrated to be environmentally friendly biocontrol strains, and most of them can produce phenazine compounds.

Through gene deletion, common start codon changing, gene silence, and in vitro assay, our result revealed that the yield of PDC in P. chlororaphis is associated with the relative expression of phzG to phzA and phzB. In addition, it is found that PDC can be spontaneously synthesized without PhzG. This study provides an efficient way for PDC production and promotes a better understanding of PhzG function in PDC biosynthesis. Moreover, this study gives an alternative opportunity for developing new antibacterial biopesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3aStreptomyces lomondensis 3aantibacterial properties 3abiological control 3abiopesticides 3abiosynthesis 3adicarboxylic acids 3agene deletion 3ain vitro studies 3astart codon 0aPhzG 0aphenazine biosynthesis 0aphenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid 0aspontaneous synthesis1 aWang, Yining1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

The characteristics of both the embedded sensors and drones (viewing angle, flying altitude, resolution) create opportunities to consider the use of hyperspectral imagery to map and monitor macroalgae communities. In general, the overflight of the areas to be mapped is conconmittently associated accompanied with measurements carried out in the field to acquire the spectra of previously identified objects. An alternative to these simultaneous acquisitions is to use a hyperspectral library made up of pure spectra of the different species in place, that would spare field acquisition of spectra during each flight. However, the use of such a technique requires developed appropriate procedure for testing the level of species classification that can be achieved, as well as the reproducibility of the classification over time. This study presents a novel classification approach based on the use of reflectance spectra of macroalgae acquired in controlled conditions. This overall approach developed is based on both the use of the spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm applied on first derivative hyperspectral data. The efficiency of this approach has been tested on a hyperspectral library composed of 16 macroalgae species, and its temporal reproducibility has been tested on a monthly survey of the spectral response of different macro-algae species. In addition, the classification results obtained with this new approach were also compared to the results obtained through the use of the most recent and robust procedure published. The classification obtained shows that the developed approach allows to perfectly discriminate the different phyla, whatever the period. At the species level, the classification approach is less effective when the individuals studied belong to phylogenetically close species (i.e., Fucus spiralis and Fucus serratus).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus serratus 3aFucus spiralis 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aflight 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3aphylogeny 3areflectance 3asurveys1 aVerpoorter, Charles 1 aDuong, Gwendoline 1 aSpilmont, Nicolas 1 aGevaert, François 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245008600185520114700271592002801418650001901446650003301465650003201498650002601530650001501556650001401571650001601585650002601601700002801627700002101655700001701676773012801693856008701821852000901908655001201917IND60768436020221120134703.0220225e20220214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843602DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100204332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-González, Alexandre 10aTwo-Drug Regimens for HIV—Current Evidence, Research Gaps and Future Challenges  aDuring the last 30 years, antiretroviral treatment (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been continuously evolving. Since 1996, three-drug regimens (3DR) have been standard-of-care for HIV treatment and are based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The effectiveness of first-generation 3DRs allowed a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients, although it was associated with several side effects and ART-related toxicities. The development of novel two-drug regimens (2DRs) started in the mid-2000s in order to minimize side effects, reduce drug–drug interactions and improve treatment compliance. Several clinical trials compared 2DRs and 3DRs in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients and showed the non-inferiority of 2DRs in terms of efficacy, which led to 2DRs being used as first-line treatment in several clinical scenarios, according to HIV clinical guidelines. In this review, we summarize the current evidence, research gaps and future prospects of 2DRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aantiretroviral agents 3acompliance 3alongevity 3anucleosides 3aproteinase inhibitors1 aSuárez-García, Inés 1 aOcampo, Antonio 1 aPoveda, Eva 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01509naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245013100181300001600312500002900328500000900357520050500366592002800871650001300899650001300912650001700925650001500942700002300957773012100980856009701101852000901198655001201207IND60663646820221120194909.0191122e196205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364682DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1962.00021962005400030019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRampton, H.

The outermost layer of the assembly is composed of a single layer of small-sized GNPs, while the larger-sized GNPs are located in the interior, forming what is referred to as a yolk/shell assembly. Time course study reveals that small and large GNPs aggregate together, and these kinetically trapped aggregations were transformed into a size-segregated structure by repeating fusions. A yolk/shell structure was directly visualized in solution by X-ray laser diffraction imaging, indicating that the structure was truly formed in solution, but not through a drying process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3adrying 3aethylene glycol 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3ananogold1 aNiikura, Kenichi1 aHiguchi, Takeshi1 aKimura, Kei,1 aMitomo, Hideyuki1 aJinnai, Hiroshi1 aJoti, Yasumasa1 aBessho, Yoshitaka1 aNishino, Yoshinori1 aMatsuo, Yasutaka1 aIjiro, Kuniharu0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Mar. 16, v. 138, no. 10 p.3274-3277dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b124563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014500157300001800302500002000320520163900340592002801979596006302007596006902070596004402139650001602183650001402199650001502213650001302228650001002241650001202251650001902263650001602282650002502298650004302323650002202366700001902388700001502407700001602422700001702438700001802455700001902473700001802492700005802510700002402568700005902592773011802651856007402769852000902843655001202852IND60744889720221120052214.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488972DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.157512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Si Jun10aJazf1 acts as a regulator of insulin‐producing β‐cell differentiation in induced pluripotent stem cells and glucose homeostasis in mice  ap. 4412-4427.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGenetic susceptibility of type 2 diabetes and Juxtaposed with another zinc finger protein 1 (Jazf1) has been reported; however, the precise role of Jazf1 in metabolic processes remains elusive. In this study, using Jazf1‐knockout (KO)‐induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), pancreatic beta cell line MIN6 cells, and Jazf‐1 heterozygous KO (Jazf1⁺/⁻) mice, the effect of Jazf1 on gradual differentiation was investigated. We checked the alterations of the genes related with β‐cell specification, maturation, and insulin release against glucose treatment by the gain and loss of the Jazf1 gene in the MIN6 cells. Because undifferentiated Jazf1‐KO iPSC were not significantly different from wild‐type (WT) iPSC, the size and endoderm marker expression after embryoid body (EB) and teratoma formation were investigated. Compared to EB and teratomas formed with WT iPSC, the EB and teratomas from with Jazf1‐KO iPSC were smaller, and in teratomas, the expression of proliferation markers was reduced. Moreover, the expression of the gene sets for β‐cell differentiation and the levels of insulin and C‐peptide secreted by insulin precursor cells were notably reduced in β‐cells differentiated from Jazf1‐KO iPSC compared with those differentiated from WT iPSC. A comparison of Jazf1⁺/⁻ and WT mice showed that Jazf1⁺/⁻ mice had lower levels of serum insulin, pancreatic insulin expression, and decreased pancreatic β‐cell size, which resulted in defects in the glucose homeostasis. These findings suggest that Jazf1 plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of β‐cells and glucose homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017R1D1A1B03029234cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aNRF‐2018R1D1A1B07049164cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2020010096cMinistry of Science and ICT 3ablood serum 3ac-peptide 3acell lines 3aendoderm 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheterozygosity 3ahomeostasis 3aislets of Langerhans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3azinc finger motif1 aKwon, Wookbong1 aPark, Song1 aJeong, Jain1 aKim, Dongjun1 aJang, Soyoung1 aKim, Si‐Yong1 aSung, Yonghun1 aKim, Myoung Ok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6650-77341 aChoi, Seong‐Kyoon1 aRyoo, Zae Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6993-36240 tFEBS journal.g2021 July, v. 288, no. 14 p.4412-4427dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.157513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245007100203300001800274500002000292520125000312592002801562596002601590596002401616596002301640596002301663596006601686650001201752650001501764650001301779650001501792650001401807700005601821700005801877700006101935700009401996700005602090700005702146700005902203700005802262773013102320856007702451852000902528655001202537IND60789724220221120164705.0220822e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078972422DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0146352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamlington, B.

The combination of data from satellite altimeters, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, and Argo profiling floats has provided a clearer picture of the different contributors to sea level change, leading to an improved understanding of how sea level has changed in the present and, by extension, may change in the future. As the overlap between these records has recently extended past a decade in length, it is worth examining the extent to which internal variability on timescales from intraseasonal to decadal can be separated from long‐term trends that may be expected to continue into the future. To do so, a combined modal decomposition based on cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions is performed simultaneously on the three data sets, and the dominant shared modes of variability are analyzed. Modes associated with the trend, seasonal signal, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and Pacific decadal oscillation are extracted and discussed, and the relationship between regional patterns of sea level change and their associated global signature is highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data  cNASA MEaSUREs Program  a80NSSC17K0564cNASA  aOCE‐1558966cNSF  aOCE‐1834739cNSF  aNRF‐ 2017R1A2B4003930cNational Science Foundation of Korea 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asea level1 aCheon, S.

However, the poor kinetics and degradation of cycling stability retard its practical application. To ease these problems, CeB₆, CeF₃ and CeO₂ nanoparticles with a size of about 10 nm are synthesized by the wet-chemistry method and introduced into NaAlH₄ systems as additives in this work. The results show that all of the nanoparticles are effective in improving the hydriding–dehydriding kinetics of NaAlH₄, and nano-CeB₆ possesses the highest catalytic activity. The rehydrogenation of dehydrogenated NaAlH₄ doped with nano-CeB₆ can be accomplished in less than 20 min with a high capacity of 4.9 wt%, which shows a 20% increase in capacity compared to that of chloride-doped NaAlH₄. Due to the structural stability and good dispersion of nano-CeB₆ and nano-CeF₃, a favorable cycling stability with high capacity retention is achieved for their doped samples. Moreover, hydrogen can be released from the hydrogenated sample doped with nano-CeB₆ at a temperature as low as 75 °C, fulfilling the operation temperature of a PEM fuel cell. In the nano-CeO₂ doped NaAlH₄ system, CeO₂ is first reduced to CeH₂.₅₁. In the subsequent cycles, the formed CeH₂.₅₁ gradually transforms into Ce–Al, and simultaneously the kinetics of the doped system is further enhanced. It is believed that the utilization of Ce-based nanoparticles as catalysts would substantially improve the practical applications of NaAlH₄ for hydrogen storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3aenergy density 3afuel cells 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aXiao, Xuezhang1 aChen, Lixin1 aZhang, Liuting1 aShao, Jie1 aLi, Shouquan1 aGe, Hongwei1 aWang, Qidong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 1, no. 34 p.9752-9759dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11860f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009000161500002000251520148100271592002801752596008401780596008401864596007701948596005102025596005102076596005502127596007002182650002102252650001402273650001502287650001202302650001102314650002302325650001302348650001102361650001302372650001102385700005402396700001402450700005802464773013602522856007702658852000902735655001202744IND60791722320221119095034.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172232DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0181662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yongsheng10aRole of Particle Resuspension in Maintaining Hypoxic Level in the Pearl River Estuary  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEutrophication‐induced seasonal hypoxia in the coastal ocean has widely been attributed to the excessive oxygen consumption induced by settling and deposition of organic particles on sea floor. However, the role of particle resuspension in maintaining the hypoxic level has seldom been investigated based on field observations. Here, we carefully examined particle resuspension and its contribution to oxygen consumption in the Pearl River Estuary in July 2020. The bottom hypoxia was found to appear over the organic‐rich mudbelt off the estuary. Concentrated particles in suspension near the bottom, which were induced by particle resuspension rather than by particle settling, occurred near the front created by shelf salinity intrusions where bottom hypoxia appeared in the summer. The total dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion responsible for bottom hypoxia can be exclusively estimated from the DO budget during the tidal cycle. The water DO depletion dominated by particle resuspension is larger than or at least comparable to sediment oxygen demand. This highlights that the DO budget in the absence of particle resuspension overestimates the DO level in coastal hypoxia. Overall, our results suggest that particle resuspension play a vital role in maintaining the DO level of bottom hypoxia. This finding will be helpful to understand the impact of particle resuspension on coastal hypoxia, as well as other marine environmental problems in estuary and coastal ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  a311020003cSouthern Ocean Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)  a311021004cSouthern Ocean Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)  aU1901209cNational Science Foundation of China‐Guangdong Joint Funding  a41776100cNational Science Foundation of China  a41906141cNational Science Foundation of China  a2019M663207cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2021A1515011637cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 3adissolved oxygen 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aresearch 3arivers 3asalinity 3asummer1 aWu, Jiaxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4114-91811 aTan, Ehui1 aKao, Shuh‐Ji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5054-90990 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2021JC018166-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0181663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245015000162300001800312520106100330592002801391650001701419650001401436650003101450650001701481650001001498650002201508650001201530650002101542650003601563650003201599650002201631650001801653650002401671650001601695650000901711650001701720650002501737650003601762650003201798653002001830653002201850653001001872653001501882700001601897700001801913700001501931700001801946700001401964700001101978700001801989700001202007700001402019700001602033700005302049700005602102773014702158856008002305852000902385655001202394IND60684912720221118051922.0200226e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b077542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Heying10aAlkaloids from Black Pepper (Piper nigrum L.)

Seven new amide alkaloids, pipernigramides A–G (3, 10, 38, and 41–44), a new piperic ester, pipernigrester A (48), along with 47 known compounds were isolated from the EtOH extract of P. nigrum. The inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) of all compounds were then evaluated. Among the tested compounds, three of them (42–44) significantly inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated NO (IC₅₀ = 4.74 ± 0.18, 4.08 ± 0.19, and 3.71 ± 0.32 μM, respectively), and IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE₂ release in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, 42–44 suppressed IκB degradation and further inhibited the cytosol-nucleus translocation of the p65 subunit by targeting IKK-β. In the carrageenan-induced paw edema test, 42–44 demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects as well. These results indicate that all three compounds from P.nigrum have the potential anti-inflammatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiper nigrum 3aalkaloids 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablack pepper 3aedema 3aenzyme inhibition 3aethanol 3afood preparation 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0apipernigramides 0aanti-inflammatory 0aIKKβ 0amacrophage1 aXue, Linlin1 aTang, Minghai1 aTang, Huan1 aKuang, Shuang1 aWang, Lun1 aMa, Xu1 aCai, Xiaoying1 aLi, Yan1 aZhao, Min1 aPeng, Aihua1 aYe, Haoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9185-10401 aChen, Lijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8076-163X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 68, no. 8 p.2406-2417dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b077543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156520169200271592002801963650001501991650001802006650002002024650001302044650001202057650002002069651001202089700002002101700002502121773012802146856007502274852000902349655001202358IND60763569420221120035444.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356942DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140203492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdi, Omid 10aLogging Trail Segmentation via a Novel U-Net Convolutional Neural Network and High-Density Laser Scanning Data  aLogging trails are one of the main components of modern forestry. However, spotting the accurate locations of old logging trails through common approaches is challenging and time consuming. This study was established to develop an approach, using cutting-edge deep-learning convolutional neural networks and high-density laser scanning data, to detect logging trails in different stages of commercial thinning, in Southern Finland. We constructed a U-Net architecture, consisting of encoder and decoder paths with several convolutional layers, pooling and non-linear operations. The canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM), and digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from the laser scanning data and were used as image datasets for training the model. The labeled dataset for the logging trails was generated from different references as well. Three forest areas were selected to test the efficiency of the algorithm that was developed for detecting logging trails. We designed 21 routes, including 390 samples of the logging trails and non-logging trails, covering all logging trails inside the stands. The results indicated that the trained U-Net using DSM (k = 0.846 and IoU = 0.867) shows superior performance over the trained model using CHM (k = 0.734 and IoU = 0.782), DEMₐᵥg (k = 0.542 and IoU = 0.667), and DEMₘᵢₙ (k = 0.136 and IoU = 0.155) in distinguishing logging trails from non-logging trails. Although the efficiency of the developed approach in young and mature stands that had undergone the commercial thinning is approximately perfect, it needs to be improved in old stands that have not received the second or third commercial thinning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acanopy height 3adata collection 3aforestry 3aforests 3aneural networks 3aFinland1 aUusitalo, Jori 1 aKivinen, Veli-Pekka 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245009400204500002000298520163500318592002801953596009801981650001102079650001602090650001502106650001902121650001102140650002402151650001302175650000902188650001402197650001202211651002302223700002202246700005302268773013602321856007702457852000902534655001202543IND60791722420221119095057.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172242DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0178232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMawson, Eleanor E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1398-511210aSea Level Rise and the Great Barrier Reef: The Future Implications on Reef Tidal Dynamics  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPredicted sea‐level rise (SLR) is anticipated to alter tidal dynamics in the future and this will in turn alter coastal ecosystems, flood risk, and geomorphology. Coral reefs are bathymetrically complex environments where tides play a crucial role in larval and nutrient dispersal. This complexity makes coral reef environments challenging to simulate numerically as a large area needs to be simulated but also with high resolution to capture the complexity. To investigate the influence of SLR on tidal dynamics in coral reef systems we use an unstructured mesh numerical model, with spatially varying resolution, of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The present‐day conditions and a total of three future SLR scenarios are considered based on the RCP scenarios. The results focus on the major tidal constituents and tidal range. The M₂ constituent generally decreases across gauge locations as sea‐level rises but S₂ generally increases. O₁ and K₁ display small variations or no change. The tidal range experiences ±10% variation depending on the gauge location, meaning it is spatially varying and alters SLR by up to 10%. Overall, SLR will influence tidal dynamics across the GBR altering coastal flooding risk with a spatially varying impact. Management schemes should consider tidal range changes in addition to increases in extreme weather conditions to provide adequate preservation of the coastline, coastal cities and infrastructure in the future. Moreover, changes in tidal patterns and dynamics may alter the distributions of reef spores and larvae and should be included in future plans of reef management.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of York High Performance Computing service, Viking and the Research Computing team 3acoasts 3acoral reefs 3ageophysics 3ainfrastructure 3alarvae 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3arisk 3asea level 3aweather 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aLee, Katherine C.1 aHill, Jon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1340-43730 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2021JC017823-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0178233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03995naa a2201105 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003800145245010300183300001800286520078400304592002801088650001901116650001001135650001301145650001201158651001501170651003101185700001901216700001901235700002201254700001701276700002301293700001701316700002101333700002001354700002201374700002401396700001901420700002001439700002501459700002301484700002001507700002001527700002601547700002101573700002101594700002101615700002101636700002001657700002201677700002001699700002201719700001801741700002101759700002201780700002401802700001801826700001901844700002101863700002401884700002501908700001901933700002201952700002101974700002201995700002102017700002302038700001802061700003002079700001802109700002202127700002602149700001802175700001902193700001902212700002202231700002002253700001502273700002502288700002002313700001602333700001602349700001702365700003702382700002202419700002302441700001802464700001902482700002202501700002002523700001802543700002202561700002002583700001802603700002002621700002102641773012702662856007902789852000902868655001202877IND60300832620221122041149.0150703e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030083262DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12271632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenniskens, Petrus Matheus Marie,10aRadar-Enabled Recovery of the Sutter’s Mill Meteorite, a Carbonaceous Chondrite Regolith Breccia  ap. 1583-1587.  aThe Meteor That Fell to Earth In April 2012, a meteor was witnessed over the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California.

However, interference multipath must be considered in practical application. In this paper, the antenna array model for interference multipath is analyzed, and an equivalent model for interference multipath is proposed. According to the equivalent interference multipath model, the influence of interference multipath on anti-jamming performance is analyzed from the space only processing (SOP) and space-time adaptive processing (STAP). Interference multipath can cause loss of the degree of freedom (DoF) of SOP. Through analysis of the equivalent model and STAP mechanism, it further reveals how the STAP can solve the interference multipath. The simulation experiments prove that the equivalent model is effective, and the analysis conclusion is correct. This paper also points out that the interference bandwidth is wider and more taps in STAP are required, under the same experiment conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3amodels 3aspace and time1 aLu, Zukun 1 aXiao, Zhibin 1 aRen, Chao 1 aSong, Jie 1 aLi, Baiyu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245015200159520179300311592002802104650002502132650001502157650000902172650001102181650001502192650002002207650001902227650001802246650003202264650001902296651001002315700001402325700002902339700001502368773011802383856007702501852000902578655001202587IND60771338420221116140848.0220325e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077133842DNAL7 a10.3390/land110303352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaohan 10aAssessment of Critical Diffusion Factors of Public–Private Partnership and Social Policy: Evidence from Mainland Prefecture-Level Cities in China  aCooperation between government and social capital is an important starting point in the supply-side reform of public services. It is also an effective practice in public governance innovation. Based on policy diffusion theory and event history analysis (EHA), this study analyzes panel data from 282 mainland prefecture-level cities in China from 2004–2020 to explore public–private partnerships’ critical diffusion factors. The study reveals that motivation factors, resource/obstacle factors, and external factors affect government and social capital cooperation policies to different extents. The main driving forces for local governments to adopt these policies are population size, level of economic development, government financial resources, the learning mechanism, and the imitation mechanism. This study proposes the following arguments: firstly, that the ultimate goal of policy innovation is to solve social contradictions and meet public demand; secondly, that economic resources can help to adopt policy innovation and proper diffusion; thirdly, that the public–private partnership (PPP) model has been continuously developed by using experience from other projects or cities through a learning mechanism; and finally, that policy publicity and public opinion expressed via the mainstream media are not only an inducement for policy innovation and diffusion, but also a powerful guarantee. The experience of local governments in China can help to verify whether the “positive factors” that are traditionally considered to be conducive to the cooperation between the government and social capital are effective, and to reveal the internal logic of the innovation diffusion of public policies of local governments in China from a more multidimensional perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3agovernance 3aland 3amodels 3amotivation 3apopulation size 3apublic opinion 3apublic policy 3apublic-private partnerships 3asocial capital 3aChina1 aLv, Yang 1 aSarker, Md Nazirul Islam1 aZeng, Xun 0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110303353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245007900205500002000284520160900304592002801913596003501941596006901976650001502045650002402060650001302084650001502097651001902112651001102131651001402142651001802156651001202174651001602186700006002202700005902262700005902321700005802380773013602438856007702574852000902651655001202660IND60791722620221119095028.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172262DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0179872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Boog, C.

Although it is well established that these anticyclones are formed near the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea, which is demarcated by the Lesser Antilles, the source of their anticyclonic vorticity remains unclear. To gain insight into this source, we analyze the fluxes of vorticity into the Caribbean at its eastern boundary using a high‐resolution numerical model. We find that the anticyclonic vorticity in the eastern Caribbean Sea predominantly originates from regions where intense ocean currents flow close to the Lesser Antilles. More specifically, St. Lucia and Grenada are hotspots for vorticity generation. The local generation rate scales with the amplitude of the volume transport through the passages between these islands. This finding is in contrast with the view that anticyclonic North Brazil Current (NBC) rings in the Atlantic Ocean are the main source of anticyclonic vorticity in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Our analyses reveal that the direct contribution of the vorticity of the NBC rings is of lesser importance than the local generation. However, the collision of upstream NBC rings with the Lesser Antilles increases the volume transport through the passages into the Caribbean Sea, so that their presence indirectly leads to enhanced local production of anticyclonic vorticity. This process is an example of the importance of vorticity generation near topography, which is ubiquitous in the oceans, and expected to be important whenever currents and steep topography meet.  aPublisher supplied data  cDelft University of Technology  a858.14.061cThe Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3atopography 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aCaribbean Sea 3aGrenada 3aSaint Lucia1 aMolemaker, M.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the Pt₂(CCPy)₂ fragment of 1 exhibits an approximately linear molecular geometry, in which the Pt–Pt bond may be considered as having been inserted within the delocalized π-electron system of the 1,4-bis(4′-pyridyl)buta-1,3-diyne. The ability of the two terminal pyridyl nitrogen atoms of 1 to coordinate to other metal centers has enabled the use of 1 as a linking ligand in the layer-by-layer (LbL) growth of heterometallic films. The self-assembly behavior of 1 with Pd(ii), supported by chloride counter ions, on poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) functionalized solid surfaces has been investigated. The resulting multilayer films of general composition and form (PdCl₂/1)ₙ have been characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). On the basis of the UV-vis spectroscopic data, it was shown that the (PdCl₂/1)ₙ multilayer films could be grown in a regular fashion, with film thickness increasing linearly with increasing deposition of the metal–ligand bilayers. Consistent with this metal ion dependent LbL growth, AFM images of the multilayer films exhibited island-shaped nanostructures with a mean diameter of about 25 nm. The catalytic properties of the (PdCl₂/1)ₙ multilayers were investigated, and (PdCl₂/1)ₙ film-loaded slides were used as a catalyst reservoir capable of liberating catalytic amounts of a highly active Pd species, which was suitable for promoting C–C bond formations. The catalyst loading was as low as 2.76 × 10⁻⁶ mol% and gave high yields. The LbL catalyst and the technology presented in this work, show distinctive features that include extraordinarily low loading and high catalytic active characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3ageometry 3aions 3aligands 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aZhao, Xiuhua1 aGao, Shuiying1 aMarqués-González, Santiago1 aYufit, Dmitry S.1 aHoward, J.

The eLoran receiver measures time-of-arrival (TOA) through cycle identification, which is key in determining timing and positioning accuracy. However, noise and skywave interference can cause cycle identification errors, resulting in TOA-measurement errors that are integral multiples of 10 μs. Therefore, this article proposes a cycle identification method in the joint time–frequency domain. Based on the spectrum-division method to determine the cycle identification range, the time–domain peak-to-peak ratio and waveform matching are used for accurate cycle identification. The performance of the method is analyzed via simulation. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 0 dB and skywave-to-groundwave ratio (SGR) ≤ 23 dB, the success rate of cycle identification is 100%; when SNR ≥ −13 dB and SGR ≤ 23 dB, the success rate exceeds 75%. To verify its practicability, the method was implemented in the eLoran receiver and tested at three test sites within 1000 km using actual signals emitted by an eLoran system. The results show that the method has a high identification probability and can be used in modern eLoran receivers to improve TOA-measurement accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexhibitions 3aglobal positioning systems 3aprobability 3aremote sensing 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3atesting1 aDong, Ming 1 aLi, Shifeng 1 aYang, Chaozhong 1 aYuan, Jiangbin 1 aHu, Zhaopeng 1 aYu, Hua,0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140202503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245014000160300001800300520120600318592002801524650002401552650001601576650001301592650002101605650002501626650001001651650002601661650001701687650002801704650002801732650001601760650002301776650001001799650003101809650000901840650001101849653004501860653002001905653002001925653003501945700006201980700002102042700002202063700001802085700001902103700001902122700002102141700002502162700002402187773014702211856008002358852000902438655001202447IND60684913020221118051908.0200226e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b081952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Yuki10aOrganophosphate Agent Induces ADHD-Like Behaviors via Inhibition of Brain Endocannabinoid-Hydrolyzing Enzyme(s) in Adolescent Male Rats  ap. 2547-2553.  aAnticholinergic organophosphate (OP) agents act on the diverse serine hydrolases, thereby revealing unexpected biological effects. Epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between the OP exposure and development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms, whereas no plausible mechanism for the OP-induced ADHD has been established. The present investigation employs ethyl octylphosphonofluoridate (EOPF) as an OP-probe, which is an extremely potent inhibitor of endocannabinoid (EC, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol)-hydrolyzing enzymes: that is, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). An ex vivo experiment shows that EOPF treatment decreases FAAH and MAGL activities and conversely increases EC levels in the rat brain. Subsequently, EOPF (treated intraperitoneally once at 0, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg) clearly induces ADHD-like behaviors (in elevated plus-maze test) in both Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The EOPF-induced behaviors are reduced by a concomitant administration of cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist SLV-319. Accordingly, the EC system is a feasible target for OP-caused ADHD-like behaviors in adolescent rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylglycerol lipase 3aadolescents 3aagonists 3aamide hydrolases 3abioactive properties 3abrain 3acannabinoid receptors 3acannabinoids 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aepidemiological studies 3afatty acids 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3arats 3aserine 0aattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 0aorganophosphate 0aendocannabinoid 0aspontaneously hypertensive rat1 aTomizawa, Motohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5579-41141 aSuzuki, Kazutaka1 aShirakawa, Yuichi1 aOno, Hiromasa1 aAdachi, Keishi1 aSuzuki, Himiko1 aShimomura, Kenji1 aNabeshima, Toshitaka1 aKamijima, Michihiro0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 68, no. 8 p.2547-2553dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b081953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245014500209500001400354520204200368592002802410650003002438650002802468650002902496650002202525650002702547650001902574650001702593650001202610653001902622653001802641653001702659653002202676773011002698856008802808852000902896655001202905IND60727687820221123035529.0210401e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadoret, A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1074-525210aConflicts and acceptability of visitation management measures for a marine protected area: The case of Porquerolles, Port-Cros National Park  aNAL-light  aAlong the touristic coastlines, Marine Protected Areas are particularly coveted by an increasing number of visitors. This influx has encouraged the implementation of monitoring and management measures by managers of protected areas that promote tourism consistent with biodiversity conservation. However, the choices that need to be made to enforce these measures are particularly complex for they need to take into account the concerns of not only a territory that produces wealth for the local population and those who live in close proximity (due to the attraction to tourists) but also those of a territory that is sensitive and vulnerable environmentally speaking. With regard to the approach initiated by the Port-Cros National Park on the carrying capacity and character of the Park's core areas, we conducted a conflict diagnosis on Porquerolles, an island within the core area. Our aim was to bring to light the territorial realities relating to past and recent conflict situations, the reasons for disputes and the methods of managing them, thus providing focal points that would be useful to help with implementing measures relating to visitation to the island. This study, comprised of interviews, questionnaires, in-situ observations and analyses of legal documents, enabled us to go back over the conflicting history of the territory. It revealed a characterisation and spatialisation of disputes, including breaches of the Environmental Code. This research provided a framework within which the factors influencing the acceptability of visitor management measures could be reflected upon. Three conditions necessary for acceptability were identified for the island of Porquerolles using the conflict analysis: recognising and addressing a differential threshold of acceptance relating to visitation; strengthening trust between the different stakeholders and the proximities on the territory; envisaging a firmer penal policy to reduce the feeling of injustice associated with specific efforts in environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3acoastal zone management 3aenvironmental protection 3aissues and policy 3amarine protected areas 3anational parks 3astakeholders 3atourism 0aConflictuality 0aAcceptability 0aTourist flow 0aCarrying capacity0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 204 p.105547-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007300154520160200227592002801829650001001857650001501867650001901882700001901901700001501920700001701935700002101952700001401973700001801987773012802005856007502133852000902208655001202217IND60763569720221123021447.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356972DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140203522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Rui 10aPreliminary Analysis and Evaluation of BDS-3 RDSS Timing Performance  aRadio determination satellite service (RDSS) is one of the characteristic services of Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS), and also distinguishes with other GNSS systems. BDS-3 RDSS adopts new signals, which is compatible with BDS-2 RDSS signals in order to guarantee the services of old users. Moreover, the new signals also separate civil signals and military signals which are modulated on different carriers to improve their isolation and RDSS service performance. Timing is an important part of RDSS service, which has been widely used in the field of the power, transportation, marine and others. Therefore, the timing accuracy, availability and continuity is an important guarantee for RDSS service. This paper summarizes the principle of one-way and two-way timing, and provides the evaluation method of RDSS timing accuracy, availability and continuity. Based on BDS-3 RDSS signal measurements of system, the performance of one-way timing and two-way timing is analyzed and evaluated for the first time. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of one-way timing and two-way timing is better than 30 ns and 8 ns respectively, which are better than the official claimed accuracy; (2) the RMS of one-way timing accuracy is 5.45 ns, which is 20% smaller than BDS-2, and the availability and continuity are 100%; (3) the RMS of two-way timing accuracy is 3.59 ns, which is 34% smaller than one-way timing, and both of the availability and continuity are 100%; (4) the orbit maneuver of GEO satellite make the one-way timing has 7.68 h recovery, but has no affection on the two-way timing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aradio 3asatellites 3atransportation1 aWang, Dongxia 1 aXing, Nan 1 aLiu, Zhijun 1 aZhang, Tianqiao 1 aRen, Hui 1 aLichuanjushi,0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245009700198500002000295520159100315592002801906596010001934596010102034596009502135596012002230596007102350650001102421650001502432650001502447650001802462650002402480650001302504650001902517650000902536651001802545651001402563700005902577700005802636773013602694856007702830852000902907655001202916IND60791722820221119095055.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172282DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0184042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Ruijian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0549-072614aThe Changing Behavior of the West Greenland Current System in a Very High‐Resolution Model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnalyzing a high‐resolution (1/60°) numerical model over 2008–2018, the inter‐annual variability of the West Greenland Coastal Current (WGCC) on the shelf and West Greenland Current (WGC) at the shelf break is presented. Both currents flow from Cape Farewell and extend to Davis Strait, with their speeds and transports corresponding well with observations. The trend over the study period of the WGCC and WGC strength near southwest Greenland are opposite, with the former declining while the latter strengthened, both by a speed change above 0.1 m/s. Both currents are predominantly buoyancy forced, but wind forcing becomes more dominant approaching Davis Strait. The main exchanges from the two currents with the interior of the Labrador Sea occur between Cape Desolation and Fylla Bank. The net volume, freshwater, heat transport decreases between these two sections are 1.4 Sv, 13 mSv, 36.7 TW, respectively. The freshwater transport of the WGC itself does not drop in between these sections, receiving freshwater from the WGCC to compensate for the losses to the basin interior. Thus, we see significant freshwater (83.1 mSv) and heat transports (70.7 TW) of the WGC remaining at Fylla Bank that reach the northern basin instead of being fluxed into the interior of the Labrador Sea. This suggests that the exchange between the boundary current system and the interior is more limited than previously thought, and most of the Greenland and Arctic melt reaches the northern Labrador Sea. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the WGCC and shelf processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a227438‐09cGouvernement du Canada Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a2020‐04344cGouvernement du Canada Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a433898cGouvernement du Canada Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a218812cMercator Ocean, Groupe Mission Mercator Coriolis and the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme  a202161058cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3abasins 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3awater currents 3awind 3aArctic region 3aGreenland1 aPennelly, Clark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2874-42341 aMyers, Paul G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-26540 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018404-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0184043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245008300162300001600245520162600261592002801887650002101915650002401936650001501960650002601975650003102001650001602032650001202048650001302060650001502073650001702088653001602105653002702121653002502148653000902173700001902182700001702201700001802218773010202236856008102338852000902419655001202428IND4461646620221121114342.0151127e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446164662DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-10-00123.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrosnan, J.

Experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 evaluating the use of fenoxaprop (25, 50, 75, and 100 g ha⁻¹) for ‘Riviera’ bermudagrass seedhead suppression and growth regulation compared to imazapic (52 g ha⁻¹), trinexapac-ethyl (91 g ha⁻¹) and mefluidide (561 g ha⁻¹). In field experiments, seedhead suppression ranged from 77 to 100%% for fenoxaprop and imazapic at 35 d after treatment (DAT). Comparatively, seedhead suppression was < 25%% for either trinexapac-ethyl or mefluidide at 35 DAT. Seedhead suppression was > 90%% from 7 to 35 DAT for fenoxaprop applied at ≥ 50 g ha⁻¹. Injury, determined visually, from fenoxaprop and imazapic in both the field and greenhouse measured < 25%% on all rating dates, with no significant injury present after 21 DAT. In greenhouse experiments, fenoxaprop and trinexapac-ethyl showed similar reductions of bermudagrass growth; no differences in aboveground biomass were detected between these treatments at 42 DAT. Results of the current study illustrate that fenoxaprop and imazapic can be applied for bermudagrass seedhead suppression and growth regulation if moderate (< 25%%) injury can be tolerated up to 21 DAT. Additional research is needed to evaluate the use of fenoxaprop and imazapic for seedhead suppression on other common and hybrid bermudagrasses.Nomenclature: Fenoxaprop; imazapic; mefluidide; trinexapac-ethyl; bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.)

While composting is an efficient way to reduce ARGs, most conventional methods are ineffective at processing highly contaminated antibiotic fermentation waste. Here we explored the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of hyperthermophilic composting at removing tylosin antibiotic fermentation residues (TFR) and associated ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs; plasmids, integrons and transposon). Hyperthermophilic composting removed 95.0% of TFR, 75.8% of ARGs and 98.5% of MGEs and this reduction mainly occurred after extended exposure to temperatures above 60 °C for at least 6 days. Based on sequencing and culture-dependent experiments, reduction in ARGs and MGEs was strongly associated with a decrease in the number of bacterial taxa that were initially associated with ARGs and MGEs. Moreover, we found 94.1% reduction in plasmid genes abundances (ISCR1 and IncQ-oriV) that significantly correlated with reduced ARGs during the composting, which suggests that plasmids were the main carriers for ARGs. We verified this using direct culturing to show that ARGs were more often found in plasmids during the early phase of composting. Together these results suggest that hyperthermophilic composting is efficient at removing ARGs and associated resistance genes from antibiotic fermentation waste by decreasing the abundance of antibiotic resistance plasmids and associated host bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacteria 3acomposting 3afermentation 3aplasmids 3atemperature 3atransposons 3atylosin 3awastes 0aAntibiotic residue 0aHyperthermophilic composting 0aHorizontal gene transfer1 aZhao, Qian1 aCui, Peng1 aChen, Zhi1 aYu, Zhen1 aGeisen, Stefan1 aFriman, Ville-Petri1 aZhou, Shungui0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Sept. 19, dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1052033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012700174300001200301500001900313520147100332592002801803596005401831596007801885596009201963650001202055650001102067650001402078650002302092650002102115650001502136650001502151650000902166650001302175650001602188650001102204650001402215650001202229650000902241650002002250650001802270651001502288700006402303700002502367700002102392700001502413700002102428700002002449700006302469773012902532856008202661852000902743655001202752IND60696461120221118121523.0200620e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069646112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-020-01227-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAman, Efdtekhar U.

A Pt–Cu electrode has been exploited to measure selective nitrate concentration, and corrosion rate of iron has been proposed to indicate relative abundance of dissolved contaminants. In order to evaluate the pollution level, water parameters of river Buriganga have been compared with those obtained from two freshwater streams named Surma and Dawki of the country. An iron strip in contact with Buriganga river water is corroded three times rapidly compared to its contact with Dawki or Surma river water indicates acute contamination of Buriganga river water. The River Buriganga is facing acute pollution from the point of high TDS (0.664–0.694 g/L), low DO (1.47–4.4 mg/L), high COD (197–218 mg/L), high ammonia (270–420 mg/L) and high nitrate concentration (107–157 mg/L). Negative ORP value (− 292 to − 310 mV) of Buriganga river water indicates that the stream contains high level reducing species. Meanwhile, positive ORP value indicates that Dawki (+ 203 to + 209 mV) and Surma (+ 184 to + 205 mV) river water contain oxidizing species. Sediment analysis shows the deposition of disintegrated organic pollutants on the bottom of the River Buriganga.

Impervious surface estimation is a significant method for evaluating urbanization, so that countries and cities can deal with their growing populations. The impervious surface area was estimated through Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image extraction, the V-H-L-S (vegetation, high-albedo, low-albedo, and soil) model, and linear spectral un-mixing analysis (LSUM). Changes in fractions of endmembers over periods of time were identified and employed to analyze changes in land use and land cover (LULC). The research adopting the V-H-L-S model for classifying land cover and exploring the association of change in impervious surface areas and socio-economic growth over a period of time is limited. In this study, impervious surface estimations for Hong Kong and Shenzhen in 1995, 2005, and 2016 were compared, selecting vegetation, high-albedo, low-albedo, and soil as endmembers. The change rate of the fractions in the four endmembers was calculated to identify changes in land use and land cover during these three specific time periods. The impervious surface was determined to constitute a combination of high-albedo and low-albedo. Moreover, a proportional relationship exists between the increase in impervious surface area, population rate, GDP, and GDP per capita in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen. However, there was a difference in the increase in impervious surface area between Hong Kong and Shenzhen due to the different land-use policies in the country’s two systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aland cover 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil 3asurface area 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aChina1 aZhang, Yuanzhi 1 aCheng, Qiuming 1 aChao, Ming Chun1 aTsou, Jin Yeu0 tLand.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110304303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245011600201500002000317520130600337592002801643596004701671596004801718650001101766650001401777650001501791650001301806650000901819650001401828650001001842700002001852700006301872773013601935856007702071852000902148655001202157IND60791719020221119212443.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079171902DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JF0066212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahdarian, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4881-928810aOn the Influence of Antecedent Morphology on Development of Equilibrium Bathymetry in Estuaries Past and Future  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough analytical and numerical models have been widely used to explore evolution and equilibrium morphology in tidal environments, less attention has been paid to examining the impact of initial bathymetry on the model outcomes. Here we use two‐dimensional idealized models with contrasting initial bathymetries to study how the interactions between antecedent morphology and tidal exchange processes determine the establishment of an estuarine equilibrium bathymetry, and how these interactions mediate the morphodynamic response to rising sea levels. In all model runs with sandy beds, inter‐tidal zones reach the equilibrium condition first and equilibrium profiles are similar for points close to mean seal level. However, key aspects like channel formation, residence time and energy dissipation do not evolve to the same state and are inherited from the initial bathymetry. This implies that responses to sea‐level rise (SLR) are different as well. Conversely, in cases with mud and sand input at the boundaries, equilibrium occurs more quickly and the equilibrium bathymetry and channel formation are dominated by the boundary mud concentration. General implications of the study are that predictions of coastal response to changes such as SLR depend on initial bathymetric conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Waikato Doctoral Scholarship  cNational Science Challenge Sustainable Seas 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asand 3asea level 3aseals1 aBryan, Karin R.1 aVan Der Wegen, Mick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5227-26790 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JF006621-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JF0066213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245005700162300001600219520155100235592002801786650001501814650003601829650001701865650001201882650001501894650003401909650001701943650001501960650002501975650001702000650002202017650001002039650001902049650001102068650001502079650001402094650001402108650002102122650002802143650001402171651001602185653001002201653001802211653004802229653001502277700001802292700001702310700001902327700002102346700001702367773013902384856007802523852000902601655001202610IND60663645320221120205758.0191004e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364532DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.22982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIm, Jae Hyoung10aCurrent Status of Tick-Borne Diseases in South Korea  ap. 225-233.  aBackground: Bites with tick-borne pathogens can cause various bacterial, viral, or parasitic diseases in humans. Tick-transmitted diseases are known as contributing factors to the increasing incidence and burden of diseases. The present article investigated the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in South Korea. Methods: The incidence and distribution of common tick-borne diseases in Korea (Lyme disease, Q fever, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS]) were investigated and analyzed, using data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) infectious disease reporting system. A literature review was compiled on the current status of uncommon tick-borne diseases (Rickettsia, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis, tularemia, tick-borne encephalitis, and babesiosis). Results and Conclusions: In South Korea, SFTS is an emerging disease, showing a rapid increase in reports since 2012, with high mortality. Likewise, reports of Lyme disease and Q fever cases have also been rapidly increasing during 2012–2017, although caution should be taken when interpreting these results, considering the likely influence of increased physician awareness and reporting of these diseases. Other tick-borne diseases reported in South Korea included spotted fever group rickettsiae, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Bartonella, and babesiosis. Evidences on human infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus and Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever were recently unavailable, but both need constant monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBartonella 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever 3aLyme disease 3aQ fever 3aRickettsia 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3aanaplasmosis 3ababesiosis 3adisease transmission 3aehrlichiosis 3aemerging diseases 3afever 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apathogens 3athrombocytopenia 3atick-borne encephalitis 3atularemia 3aSouth Korea 0aKorea 0aRickettsia sp 0asevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 0atick-borne1 aBaek, JiHyeon1 aDurey, Areum1 aKwon, Hea Yoon1 aChung, Moon-Hyun1 aLee, Jin-Soo0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 19, no. 4 p.225-233dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2018.22983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01564naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100003200154245007100186300001600257520073800273592002801011650001001039650002501049650002901074773014101103856005701244852000901301655001201310IND4480353020221122035025.0120418e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448035302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1989.tb00689.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, P.

Examples include the CRETH, translog, generalised power and generalised McFadden functions. Moreover, given a function which is a member of this family, the individual commodity yield and production functions can be recovered.

Pregnant women are a vulnerable population and measures to reduce exposure in this group are important. We undertook a study of maternal exposure to the metals, aluminium, arsenic, copper, cobalt, chromium, lithium, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, uranium and zinc in 173 participants across Western Australia. Each participant provided a whole blood and urine sample, as well as drinking water, residential soil and dust samples and completed a questionnaire. In general the concentrations of metals in all samples were low with the notable exception of uranium (blood U mean 0.07µg/L, range <0.01–0.25µg/L; urinary U mean 0.018µg/g creatinine, range <0.01–0.199µg/g creatinine). Factors that influenced biological concentrations were consumption of fish which increased urinary arsenic concentrations, hobbies (including mechanics and welding) which increased blood manganese concentrations and iron/folic acid supplement use which was associated with decreased concentrations of aluminium and nickel in urine and manganese in blood. Environmental concentrations of aluminium, copper and lithium were found to influence biological concentrations, but this was not the case for other environmental metals concentrations. Further work is underway to explore the influence of diet on biological metals concentrations in more detail. The high concentrations of uranium require further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aat-risk population 3ablood 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3acreatinine 3adrinking water 3afish consumption 3afolic acid 3airon 3alithium 3amanganese 3amechanics 3anickel 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3arecreation 3aselenium 3asoil 3auranium 3aurine 3azinc 3aWestern Australia 0aMetals 0aMaternal exposure 0aBlood 0aUrine 0aBiomarkers1 aHinwood, A.L.1 aRamalingam, M.1 aBoyce, M.1 aHeyworth, J.1 aMcCafferty, P.1 aOdland, J.Ø.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2013 Oct., v. 126 p.111-117dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014800158300001800306500002000324520148500344592002801829596004601857650002501903650001901928650002901947650001701976650002001993650002002013650003002033650001802063650001202081650001402093650001902107650002002126700002102146700002002167700006002187773011602247856007302363852000902436655001202445IND60750118620221122213856.0210910e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075011862DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.153722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlrich, Louisa14aThe jasmonoyl‐isoleucine receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 suppresses defense gene expression in Arabidopsis roots independently of its ligand  ap. 1119-1130.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe F‐box protein CORONANTINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) serves as the receptor for the plant hormone jasmonoyl‐isoleucine (JA‐Ile). COI1, its co‐receptors of the JASMONATE ZIM‐domain (JAZ) protein family, and JA‐Ile form a functional unit that regulates growth or defense mechanisms in response to various stress cues. Strikingly, COI1, but not JA‐Ile, is required for susceptibility of Arabidopsis thaliana towards the soil‐borne vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum. In order to obtain marker genes for further analysis of this JA‐Ile‐independent COI1 function, transcriptome analysis of roots of coi1 and allene oxide synthase (aos) plants (impaired in JA biosynthesis) was performed. Intriguingly, nearly all of the genes that are differentially expressed in coi1 versus aos and wild type are constitutively more highly expressed in coi1. To support our notion that COI1 acts independently of its known downstream signaling components, coi1 plants were complemented with a COI1 variant (COI1AA) that is compromised in its interaction with JAZs. As expected, these plants showed only weak induction of the expression of the JA‐Ile marker gene VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN2 after wounding and remained sterile. On the other hand, genes affected by COI1 but not by JA‐Ile were still strongly repressed by COI1AA. We suggest that COI1 has a potential moonlighting function that serves to repress gene expression in a JA‐Ile‐ and JAZ‐independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA330/24cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aF-box proteins 3aVerticillium longisporum 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3ahydroperoxide dehydratase 3ajasmonic acid 3aligands 3apathogens 3aplant hormones 3atranscriptomics1 aSchmitz, Johanna1 aThurow, Corinna1 aGatz, Christiane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2741-85140 tplant journal.g2021 Aug., v. 107, no. 4 p.1119-1130dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.153723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01605naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010800168300001800276520043700294592002800731650002100759650001100780650002500791650002100816653001700837653001800854653001800872653002500890700002100915700002300936700005900959773014301018856008501161852000901246655001201255IND60696457420200811000000.0200526e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c022232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrätz, Sven10aMechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation with Elemental Copper: An Alternative Pathway toward Nanographenes  ap. 7569-7573.  aElemental copper can be utilized to generate C–C bonds in order to synthesize nanographenes in a mechanochemical environment.

The method is one-pot, scalable, and produces nanoclusters that are stable in aqueous solution for at least 9 months at room temperature under ambient conditions, with very little degradation to their unique UV-Vis optical absorption spectrum. The composition, size, and monodispersity were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. The produced nanoclusters are likely to be in a superatom charge-state of m = 4−, due to the fact that their optical absorption spectrum shares most of the unique features of the intense and broadly absorbing nanoparticles identified as [Ag₄₄(SR)₃₀]⁴⁻ by Harkness et al. (Nanoscale, 2012, 4, 4269). A protocol to transfer the nanoclusters to organic solvents is also described. Using the disperse nanoclusters in organic media, we fabricated solid-state films of [Ag₄₄(SR)₃₀]ᵐ that retained all the distinct features of the optical absorption spectrum of the nanoclusters in solution. The films were studied by X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy in order to investigate their crystallinity, atomic composition and valence band structure. The stability, scalability, and the film fabrication method demonstrated in this work pave the way towards the crystallization of [Ag₄₄(SR)₃₀]ᵐ and its full structural determination by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Moreover, due to their unique and attractive optical properties with multiple optical transitions, we anticipate these clusters to find practical applications in light-harvesting, such as photovoltaics and photocatalysis, which have been hindered so far by the instability of previous generations of the cluster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar energy 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis 3aultracentrifugation1 aAshraf, Sumaira1 aKatsiev, Khabiboulakh1 aKirmani, Ahmad R.1 aKothalawala, Nuwan1 aAnjum, Dalaver H.1 aAbbas, Sikandar1 aAmassian, A.q(Aram),1 aStellacci, Francesco1 aDass, Amala1 aHussain, Irshad1 aBakr, Osman M.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 1, no. 35 p.10148-10154dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta11785e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008300162300001500245500002000260520111800280592002801398650000901426650002101435650001901456650002301475650001401498650002001512650001601532700001901548700002301567773014301590856007401733852000901807655001201816IND60786600320221120185144.0220804e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660032DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.10462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, Beverly B.10aEvaluating Options for Regenerant Brine Reuse in Magnetic Ion Exchange Systems  ap. E2-E10.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this work was to provide an empirical foundation for decisions regarding regenerant brine management in anion exchange systems for the removal of compounds that absorb ultraviolet (UV) light at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV₂₅₄) in drinking water treatment. Regenerant performance was assessed for fresh regenerant brine, reused regenerant brine, and used brine that had been treated with aluminum sulfate (alum) before reuse. Jar tests were conducted to examine the UV₂₅₄ reduction achieved by resins treated with each of these regenerants. Over three regeneration cycles, resin treated with continuously reused regenerant did not display a significant decline in UV₂₅₄ reduction. While treatment with alum was effective for removing UV₂₅₄‐absorbing compounds from used regenerant brine, this treatment did not improve the brine's performance as a regenerant. These results demonstrate that regenerant brine may be reused several times without any intermediate treatment, which provides a cost‐saving solution for treatment plants seeking to install anion exchange systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3aaluminum sulfate 3aanion exchange 3acost effectiveness 3amagnetism 3awater utilities 3awavelengths1 aBoyer, Treavor1 aIndarawis, Katrina0 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2018 May, v. 110, no. 5 p.E2-E10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/awwa.10463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013000170300001800300520140900318592002801727650001601755650001801771650002601789650002101815650002501836650001601861650001201877650001601889650001101905650001601916650001201932650001701944650001701961650002401978650000902002650001102011653004102022653003002063653004202093653003302135700001702168700001602185700001202201700005602213773014302269856008502412852000902497655001202506IND60696457520221121035735.0200526e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645752DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b077022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuechao10aFerrihydrite Reduction Exclusively Stimulated Hydrogen Production by Clostridium with Community Metabolic Pathway Bifurcation  ap. 7574-7580.  aThe influence of fermentative iron reduction on hydrogen-producing metabolism is rarely studied. In this study, the benefits of dissimilatory iron reduction with respect to dark fermentation hydrogen production were exploited by adding the iron hydroxide mineral ferrihydrite to a heat-shocked consortium. The results showed that ferrihydrite reduction significantly promoted biohydrogen by reshaping the bacterial community, redirecting metabolic pathways, and stimulating bacterial growth, resulting in elevated carbon and electron conversion efficiencies. Furthermore, the mechanisms of hydrogen enhancement were illustrated. Ferrihydrite reduction exclusively enriched hydrogen producers, as most fermentative iron reducers are intimately related to hydrogen-producing ability. Ferrihydrite supplementation efficiently regulated the release of ferrous needed for hydrogenase or ferredoxin, and ferrihydrite reduction protected against system acidification due to organic acid accumulation. Although only approximately 3% of the reducing equivalents obtained from the substrate shifted to ferrihydrite reduction, iron reduction distinctly benefited the fermentation hydrogen-producing metabolism. The current study is expected to provide basic and engineering data for the bioreactor design of practical bioprocesses aimed at stable and prolonged hydrogen production from sustainable or waste biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aacidification 3abacterial communities 3abacterial growth 3abiochemical pathways 3abiohydrogen 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3aferrihydrite 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3awastes 0aDissimilatory ferrihydrite reduction 0aFermentative iron reducer 0aDark fermentation hydrogen production 0aEnergy conversion efficiency1 aXiao, Leilei1 aHao, Qinqin1 aLi, Xin1 aLiu, Fanghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1934-36740 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 May 01, v. 8, no. 20 p.7574-7580dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b077023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00971naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005700159300001400216500002000230520012800250592002800378650001500406650001500421650002000436651001200456773014200468856007400610852000900684655001200693IND60786600420221120185218.0220804e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660042DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.10792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatko, Tapio S.10aWater Services Development and Governance in Finland  ap. 50-55.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWater and wastewater services have developed remarkably well in Finland by following a principle of continuous development.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3awastewater 3awater utilities 3aFinland0 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2018 May, v. 110, no. 5 p.50-55dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/awwa.10793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245015300176520117900329592002801508650001201536650001401548650001501562650001601577650001901593650002501612650002201637651001301659700002601672700001801698700001801716700002601734700002801760773012801788856008701916852000902003655001202012IND60768433720221120124700.0220225e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843372DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100204102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadzlin, Nurfatini 10aGenome Analysis of Celeribacter sp. PS-C1 Isolated from Sekinchan Beach in Selangor, Malaysia, Reveals Its β-Glucosidase and Licheninase Activities  aA halophilic marine bacterial strain, PS-C1, was isolated from Sekinchan beach in Selangor, Malaysia. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain PS-C1 was associated with the genus Celeribacter. To date, there have been no reports on enzymes from the genus Celeribacter. The present study reports on the cellular features of Celeribacter sp. PS-C1, its annotated genome sequence, and comparative genome analyses of Celeribacter glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes. The genome of strain PS-C1 has a size of 3.87 Mbp and a G+C content of 59.10%, and contains 3739 protein-coding genes. Detailed analysis using the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database revealed that Celeribacter genomes harboured at least 12 putative genes encoding industrially important GHs that are grouped as cellulases, β-glucanases, hemicellulases, and starch-degrading enzymes. Herein, the potential applications of these enzymes are discussed. Furthermore, the activities of two types of GHs (β-glucosidase and licheninase) in strain PS-C1 were demonstrated. These findings suggest that strain PS-C1 could be a reservoir of novel GH enzymes for lignocellulosic biomass degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adatabases 3aglycosides 3alicheninase 3alignocellulose 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3aMalaysia1 aYaakop, Amira Suriaty1 aGoh, Kian Mau1 aLiew, Kok Jun1 aZakaria, Iffah Izzati1 aKahar, Ummirul Mukminin0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010100167500001900268520104200287592002801329650002101357650002901378650002501407650001701432650001301449700002501462700001801487700002001505700001901525773012101544856007901665852000901744655001201753IND60732031420221119235100.0210326e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073203142DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100302162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeraldi, Almando 10aSynthetic Scaffold Systems for Increasing the Efficiency of Metabolic Pathways in Microorganisms  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobes have been the preferred hosts for producing high-value chemicals from cheap raw materials. However, metabolic flux imbalance, the presence of competing pathways, and toxic intermediates often lead to low production efficiency. The spatial organization of the substrates, intermediates, and enzymes is critical to ensuring efficient metabolic activity by microorganisms. One of the most common approaches for bringing the key components of biosynthetic pathways together is through molecular scaffolds, which involves the clustering of pathway enzymes on engineered molecules via different interacting mechanisms. In particular, synthetic scaffold systems have been applied to improve the efficiency of various heterologous and synthetic pathways in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with varying degrees of success. Herein, we review the recent developments and applications of protein-based and nucleic acid-based scaffold systems and discuss current challenges and future directions in the use of such approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3atoxicity1 aKhairunnisa, Fatiha 1 aFarah, Nadya 1 aBùi, Lê Minh,1 aRahman, Ziaur 0 tBiology.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100302163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014500164520095900309592002801268650002501296650001501321650001901336650001701355650000901372650001301381650001901394650001901413650002401432650001101456650001201467653002101479653003201500653002501532653001201557653001901569653001601588700001201604700001601616700001801632700001201650700001901662700001501681700001601696700001601712773010001728856008701828852000901915655001201924IND60755852020221119195221.0220426e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1315302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMi, Jie10aEffect of acetylated distarch adipate on the physicochemical characteristics and structure of shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) myofibrillar protein  aTo investigate the effect of acetylated distarch adipate (ADA) on the physicochemical properties and structure of shrimp myofibrillar protein (MP), the changes in chemical bonds, secondary structure and protein composition of shrimp MP and MP gel (MPG) were analyzed. Besides, the microstructure, water state, texture properties and water holding capacity (WHC) of MPG with different ADA additions were compared. The results showed that the shrimp MPG with 1% ADA addition had the highest breaking force and gel strength, WHC, and the densest three-dimensional network structure. The ADA had little significant effect on the secondary structure of MP and MPG. In addition, hydrogen and ionic bonds were the main chemical bonds of MP, while MPG is mainly dominated by hydrophobic and disulfide bonds. The correlation analysis of gel properties and water state of MPG showed that bound water and immobilized water had a positive effect on the gel strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3adisulfides 3afood chemistry 3agel strength 3agels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3aprotein composition 3ashrimp 3atexture 0aPenaeus vannamei 0aAcetylated distarch adipate 0aMyofibrillar protein 0aTexture 0aMicrostructure 0aWater state1 aNi, Wei1 aHuang, Ping1 aHong, Jingxia1 aJia, Ru1 aDeng, Shanggui1 aYu, Xunxin1 aWei, Huamao1 aYang, Wenge0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 373 p.131530-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1315303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245009400169300001600263520150400279592002801783650002401811650001301835650001001848650002201858650003501880650002101915650001601936650001001952650000901962650000901971650001301980650003001993650002302023650002802046650001102074653001502085653001402100653002402114653003102138653001702169700002902186700002602215700002002241700002502261700002402286700002302310700002202333700001802355700003002373773013802403856007802541852000902619655001202628IND60663645620221120205642.0191002e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364562DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.23312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Amanda R.10aBartonella henselae Infection in Sickle Cell Disease Mice Is Associated with Hyperalgesia  ap. 102-105.  aBackground: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent hematologic genetic disorder. Acute vaso-occlusive painful crisis is the hallmark of the disease and may be related to subclinical infections. Bartonellosis, a rare and neglected infection, is caused by Bartonella spp., which can be found in donated blood. These bacteria cause intraerythrocytic and endothelial infection and pain, all of which occur in SCD. It is likely that this infection is transmitted to SCD patients during transfusion from donated blood, leading to pain. We, therefore, evaluated whether Bartonella henselae infection would cause hyperalgesia in mice with SCD. Materials and Methods: SCD mice were generated by transplantation of nucleated bone marrow cells harvested from transgenic Berkeley sickle mice into 2-month-old irradiated C57BL/6 mice. We infected four SCD mice by intraperitoneal inoculation with B. henselae, and inoculated four other mice with the same volume of saline. Mechanical hyperalgesia was determined using von Frey monofilaments by two blinded observers. Thereafter, the animals were anesthetized and euthanized to collect blood, liver, and spleen samples to seek B. henselae infection by PCR. Findings: We confirmed the experimental infection in all animals by PCR. Tremors and mechanical hypersensitivity were demonstrated by SCD mice infected with B. henselae infection but not in those receiving saline. Conclusion: B. henselae infection may be related to pain and other symptoms in SCD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBartonella henselae 3abacteria 3ablood 3abone marrow cells 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahypersensitivity 3airradiation 3aliver 3amice 3apain 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asickle cell anemia 3asomatosensory disorders 3aspleen 0aBartonella 0ainfection 0asickle cell disease 0ainfectious disease vectors 0ahyperalgesia1 aVieira-Damiani, Gislaine1 ada Silva, Marilene N.1 aLania, Bruno G.1 aSoares, Tânia C.

Triterpene saponins found in E. planum and also present in Eryngium maritimum were different from those described previously in Eryngium campestre L. Three primary saponins were isolated and their tentative identifications, based on the electrospray MS/MS fragmentation patterns, were subsequently confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR analyses. Their structures were established as 3- O -β- d -glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β- d -glucuronopyranosyl-21- O -acetyl-22- O -angeloyl-R1-barrigenol (1) and 3- O -β- d -glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β- d -glucuronopyranosyl-22- O -angeloyl-A1-barrigenol (2) and 3- O -β- d -glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-β- d -glucuronopyranosyl-22- O -angeloyl-R1-barrigenol (3).

This catastrophic event might perish all organisms from the ancient Santorini and could seriously impact the sand fly fauna of the Aegean islands. To investigate these effects, the survival possibility of the sand fly fauna in the Santorini islands and the biogeographic investigation of the sand fly fauna of eleven Aegean islands were conducted. It was found that only the south and east slopes of the massifs of Thira could provide refuge for sand fly populations. The expression-based heat map of the Jaccard coefficient matrix data showed that the Santorini islands and their neighbouring Anafi, Folegandros had clearly different z-score patterns compared to the other islands. It could be a late sign of the devastating effect of the Minoan eruption and/or the consequence of the distance of these islands from the mainland. Neither the glacial seashore patterns nor the geographic-climatic conditions can explain the present sand fly fauna of the Aegean Archipelago. If the sand fly populations of ancient Santorini survived the Minoan cataclysm, it could indicate that the environmental tolerance and the resilience of the sand fly populations can be high, and local geological and geomorphological conditions can play a greater role in the survival of sand fly species than previously assumed.  aFunding The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Széchenyi 2020 under grant GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00016.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important antiinflammatory cytokine, but its genetic polymorphisms and serum levels in Indian MetS subjects are unknown. Three IL-10 gene polymorphisms (−1082A >G (rs1800896), −819C >T (rs1800872) and −592C >A (rs1800871)) were genotyped with PCR-RFLP in MetS subjects (n = 384) and age/sex matched control subjects (n = 386). Serum IL-10 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IL-10 level was significantly low in MetS subject and significantly correlated with clinicobiochemical parameters of MetS. Of three investigated promoter polymorphisms, IL-10 –819C > T and –592C >A were significantly associated with risk of MetS. The mutant alleles −819T and −592A of IL-10 gene polymorphism were significantly higher in MetS subjects compared to controls. Of the four different haplotypes obtained, common ACC haplotype and rare GTA haplotype of IL-10 polymorphisms were associated with MetS. The mean of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly different between the genotypes of both −819 C >T and −592C >A polymorphisms of IL-10 in MetS subjects. These results suggested that polymorphisms in IL-10 gene (−819C >T and −592C >A), haplotypes (ACC and GTA) and serum level are significantly associated with risk of MetS. IL-10 −819C >T and −592C >A polymorphic variants are also significantly associated with insulin level and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance in north Indian MetS subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-10 3ametabolic syndrome 3amodels 3amutants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk1 aSINGH, SHRADDHA1 aDWIVEDI, SHIPRA1 aKONWAR, RITURAJ1 aNATU, SHANKAR MADHAV1 aGhatak, Ashim,0 tJournal of genetics.g2017 Mar., v. 96, no. 1 p.53-64dSpringer Indiax0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-016-0738-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019300171300001600364520153800380592002801918596001401946650000901960650001001969650001101979650001501990650001702005650001302022650001102035650001902046650001702065650001702082650001402099650002602113650002202139651001002161651000902171653002102180653001602201653001702217653001602234700001802250700002002268700002402288700003002312700002602342773014502368856008602513852000902599655001202608IND60767349220221117212921.0220215e20220326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076734922DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20288102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGharaghani, Ali10aTiming and Rate of Foliar Potassium Application to Improve Yield, Fruit Size and Quality Attributes of Pomegranate: Based on Data Generated in Field Experiments Conducted in Iran and Egypt  ap. 714-728.  aIt is proven that potassium (K) plays a key regulatory role in many physiological processes of plant growth and that K fertilization can improve the yield and quality attributes in fruit crops. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of timing and various concentrations of foliar sprays of potassium sulfate, during fruit growth and maturation, on yield and quality of pomegranate fruit in Iran and Egypt, which have different pomegranate production systems. In Iran one, two or three sprays of 1% or 2% K-Leaf® (a high grade foliar potash booster) was used, and in Egypt a single spray of either 10 or 20 kg/ha, and two sprays of 10 and 20 kg/ha K-Leaf® were applied. Results showed that in both experiments in Iran and Egypt, foliar K treatments increased total and marketable yield of pomegranates, as well as fruit weight and size, flavor index (the ratio of total soluble solids/total acid). The treatments also improved the fruit’s peel and aril color compared to the non-treated control plants. Results also demonstrated that multiple potassium sprays (two or three applications) were more effective than applying higher concentrations; as in many cases, there were no significant differences between 1 and 2% concentrations of K fertilizer in treatments with same number of applications (one, two or three sprays). Although three sprays of 2% K-Leaf® were the most effective treatments, it can be concluded that three sprays of 1% K-Leaf®) is probably more economically sound for use in pomegranate orchards.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo number 3aaril 3acolor 3aflavor 3afruit size 3afruit weight 3afruiting 3afruits 3aplant analysis 3aplant growth 3apomegranates 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3apotassium sulfate 3aEgypt 3aIran 0amarketable yield 0apomegranate 0afoliar spray 0afruit color1 aEshghi, Saeid1 aKabouri, Lahcen1 aElkholy, Mahmoud H.1 aJahani Kondori, Mahboubeh1 aGhahramanzadeh, Robab0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Mar. 26, v. 53, no. 6 p.714-728dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20288103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012500167300001400292520133400306592002801640596005701668650002401725650002401749650001601773650001101789650001501800650002101815650001501836650002101851650001201872650001901884650002401903651001301927653001901940653001201959653001601971653002501987653001602012653001902028653001802047700001802065700001702083700001602100700001602116773012002132856008502252852000902337655001202346IND60595663920221120131535.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059566392DNAL7 a10.1080/14728028.2017.13630042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusemwa, L.10aZ. mauritiana fruits in the lower Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe: uses and contribution to the income of harvesting households  ap. 32-42.  aIn the Lower Zambezi Valley, most households have recently become food insecure. More than 80% of the households are now collecting fruits of Ziziphus mauritiana as one of their main sources of food and income. The main objective of this study was to determine the contribution of Z mauritiana products to household income in the Lower Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. One hundred collector households were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire. A linear regression model was used to determine the factors affecting the ratio of income derived from Z. Mauritiana to total household income. Our results revealed that Z. mauritiana fruits are mainly sold for cash, brewed into alcoholic beverage and barter traded against various commodities. The contribution of Z. mauritiana fruits to household income vary significantly according to uses (P<0.05). Family size, quantity of fruits harvested, and the maximum distance travelled to harvest the fruits, significantly affect the contribution of Z. mauritiana to household income. In order for Z. mauritiana to better contribute to mitigating poverty and land degradation in the marginalised areas of the Lower Zambezi Valley, research aimed at improving the quality and yield of Z. mauritiana, and development of programmes aimed at domesticating the species, should be promoted.  aPublisher supplied data  aBlock GrantcBindura University of Science Education 3aZiziphus mauritiana 3aalcoholic beverages 3afamily size 3afruits 3aharvesting 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aland degradation 3apoverty 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aZimbabwe 0aBarter trading 0abrewing 0aconsumption 0aLower Zambezi Valley 0alivelihoods 0avalue addition 0aZ. mauritiana1 aMaruza, I.

Before inferring causality of any particular factor, however, it is critical to demonstrate that the observed variation in diversity is significantly greater than that expected from natural stochastic processes. Relative tests that assess whether observed asymmetry in species richness between sister taxa in monophyletic pairs is greater than would be expected under a symmetric model have been used widely in studies of rate heterogeneity and are particularly useful for groups in which paleontological data are problematic. Although one such test introduced by Slowinski and Guyer a decade ago has been applied to a wide range of clades and evolutionary questions, the statistical behavior of the test has not been examined extensively, particularly when used with Fisher's procedure for combining probabilities to analyze data from multiple independent taxon pairs. Here, certain pragmatic difficulties with the Slowinski-Guyer test are described, further details of the development of a recently introduced likelihood-based relative rates test are presented, and standard simulation procedures are used to assess the behavior of the two tests in a range of situations to determine: (1) the accuracy of the tests' nominal Type I error rate; (2) the statistical power of the tests; (3) the sensitivity of the tests to inclusion of taxon pairs with few species; (4) the behavior of the tests with datasets comprised of few taxon pairs; and (5) the sensitivity of the tests to certain violations of the null model assumptions. Our results indicate that in most biologically plausible scenarios, the likelihood-based test has superior statistical properties in terms of both Type I error rate and power, and we found no scenario in which the Slowinski-Guyer test was distinctly superior, although the degree of the discrepancy varies among the different scenarios. The Slowinski-Guyer test tends to be much more conservative (i.e., very disinclined to reject the null hypothesis) in datasets with many small pairs. In most situations, the performance of both the likelihood-based test and particularly the Slowinski-Guyer test improve when pairs with few species are excluded from the computation, although this is balanced against a decline in the tests' power and accuracy as fewer pairs are included in the dataset. The performance of both tests is quite poor when they are applied to datasets in which the taxon sizes do not conform to the distribution implied by the usual null model. Thus, results of analyses of taxonomic rate heterogeneity using the Slowinski-Guyer test can be misleading because the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis (equal rates) when true is often inaccurate and its ability to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative (unequal rates) is true is poor, particularly when small taxon pairs are included. Although not always perfect, the likelihood-based test provides a more accurate and powerful alternative as a relative rates test.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDiversity 0aevolutionary rates 0aextinction 0alikelihood 0ataxon pairs1 aSims, Hallie J.0 tEvolution.g2004 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.12-23dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F03-1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007400159500001400233520101000247592002801257650001601285650001501301650003001316650000901346650001601355650001201371650001501383650001801398650001401416650001401430650001901444650001501463651001001478700001801488700001501506700002101521700002001542773012801562856007401690852000901764655001201773IND60724592120221121205645.0210122e20210109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459212DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiachao 10aEvaluation of TMPA 3B42-V7 Product on Extreme Precipitation Estimates  aNAL-light  aAvailability of precipitation data at high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for the understanding of precipitation behaviors that are determinant for environmental aspects such as hydrology, ecology, and social aspects like agriculture, food security, or health issues. This study evaluates the performance of 3B42-V7 satellite-based precipitation product on extreme precipitation estimates in China, by using the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm and L-moment-based regional frequency analysis method. The China Gauge-based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA) product is employed to measure the estimation biases of 3B42-V7. Results show that: (1) for most regions of China, the Generalized Extreme Value and Generalized Normal distributions are preferable for extreme precipitation estimates; (2) the extreme precipitation estimations of 3B42-V7 for different return periods have a high correlation with those of CGDPA, with biases within 25% for a majority of China on extreme precipitation estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abias 3acorrelation 3aecology 3aestimation 3afood security 3afrequency 3ahydrology 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aChina1 aWang, Zhaoli 1 aWu, Xushu 1 aLai, Chengguang 1 aChen, Xiaohong 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 09, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245013000214300001800344506007600362520136500438592002801803506003701831650002801868650002701896650001901923650002601942650001001968650001601978650002601994650001902020650001602039650001402055650001402069700002102083700003102104700001902135700002502154700001502179773011702194856008102311852000902392655001202401IND60120566320221207132933.0150208e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012056632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7134-42doi7 aPMC45390032pmcid7 a238128802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehdashti, Seameen J.12aA high-throughput screening assay for assessing the viability of Cryptococcus neoformans under nutrient starvation conditions  ap. 6823-6829.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCryptococcus neoformans causes an estimated 600,000 AIDS-related deaths annually that occur primarily in resource-limited countries. Fluconazole and amphotericin B are currently available for the treatment of cryptococcal-related infections. However, fluconazole has limited clinical efficacy and amphotericin B requires intravenous infusion and is associated with high renal toxicity. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a new orally administrable anti-cryptococcal drug. We have developed a high-throughput screening assay for the measurement of C. neoformans viability in 1,536-well plate format. The signal-to-basal ratio of the ATP content assay was 21.9 fold with a coefficient of variation and Z' factor of 7.1 % and 0.76, respectively. A pilot screen of 1,280 known compounds against the wild-type C. neoformans (strain H99) led to the identification of four active compounds including niclosamide, malonoben, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime, and 5-[(4-ethylphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone. These compounds were further tested against nine clinical isolates of C. neoformans, and their fungicidal activities were confirmed. The results demonstrate that this miniaturized C. neoformans assay is advantageous for the high-throughput screening of large compound collections to identify lead compounds for new anti-cryptococcal drug development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamphotericin B 3aantifungal properties 3adrugs 3afluconazole 3aintravenous injection 3anephrotoxicity 3aniclosamide 3ascreening 3aviability1 aAbbott, Jennifer1 aNguyẽ̂n, Đá̆c Trung,1 aMcKew, John C.1 aWilliamson, Peter R.1 aZheng, Wei0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 405, no. 21 p.6823-6829dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7134-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245004100192300001800233520118200251592002801433650001601461650001901477650001901496650002401515650001701539650001301556650001401569650002401583650001601607650004701623650003701670650002901707650002901736650002301765650003501788650002401823700002001847700002401867773009401891856008101985990002302066852000902089655001202098IND60093870020221118225124.0141104e20111122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009387002DNAL7 a220791142pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmertenko, Andrei P.14aThe Origin of Phragmoplast Asymmetry  ap. 1924-1930.  aThe phragmoplast coordinates cytokinesis in plants [1]. It directs vesicles to the midzone, the site where they coalesce to form the new cell plate. Failure in phragmoplast function results in aborted or incomplete cytokinesis leading to embryo lethality, morphological defects, or multinucleate cells [2, 3]. The asymmetry of vesicular traffic is regulated by microtubules [1, 4, 5, 6], and the current model suggests that this asymmetry is established and maintained through treadmilling of parallel microtubules. However, we have analyzed the behavior of microtubules in the phragmoplast using live-cell imaging coupled with mathematical modeling and dynamic simulations and report that microtubules initiate randomly in the phragmoplast and that the majority exhibit dynamic instability with higher turnover rates nearer to the midzone. The directional transport of vesicles is possible because the majority of the microtubules polymerize toward the midzone. Here, we propose the first inclusive model where microtubule dynamics and phragmoplast asymmetry are consistent with the localization and activity of proteins known to regulate microtubule assembly and disassembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokinesis 3adynamic models 3aimage analysis 3amathematical models 3amicrotubules 3aproteins 2aCell Line 2aComputer Simulation 2aCytokinesis 2aFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching 2aLuminescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aTobaccoxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTubulinxmetabolism1 aPiette, Bernard1 aHussey, Patrick J.,0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Nov. 22, v. 21, no. 22 p.1924-1930dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008500164300001600249520164400265536025901909592002802168596001402196596001002210650001202220650001602232650001102248650001902259650002902278650001202307650002602319650001902345650001902364650001302383650001302396650000902409650001302418650002102431650001202452650001702464650002702481651001002508653002502518653002302543653001702566700002302583700002302606773014502629856008602774852000902860655001202869IND60767349420221117212423.0220215e20220326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076734942DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20288122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xue10aChemical Response of Soils to Traditional and Industrial Byproduct Wood Biochars  ap. 737-751.  aSoil degradation and a global focus on carbon (C) sequestration in soils have resulted in growing societal interest in soil health practices. Biochar has a high C content, porosity, pH, and cation exchange capacity that benefit soil properties. Here we described an incubation study that aims to evaluate the influences of biochar additions on representative forest organic, forest mineral, blueberry, potato, and mixed vegetable soils from Maine, USA. The experiment consisted of amendments of either a lime stabilized industrial byproduct softwood pulp biochar (SPB) or pine wood biochar (PB) at application rates equivalent to 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 t ha⁻¹. Here we report influences of biochar addition on soil pH, loss-on-ignition (LOI), water-holding capacity (WHC), and exchangeable cations. In general, both SPB and PB increased the value of these soil properties in all mineral soils, with significant increases often being found at a rate of 100 t ha⁻¹. Forest organic soils, however, were more variable attributable to the high organic C concentration of this substrate. Soil response to SPB amendments was strongly influenced by the lime component, although few significant differences were found between SPB and PB amended soils. Analysis of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from SPB amendments due to lime dissolution and acid neutralization represented less than 3% of the total carbon added in SPB treated soils, leaving SPB and PB both important potential soil amendments. This suggests that both traditional and industrial byproduct biochars have potential for soil health and C sequestration management goals.  aThis study was supported by the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station ME042007 Project ME0-42007 and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contracts (C0052 & C0057) with the Forest Bioproducts Research Institute (FBRI) at the University of Maine.  aPublisher supplied data  aME0-42007  aC0052 3abiochar 3ablueberries 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acation exchange capacity 3aforests 3aindustrial byproducts 3aneutralization 3aplant analysis 3aporosity 3apotatoes 3apulp 3asoftwood 3asoil degradation 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3awater holding capacity 3aMaine 0acarbon sequestration 0aagricultural soils 0aforest soils1 aFernandez, Ivan J.1 aSpencer, Cheryl J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Mar. 26, v. 53, no. 6 p.737-751dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20288123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010400172300001600276520112500292592002801417650001801445650002001463650000901483650001201492700002301504773008801527856008501615852000901700655001201709IND60111841320221119222652.0150812e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011184132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMora, Cordula V.10aConsistent effect of an attached magnet on the initial orientation of homing pigeons, Columba livia  ap. 377-383.  aThere is ongoing debate about which sensory mechanisms are critical for animal navigation over long distances. We tested whether magnetoreception associated with the front of the head is involved in navigation by homing pigeons. We attached small, but strong, rare-earth magnets atop the ceres of experienced homing pigeons and released the birds under sunny conditions. In releases distributed over a wide range of distances and directions, the mean vanishing directions of birds carrying magnets were consistently (91% of releases) shifted to the right of controls carrying brass weights. The right shift appeared within a few minutes after release and was reproducible over consecutive years. The magnet's effect was sustained (82%) in birds released repeatedly at one site and was larger (73%) for a North-up than for a South-up orientation of the magnet in releases (88%), where the North-up and South-up groups of experimental birds were right-shifted relative to their controls. We discuss several possible nonnavigational and navigational explanations for the magnet's effect on the pigeons' vanishing direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3aanimal behavior 3ahead 3apigeons1 aWalker, Michael M.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Aug., v. 84, no. 2 p.377-383dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009000173300001600263520193000279592002802209650001602237650002002253650002402273650000902297650001102306650001102317650001402328650000902342650001002351650002002361650001902381650001202400653002102412653001602433653000802449653003202457700002302489700002202512700002302534773009602557856008902653852000902742655001202751IND60688554920200616000000.0200429e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068855492DNAL7 a10.2752/089279314X140722686878802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Bradley14aThe Prevalence and Implications of Human–Animal Co-Sleeping in an Australian Sample  ap. 543-551.  aSleep research is characterized by an interest in humans, with the realm of animal sleep left largely to ethologists and animal scientists. However, the lives of sleep-study participants and those with sleep problems frequently involve animals. For the majority of the population in developed countries who own pets, their waking lives are impacted by the duties of animal care and ownership. For many, their sleeping lives are also impacted through sharing their bedrooms or their beds with pets. Yet, little is known about the prevalence of human–animal co-sleeping relationships or their impact on sleep. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and implications of human–animal co-sleeping in an Australian sample. The study uses data collected from the 2012 Sealy Sleep Census, a national online survey of sleep wellness that included a sample of 10,128 after data cleaning. The population of respondents (aged 18–74) who co-slept with pets (n = 1,018 or 10% of the sample) was then matched to a sample of respondents who did not co-sleep with pets, according to gender and age. Those who co-slept with pets took longer to fall asleep (p = 0.029), were more likely to wake up tired (p = 0.025), and although they were not more likely to wake up due to a disturbance, those who did had a greater chance of being disturbed by dog barking/animals making noises (p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences found in total self-reported sleep length or feelings of tiredness during the day. The continued practice of co-sleeping with pets suggests that there may be some benefits such as social support and social interaction, and increased feelings of personal security. The survey provides a preliminary understanding of the prevalence and implications of human–animal co-sleeping, and highlights areas for further examination of its implications on sleep research and clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal care 3adata collection 3adeveloped countries 3adogs 3agender 3ahumans 3aownership 3apets 3asleep 3asocial behavior 3asocial support 3asurveys 0acompanion animal 0aco-sleeping 0adog 0ahuman–animal relationship1 aThompson, Kirrilly1 aClarkson, Larissa1 aDawson, Andrew B.,0 tAnthrozoös.g2014 Dec. 1, v. 27, no. 4 p.543-551dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2752/089279314X140722686878803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009900176300001600275520201300291592002802304650000802332650001102340650002602351650001802377650001502395650001502410650001002425650001402435650001002449650002502459650000902484651001002493653001402503653002502517653002002542653003002562653001802592653002702610653001602637700002002653773010202673856008702775852000902862655001202871IND60545756920221119123418.0170719e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAḥmadī, Mahdī,10aStatistical evaluation of the impact of shale gas activities on ozone pollution in North Texas  ap. 457-467.  aOver the past decade, substantial growth in shale gas exploration and production across the US has changed the country's energy outlook. Beyond its economic benefits, the negative impacts of shale gas development on air and water are less well known. In this study the relationship between shale gas activities and ground-level ozone pollution was statistically evaluated. The Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) area in north-central Texas was selected as the study region. The Barnett Shale, which is one the most productive and fastest growing shale gas fields in the US, is located in the western half of DFW. Hourly meteorological and ozone data were acquired for fourteen years from monitoring stations established and operated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The area was divided into two regions, the shale gas region (SGR) and the non-shale gas (NSGR) region, according to the number of gas wells in close proximity to each monitoring site. The study period was also divided into 2000–2006 and 2007–2013 because the western half of DFW has experienced significant growth in shale gas activities since 2007. An evaluation of the raw ozone data showed that, while the overall trend in the ozone concentration was down over the entire region, the monitoring sites in the NSGR showed an additional reduction of 4% in the annual number of ozone exceedance days than those in the SGR. Directional analysis of ozone showed that the winds blowing from areas with high shale gas activities contributed to higher ozone downwind. KZ-filtering method and linear regression techniques were used to remove the effects of meteorological variations on ozone and to construct long-term and short-term meteorologically adjusted (M.A.) ozone time series. The mean value of all M.A. ozone components was 8% higher in the sites located within the SGR than in the NSGR. These findings may be useful for understanding the overall impact of shale gas activities on the local and regional ozone pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3aoil fields 3aozone 3apollution 3ashale 3atime series analysis 3awind 3aTexas 0aShale gas 0aHydraulic fracturing 0aOzone pollution 0aMeteorological adjustment 0aBarnett Shale 0aStatistical evaluation 0aOzone trend1 aJohn, Kuruvilla0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.457-467dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520138600289592002801675596004401703650001501747650001001762650001401772650001101786650001201797650001001809651001101819653002101830653002901851653002401880653002401904653003701928700001601965700001601981700001801997700001902015700001602034773012202050856008502172852000902257655001202266IND60595664320221120100653.0180605e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059566432DNAL7 a10.1080/14728028.2018.14430272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyoka, B.

A survey was conducted to assess the quality of tree seedlings produced by various nurseries. The survey covered 55 nurseries in four districts in central Malawi comprising 18 private, 26 communal and 11 institutional nurseries. A total of 1,500 tree seedlings were assessed for morphological attributes i.e. root collar diameter (RCD), height, root and shoot weight, shoot-to-root ratio (S:R), sturdiness quotient, Dickson’s Quality Index (DQI) and root deformity. Differences between the three nursery types were significant (p < 0.05) for some of the parameters. Overall, 33%, 58% and 67% of assessed seedlings in communal, institutional and private nurseries, respectively, had the recommended S:R ratio of less than 2, while for sturdiness quotient, 8%, 67%, and 58%, respectively, of the seedlings had less than the recommended threshold value of 6. A similar pattern was observed for RCD and DQI. Prevalence of root deformities was highest in institutional nurseries (47.5%), followed by private (45.5%) and communal nurseries had the lowest (42.6%). Given that all three nursery types have apparent, but sometimes different seedling quality issues, building knowledge and technical capacity is needed across all the nursery operators.  aPublisher supplied data  cEmpowering Forest Dependent Communities 3aroot crown 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asurveys 3atrees 3aMalawi 0aSeedling quality 0amorphological attributes 0ashoot-to-root ratio 0asturdiness quotient 0aquality index and deformed roots1 aKamanga, R.1 aNjoloma, J.1 aJamnadass, R.1 aMng’omba, S.1 aMuwanje, S.0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 27, no. 2 p.103-117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2169x2164-30757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2018.14430273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009500167300001800262520172100280592002802001650004402029650002202073650002202095650001502117650001502132650001102147650002602158650001802184650001502202650001302217650001202230650002002242650001302262650001202275650001102287650001302298650000702311650001902318650001502337650003302352650001302385650002302398650001602421650002102437650003702458700006502495700001802560773017102578856008002749852000902829655001202838IND60601945420221116180316.0180709e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060194542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b037902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarylak, Martyna10aApplication of Carbonized Metal–Organic Framework as Efficient Adsorbent of Cationic Dye  ap. 4867-4879.  aHerein, we report study about adsorption kinetics of rhodamine B onto metal organic framework containing cobalt (CoOF). The CoOF can be successfully produced from the reused waste–organic ligands and solvents. The as-prepared material was carbonized and purified prior to testing. The adsorbent was characterized with scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, X-ray diffractometer, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscope, and N₂ adsorption/desorption isotherms. The kinetics of dye adsorption onto structure was examined with the UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Various physiochemical parameters such as initial dye concentration, pH of dye solution, and temperature were investigated in an adsorption technique. The adsorption uptake was found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration. An increase in adsorption capacity was noticed when the solution was changed to basic, optimum conditions obtained at pH 7. The results indicate that along with an increase in the temperature the adsorption capacities decrease. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of RhB onto CoOF was 72.150 mg/g. Kinetic adsorption data were analyzed using the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the intraparticle diffusion model. The adsorption kinetics well fit using a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The experimental data were analyzed by the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Equilibrium data fit well with the Freundlich isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy were determined. It was found that the adsorptions of RhB onto CoOF was a spontaneous and exothermic physisorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3adata analysis 3adesorption 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheat production 3akinetics 3aligands 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apH 3aprocess design 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aCendrowski, Krzysztof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7913-63001 aMijowska, Ewa0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 57, no. 14 p.4867-4879dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b037903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008700174300001600261520110100277592002801378650002401406650001601430650001201446650001301458650003401471650001401505650002001519650001201539651001401551653002701565653004001592653002501632700002201657773011601679856008601795852000901881655001201890IND60767349920221117212908.0220309e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076734992DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2021.20058542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Aaron W.10aFactors Motivating Forest Conservation Easement Adoption in Wisconsin's Northwoods  ap. 129-148.  aThe diversity of ownership of forestlands in the Northwoods Region and the absence of strong local land use regulations represent critical barriers to protecting the health of natural resources. Seen by policymakers as a viable land protection strategy, conservation easements represent a voluntary alternative to land use regulation for forest land conservation. However, landowner adoption for privately owned forest lands remains low in Wisconsin despite more than 16 million acres nationally held by nonprofit state, local, and national land trust organizations. Despite these successes, resistance exists from non-industrial private forest landowners to the adoption of conservation easements. This study explores these barriers using data collected from mail survey responses from 470 forest landowners in Wisconsin's Northwoods. A typology of landowners is developed based on attitudes toward the adoption of conservation easements, revealing that current interest among forest landowners is below 20%, and land trusts currently lack standing as trusted partners in forest land management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest conservation 3aforest land 3aforests 3aland use 3anonindustrial private forests 3aownership 3aright of access 3asurveys 3aWisconsin 0aConservation easements 0aforest conversion and parcelization 0alandowner typologies1 aWadleigh, Rebecca0 tSociety & natural resources.g2022 Feb. 1, v. 35, no. 2 p.129-148dRoutledgewJournal:jnl45063x1521-07237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2021.20058543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245011500178300001200293520141900305592002801724650002901752650002801781650001601809650001301825650001701838650002401855650001001879650001301889650002101902650002001923650003101943650004601974650002002020650004202040650005102082650004802133650003102181650004602212650002202258650005202280650002602332700001502358700001402373700001802387700001302405700001802418700001602436700001902452773014202471852000902613856008202622655001202704IND4408497920221116171640.0200207e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440849792DNAL7 a185608302pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-008-1545-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lei10aCharacterization of a negative regulator AveI for avermectin biosynthesis in Streptomyces avermitilis NRRL8165  ap. 277.  aA transcriptional activator for actinorhodin biosynthesis, AtrA, was previously characterized in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), and an orthologue of atrA, named aveI, is identified in the Streptomyces avermitilis NRRL8165 genome (Uguru et al., Mol Microbiol, 58:131–150, 2005). In this study, genetic and functional characterization of aveI gene was reported. Deletion of aveI gene led to increased biosynthesis of avermectin B1a by about 16-fold. The increased synthesis of avermectin B1a was suppressed by complementation with either aveI gene or its orthologue gene atrA from S. coelicolor, suggesting AveI and AtrA shared the similar functionality and were negative regulators for avermectin biosynthesis in S. avermitilis. However, when aveI was introduced into S. coelicolor on a multi-copy plasmid, the production of actinorhodin was significantly increased, indicating that aveI had a positive effect on actinorhodin biosynthesis in S. coelicolor, the same as its orthologue atrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed AveI can bind specifically to the promoter region of actII-ORF4 in vitro but not that of aveR. Although its mechanism still needs to be defined, the species-differential regulation by the same regulator may represent an example of the evolutional strategy that enables bacteria to adapt the existing molecular machinery to a variety of functionalities for growth and survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces avermitilis 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aavermectins 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aplasmids 3apromoter regions 3atransactivators 2aAnthraquinonesxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aPolyketide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Deletion 2aStreptomycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factors1 aLu, Yinhua1 aChen, Jun1 aZhang, Weiwen1 aShu, Dan1 aQin, Zhongjun1 aYang, Sheng1 aJiang, Weihong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Aug., v. 80, no. 2 p.277-277dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1545-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03498naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015300169300001600322520173100338592002802069650001302097650000802110650001802118650001602136650001302152650001102165650002102176650002502197650001402222650002602236650002502262650001402287650002102301650002202322650001502344650001102359650001202370650003102382650002602413650001702439650002302456651001002479653002302489653001702512653001802529653001302547700005302560700001402613700001902627700001702646700002002663700001502683773010202698856008702800852000902887655001202896IND60545757120221119122553.0170719e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Keran10aAnalysis of residents' willingness to pay to reduce air pollution to improve children's health in community and hospital settings in Shanghai, China  ap. 283-289.  aShanghai, along with many major cities in China, faces deterioration of air quality and increases in air pollution-related respiratory diseases (RDs) in children due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was used to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing children's RDs through air quality improvement. Methods: Between April and May, 2014, 975 face-to-face interviews were collected from parents in a community-based and a hospital-setting in Shanghai. Multiple imputation and the Probit model were used to determine the relationship between the WTP and the related environmental factors, child health factors and the socio-economic status.Most respondents reported being willing to make a financial contribution to improve air quality in both the community (52.6%) and hospital (70.2%) samples. Those in the hospital setting were willing to pay significantly more ¥504 (USD$80.7) compared to the community sample ¥428 ($68.5) as expected. Reasons for those not being willing to pay included lack of disposable income and believing that responsibility of the air quality was a community issue. These did not differ by sample. Annual household income and education were related to WTP.This study indicated that parents in Shanghai would be willing to pay for improved air quality. Children's health can be the incentive for the citizens' participation and support in the air quality improvement, therefore, hospital settings may present unique places to improve education about air quality and enhance advocacy efforts. This study also suggested that future environmental policies be addressed more rigorously for targeted populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3achildren 3acities 3acommunity health 3acontingent valuation 3aeducation 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental policy 3ahospitals 3ahousehold income 3aindustrialization 3ainterviews 3amodels 3aparents 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asocioeconomic factors 3aurbanization 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aWillingness to pay 0aChild health 0aAir pollution 0aShanghai1 aWu, Jinyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0202-83871 aWang, Rui1 aYang, Yingying1 aChen, Renjie1 aMaddock, Jay E.1 aLu, Yuanan0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 533 p.283-289dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011300154500001400267520167000281592002801951650002001979650001701999650001502016650002202031650002602053650002902079650001602108650001402124650001602138650001102154650001002165650001902175650001602194700002202210700001402232700001802246773012802264856007402392852000902466655001202475IND60724592820221123041356.0210122e20210110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459282DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Hui 10aAnalysis of Forward Model, Data Type, and Prior Information in Probabilistic Inversion of Crosshole GPR Data  aNAL-light  aThe crosshole ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a widely used tool to map subsurface properties, and inversion methods are used to derive electrical parameters from crosshole GPR data. In this paper, a probabilistic inversion algorithm that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations within the Bayesian framework is implemented to infer the posterior distribution of the relative permittivity of the subsurface medium. Close attention is paid to the critical elements of this method, including the forward model, data type and prior information, and their influence on the inversion results are investigated. First, a uniform prior distribution is used to reflect the lack of prior knowledge of model parameters, and inversions are performed using the straight-ray model with first-arrival traveltime data, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model with first-arrival traveltime data, and the FDTD model with waveform data, respectively. The cases using first-arrival traveltime data require an unreasonable number of model evaluations to converge, yet are not able to recover the real relative permittivity field. In contrast, the inversion using the FDTD model with waveform data successfully infers the correct model parameters. Then, the smooth constraint of model parameters is employed as the prior distribution. The inversion results demonstrate that the prior information barely affects the inversion results using the FDTD model with waveform data, but significantly improves the inversion results using first-arrival traveltime data by decreasing the computing time and reducing uncertainties of the posterior distribution of model parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3achemical elements 3aelectrical properties 3aground-penetrating radar 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3amethodology 3amodels 3apaper 3aremote sensing 3auncertainty1 aWang, Zhengzheng 1 aTang, Yu 1 aGeng, Tiesuo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169520124500245592002801490650001701518650001801535650002301553650001201576650002101588650001401609650001301623650001401636650001501650650001301665653002101678653002301699653002201722653001901744653002401763700001301787700001901800700004001819700002001859700005501879773010201934856008602036852000902122655001202131IND60742991820221118142125.0220205e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074299182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1069922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuai, Lingyun10aControlled release of antioxidants from active food packaging: A review  aActive packaging is an innovative concept emerging in the field of food packaging to meet market demands, such as consumers' preference for safe, healthy and high-quality food. The release packaging system is one type of active packaging, in which the active substances reach the food surface or the top wrapper through diffusion to inhibit the microbial growth or lipid oxidation and rancidity of foods. The release rate of some active substances over time can be regulated through some technologies so that their concentrations on the food surface can be maintained to prevent food oxidation and spoilage, thereby extending the shelf life. In this paper, the latest research on controlled-release antioxidant packaging is reviewed. The release mechanism of antioxidants in active packaging, the factors affecting the controlled-release and the packaging design considerations are introduced from the aspects of packaging material components (polymer matrix and active substances), combination of other components and preparation methods. The potential use of new technology in antioxidant packaging is also emphasized, and the challenges and opportunities for commercial application of antioxidant active packaging are further elaborated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3ahydrocolloids 3alipid peroxidation 3amarkets 3amicrobial growth 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3arancidity 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 0aActive packaging 0aControlled release 0aRelease mechanism 0aPolymer matrix 0aPreparation methods1 aLiu, Fei1 aChiou, Bor-Sen1 aAvena Bustillos, Roberto de Jesús,1 aMcHugh, Tara H.1 aZhong, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5850-49600 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Nov., v. 120 p.106992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1069923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010900173300001600282520204100298592002802339650000802367650001802375650001602393650001102409650001102420650001402431650001202445650001402457650001802471650001702489650001102506650001502517650002402532650002002556650001002576650001102586650001102597651001702608653001702625653002802642653002502670653002502695653002602720700002702746700001702773700002102790700002202811700001502833700002402848773010202872856008702974852000903061655001203070IND60545757320221119122723.0170719e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunno, Brett J.10aIndoor air sampling for fine particulate matter and black carbon in industrial communities in Pittsburgh  ap. 108-115.  aImpacts of industrial emissions on outdoor air pollution in nearby communities are well-documented. Fewer studies, however, have explored impacts on indoor air quality in these communities. Because persons in northern climates spend a majority of their time indoors, understanding indoor exposures, and the role of outdoor air pollution in shaping such exposures, is a priority issue. Braddock and Clairton, Pennsylvania, industrial communities near Pittsburgh, are home to an active steel mill and coke works, respectively, and the population experiences elevated rates of childhood asthma. Twenty-one homes were selected for 1-week indoor sampling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) during summer 2011 and winter 2012. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine contributions from both outdoor concentrations and indoor sources. In the models, an outdoor infiltration component explained 10 to 39% of variability in indoor air pollution for PM2.5, and 33 to 42% for BC. For both PM2.5 models and the summer BC model, smoking was a stronger predictor than outdoor pollution, as greater pollutant concentration increases were identified. For winter BC, the model was explained by outdoor pollution and an open windows modifier. In both seasons, indoor concentrations for both PM2.5 and BC were consistently higher than residence-specific outdoor concentration estimates. Mean indoor PM2.5 was higher, on average, during summer (25.8±22.7μg/m3) than winter (18.9±13.2μg/m3). Contrary to the study's hypothesis, outdoor concentrations accounted for only little to moderate variability (10 to 42%) in indoor concentrations; a much greater proportion of PM2.5 was explained by cigarette smoking. Outdoor infiltration was a stronger predictor for BC compared to PM2.5, especially in winter. Our results suggest that, even in industrial communities of high outdoor pollution concentrations, indoor activities – particularly cigarette smoking – may play a larger role in shaping indoor exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aasthma 3acarbon 3achildhood 3aclimate 3aemissions 3alinear models 3aparticulates 3apeople 3apollutants 3aregression analysis 3asmoking (habit) 3asteel 3asummer 3awinter 3aPennsylvania 0aBlack carbon 0aFine particulate matter 0aIndoor air pollution 0aIndustrial emissions 0aMultivariate modeling1 aKyra Naumoff Shields, 1 aCambal, Leah1 aTripathy, Sheila1 aHolguin, Fernando1 aLioy, Paul1 aClougherty, Jane E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01645naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001800296520042000314592002800734650002300762650001400785650000900799650001800808650001800826650001100844650002200855650001500877650005000892653001800942653001300960653001300973653000900986700002200995700002301017700002401040773008101064856008101145852000901226655001201235IND60529245220221119082633.0161019e20160609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaterno', Alessio10aPolarity study of ionic liquids with the solvatochromic dye Nile Red: a QSPR approach using in silico VolSurf+ descriptors  ap. 3282-3287.  aThe in silico VolSurf+ descriptors, accounting for both cationic and anionic structural features of ionic liquids (ILs) were used to develop a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model able to establish a Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) correlation with their solvatochromic dye Nile Red polarity.

The study compares the isothermal melt- and cold-crystallization processes at several selected temperatures Tc in the vicinity of the glass-transition temperature Tg (1.07Tg ≤ T ≤ 1.17Tg). Our findings reveal that at low temperatures, the crystallization of the Cr1 phase from the nematic melt state occurs more quickly than the cold crystallization. The dimensionality of the growing crystallites (n) was found to be slightly higher for the cold- than for the melt-crystallization process, varying from n ∼ 5 to n ∼ 3 with increasing temperature. Our experimental results are discussed in terms of dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the material. The study also uses polarized optical microscopy to investigate the isothermal secondary cold crystallization (the formation of Cr2 from Cr1 upon heating), which is inaccessible by BDS measurements because of its very fast crystallization rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acrystallites 3acrystallization 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3alight microscopy 3aliquid crystals 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics1 aRozwadowski, Tomasz1 aDmochowska, Ewelina1 aJuszyńska-Gałązka, Ewa1 aKula, Przemysław1 aMassalska-Arodź, Maria0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 122, no. 46 p.10627-10636dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b081383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03907naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245021800173300001600391520210800407592002802515650001802543650001802561650001902579650001502598650002402613650002202637650002002659650002502679650002102704650000902725650001502734650001102749650001502760650002602775650001502801650001102816650001502827650000702842650000902849650002802858650002302886650001802909650001802927650002802945651001902973653002302992653001303015653002003028653002803048700005503076773010203131856008703233852000903320655001203329IND60545757420221119122443.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLathouri, Maria10aTemporal assessment of copper speciation, bioavailability and toxicity in UK freshwaters using chemical equilibrium and biotic ligand models: Implications for compliance with copper environmental quality standards  ap. 385-401.  aAlthough significant progress has been made in understanding how environmental factors modify the speciation, bioavailability and toxicity of metals such as copper in aquatic environments, the current methods used to establish water quality standards do not necessarily consider the different geological and geochemical characteristics of a given site and the factors that affect copper fate, bioavailability potential and toxicity. In addition, the temporal variation in the concentration and bioavailable metal fraction is also important in freshwater systems. The work presented in this paper illustrates the temporal and seasonal variability of a range of water quality parameters, and Cu speciation, bioavailability and toxicity at four freshwaters sites in the UK. Rivers Coquet, Cree, Lower Clyde and Eden (Kent) were selected to cover a broad range of different geochemical environments and site characteristics. The monitoring data used covered a period of around six years at almost monthly intervals.Chemical equilibrium modelling was used to study temporal variations in Cu speciation and was combined with acute toxicity modelling to assess Cu bioavailability for two aquatic species, Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex. The estimated copper bioavailability, toxicity levels and the corresponding ecosystem risks were analysed in relation to key water quality parameters (alkalinity, pH and DOC). Although copper concentrations did not vary much during the sampling period or between the seasons at the different sites; copper bioavailability varied markedly. In addition, through the chronic-Cu BLM-based on the voluntary risk assessment approach, the potential environmental risk in terms of the chronic toxicity was assessed. A much higher likelihood of toxicity effects was found during the cold period at all sites. It is suggested that besides the metal (copper) concentration in the surface water environment, the variability and seasonality of other important water quality parameters should be considered in setting appropriately protective environmental quality standards for metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aDaphnia pulex 3aacute toxicity 3aalkalinity 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3abioavailability 3achemical equilibrium 3achronic toxicity 3acold 3acompliance 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apH 3arisk 3arisk assessment process 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 3aUnited Kingdom 0aCu bioavailability 0aToxicity 0aRisk assessment 0aWater quality standards1 aKorre, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1981-08660 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 538 p.385-401dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01142naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245003300188300001800221520019600239592002800435650001600463650001100479650001700490650001200507650003100519650003100550700002800581773009400609856008100703990002300784852000900807655001200816IND60093871020221118225411.0141104e20111122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009387102DNAL7 a221154582pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLand, Michael F.,10aMarine Optics: Dark Disguise  ap.

However, its effects on reproductive endocrine system and the underlying toxicological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 10, 20, 40 μg/L of Cu for 30 days. Growth, gonad histopathology, the hormone levels and the transcriptional profiles of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in both sexes were examined. The results indicated that body weight was significantly reduced, the gonadal development was affected, and the levels of E2, T and 11-KT were remarkably disturbed in Cu-exposed fish. Moreover, the expression profiles of steroidogenesis-related genes in gonad (3βhsd, 17βhsd, cyp11a1, cyp17, cyp19a, lhr, fshr, hmgra and star) and in brains (ar, cyp19b, erα, er2β, lhβ, fshβ, gnrh2, gnrh3, gnrhr1, gnrh2 and gnrh4) displayed alterations after exposure to Cu. These results demonstrated that Cu could suppress the growth of zebrafish and significantly affect the reproductive biology in both sexes by damaging the structure of the gonads, altering the steroid hormone levels and the expressions of endocrine-related genes in HPG of zebrafish. This study suggests that Cu adversely affects the reproductive endocrine system in zebrafish and could pose a potential threat to fish populations inhabiting Cu-contaminated waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abody weight 3abrain 3acopper 3afish 3afish communities 3agenes 3agonads 3ahistopathology 3asteroid hormones 3asurface water 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCu 0aZebrafish 0aGonad 0aEndocrine disruption 0aHPG axis1 aWang, Guodong1 aWang, Tianyu1 aChen, Jianjie1 aWenjing, Guo1 aWu, Panhong1 aHe, Xinjin1 aXie, Lingtian0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 June, v. 211 p.124-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009400173300001600267520137600283592002801659650001601687650001601703650003101719650001401750650001501764650001001779650001801789700002201807700002401829700002301853700002001876773008801896856008501984852000902069655001202078IND60111842320221119224708.0150812e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011184232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelattre, Olivier10aSocial parasite pressure affects brood discrimination of host species in Temnothorax ants  ap. 445-450.  aSocial parasites exploit complete societies, on which they are dependent. In ants, slave-making species invade, exploit and raid host colonies, impacting their survival and exerting powerful selection pressure on their host species. Recent studies suggest that host ant species may develop a parasite brood intolerance, which could be the first step of a slave rebellion in parasitized colonies. However, enslaved workers of slave-making ants not only raise and feed their parasites, but also accept alien conspecific brood brought during seasonal raids. We compared the agonistic and grooming behaviour (a sign of brood integration) of two sympatric nonhost species (one showing intraspecific parasitism) and of enslaved and free-living host species confronted with alien conspecific worker pupae to assess whether parasite pressure could have decreased brood tolerance in host species. Free-living colonies of species suffering from interspecific or intraspecific parasitism were more aggressive and performed less grooming towards alien conspecific brood than colonies of nonhost species. Moreover, slave workers were not more aggressive towards alien parasites than towards alien conspecific brood but groomed alien parasites more than alien conspecific brood. We discuss how host–parasite coevolution could impact the social recognition mechanisms in host species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTemnothorax 3acoevolution 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apupae 3asocial impact1 aChâline, Nicolas1 aChameron, Stéphane1 aLecoutey, Emmanuel1 aJaisson, Pierre0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Aug., v. 84, no. 2 p.445-450dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04288naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008700168300001600255520243900271592002802710650002102738650002202759650002402781650002702805650001802832650002502850650002402875650000902899650001502908650002302923650001002946650001302956650003202969650001003001650001103011650001103022650002103033650001403054650001503068650000903083650002303092650002103115650001103136653000903147653002303156653001403179653003203193653002003225653001303245700001703258700002403275700001803299700002603317700002503343700001803368700002103386700002103407773010303428856008603531852000903617655001203626IND60636638820221121053624.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063663882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouda, Karel10aHost-parasite interaction as a toxicity test endpoint using asymmetrical exposures  ap. 173-180.  aInterspecific relationships frequently determine the effect a pollutant can have on an organism, and this is especially true in closely interacting species such as hosts and parasites. The high spatial and temporal variability of contaminant concentrations combined with the movement of aquatic biota can further influence the consequences that are associated with contamination. We used a full factorial design for the exposed and unexposed partners of the relationship between the parasitic larvae (glochidia) of the European freshwater mussel (Anodonta anatina) and its host fish (Squalius cephalus) to identify the sources of variation in the sublethal endpoints of species interaction (the intensity of parasite attachment, the spatial position of glochidia on the host body, and encapsulation success). We used the water-borne human pharmaceutical compounds methamphetamine (a central nervous system stimulant) and tramadol (an opioid) at environmentally relevant concentrations (˜ 6.7 and 3.8 nmol L−1 of methamphetamine and tramadol, respectively) as a proxy for contaminant exposure because these compounds are emerging aquatic stressors that are known for high spatial and temporal variability in their detected concentration levels. The relationship between the bivalve and the fish species was influenced by the preceding contact with both methamphetamine and tramadol, but this effect was highly asymmetric. Our experimental design enabled us to identify the specific changes in the relationship outcome that are elicited by the exposure of individual partners, such as the significant increase in glochidia infection success rate from 59.6 ± 3.9% to 78.7 ± 2.8% (means ± s.e.) that was associated with host exposure to methamphetamine. Additionally, the significant interaction effect of the exposure was demonstrated by the lowered proportion of glochidia attached to gills after the coexposure of both partners to tramadol. The impact of pharmaceuticals on wild aquatic host–parasite relationships provides an example of the risks that are associated with the unintentional discharge of biologically active compounds into freshwater habitats. Given the increasing evidence showing the ecological impact of waste pharmaceuticals, the use of multitrophic interaction endpoints after joint and unilateral exposures provides an important step towards the realistic risk assessment of these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnodonta anatina 3aSqualius cephalus 3abioactive compounds 3acentral nervous system 3aencapsulation 3aenvironmental impact 3aexperimental design 3afish 3afreshwater 3afreshwater mussels 3agills 3ahabitats 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amethamphetamines 3aparasites 3apollutants 3arisk 3atemporal variation 3atoxicity testing 3awastes 0aFish 0aFreshwater mussels 0aGlochidia 0aInterspecific relationships 0aMethamphetamine 0aTramadol1 aZhao, Shuran1 aVodáková, Barbora1 aHorký, Pavel1 aGrabicová, Kateřina1 aBožková, Kristýna1 aGrabic, Roman1 aSlavík, Ondřej1 aRandák, Tomáš0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 June, v. 211 p.173-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010400172300001800276520098400294536009001278592002801368650001501396650000901411650001301420650001101433650001501444650001601459653002501475653000801500653001801508653001101526653001201537653003401549653001601583653002301599700001901622700002201641700002001663700001301683700002601696700001701722773012401739856008501863852000901948655001201957IND60747540820221121014316.0210814e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074754082DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.19286732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhosravi, Khabat10aImproving daily stochastic streamflow prediction: comparison of novel hybrid data-mining algorithms  ap. 1457-1474.  aIn the current paper, the efficiency of three new standalone data-mining algorithms [M5 Prime (M5P), Random Forest (RF), M5Rule (M5R)] and six novel hybrid algorithms of bagging (BA-M5P, BA-RF and BA-M5R) and Attribute Selected Classifier (ASC-M5P, ASC-RF and ASC-M5R) for streamflow prediction were assessed and compared with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model as a benchmark. The models used precipitation (P) and streamflow (Q) data from the period 1979–2012 for training and validation (70% and 30% of data, respectively). Different input combinations were prepared using both P and Q with different lag times. The best input combination proved to be that in which all of the the data were used (i.e. R and Q – with lag times). Overall, employing Q with different lag times proved to be more effective than using only P as input for streamflow prediction. Although all models showed very good predictive power, BA-M5P outperformed the other models.  aThis research project was supported by Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abags 3ajournals 3amodels 3aprediction 3astream flow 0astreamflow modelling 0aM5P 0arandom forest 0aM5Rule 0abagging 0aAttribute Selected Classifier 0adata mining 0aTaleghan catchment1 aGolkarian, Ali1 aBooij, Martijn J.1 aBarzegar, Rahim1 aSun, Wei1 aYaseen, Zaher Mundher1 aMosavi, Amir0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2021 July 04, v. 66, no. 9 p.1457-1474dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.19286733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015200161500001400313520213300327592002802460650001302488650001502501650002802516650000902544650001102553650001902564650002102583650001102604650001502615650001102630650001502641650002302656650001902679650002302698700001802721773012802739856007402867852000902941655001202950IND60724593420221122030722.0210122e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459342DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xingming 10aApplying Deep Learning to Clear-Sky Radiance Simulation for VIIRS with Community Radiative Transfer Model—Part 1: Develop AI-Based Clear-Sky Mask  aNAL-light  aA fully connected deep neural network (FCDN) clear-sky mask (CSM) algorithm (FCDN_CSM) was developed to assist the FCDN-based Community Radiative Transfer Model (FCDN_CRTM) to reproduce the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) clear-sky radiances in five thermal emission M (TEB/M) bands. The model design was referenced and enhanced from its earlier version (version 1), and was trained and tested in the global ocean clear-sky domain using six dispersion days’ data from 2019 to 2020 as inputs and a modified NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor over Ocean (ACSPO) CSM product as reference labels. The improved FCDN_CSM (version 2) was further enhanced by including daytime data, which was not collected in version 1. The trained model was then employed to predict VIIRS CSM over multiple days in 2020 as an accuracy and stability check. The results were validated against the biases between the sensor observations and CRTM calculations (O-M). The objectives were to (1) enhance FCDN_CSM performance to include daytime analysis, and improve model stability, accuracy, and efficiency; and (2) further understand the model performance based on a combination of the statistics and physical interpretation. According to the analyses of the F-score, the prediction result showed ~96% and ~97% accuracy for day and night, respectively. The type Cloud was the most accurate, followed by Clear-Sky. The O-M mean biases are comparable to the ACSPO CSM for all bands, both day and night. The standard deviations (STD) were slightly degraded in long wave IRs (M14, M15, and M16), mainly due to contamination by a 3% misclassification of the type Cloud, which may require the model to be further fine-tuned to improve prediction accuracy in the future. However, the consistent O-M means and STDs persist throughout the prediction period, suggesting that FCDN_CSM version 2 is robust and does not have significant overfitting. Given its high F-scores, spatial and long-term stability for both day and night, high efficiency, and acceptable O-M means and STDs, FCDN_CSM version 2 is deemed to be ready for use in the FCDN_CRTM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abias 3adesign 3aimage analysis 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aobjectives 3aoceans 3aprediction 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3astandard deviation1 aLiu, Quanhua 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011300173300001600286520151800302592002801820650002401848650001301872650002401885653002601909653003101935653001601966653002701982653002402009653002602033700001802059700001802077773010202095856008702197852000902284655001202293IND60537827920221121053517.0190405e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053782792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindahl, Therese10aGoverning complex commons — The role of communication for experimental learning and coordinated management  ap. 111-120.  aIn this paper, we build on common-pool research and adaptive management to increase our understanding on if and how communication between resource users affects their joint ability to learn about and manage complex ecological resources. More specifically we study the role of user communication in relation to learning through continual experimentation when managing a complex resource system involving resource interdependencies. For this purpose we designed a laboratory experiment where we tested the effect of user communication over time in a setup with two interdependent resources, and where resource access is asymmetrical: one resource is shared and the other is private. Our results indicate that communication, through its interaction with experimental learning is more multifaceted than what previous experimental studies on commons dilemmas suggest. We show for example that in communicating groups the likelihood of successful resource management increases, but this effect is mostly dominant in earlier periods, when resource dynamics are unknown. We hypothesize however, that communication stimulates continual improvements by fine-tuning of management through experimental learning and coordinated resource extraction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that in communicating groups, the need to quickly gain a basic understanding of the dynamics overshadows not only the devotion to improve management of the private resource but also the potential tensions brought by the asymmetry in resource access.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3alearning 3aresource management 0aCommon pool resources 0aResource interdependencies 0aAsymmetries 0aLaboratory experiments 0aAdaptive management 0aExperimental learning1 aBodin, Örjan1 aTengö, Maria0 tEcological economics.g2015 Mar., v. 111 p.111-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245005700190300001800247520024100265592002800506650001100534650001800545650001300563650001400576650001200590650002200602650002200624650001100646650003100657650004000688650003000728650002500758650003800783700003300821773009400854856008100948990002301029852000901052655001201061IND60093871320221118225523.0141104e20111122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009387132DNAL7 a221154612pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklin, David W.10aFeedback Modulation: A Window into Cortical Function  ap.

This study aimed to characterize spatiotemporal variation in accumulation levels and morphotype composition of sargasso inundations. Community science initiatives can aid in monitoring sargasso regionally by locally collecting data on morphotype composition and accumulation level. A volunteer network compiled community-contributed photos from the "Sargassum Watch" Epicollect5 digital application. Florida and the Gulf coast showed less susceptibility to high accumulations than other subregions of the tropical Atlantic. S. fluitans III was the most frequently encountered morphotype, though the probability of encountering any of the three morphotypes depended on accumulation level. Despite differences in latitude, the 2021 season demonstrated similar 'peak' sargasso months between South Florida and Mexican Caribbean (May–July), though the intensity and duration of high-accumulation months differed. Much of these composition patterns and accumulation levels were likely related to the proximity of both regions to the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt and dispersal through wind and water currents. Using community-collected data to outline quantitative trends and patterns in sargasso accumulation levels and composition, this study can be useful for future collaborations and syntheses with other forecasting and monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3abotany 3acoasts 3alatitude 3amorphs 3aprobability 3awind 3aCaribbean 3aFlorida 0aWider Caribbean 0aSouth Florida 0aPelagic Sargassum 0aCitizen science 0aCommunity science 0aMonitoring 0aInundations 0aBlooms1 aHatt, Danielle C.1 aBally, Natalie K.1 aCastro, Alicia1 aCardet, Elizabeth1 aMesidor, Remsly1 aOlszak, Samantha1 aDuran, Alain1 aBurkholder, Derek A.1 aCollado-Vides, Ligia0 tAquatic botany.g2022 Oct., v. 182 p.103546-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2022.1035463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245007100157300001600228520132800244592002801572650002501600650001901625650002301644650001101667650001201678650001701690650001701707650002101724650001701745650002001762650003501782700001801817700001801835700001601853700001301869700001401882700001701896700001801913773009301931856004802024852000902072655001202081IND4473789420221119165941.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447378942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-0800-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jin10aInvolvement of auxin and nitric oxide in plant Cd-stress responses  ap. 107-119.  aCadmium (Cd) toxicity inhibited the seedling growth while inducing the occurrences of lateral roots (LR) and adventitious roots (AR). Further study indicated that auxin and nitric oxide (NO) are involved in the processes. In this study, we chose model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and Cd-hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum as material to examine the involvement of Cd-induced auxin redistribution in NO accumulation in plants and the effect of NO on Cd accumulation. For this aim, the histochemical staining, NO fluorescence probe (DAF-2DA) detections combined with the pharmacological study were used in this study. By using DR5:GUS staining analysis combined with NO fluorescence probe (DAF-2DA) detection, we found that Cd-induced NO accumulation is at least partly due to auxin redistribution in plants exposure to Cd. Supplementation with SNP donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) increased the number of LR and AR. In contrast, NO-scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) reversed the effects of NO on modulating root system architecture and Cd accumulation. These results suggest that manipulation of the NO level is an effective approach to improve Cd tolerance in plants by modulating the development of LR and AR, and provide insights into novel strategies for phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSolanum nigrum 3aadventitious roots 3aauxins 3acadmium 3afluorescence 3anitric oxide 3aphytoremediation 3aroot systems 3aseedling growth 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aWang, Wenying1 aSun, Jianhang1 aZhang, Yuan1 aGe, Qing1 aDu, Liguo1 aYin, Hengxia1 aLiu, Xiaojing0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Sept., v. 346, no. 1-2 p.107-119dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-0800-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014100173300001600314520162400330592002801954650001201982650002201994650001602016650001002032650001102042650001702053650001902070650001702089650002202106650001002128650000702138650001202145650001102157650002002168650001002188650001602198650001902214650001802233700002402251700002002275700002102295700002402316700002502340773010102365856008102466852000902547655001202556IND50089959820221120190222.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008995982DNAL7 a10.1007/s13594-014-0169-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArboatti, Ainelén S.14aThe influence of sodium chloride reduction on physicochemical, biochemical, rheological and sensory characteristics of Mozzarella cheese  ap. 373-386.  aExcessive intake of sodium has been associated with harmful effects on human health. Therefore, salt reduction in manufactured products is been targeted as a way to reduce dietary sodium intake. Sodium chloride (NaCl) plays an important role in cheese, and reducing the NaCl level in cheese may adversely affect its characteristics. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of different levels of salt reduction on the physicochemical, biochemical, rheological, and sensory characteristics of Mozzarella cheese. Samples were brine-salted for different periods to obtain cheeses with different levels of salt reduction (C: control cheese; S1: cheese with 60% salt reduction, S2: cheese with 35% salt reduction). Samples were analysed during 43 days of ripening. As expected, salt flavour intensity decreased with a decrease in NaCl levels. Small differences between control and experimental cheeses due to salting condition were observed in moisture content, water activity, maturation index, αₛ₁-casein, αₛ₁-I-casein, crossover temperature (when the elastic component equals the viscous component) and in some sensory attributes (aroma, colour, global flavour and creaminess). No significant differences due to salting condition were observed in pH, γ-casein, β-casein degradation, activation energy (parameter that quantifies the matrix degradation with heating), residual flavour, acidity and bitter taste. Taking into account the minor differences observed after the significant salt reduction analysed, it is considered that decreasing NaCl may not jeopardise the standard Mozzarella cheese quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aactivation energy 3abeta-casein 3acolor 3aflavor 3agamma-casein 3aheat treatment 3ahuman health 3amozzarella cheese 3aodors 3apH 3asalting 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3ataste 3atemperature 3awater activity 3awater content1 aOlivares, María L.1 aSabbag, Nora G.1 aCosta, Silvia C.1 aZorrilla, Susana E.1 aSihufe, Guillermo A.0 tDairy science & technology.g2014 July, v. 94, no. 4 p.373-386dSpringer-Verlagx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-014-0169-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04129naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245015300179300001800332520217300350592002802523650001602551650002002567650002202587650001402609650001702623650001802640650001302658650001002671650001902681650002102700650001402721650001402735650001302749650001602762650002402778650000902802650001202811650001202823650004602835650003102881650001102912650005502923650004102978650001103019650002003030650002803050650001203078651001403090651001403104700002003118700001603138700001603154700001203170700001403182700001903196700001503215700001503230773009903245856007703344961001303421852000903434655001203443IND60083409020221120030703.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008340902DNAL7 a227209572pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-52752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodden, S.M.10aHeat-treated colostrum and reduced morbidity in preweaned dairy calves: Results of a randomized trial and examination of mechanisms of effectiveness  ap. 4029-4040.  aA randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted using 1,071 newborn calves from 6 commercial dairy farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin, with the primary objective being to describe the effects of feeding heat-treated colostrum on serum immunoglobulin G concentration and health in the preweaning period. A secondary objective was to complete a path analysis to identify intermediate factors that may explain how feeding heat-treated colostrum reduced the risk for illness. On each farm, colostrum was collected each day, pooled, and divided into 2 aliquots; then, one aliquot was heat-treated in a commercial batch pasteurizer at 60°C for 60min. Samples of fresh and heat-treated colostrum were collected for standard microbial culture (total plate count and total coliform count, cfu/mL) and for measurement of immunoglobulin G concentrations (mg/mL). Newborn calves were removed from the dam, generally within 30 to 60min of birth, and systematically assigned to be fed 3.8L of either fresh (FR, n=518) or heat-treated colostrum (HT, n=553) within 2h of birth. Venous blood samples were collected from calves between 1 and 7d of age for measurement of serum IgG concentrations (mg/mL). All treatment and mortality events were recorded by farm staff between birth and weaning. Regression models found that serum IgG concentrations were significantly higher in calves fed HT colostrum (18.0±1.5mg/mL) compared with calves fed FR colostrum (15.4±1.5mg/ml). Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression indicated a significant increase in risk for a treatment event (any cause) in calves fed FR colostrum (36.5%, hazard ratio=1.25) compared with calves fed HT colostrum (30.9%). In addition, we observed a significant increase in risk for treatment for scours in calves fed FR colostrum (20.7%, hazard ratio=1.32) compared with calves fed HT colostrum (16.5%). Path analysis suggested that calves fed HT colostrum were at lower risk for illness because the heat-treatment process caused a significant reduction in colostrum total coliform count, which was associated with a reduced risk for illness as a function of improved serum IgG concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aclinical trials 3acoliform bacteria 3acolostrum 3adairy calves 3adairy farming 3adiarrhea 3afarms 3aheat treatment 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneonates 3aplate count 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aweaning 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornximmunologyxphysiology. 2aBacterial Loadxveterinary 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aColostrumxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aWeaning 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin1 aSmolenski, D.J.1 aDonahue, M.1 aOakes, J.M.1 aBey, R.1 aWells, S.1 aSreevatsan, S.1 aStabel, J.1 aFetrow, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.4029-4040dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-52753Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010800174300001400282520092300296592002801219650004401247650002401291650001801315650002201333650002501355650002201380650001501402650002401417650001601441650002001457650002201477650001501499650001901514650001101533650004401544650001801588653002401606653002001630653002001650653002001670653000801690700005601698700002201754700001801776700002301794773009801817856008701915852000902002655001202011IND60629955020221120070500.0190402e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062995502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshaware, Shweta10aDebittering of bitter gourd juice using β-cyclodextrin: Mechanism and effect on antidiabetic potential  ap. 78-85.  aTriterpene glycosides namely momordicoside K and momordicoside L causes bitterness in bitter-gourd thereby reducing its consumer acceptance.

Two active nests of P. superciliaris were found, the first was 50 cm above the ground and the second was 2.6 m. Both were bowl shaped and had three and two eggs, respectively. One egg from each nest was measured and weighed: 64.3 × 42.1 mm (61.5 g) and 55.5 × 38.0 mm (42.5 g). An active nest of O. guttata was found 3.2 m high on top of a tree. Initially, there was a single egg in the nest but two more were laid. The average egg measurements and weight were 55.0 × 38.4 mm and 43.3 g. The eggs of both species were rather similar with a dull white color, rough shell, and smeared with organic matter from the nest. We observed an incubation period of 29–30 days for the chachalaca, which was longer than previous estimates of this species. The guan nests were found in an advanced stage of development, which prevented accurate tracking of their incubation periods. Although the primary social reproductive strategy in most cracids is monogamy, it is possible that P. superciliaris is polygynous in our study area, justifying the absence of a male near the nest or even a nest territory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrtalis 3aPenelope 3abreeding 3acolor 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3amales 3amonogamy 3anests 3aorganic matter 3apolygyny 3arain forests 3atree crown 3aBrazil 0abreeding 0aCracidae 0alife history 0aRusty-margined Guan 0aSpeckled Chachalaca1 ade Oliveira, Tonny Marques1 aMacario, Phoeve1 ade Oliveira, Damião Valdenor1 aPichorim, Mauro0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 Sept., v. 125, no. 3 p.665-669dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-149.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014600171300001800317520107500335592002801410650001201438650001901450650001301469650001301482700002101495700002701516700002001543700007501563700006001638773012101698856008201819852000901901655001201910IND60646394220221122231332.0190610e20190513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064639422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b003792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Stefanie L.10aCharge-Preserving Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Initiator Rescues the Lost Function of Negatively Charged Protein–Polymer Conjugates  ap. 2392-2405.  aWhen grown from the surface of proteins, negatively charged polymers cause irreversible inactivation, thereby limiting the breadth of the synthetic space that negatively charged protein–polymer conjugates can be applied to. More broadly speaking, independent of polymer and synthetic approach, almost all protein–polymer conjugates are less active than their precursors. After more than a decade without major advances in understanding why the attachment of some polymers so sharply deactivates enzymes, we focused our attention on a technique to protect enzymes from the growth of a deactivating polymer by restoring the charge at the protein surface during polymer attachment. We synthesized an amino-reactive positively charged atom transfer radical polymerization initiator that inserted a permanent positive charge at the site of bio-macroinitiator attachment. Preserving the surface charge through attachment of the permanent positively charged initiator led to the first observation of activity of enzymes that were coupled to negatively charged homopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproteins1 aMurata, Hironobu1 aKaupbayeva, Bibifatima1 aTasbolat, Adina1 aMatyjaszewski, K.q(Krzysztof),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1960-34021 aRussell, Alan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5101-43710 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 May 13, v. 20, no. 6 p.2392-2405dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b003793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010600166300001600272520105800288592002801346650001801374650002501392650002501417650001301442650002101455650002701476650002101503650002101524650001901545650001801564650001501582650002601597650002001623650001701643650001401660650002101674653001701695653001901712700001501731700001501746700001501761700001701776700001401793700001801807773013601825856008701961852000902048655001202057IND60746582020221118233411.0210904e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Guo10aIn vitro and in vivo immunoregulatory activity of sulfated fucan from the sea cucumber A. leucoprocta  ap. 931-938.  aThe in vitro and in vivo immunoregulatory activity of a water-soluble sulfated fucan AL1-1 from the sea cucumber A. leucoprocta was elucidated. In vitro experiments showed that AL1-1 up-regulated immunostimulatory activities in RAW264.7 cells and that it could successfully promote ROS production and phagocytic activity, increase secretion levels of iNOS, and induce the production of considerable amounts of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-12). We found that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was mainly involved in AL1-1 mediated macrophage activation. AL1-1's in vivo immunomodulatory activity on cyclophosphamide (CY)-treated mice was investigated and it was shown that it could strongly enhance Sig A levels, promote the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and reduce malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the intestine. It could also increase activities of superoxidase dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). These results demonstrate that AL1-1 has a significant effect on enhancing in vivo and in vitro immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuroidea 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3acyclophosphamide 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3amacrophage activation 3amalondialdehyde 3aphagocytosis 3asecretion 3awater solubility 0aSea cucumber 0aSulfated fucan1 aLaijin, Su1 aChen, Shen1 aTeng, Wang1 aDejian, Zhou1 aYin, Chen1 aShoudong, Guo0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 187 p.931-938dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002900189245009700218300001200315506007600327520053700403592002800940506003700968650002101005650001701026650000901043650001001052650001201062650001301074650001301087650001701100650001001117653002701127653001601154653001701170653002801187700002501215700003401240700002701274700003301301700002901334700003201363700002501395700002301420773010601443856008301549852000901632655001201641IND60584922420221207064922.0190416e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2017.09.0022doi7 aPMC56788832pmcid7 a291590272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarmento Tatagiba, Luiza12aA case of paracoccidioidomycosis due to Paracoccidioides lutzii presenting sarcoid-like form  ap. 6-8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParacoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal disease caused by Paracoccidioides spp., which can cause a systemic granulomatous infection with tegumentary and visceral involvement.

It enables novel Product-Service Systems (PSS) that transform customer/supplier relationships and introduces new value propositions. However, while opportunities for novel types of PSS arise, it is not clear how digitization and the institutionalisation of digital capabilities, particularly within the customer organisations, may affect implementation of PSS, potentially leading to transformational changes in the customer organisation. This paper examines one such potential transformational change from three complementary viewpoints – the resource based, the dynamic, and the relational viewpoint. It does so through action research study in the context of the maritime industry, which is particularly attractive for PSS offerings. The research methodology comprised a two-step action research process, focusing on both digitization and PSS development and implementation. The main findings are that rather than facilitating procurement to co-development of PSS, institutionalisation of digital capabilities facilitated development of PSS by stakeholders internal to the company, and strategic co-development with external stakeholders. The new digital capabilities circumvented cost barriers associated with the procurement of services from external stakeholders, supported process standardisation - to the expense of process innovation-, and transformed the network that delivered PSS by closing opportunity gaps for externally procured services. Furthermore, the uptake of digital capabilities highlighted the importance of cost estimation in making the customer more responsive to threats and opportunities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sectors 3aindustry 3aresearch methods 3astakeholders 0aProduct-Service Systems 0aDigitization 0aCustomer 0aMaritime industry1 aMaier, Anja1 aMcAloone, Tim C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.369-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014200170520154000312592002801852650000801880650001701888650001901905650001801924650002001942650001201962650001901974650001701993650001802010650001302028650002602041650001802067650001902085650001602104653001202120653003102132653002302163653001402186653002502200700001502225700001902240700001702259700001702276700001702293700001802310700001502328773011502343856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60782121920221122233024.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078212192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Jiangqiao10aNew insight into the mechanism underlying the effect of biochar on phenanthrene degradation in contaminated soil revealed through DNA-SIP  aBiochar has been widely used for the remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated soil, but its mechanism of influencing PAH biodegradation remains unclear. Here, DNA-stable isotope probing coupled with high-throughput sequencing was employed to assess its influence on phenanthrene (PHE) degradation, the active PHE-degrading microbial community and PAH-degradation genes (PAH-RHDα). Our results show that both Low-BC and High-BC (soils amended with 1 % and 4 % w/w biochar, respectively) treatments significantly decreased PHE biodegradation and bioavailable concentrations with a dose-dependent effect compared to Non-BC treatment (soils without biochar). This result could be attributed to the immobilisation of PHE and alteration of the composition and abundance of the PHE-degrading microbial consortium by biochar. Active PHE degraders were identified, and those in the Non-BC, Low-BC and High-BC microcosms differed taxonomically. Sphaerobacter, unclassified Diplorickettsiaceae, Pseudonocardia, and Planctomyces were firstly linked with PHE biodegradation. Most importantly, the abundances of PHE degraders and PAH-RHDα genes in the ¹³C-enriched DNA fractions of biochar-amended soils were greatly attenuated, and were significantly positively correlated with PHE biodegradation. Our findings provide a novel perspective on PAH biodegradation mechanisms in biochar-treated soils, and expand the understanding of the biodiversity of microbes involved in PAH biodegradation in the natural environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPlanctomyces 3aPseudonocardia 3aSphaerobacter 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3abiodegradation 3abiodiversity 3adose response 3aisotopes 3amicrobial communities 3aphenanthrenes 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 0aBiochar 0aDNA-stable isotope probing 0aPAH biodegradation 0aPAH-RHDα 0aActive PAH degraders1 aLi, Jibing1 aJiang, Longfei1 aMei, Weiping1 aSong, Mengke1 aHuang, Deyin1 aLuo, Chunling1 aZhang, Gan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008300160300001600243520077600259592002801035650002401063650001901087650001101106650002301117650001001140650002201150650001301172650001401185650001201199650001401211650002201225651001001247653004701257653001401304653002401318653002001342653001901362653001401381653001901395700002401414700001801438773012401456856007401580852000901654655001201663IND60131544520221122055433.0151127e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154452DNAL7 a10.1676/12-159.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugesek, Bruce H.14aThe relationship of blue crab abundance to winter mortality of Whooping Cranes  ap. 658-661.  aWe sampled blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) numbers in marshes on the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas from 1998–2006, while simultaneously censusing the wintering population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) on the refuge and surrounding habitats. This was done to determine whether mortality of wintering Whooping Cranes was related to the availability of this food source. Yearly variation in crab numbers was high, ranging from a low of 0.1 crabs to a high of 3.4 crabs per 100-m transect section. Significant non-linear increases in both juvenile and adult mortality in relation to decreasing crab abundance was observed.

The results indicated that W-BC reduced the Cd concentration in pore water as well as in the roots and shoots of rice by 26.24%, 53.23% and 62.47% respectively. On the contrary, there was an increase in Cd contents by 50.27% in pore water, 2.32% in the roots, and 12.80% in the shoots of rice under BC treatment. Furthermore, Cd content in rice shoot was significantly and positively correlated with Cl− addition to the soil (P < 0.01). This phenomenon could be attributed to several combined effects: (1) the increase of Cl− in the soil decreased the soil pH, enhanced the dissolved organic carbon in soil pore water and increased the complexes of Cd2+ and Cl−, resulting in the release of Cd from solid phase into solution phase, (2) the chloride in the soil increased the uptake of CdCl+ instead of Cd2+ by the roots, thereby causing an increase of Cd in rice tissues. These results demonstrate for the first time that biochar with high chloride content could weaken its immobilization effects on soil Cd and even enhance Cd uptake by rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abiochar 3acadmium 3achlorides 3achlorine 3adissolved organic carbon 3apolluted soils 3arice 3arice straw 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil pore water 3atissues 0aCadmium 0aChlorine 0aBiochar 0aWater-washed biochar 0aRice1 aLi, Zhou1 aKhaliq, Muhammad Athar1 aXie, Tuanhui1 aChen, Yanhui1 aWang, Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4295-47450 tChemosphere.g2019 Nov., v. 235 p.1172-1179dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04349naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245016600178300001800344520238300362592002802745650002502773650001002798650001102808650001202819650001402831650001502845650002502860650002602885650002602911650001802937650002702955650002202982650001003004650001403014650001603028650001303044650002403057650001703081650001303098650001403111650001203125650002803137650003103165650002403196650003303220650003303253650002303286650003903309650003603348650001103384650002803395650003003423650001403453650003203467700001503499773009903514856007703613852000903690655001203699IND60083409420221120030802.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008340942DNAL7 a227209612pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-54572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoallem, U.10aShort communication: The effects of supplementation of various n-3 fatty acids to late-pregnant dairy cows on plasma fatty acid composition of the newborn calves  ap. 4055-4058.  aThe passage of long-chain fatty acids (FA) through the placenta in ruminants is limited. However, essential long-chain polyunsaturated FA, and especially n-3 FA, are crucial for normal development of the bovine fetus; therefore, uptake of these FA by the embryo must occur during pregnancy. The objectives of the present study were to examine the effects of enrichment of dam plasma with various n-3 FA during late gestation on newborn calf plasma FA composition. Twenty-seven multiparous cows at 256d of pregnancy were divided into 3 groups and fed encapsulated fats as follows: 1) control: supplemented at 240g/d per cow with saturated FA; 2) flaxseed oil (FLX): supplemented at 300g/d per cow with fat that provided 56.1g/d per cow of α-linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil; and 3) fish oil (FO): supplemented at 300g/d per cow with fat that provided 5.8 and 4.3g/d per cow eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from fish oil, respectively. Blood samples were taken from dams twice weekly and from calves immediately after calving before first colostrum. The FA composition in plasma was determined in dams at the last sample before parturition, on average 2d before calving. Feeding cows with FLX resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in the proportion of ALA in dam plasma as compared with the control. The proportion of EPA in cow plasma was not different between groups; however, the percentage of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) was 1.4 and 2 times higher, respectively, in cows fed FLX and FO than in the controls. In addition, the plasma proportion of DHA was 15 times higher in FO cows than in controls. In calves, no differences between groups were observed in the plasma proportions of ALA and EPA; however, the proportion of DHA was 1.9 times higher in the FO calves than in controls. Across treatments, data showed no correlation between the proportions of ALA, EPA, and DPA in dam and calf plasma; however, positive correlation was demonstrated between dams and calves in DHA proportion (r=0.55). In conclusion, the distinct plasma FA profile in newborn calves compared with dams was apparently due to low permeability of the bovine placenta to polyunsaturated FA. Enriching late-gestation dairy cows with n-3 FA increased the proportion of DHA, but not ALA, in newborn calf plasma, probably because of the essentiality of DHA to fetal development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3ablood 3acalves 3acalving 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adocosapentaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aencapsulation 3afatty acid composition 3afetal development 3afetus 3afish oils 3alinseed oil 3aneonates 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apermeability 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxblood 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxblood 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxblood 2aFatty Acidsxblood 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxblood 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aLinseed Oilxpharmacology 2aPregnancy 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxblood1 aZachut, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.4055-4058dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-54573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012500160300002000285520129600305592002801601650002301629650001801652650002301670650002701693650002301720650002201743650002601765650001201791650001101803650003501814650001301849700001401862700001501876700001801891700001801909700001401927700001801941773012401959856007402083852000902157655001202166IND60667569220221119055042.0190919e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756922DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06210a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Shengrong10aDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of soluble 2,5-diketopiperazines derivatives as potential antifouling agents  ap. 51020-51026.  aA small library of soluble 2,5-diketopiperazine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as antifouling agents against two species of marine organisms: Balanus amphitrite and Bugula neritina by larval attachment assay.

(Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), the southern green stink bug, has body color polymorphisms. N. viridula f. smaragdula is the common green morph, whereas the rare morph N. viridula f. aurantiaca is uniformly orange. Crossing studies were conducted to determine the inheritance of the orange body color trait. Mendelian genetic analysis suggested that orange body color is a simple, sex-linked recessive trait. In sperm precedence studies using orange females crossed with green and then orange males, or vice versa, the proportion of offspring attributable to the second male, P2, averaged 73.3% (extremes 23.5-100%). The average P2 in the first egg mass deposited after the new pairing was 71.8%. The pattern of sperm use provided evidence for incomplete sperm mixing, sperm stratification, and sperm displacement. Green females preferred mating with orange males (88%) compared with green males (12%), suggesting that disassortative mating may operate. 3aassortative mating 3aNezara viridula 3amorphs 3apaternity 3aMendelian inheritance 3asex linkage 3asperm competition 3acrossing 3acolor 3arecessive genes 3amating behavior 0abody color polymorphism 0amating systems 0amating preferences1 aCalvert, F.1 aGolden, M.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2007 May, v.  100, no.  3 p.433-438dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/39173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2007)100%5B433:GSUTOB%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070926b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02171naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006300168300001800231520104200249592002801291650002201319650001601341650001101357650002401368650002601392650001101418650001501429650000701444650001201451700002001463700002101483700002001504700006001524773012201584856008201706852000901788655001201797IND60646394520190718000000.0190610e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064639452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b004812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontroni, Devis10aβ-Chitin Nanofibril Self-Assembly in Aqueous Environments  ap. 2421-2429.  aChitin is one of the most studied biopolymers but the understanding of how it assembles from molecules to microfibers is still limited. Organisms are able to assemble chitin with precise control over polymorphism, texture, and final morphology. The produced hierarchical structure leads to materials with outstanding mechanical properties. In this study, the self-assembly in aqueous solutions of β-chitin nanofibrils, as far as possible similar to their native state, is investigated. These nanofibrils increase their tendency to self-assemble in fibers, up to millimetric length and ≈10 μm thickness, with the pH increasing from 3 to 8, forming loosely organized bundles as observed using cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The knowledge from this study contributes to the understanding of the self-assembly process that follows chitin once extruded from cells in living organisms. Moreover, it describes a model system which can be used to investigate how other biomolecules can affect the self-assembly of chitin nanofibrils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiopolymers 3achitin 3aelectron microscopy 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3ananofibers 3apH 3atexture1 aMarzec, Bartosz1 aValle, Francesco1 aNudelman, Fabio1 aFalini, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2367-37210 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 20, no. 6 p.2421-2429dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b004813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245014400157300001600301520172700317592002802044650001402072650002002086650002002106650002502126650002702151650001802178650002102196650001102217650001002228650001002238650001002248650001202258651001502270651001102285653001702296653002102313653001202334653001802346653002502364653001702389653001202406700002402418773012402442856007402566852000902640655001202649IND60131544620221122055512.0151127e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154462DNAL7 a10.1676/12-162.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyon, Bruce E.10aRarely parasitized and unparasitized species mob and alarm call to cuckoos: implications for sparrowhawk mimicry by brood parasitic cuckoos  ap. 627-630.  aRecent experiments support the long-standing hypothesis that Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) are mimics of Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus). Additional experiments further suggest that mimicry benefits the cuckoos by reducing the intensity of mobbing they suffer near host nests, at least in some host populations, potentially increasing their access to the hosts' nests. We observed two species of birds—one very rarely parasitized and the other never parasitized by cuckoos—responding to a cuckoo as they would a bird of prey. On the island of Öland, Sweden, we observed two instances of a gray phase cuckoo being mobbed by a group of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) during the non-breeding season. These mobbing observations cannot be explained as a consequence of selection in the context of brood parasitism, because swallows are extremely rare cuckoo hosts and should not show co-evolutionary responses to parasitism. Instead, the swallows appear to have mistaken the cuckoos for Eurasian Sparrowhawks and responded as they would to true hawks. Similar observations were made in California, where a vagrant Common Cuckoo repeatedly elicited alarm calls from Bushtits (Psaltriparus minimus), a species completely allopatric with cuckoos and thus with no evolutionary history of brood parasitism. Because Eurasian Sparrowhawks visually resemble related North American bird-eating Accipiter hawks in plumage and flight characteristics, the cuckoo likely triggered a general Accipiter response in the Bushtits. Together, these observations provide additional evidence that cuckoos successfully mimic Eurasian Sparrowhawks and that such mimicry comes not only with benefits to the cuckoos, but costs as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAccipiter 3aCuculus canorus 3aHirundo rustica 3aanimal communication 3aantipredatory behavior 3abirds of prey 3abrood parasitism 3aflight 3ahawks 3ahosts 3anests 3aplumage 3aCalifornia 3aSweden 0aBarn Swallow 0abrood parasitism 0aBushtit 0aCommon Cuckoo 0aEurasian Sparrowhawk 0ahawk mimicry 0amobbing1 aGilbert, Gregory S.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 Sept., v. 125, no. 3 p.627-630dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-162.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245008700215520172500302592002802027650002202055650001502077650001502092650001402107650001502121650001402136650001602150650001802166650000702184650001602191653001502207653001602222653001302238653001602251653001402267700006202281700002202343700002802365773009102393856009002484852000902574655001202583IND60649451120221119071711.0201023e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064945112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToński, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1918-134210aHydrolytic stability of selected pharmaceuticals and their transformation products  aThe fact that pharmaceuticals are present in the environment has been proven in numerous publications. Nevertheless, their transformation products (mainly metabolites) are detected significantly less often, mainly because they are not included in the detecting methods, even though many of them are excreted from organisms at high rates and may be biologically active or have other properties that make them a potential threat to the environment. One of the most common processes that occur in the aqueous environment is hydrolysis, which may be one of the most important factors influencing the persistency of pharmaceuticals. Therefore four pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, tramadol and naproxen) as well as ten metabolites (10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-2-hydroxy carbamazepine, carbamazepine epoxide, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen, ibuprofen carboxylic acid, O-desmethyltramadol, hydroxy metronidazole, N-acetylsulfamethoxazole, 4′-hydroxy diclofenac, and O-desmethylnaproxen) were selected for the hydrolytic stability tests in accordance to OECD 111 Guideline. The preliminary test showed that only carbamazepine epoxide at pH 4, hydroxy metronidazole at pH 9 and 4′-hydroxy diclofenac at pH 4 and 9 were unstable and were included in the extended tests, which resulted in calculation of rate constants and half-lives at the temperature of 20, 50 and 70 °C as well as the activation energy at the pH values in which these compounds were unstable. The obtained results show that carbamazepine epoxide is quite unstable and the half-life at 20 °C was a little more than 8 days. Nevertheless, hydroxy-metronidazole and 4′-hydroxy diclofenac did not degrade at 20 °C for 30 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adiclofenac 3aguidelines 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3aibuprofen 3ametabolites 3ametronidazole 3apH 3atemperature 0aHydrolysis 0aMetabolites 0aOECD 111 0aEnvironment 0aStability1 aDołżonek, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5595-77641 aStepnowski, Piotr1 aBiałk-Bielińska, Anna0 tChemosphere.g2019 Dec., v. 236 p.124236-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009700161300001600258520145600274592002801730650001801758650002001776650001101796650002101807650001201828650001101840650001301851650001401864650001401878650001001892650001201902650001801914650001001932650002201942650001801964650001101982650001001993650002102003651002302024651001302047651001202060651001402072653001702086653001602103653002702119653001402146653001802160653002402178653001802202653001302220700001802233700002002251773012402271856007402395852000902469655001202478IND60131544920221122044956.0151127e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154492DNAL7 a10.1676/12-168.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnich, Nicholas M.10aNest-site selection, nest survival, productivity, and survival of Spruce Grouse in Wisconsin  ap. 570-582.  aSpruce Grouse (Falcipennis canadensis) are listed as threatened in Wisconsin, and the boreal habitats in which they occur are likely to be threatened by changing climatic conditions. However, the limited information available on Spruce Grouse in the Upper Great Lakes region makes it unclear which habitat features are important for Spruce Grouse nesting in Wisconsin. We radiotracked 30 female Spruce Grouse in northern Wisconsin from 2007–2012 and located 25 nests. Eighteen of 25 nests were beneath black spruce (Picea mariana) trees. Only three nests were in upland, and only one in a stand of jack pines (Pinus banksiana), in contrast to studies from Michigan and Ontario. Overall concealment was a good predictor of nest sites for Spruce Grouse, but not a good predictor of nest survival. Nest survival was associated with moderately dense and uniform 0–0.5 m lateral vegetation cover. Seventeen of 25 nests were successful, with a daily survival rate of 0.985, overall productivity of 1.0 young/female, and 1.9 young/successful nest. Annual survival of adult males was estimated at 54%, adult females at 40%, and juvenile survival at 14% and 24% by two different methods. Estimates of λ of 0.65 and 0.67 suggest a declining population, but the upper confidence limit exceeds 1, not ruling out a stable or slightly increasing population. Protecting black spruce swamps will protect important nesting habitat for Spruce Grouse in Wisconsin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aPinus banksiana 3aadults 3aclimatic factors 3afemales 3agrouse 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3ajuveniles 3amales 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3apopulation growth 3asurvival rate 3aswamps 3atrees 3avegetation cover 3aGreat Lakes region 3aMichigan 3aOntario 3aWisconsin 0ablack spruce 0aconcealment 0aFalcipennis canadensis 0ajack pine 0anest survival 0anest-site selection 0aSpruce Grouse 0asurvival1 aWorland, Mike1 aMartin, Karl J.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 Sept., v. 125, no. 3 p.570-582dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-168.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172506010400286506007600390520124300466592002801709506003701737650002001774650002101794650001301815650001701828650001401845650001701859650000901876653002801885653002301913653002401936653002401960653001901984700002102003700002402024700001702048700001902065700002102084773011502105856008602220852000902306655001202315IND60782122320221207045008.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078212232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarguilla, Irene10aLong-term exposure to nanoplastics alters molecular and functional traits related to the carcinogenic process  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicro/nanoplastics (MNPLs) are considered emergent pollutants widely spread over all environmental compartments. Although their potential biological effects are being intensively evaluated, many doubts remain about their potential health effects in humans. One of the most underdeveloped fields is the determination of the potential tumorigenic risk of MNPLs exposure. To shed light on this topic, we have designed a wide battery of different hallmarks of cancer applied to prone-to-transformed progress MEF cells exposed to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPLs) in the long term (6 months). Interestingly, most of the evaluated hallmarks of cancer are exacerbated after exposure, independently if they are associated with an early tumoral phenotype (changes in stress-related genes, or microRNA deregulation), advanced tumoral phenotype (growing independently of anchorage ability, and migration capacity), or an aggressive tumoral phenotype (invasion potential, changes in pluripotency markers, and ability to grow to form tumorspheres). This set of obtained data constitutes a relevant warning on the potential carcinogenic risk associated with long-term exposures to MNPLs, specifically that induced by the PSNPLs evaluated in this study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenicity 3achronic exposure 3amicroRNA 3ananoplastics 3aphenotype 3apolystyrenes 3arisk 0aPolystyrene nanoplastic 0aLong-term exposure 0aCell transformation 0aOncogenic phenotype 0aCarcinogenesis1 aDomenech, Josefa1 aBallesteros, Sandra1 aRubio, Laura1 aMarcos, Ricard1 aHernández, Alba0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001900158245008800177300001600265520161100281592002801892650001601920650001601936650001901952650001001971650002901981650001402010650002502024650002602049650003202075650004602107650003302153650002802186650004202214650005602256700002202312773019202334856007302526852000902599655001202608IND50089960720221120085232.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008996072DNAL7 a241127842pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.123382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuchta, Holger10aSynthetic nucleases for genome engineering in plants: prospects for a bright future  ap. 727-741.  aBy inducing double‐strand breaks (DSB), it is possible to initiate DNA recombination. For a long time, it was not possible to use DSB induction for efficient genome engineering due to the lack of a means to target DSBs to specific sites. This limitation was overcome by development of modified meganucleases and synthetic DNA‐binding domains. Domains derived from zinc‐finger transcription factors or transcription activator‐like effectors may be designed to recognize almost any DNA sequence. By fusing these domains to the endonuclease domains of a class II restriction enzyme, an active endonuclease dimer may be formed that introduces a site‐specific DSB. Recent studies demonstrate that gene knockouts via non‐homologous end joining or gene modification via homologous recombination are becoming routine in many plant species. By creating a single genomic DSB, complete knockout of a gene, sequence‐specific integration of foreign DNA or subtle modification of individual amino acids in a specific protein domain may be achieved. The induction of two or more DSBs allows complex genomic rearrangements such as deletions, inversions or the exchange of chromosome arms. The potential for controlled genome engineering in plants is tremendous. The recently discovered RNA‐based CRISPR/Cas system, a new tool to induce multiple DSBs, and sophisticated technical applications, such as the in planta gene targeting system, are further steps in this development. At present, the focus remains on engineering of single genes; in the future, engineering of whole genomes will become an option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aengineering 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3anucleases 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription factors 2aDNA Breaks, Double-Stranded 2aDeoxyribonucleasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aFauser, Friedrich0 tplant journal.g2014 June, v. 78, no. 5 p.727-741dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.123383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2201021 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164300001800298520153200316592002801848650001501876650001501891650001301906650002301919650001601942650002001958650002101978650002301999650001102022650001602033650002202049650001702071650002102088650001302109650001402122650001302136650002002149650001302169650001102182650001402193650002902207650001902236650001102255653001302266653003602279653002302315653001402338653000802352653000702360653000702367653000902374653000702383653001102390653001302401653000802414653000802422653000702430653001002437653000902447653000702456653000802463653001002471653000902481653000702490653000702497653000702504653000802511653000902519653000902528653000802537653000802545653000802553653000802561653000702569653000802576653000902584653000802593653000802601700003002609700001602639700001702655700001502672700001702687700001402704700002002718700001802738700001702756700002102773773012202794856008202916852000902998655001203007IND60713036920221121184752.0201216e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Suqing10aPost-translational Modifications of Fumarase Regulate its Enzyme Activity and Function in Respiration and the DNA Damage Response  ap. 6108-6126.  aThe Krebs cycle enzyme fumarase is a dual-targeted protein that is located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Besides being involved in the TCA cycle and primary metabolism, fumarase is a tumour suppressor that aids DNA repair in human cells. Using mass spectrometry, we identified modifications in peptides of cytosolic yeast fumarase, some of which were absent when the cells were exposed to DNA damage (using the homing endonuclease system or hydroxyurea). We show that DNA damage increased the enzymatic activity of fumarase, which we hypothesized to be affected by post-translational modifications. Succinylation and ubiquitination of fumarase at lysines 78 and 79, phosphorylation at threonine 122, serine 124 and threonine 126 as well as deamidation at arginine 239 were found to be functionally relevant. Upon homology analysis, these residues were also found to be evolutionally conserved. Serine 128, on the other hand, is not evolutionary conserved and the Fum1S128D phosphorylation mimic was able to aid DNA repair. Our molecular model is that the above modifications inhibit the enzymatic activity of cytosolic fumarase under conditions of no DNA damage induction and when there is less need for the enzyme. Upon genotoxic stress, some fumarase modifications are removed and some enzymes are degraded while unmodified proteins are synthesized. This report is the first to demonstrate how post-translational modifications influence the catalytic and DNA repair functions of fumarase in the cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aarginine 3acatalytic activity 3adeamidation 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3afumarate hydratase 3ahumans 3ahydroxyurea 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3amolecular models 3amutagens 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3aserine 3athreonine 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aubiquitination 3ayeasts 0aFumarase 0apost-translational modification 0aenzymatic activity 0aTCA cycle 0a2SC 0a22 0a33 0aAMPK 0abp 0aDNA-PK 0aDNA-PKcs 0aDSB 0aEMT 0aFH 0aFOXM1 0aFum1 0aHA 0aHIF 0aHLRCC 0aHOT1 0aHR 0aHU 0aMS 0aMTS 0aNHEJ 0aNRF2 0aORF 0aPTM 0aRCC 0arpm 0aSD 0aTCA 0aVEGF 0aw/v 0aYLB1 aRamamurthy, Dharanidharan1 aTan, Jasper1 aLiu, Jingyan1 aYip, Joyce1 aChua, Andrea1 aYu, Zhang1 aLim, Teck Kwang1 aLin, Qingsong1 aPines, Ophry1 aLehming, Norbert0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 432, no. 23 p.6108-6126dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04437naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245017700183300001600360520195100376592002802327650001602355650001702371650002302388650002002411650001502431650001702446650001502463650001602478650002002494650001802514650002902532650001102561650001702572650001002589650001602599650001302615650002002628650001502648650001302663650001302676653001102689653000802700653000802708653001402716653003802730653001002768653001702778653002302795653004002818653003902858653003002897653002902927653004302956653002802999653001903027653002003046653001803066653004303084653003803127653002203165653001703187653006403204653003303268653001403301700006003315700002403375700002403399773014003423856008303563852000903646655001203655IND60782684420221116223050.0220809e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078268442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalakoura-Karagkouni, Katerina10aUsing adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to study the effect of myeloperoxidase on plasma lipid levels, HDL structure and functionality in mice expressing human apoA-I forms  ap. 108-114.  aApolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the main protein component of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), is modified in plasma and the arterial wall by various enzymes. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a leukocyte-derived peroxidase, is highly expressed during inflammation and associates with HDL reducing its functionality and contributing to atherosclerosis. In the present study we sought to explore further the effect of MPO on HDL structure and functionality in vivo using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of human MPO combined with human apoA-I forms containing substitutions at MPO-sensitive sites or wild type apoA-I. We found that overexpression of MPO in mice significantly increased plasma apoA-I and HDL levels without affecting the expression of genes involved in HDL biogenesis or catabolism in the liver. Overexpression of MPO in the liver reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and increased or did not affect the expression of anti-inflammatory genes suggesting that MPO had no toxic effects in this organ. In the plasma of mice overexpressing MPO, no significant alterations in HDL size or electrophoretic mobility was observed with the exception of mice expressing apoA-I (M148A) which showed enriched pre-β relative to α HDL particles, suggesting that the apoA-I (M148A) mutation may interfere with HDL remodelling. Overexpression of MPO was associated with reduced anti-oxidant capacity of HDL particles in all mice. Interestingly, HDL particles bearing apoA-I (Y192A) showed enhanced ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages which was not affected by MPO and these mice had reduced levels of LDL-c. These findings provide new insights on the role of specific amino acid residues of apoA-I in HDL structure and function following modification by MPO. This knowledge may facilitate the development of novel therapies based on improved HDL forms for patients with chronic diseases that are characterized by dysfunctional HDL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aatherosclerosis 3abiogenesis 3ablood lipids 3acatabolism 3acholesterol 3aelectrophoresis 3agene transfer 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amutation 3amyeloperoxidase 3aperoxidase 3aresearch 3atoxicity 0aapoA-I 0aHDL 0aMPO 0aMutations 0aAdenovirus-mediated gene transfer 0aLiver 0aAdenoviruses 0aApolipoprotein A-1 0aATP-Binding Cassette Transporter A1 0aFast Protein Liquid Chromatography 0aGreen Fluorescent Protein 0aHigh density lipoprotein 0aLecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase 0aLow-Density Lipoprotein 0aMethionine-148 0aMyeloperoxidase 0aParaoxonase-1 0aReverse Transcription-quantitative PCR 0aScavenger Receptor class B type 1 0aTotal Cholesterol 0aTyrosine-192 0aTwo-dimensional polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis 0aVery Low-Density Lipoprotein 0awild type1 aTiniakou, Ioanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-70451 aZannis, Vassilis I.1 aKardassis, Dimitris0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Sept. 24, v. 622 p.108-114dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245004900159300001600208520169200224592002801916650001401944650002601958650002501984650001902009650001802028650002302046650002502069650001002094650001202104650001102116650001502127650001102142650001202153650001002165650002402175650001402199650001402213650001602227650001802243651001202261653001502273653002102288653002202309653001902331653001302350653001702363653001602380700002002396700001902416700002102435773012402456856007402580852000902654655001202663IND60131545020221118224852.0151127e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154502DNAL7 a10.1676/12-169.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriesen, Lyle E.10aNest predation in an anthropogenic landscape  ap. 562-569.  aWood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) are experiencing widespread population declines. Knowing the relative contribution of predator species to overall rates of nest predation of Wood Thrushes, and understanding how the thrushes are affected by temporal and landscape factors, may be important elements in choosing and devising effective management strategies. We used miniature video cameras to identify nest predators of Wood Thrushes in a highly fragmented landscape in Ontario. Eleven species of birds and mammals were recorded as nest predators. Birds accounted for almost twice as many predation events as mammals, and three species – Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and raccoon (Procyon lotor) – accounted for the majority. Species such as American Crow (Corvus brachyrynchos), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) that are often speculated to be important nest predators in agricultural and suburban landscapes contributed little or nothing to overall predation rates. We tested hypotheses concerning effects of nest stage, time of nesting season, forest size, forest cover, urban housing pressure, and prior predation events at a nest on the probability of nest predation. Our models showed only two of these factors to be significant: prior predation at a nest increased the chance of a subsequent predation event and increasing the measure of urban pressure reduced the chance of a predation event. The many alternate and easy food sources associated with humans might divert the attention of potential predators from nesting birds in urban forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAccipiter 3aCorvus brachyrhynchos 3aHylocichla mustelina 3aMolothrus ater 3aProcyon lotor 3aQuiscalus quiscula 3aSciurus carolinensis 3abirds 3aforests 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anesting 3anests 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3apredators 3aprobability 3avideo cameras 3aOntario 0aaccipiters 0abrood parasitism 0alandscape effects 0anest predation 0araccoons 0aurbanization 0aWood Thrush1 aCasbourn, Garth1 aMartin, Virgil1 aMacKay, R.

Here, we propose microfluidics coupled to a source of UV light to produce multifunctional methacrylated laminarin microparticles with narrow distribution of sizes using photopolymerization.The multifunctional microparticles were loaded with platelet lysates and further conjugated with an adhesive peptide. The adhesive peptides dictated cell adhesiveness to the laminarin microparticles, the incorporation of platelet lysates have resulted in improved cell expansion compared to clear microparticles.Overall, our findings demonstrate that multifunctional methacrylated laminarin microparticles provide an effective support for cell attachment and expansion. Moreover, expanded cells provide the link for microparticles aggregation resulting in robust 3D structures. This suggest the potential for using the methacrylated laminarin microplatforms capable to be assembled by the action of cells to rapidly produce large tissue engineered constructs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3amicroparticles 3apeptides 3atissue engineering 3aultraviolet radiation 0aMicrofluidic 0aMicrocarrier 0aMicrogels 0aPlatelet lysates 0aMethacrylated laminarin 0aInjectable scaffolds1 aCustódio, C.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2967-700X1 aMano, J.F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 202 p.91-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245010300170300001600273520095400289592002801243650001701271650001701288650001601305650001701321650001201338650001801350650001001368650004301378650000901421650002101430650001701451700001601468700001601484700002001500700002101520773008201541856008601623852000901709655001201718IND4468919320221118063244.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446891932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, A.M.10aDistribution and stability of aflatoxin M₁ during processing and storage of Minas Frescal cheese  ap. 104-108.  aAflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) is a hepatocarcinogen found in milk of animals that have consumed feeds with aflatoxin B₁. The carry-over of AFM₁ from milk to Minas Frescal cheese produced with or without starter cultures was determined. 40 L of milk were divided into 10 L each and assigned to the following treatments for cheese manufacture: 0.250 ng AFM₁ mL⁻¹, 0.500 ng AFM₁ mL⁻¹, 0.250 ng AFM₁ mL⁻¹ + starter, 0.500 ng AFM₁ mL⁻¹ + starter. Quantification of AFM₁ was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography. The carry-over of AFM₁ from milk to cheese ranged from 30.64% to 42.26%. There was no effect of storage time on AFM₁. Milk with AFM₁ in levels studied may concentrate the toxin in Minas Frescal cheese, but at concentrations below the Brazilian tolerance limit. The addition of starter cultures did not influence concentration or stability of the AFM₁ in cheese over 30 days storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin M1 3acheese milk 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3adairy animals 3afeeds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amilk 3astarter cultures 3astorage time1 aCorrêa, B.1 aRosim, R.E.1 aKobashigawa, E.1 aOliveira, C.A.F.0 tFood control.g2012 , v. 24, no. 1-2 p.104-108dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169300001600293520072300309592002801032650002301060650002201083650002001105650002401125653000801149653000801157653000801165653002401173653002701197653001301224653003201237653003501269700002201304700001801326773011201344856008601456852000901542655001201551IND60696272520221120141842.0200913e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069627252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhysels, Eric10aTesting a large set of zero restrictions in regression models, with an application to mixed frequency Granger causality  ap. 633-654.  aThis paper proposes a new test for a large set of zero restrictions in regression models based on a seemingly overlooked, but simple, dimension reduction technique. The procedure involves multiple parsimonious regression models where key regressors are split across simple regressions. Each parsimonious regression model has one key regressor and other regressors not associated with the null hypothesis. The test is based on the maximum of the squared parameters of the key regressors. Parsimony ensures sharper estimates and therefore improves power in small sample. We present the general theory of our test and focus on mixed frequency Granger causality as a prominent application involving many zero restrictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3aregression analysis 0aC12 0aC22 0aC51 0aDimension reduction 0aGranger causality test 0aMax test 0aMixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) 0aParsimonious regression models1 aHill, Jonathan B.1 aMotegi, Kaiji0 tJournal of econometrics.g2020 Oct., v. 218, no. 2 p.633-654dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03890naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245020200168520231600370592002802686650002802714650000802742650001002750650001502760650001902775650001902794650001702813650000902830650002802839650001602867650001902883650001202902650002202914650001902936650001802955650001602973650001402989650002603003650001403029653001803043653001803061653001203079653002403091700002603115700003303141773011503174856008603289852000903375655001203384IND60782122520221122033355.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078212252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBownik, Adam10aBehavioral disturbances induced by cyanobacterial oligopeptides microginin-FR1, anabaenopeptin-A and microcystin-LR are associated with neuromotoric and cytotoxic changes in Brachionus calyciflorus  aAquatic animals are exposed to various cyanobacterial products released concomitantly to the environment by decaying blooms. Although there exist results on the toxicity of cyanobacterial extracts little is known on the influence of pure oligopeptides or their mixtures and elucidated mechanisms of behavioral toxicity in zooplanktonic organisms. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of single and mixed pure cyanobacterial oligopeptides: microginin FR-1 (MG-FR1), anabaenopeptin-A (ANA-A) and microcystin-LR (MC-LR) at various concentrations on the swimming behavior and catecholamine neurotransmitter activity, muscular F-actin structure, DNA nuclear content and cell viability of a model rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Swimming behavior was analyzed with the use of video digital analysis. Fluorescent microscopy imaging was used to analyze neuromotoric biomarkers in the whole organisms: neuromediator release (by staining with EC517 probe), muscle F-actin filaments (by staining with blue phalloidin dye). DNA content and cytotoxicity was also determined by Hoechst 34580 and propidium iodide double staining, respectively. The results showed that single oligopeptides inhibited all the tested endpoints. The binary mixtures induced synergistic interaction on swimming speed except for MG-FR1 +MC-LR which was nearly additive. Both binary and ternary mixtures also synergistically degraded F-actin and triggered cytotoxic effects visible in the whole organisms. Antagonistic inhibitory effects of all the binary mixtures were found on catecholamine neurotransmitter activity, however the ternary mixture induced additive toxicity. Antagonistic effects of both binary and ternary mixtures were also noted on nuclear DNA content. The results of the study suggest that both depression of neurotransmission and impairment of muscle F-actin structure in muscles may contribute to mechanisms of Brachionus swimming speed inhibition by the tested single cyanobacterial oligopeptides and their mixtures. The study also showed that natural exposure of rotifers to mixtures of these cyanobacterial metabolites may result in different level of interactive toxicity with antagonistic, additive synergistic effects depending on the variants and concentrations present in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus calyciflorus 3aDNA 3aactin 3abiomarkers 3acatecholamines 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adyes 3afluorescence microscopy 3ametabolites 3amicrocystin-LR 3amuscles 3aneurotransmitters 3anuclear genome 3aoligopeptides 3aphalloidine 3apropidium 3asynaptic transmission 3asynergism 0aCyanobacteria 0aOligopeptides 0aRotifer 0aBehavioral toxicity1 aAdamczuk, Małgorzata1 aPawlik-Skowrońska, Barbara,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1294723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012500207520145100332592002801783650002301811650005201834650002301886650001401909650002101923650002001944650002201964650001301986650001801999653001602017653002202033653002402055653002602079653001502105653001802120773009902138856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60746582720221118233356.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1025262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9171-729810aWhy the Navajo Nation was hit so hard by coronavirus: Understanding the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  aThe COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic of 2019–2020 has incurred astonishing social and economic costs in the United States (US) and worldwide. Native American reservations, representing a unique geography, have been hit much harder than other parts of the country. This study seeks to understand the reasons for the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Native American communities by focusing on the Navajo Nation – the largest Native American reservation in the US. I first reviewed the historical pandemics experienced by Native Americans. Guided by the literature review, an institutional analysis focusing on the Navajo Nation suggests a lack of both institutional resilience and healthcare preparation. The analysis further identified four factors that could help explain the Navajo's slow response to the COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence of underlying chronic health conditions, lack of institutional resilience, the relationship between the federal government and tribal governments, and lack of social trust. Relevant policy implications are discussed. For instance, to better prepare Native American communities for shocking events like the COVID-19 pandemic in the future, policymaking should integrate informal institutions to build efficient formal institutions for self-governance. Promoting public health education and establishing collaborations between Native and non-Native communities are also necessary long-run strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3afederal government 3ageography 3ahealth education 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3apublic health 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 pandemic 0aFormal institutions 0aInformal institutions 0aResilience 0aNavajo nation0 tApplied geography.g2021 Sept., v. 134 p.102526-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1025263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011600169300001400285520101700299592002801316650001501344650001301359650001501372650001601387650002001403650003401423650001301457650001801470650001401488653003201502653001601534653001301550653002301563653002501586700001301611700001801624700001701642700001901659700001901678700001801697700001701715700001101732700001601743700005801759700001901817773009801836856008701934852000902021655001202030IND60629955720221122033410.0190402e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062995572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qiong13aAn improved clenbuterol detection by immunochromatographic assay with bacteria@Au composite as signal amplifier  ap. 48-55.  aImmunochromatographic assays (ICAs) are most frequently used for on-site rapid screening of clenbuterol. To improve sensitivity, a novel probe with bacteria as signal carriers was developed. Bacteria can load a great deal of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on their surface, meaning much fewer antibodies are needed to produce clearly visible results, although low concentrations of antibody could also trigger fierce competition between free analyte and the immobilized antigen. Thus, a limited number of antibodies was key to significantly improved sensitivity. Analytical conditions, including bacterial species, coupling method, and concentration, were optimized. The visual detection limit (VDL) for clenbuterol was 0.1 ng/mL, a 20-fold improvement in sensitivity compared with traditional strips. This work has opened up a new route for signal amplification and improved performance of ICAs. Furthermore, inactivated bacteria could also be environment-friendly and robust signal carriers for other biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3aclenbuterol 3adetection limit 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3ananogold 3arapid methods 3ascreening 0aImmunochromatographic assay 0aClenbuterol 0aBacteria 0aGold nanoparticles 0aSignal amplification1 aBu, Tong1 aZhang, Wentao1 aYan, Lingzhi1 aZhang, Mengyue1 aYang, Qingfeng1 aHuang, Lunjie1 aYang, Baowei1 aHu, Na1 aSuo, Yourui1 aWang, Jianlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-542X1 aZhang, Daohong0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 262 p.48-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245013700221300001400358520115600372592002801528650001001556650002801566650001301594650001701607650002501624650002401649650001501673650002101688650001901709650001401728650002101742650001301763650002101776653001301797653001601810653003201826653003001858653001701888700002501905700001801930700002001948700002401968773010601992856008602098852000902184655001202193IND60611481920221117161033.0200601e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061148192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChokradjaroen, Chayanaphat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6311-581210aCytotoxicity against cancer cells of chitosan oligosaccharides prepared from chitosan powder degraded by electrical discharge plasma  ap. 20-30.  aChitosan oligosaccharides, which obtain from degradation of chitosan, possess some interesting molecular weight-dependent biological properties, especially anticancer activity. Therefore, the conversion of chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharides with specific molecular weight has been continuously investigated in order to find effective strategies that can achieve both economic feasibility and environmental concerns. In this study, a novel process was developed to heterogeneously degrade chitosan powder by highly active species generated by electrical discharge plasma in a dilute salt solution (0.02 M) without the addition of other chemicals. The degradation rate obtained from the proposed process was comparable to that obtained from some other methods with the addition of acids and oxidizing agents. Separation of the water-soluble degraded products containing chitosan oligosaccharides from the reaction solution was simply done by filtration. The obtained chitosan oligosaccharides were further evaluated for an influence of their molecular weights on cytotoxicity against cancer cells and the selectivity toward cancer and normal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aantineoplastic activity 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3aeconomic feasibility 3aelectric discharges 3afiltration 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligosaccharides 3aoxidants 3awater solubility 0aChitosan 0aDegradation 0aElectrical discharge plasma 0aChitosan oligosaccharides 0aCancer cells1 aTheeramunkong, Sewan1 aYui, Hiroharu1 aSaito, Nagahiro1 aRujiravanit, Ratana0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 201 p.20-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012100163300001600284520116400300592002801464650002401492650002501516650002201541650002101563650002801584650002401612650001501636650001401651650001401665650003301679650002701712650001301739650001601752653002901768653002201797653001401819653002401833700001901857700001901876773011301895856008602008852000902094655001202103IND60581245220221119222329.0190321e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058124522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Bo13aAn integrated and environmental-friendly technology for recovering valuable materials from waste tantalum capacitors  ap. 512-518.  aWaste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) are valuable urban ore for recycling. Many efforts have been done to recover resources from basal boards of WPCB. In addition to basal boards, WPCBs contain many electronic components. However, the recycling technology for electronic components has been poorly developed. This study proposed an integrated and environment-friendly technology for recycling waste tantalum capacitors (WTCs) of WPCBs. Firstly, the WTCs were treated by argon pyrolysis to decompose mold resin. The pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C and holding time for 30 min were considered as the optimal parameters. Then, the pyrolysis residues were performed by crush and magnetic separation to recover nickel-iron terminals. Finally, chloride metallurgy (CM) was used to recover rare metal tantalum (Ta). The Ta recovery rate could reach 92.87 ± 0.36%. The optimal parameters were determined as temperature of 493 °C, adding FeCl2·4H2O of 53 wt% and holding time for 150 min based on the response surface methodology (RSM).

Both TRPM4-K.O. clones demonstrated lower proliferation and viability compared to the parental cells. Migration was also impaired in the TRPM4-K.O. cells. Additionally, analysis of 210 prostate cancer patient tissues demonstrates a positive association between TRPM4 protein expression and local/metastatic progression. Moreover, a decreased adhesion rate was detected in the two K.O. clones compared to DU145 cells.Next, we tested three novel TRPM4 inhibitors with whole-cell patch clamp technique for their potential to block TRPM4 currents. CBA, NBA and LBA partially inhibited TRPM4 currents in DU145 cells. However, none of these inhibitors demonstrated any TRPM4-specific effect in the cellular assays.To evaluate if the observed effect of TRPM4 K.O. on migration, viability, and cell cycle is linked to TRPM4 ion conductivity, we transfected TRPM4-K.O. cells with either TRPM4 wild-type or a dominant-negative mutant, non-permeable to Na⁺. Our data showed a partial rescue of the viability of cells expressing functional TRPM4, while the pore mutant was not able to rescue this phenotype. For cell cycle distribution, TRPM4 ion conductivity was not essential since TRPM4 wild-type and the pore mutant rescued the phenotype.In conclusion, TRPM4 contributes to viability, migration, cell cycle shift, and adhesion; however, blocking TRPM4 ion conductivity is insufficient to prevent its role in cancer hallmark functions in prostate cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aadhesion 3acalcium 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3agene editing 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman diseases 3aion channels 3ametastasis 3amutants 3aneoplasm cells 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asodium 0apatch-clamp 0asmall molecule inhibitors 0aadhesion 0aproliferation 0amigration 0aTRPM4 0aADT 0aCRPC 0aFA 0aEMT 0aIF 0aTMA1 aHauert, Barbara1 aKappel, Sven1 aZoni, Eugenio1 aKiener, Mirjam1 aStokłosa, Paulina1 aBaur, Roland1 aSpahn, Martin1 aKruithof-de Julio, Marianna1 aPeinelt, Christine0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 433, no. 17 p.166665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245009400187300001600281520163600297592002801933650002901961650001101990650001802001650001102019650002902030650001302059650001502072650002102087650001102108650001102119650001402130650001502144650003702159650002302196650002702219650001102246650001102257650001102268650001102279650000902290653001102299653001302310653002502323653001502348653000902363653002202372653001402394700002402408700002002432700002002452700002102472700002002493700002002513700002302533700006202556773009102618856009002709852000902799655001202808IND60649451620221119072135.0190913e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064945162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBancon-Montigny, Chrystelle10aSeasonal changes of chemical contamination in coastal waters during sediment resuspension  ap. 651-661.  aThe potential of remobilization of pollutants is a major problem for anthropogenic ecosystems, because even when the anthropogenic source of pollution is identified and removed, pollutants stored in sediments can be released into the water column and impact pelagic communities during sediment resuspension provoked by dredging, storms or bottom trawling. The objectives of the present study were to assess the changes observed in the chemical composition of the water column following resuspension of a polluted marine sediment and the consequences for the chemical composition of adjacent marine waters according to season. For that purpose, an experimental sediment resuspension protocol was performed on four distinct occasions, spring, summer, fall and winter, and the changes in nutrients, organic contaminants and inorganic contaminants were measured after mixing sediment elutriate with lagoon waters and offshore waters sampled nearby. Significant seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the contaminated sediments were observed, with a strong accumulation of PAHs in fall, whereas minimum PAH concentrations were observed during winter. In all seasons, sediment resuspension provoked a significant enrichment in nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and trace metal elements like Ni, Cu, and Zn in offshore waters and lagoon waters, with enrichment factors that were season and site dependent. The most pronounced changes were observed for offshore waters, especially in spring and winter, whereas the chemical composition of lagoon waters was weakly impacted by the compounds supplied by sediment resuspension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3acoastal water 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3adredging 3aecosystems 3amarine sediments 3amixing 3anickel 3anutrients 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aseasonal variation 3asediment contamination 3aspring 3astorms 3asummer 3awinter 3azinc 0aLagoon 0aOffshore 0aTrace metal elements 0aPesticides 0aPAHs 0aEnrichment factor 0aElutriate1 aGonzalez, Catherine1 aDelpoux, Sophie1 aAvenzac, Muriel1 aSpinelli, Sylvie1 aMhadhbi, Takoua1 aMejri, Kaouther1 aHlaili, Asma Sakka1 aPringault, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2363-83760 tChemosphere.g2019 Nov., v. 235 p.651-661dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015800165300001600323520198300339592002802322650002002350650002802370650001002398650001602408650001202424650001602436650001402452650001902466650001702485650002202502650001602524650002402540650002602564650002002590650001002610650001102620650002002631650002102651650001802672650002002690650002002710650002202730650004302752650001302795650001602808650001902824650001202843650001902855650002102874653000902895653001002904653000802914653000902922653000702931653000802938653000702946653000802953653000802961653002102969653002002990653002103010653002003031653002103051700001903072700001603091700001903107773009503126856008403221852000903305655001203314IND60584923220221119043946.0190416e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Qiulan10aIdentification and expression profile of an alpha-COPI homologous gene (COPA1) involved in high irradiance and salinity stress in Haematococcus pluvialis  ap. 220-228.  aIn response to stresses, Haematococcus pluvialis accumulates triacylglycerols (TAGs) and astaxanthin, which are highly positively correlated in cells. Coatomer protein I (COPI) complexes play important roles in protein and lipid transportation between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The proposed functions of COPI alpha-subunit (COPA1) were to maintain the integrity of endomembrane system and to regulate cellular physiological activities (such as autophagy, protein sorting, secretory trafficking and lipid metabolism). However, only scarce information has been reported on this subunit. In this study, the full-length cDNA encoding H. pluvialis COPA1 (HpCOPA1) and its promoter were cloned and further analyzed by bioinformatics tools. The predicted length of HpCOPA1 was 1234 amino acids (AAs), including WDR, Coatomer-WDAD and COPI-C motifs. The AA sequence of HpCOPA1 was highly identical (78%–99%) to other algal COPA1 and had a highly conserved WDR domain at the N terminus. The promoter of HpCOPA1 contained cis-elements in relation to light and salt stresses, such as AE-box, MNF1, CCAAT-box and TCA-element. Moreover, real-time qPCR analyses showed that the mRNA level of HpCOPA1 was strongly induced by treatments with either high irradiance, or high salinity (45mM sodium acetate) or in combination. HpCOPA1 revealed a delayed but higher peak expression level in treatments with high salinity (12.5-fold at 4h) compared with high irradiance (4.7-fold at 2h). To investigate its subcellular localization, HpCOPA1 was expressed in tobacco lower epidermal leaf cells in fusion with GFP. The results showed that HpCOPA1 was localized to plasma membrane and endomembrane system, partly similar to the localization of COPA1 in higher plants and animals. Taken together, the present results would contribute to the further elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and transportation of lipids and astaxanthin in H. pluvialis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aalgae 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3aastaxanthin 3aautophagy 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3acorrelation 3aendomembrane system 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alipid metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3aplants (botany) 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein transport 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium acetate 3atobacco 3atransportation 3atriacylglycerols 0aCOPI 0aCOPA1 0aTAG 0aRACE 0aHL 0aWDR 0aER 0aROS 0aLBs 0aCoatomer protein 0aHigh irradiance 0aLipid metabolism 0aSalinity stress 0aWD repeat domain1 aNing, Jingjing1 aHu, Zhangli1 aWang, Chaogang0 tAlgal research.g2017 Dec., v. 28 p.220-228dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245021200166520105100378592002801429650002701457650002301484650001701507650001901524650001901543650001401562650001301576650001901589650001201608650001801620650002901638650001701667653003501684653002601719653003801745653003401783653002801817653000601845653001201851653000801863653000801871653000701879653000801886653000701894653000801901653000901909653001001918653000801928653001201936653000801948653001001956653000701966653000801973653000801981653000801989653000801997653000702005653001202012653000802024700001702032700001402049700001302063700001702076700001502093700001602108700001702124700001702141700002002158773010802178856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60746583020221118233807.0220205e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1184832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yang10aGraft copolymer of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and polyether polyol (CMC-g-TMN-450) improves the crosslinking degree of polyurethane for coated fertilizers with enhanced controlled release characteristics  aNovel superhydrophobic sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) modified polyurethane (MPU) was developed as the membrane material for controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) by cross-linking polymerization of 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and CMC-based modified polyol (CMP) which was made by grafting CMC onto polyether polyol (TMN-450). The modified polyurethane coated fertilizer (MPUCF) was prepared by using MPU as the membrane material through a fluidized bed device. Analysis results of ¹³C NMR showed that the coatings of PUCF and MPUCF were prepared by connecting hydroxyl to isocyanate groups to form a carbamate. MPU had lower water absorption rates than PU, and MPUCF coating showed excellent hydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that MPUCF coating surface was much more smooth and flat than that of PUCF. Furthermore, the nitrogen (N) release longevity of MPUCF can increased to 140 days when the coating rate was 5%. It is concluded that MPU was an excellent superhydrophobic coating material for CRF.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3afluidized beds 3ahydrophobicity 3alongevity 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3aslow-release fertilizers 3awater uptake 0aSodium carboxymethyl cellulose 0aModified polyurethane 0aSuperhydrophobic coating material 0aControlled-release fertilizer 0aRelease characteristics 0aN 0aTMN-450 0aMDI 0aCMC 0aDS 0aCMP 0aPU 0aMPU 0aPUCF 0aMPUCF 0aCRF 0aGC–MS 0aGPC 0aFT-IR 0aTG 0aDTG 0aDTA 0aSEM 0aWCA 0aWA 0aCP/TOSS 0aNMR1 aSun, Mingxue1 aQiao, Dan1 aLi, Juan1 aWang, Yajing1 aLiu, Weiyi1 aBunt, Craig1 aLiu, Hongxia1 aLiu, Jinlong1 aYang, Xiangdong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 272 p.118483-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1184833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015500174300001600329520097700345536031401322592002801636596011401664650001501778650001501793650001301808650001701821650001901838650001401857650001301871650001901884653002801903653002901931653001901960653000801979653000701987700001901994700002402013700002402037773015002061856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60594687820221116171931.0180522e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059468782DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2018.14436682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeauchamp, Nicolas10aUse of differential absorbance to estimate concentrations of chlorinated disinfection by-product in drinking water: Critical review and research needs  ap. 210-241.  aDifferential UV absorbance (ΔA) has been proposed as a method for estimating disinfection by-products (DBP) concentrations in drinking water at a lower cost and at higher frequencies than the sampling programs required by regulations. Various equations developed in laboratory settings between individual DBP concentrations and ΔA₂₇₂ have been reported in the literature. Although the form of the DBP–ΔA relationships (linear or exponential) is shared by most published studies, the fitting parameters vary and must be calibrated for each site. This is usually explained by differences in the nature of the natural organic matter (NOM) reacting with free chlorine. This literature review suggests that future research should first focus on improving our understanding of the reaction between NOM moieties and chlorine, and its impact on UV absorbance spectra, and second on overcoming the challenges of applying ΔA for estimating DBPs in full-scale facilities.  aNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (459125-13).

To develop remediation strategies, we proposed a comprehensive mathematical model to describe the As removal in a arsenite (As (III)) oxidizing and ferrous iron (Fe (II)) oxidizing denitrifying granular biofilm system. In the model framework, the growth-linked microbial oxidation of As (III) and Fe (II) was coupled to chemolithotrophic denitrification of one-step reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Meanwhile, the precipitation of ferric iron (Fe (III)) and adsorption of arsenate (As (V)) onto the biogenic Fe (III) (hydr)oxides were also considered. The model was calibrated by comparing the model predictions against experimental data from batch experiments. The validity of the model was further demonstrated through testing against long-term experimental results from five independent bioreactors with different reactor configurations and operational conditions. Modeling results revealed that the granule size would exert a limited impact on arsenic and iron removal. Nevertheless, their removal efficiencies increased rapidly with the increase of hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 1 h to 12 h, but became independent of HRT as it further increased. The established model framework enables interpretation of a range of experimental observations on As and Fe removal and helps to identify the optimal conditions for enhanced arsenic remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3agroundwater 3airon 3amathematical models 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3aremediation 0aArsenic 0aMathematical model 0aDenitrifying granular biofilm 0aGranule size 0aHydraulic retention time1 aLiu, Yiwen1 aSun, Jing1 aWang, Dongbo1 aDai, Xiaohu1 aNi, Bing-Jie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.449-457dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005700155245014500212300001600357520104200373592002801415650001401443650001101457650001801468650001401486650001601500650001901516650001801535650001701553650001801570650001801588650001101606650001401617650001501631651001001646653001501656653001301671653001001684653001401694653000901708700001601717700001801733700002201751700002201773700001601795773009101811856009001902852000901992655001202001IND60649451820221119072142.0190913e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064945182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubo, Atsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6136-009910aSpatial variation in sedimentary radioactive cesium concentrations in Tokyo Bay following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident  ap. 550-555.  aCesium-137 concentrations in sediment (137Cs) at Tokyo Bay were measured at 26 stations during 2017. Average 137Cs concentrations at the Arakawa river mouth (117 ± 46 Bq kg−1) were approximately six times higher than those of the other stations in the bay (20 ± 16 Bq kg−1). There were radiocesium-bearing microparticles in the bay sediment as well as in suspended matter of Fukushima coastal waters. Radioactivity of radiocesium-bearing microparticles was estimated to be 0.12 Bq. However, the contributions of radiocesium-bearing microparticles to each 137Cs concentration of the bulk sample were low; 3% was the maximum. The 137Cs inventory in sediment at the entire bay was 0.67 TBq, showing that a large amount of 137Cs was supplied to the bay from the river following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Approximately 9.2% of the 137Cs which was fallout in the drainage basin has already flowed into the bay from the watershed, which is approximately 3.2 times higher than that of a previous estimate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3acesium 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3ainventories 3amicroparticles 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3asediments 3awatersheds 3aJapan 0aCesium-137 0aSediment 0aFDNPP 0aTokyo bay 0aCsMP1 aTanabe, Kai1 aItō, Yukari,1 aIshimaru, Takashi1 aArakawa, Hisayuki1 aKanda, Jota0 tChemosphere.g2019 Nov., v. 235 p.550-555dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.2153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015900174500001900333520210900352592002802461650001602489650001102505650002202516650002002538650001002558650001202568650001602580650001902596651001102615653001702626653001902643653003102662653002802693653002802721700005902749700002002808700001702828700002302845773011302868856008202981852000903063655001203072IND60696273120221120141828.0200907e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069627312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2020.1051422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKądziołka, Katarzyna10aTowards better reconstruction of smelting temperatures: Methodological review and the case of historical K-rich Cu-slags from the Old Copper Basin, Poland  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTemperature is a crucial factor influencing the effectiveness of metal smelting process. When studied in historical slags it provides information on the evolution of smelting technologies over time and how humankind approached metal recovery. Methodological approaches to temperature reconstruction using pyrometallurgical slags vary and this study serves as a critical review of the methods used so far with the complex historical smelting site used as an example of the application of the methods. The example includes silica-undersaturated, potassium-rich Cu slags from four sites in the Old Copper Basin (Stare Zagłębie Miedziowe), Poland, and is of particular interest because (a) K-rich slag compositions are not widely found and this provides additional challenge to temperature reconstruction approach and (b) the site provides material of different ages (18ᵗʰ and 19ᵗʰ century) and, therefore, gives insight into potentially different pyrometallurgical processes. Several methods are compared and include phase diagrams, geothermometry (Cpx-WR), thermodynamic modelling with MELTS software and temperature XRD analyses with the main implication that most of the methods have their merits, but modelling by MELTS software returns the most reliable estimates of liquidus temperature. In fact, MELTS is the only method that returns differences of 200 °C in reconstructed temperatures between the studied sites, which signifies a change in smelting technique probably related to the change in input material. More importantly, MELTS may also be used to estimate crystallization interval (temperature difference between solidus and liquidus) that together with liquidus temperature gives insight into metal extraction efficiency for a given site and provides information on society advancement in metallurgy. The software can also be used cost-effectively for a large number of samples and its combination with experimental approach (temperature XRD analyses) provides the most promising tool to reconstruct differences in smelting technologies of ancient and historical metallurgical sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3abasins 3acomputer software 3acrystallization 3aslags 3asociety 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aPoland 0aArchaeometry 0aMetal smelting 0aTemperature reconstruction 0aThermodynamic modelling 0aHistorical copper slags1 aPietranik, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3990-87211 aKierczak, Jakub1 aPotysz, Anna1 aStolarczyk, Tomasz0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 June, v. 118 p.105142-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1051423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013700167520118200304592002801486650001501514650001401529650001901543650001401562650001501576650000701591650001401598650001601612650001101628650002001639650003701659650001401696650001901710653003701729653004301766653002601809653002701835653004101862700001401903700001401917700001701931700001701948773010801965856008602073852000902159655001202168IND60746583220221118233850.0210926e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1184922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xinyu10aHigh-viscosity Pickering emulsion stabilized by amphiphilic alginate/SiO2 via multiscale methodology for crude oil-spill remediation  aThe separation of crude oil from oily water and collection of the emulsion constituents has attracted significant attention. We demonstrate that the relationships between inherent dynamic factors and the performance of a Pickering emulsion stabilized by SiO₂ particles with adsorbed hydrophobically modified sodium alginate derivatives (HMSA), a natural pH-sensitive polysaccharide, can be clarified via a multi-scale methodology. Functionalization of the silica surface with HMSA controls particle dispersibility, as verified by turbidity and stability analyses, the zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy measurements. The interaction mechanism between HMSA and SiO₂ nanoparticles was elucidated by both experimental adsorption measurements and computer simulations, which showed qualitative consistency. The aggregation/disaggregation of HMSA/SiO₂ particles achieved by tuning the pH of the solution facilitated reversible dispersibility/collectability behavior. Overall, a high-viscosity Pickering emulsion system based on particle-particle and droplet-droplet interactions, which can be filtered for the recovery of spilled crude oil, was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acomputers 3adispersibility 3aemulsions 3aoil spills 3apH 3apetroleum 3aremediation 3asilica 3asodium alginate 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aturbidity 3azeta potential 0aAmphiphilic alginate derivatives 0aAggregation/disaggregation interaction 0aMolecular simulations 0aMultiscale methodology 0aCollection of crude oil constituents1 aHe, Furui1 aYu, Gaobo1 aFeng, Yuhong1 aLi, Jiacheng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 273 p.118492-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1184923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245017400207300001400381520126800395592002801663650002001691650001701711650001301728650002301741650001601764650002801780650002601808650001501834650001501849650002401864650002401888650001501912650001401927650001901941653000801960653000701968653000801975653000801983653000801991653001001999653000902009653000802018653000802026653000802034653001102042653001202053653000702065653000802072653000702080653000902087653000802096653000702104653000802111653000702119653000802126653000702134653000702141653000802148653000802156653000802164653000702172653001902179653002502198653002002223653001502243653002402258653002002282700006002302700002302362700002002385700002302405700002302428700006202451773009302513856008402606852000902690655001202699IND60584923520221119042351.0190416e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerin, Giorgio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9204-408010aCultivation in industrially relevant conditions has a strong influence on biological properties and performances of Nannochloropsis gaditana genetically modified strains  ap. 88-99.  aMicroalgae are promising feedstocks for the production of biofuels thanks to their high biomass yield and the lack of competition with food crops for arable land. Algal industrial exploitation, however, still needs to address several technological challenges to reach energetic and economic sustainability. Genetic improvement of microalgae strains is seminal to fully exploit the potential of these organisms.In this work, we investigated how key environmental parameters affected productivity of a promising genetically modified algal strain cultivated in industrially relevant conditions. We observed that intensive growth conditions strongly influenced algae biology as evidenced by molecular and functional analyses. We also showed that specific operational conditions significantly affected performances, enhancing or reducing the advantages of the strains genetic modification, such as the chlorophyll content per cell and the abundance of photosynthetic apparatus components.This work demonstrates the presence of a strong influence of cultivation environment on the phenotype of improved strains, suggesting that operational parameters have a seminal influence on algae performances and must be taken into full account during strains development efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3aarable soils 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental factors 3afeedstocks 3afood crops 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic improvement 3amicroalgae 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 0aAEF 0aAS 0aCar 0aCEF 0aChl 0aDBMIB 0aDCMU 0aECS 0aEMS 0aETR 0aGC-FID 0aGC–MS 0aHA 0aLab 0aFA 0aFAME 0aLHC 0aMV 0aNPQ 0aPE 0aPBR 0aPS 0aRT 0aROS 0aTAG 0aTEF 0aWT 0aPhotosynthesis 0aBiomass productivity 0aNannochloropsis 0aMicroalgae 0aGenetic engineering 0aPhotobioreactor1 aSimionato, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2774-66411 aBellan, Alessandra1 aCarone, Michele1 aOcchipinti, Andrea1 aMaffei, Massimo E.1 aMorosinotto, Tomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0803-75910 tAlgal research.g2017 Dec., v. 28 p.88-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012300209300001400332520102300346592002801369650002201397650001301419650002001432650002001452650001101472650001401483653000801497653000701505653000801512653000901520653000801529653001201537653001201549653003001561653001601591653002401607653001401631773010601645856008601751852000901837655001201846IND60611482320221117161022.0200601e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061148232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatara, Tsuneo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6346-466810aContrasting effects of albumin and hydroxyethyl starch solutions on physical properties of sodium hyaluronate solution  ap. 60-64.  aHydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution reportedly sheds the endothelial surface layer (ESL) consisting of polysaccharide glycosaminoglycans, whereas albumin stabilizes the ESL. Here we compared the effects of albumin and HES (MW 130,000) solutions on the physical properties of sodium hyaluronate (NaHA, MW 1.3 × 10⁶) solution, a constituent of the ESL. Partial specific volumes (v) and intrinsic viscosities ([η]) of NaHA in 0.15 M NaCl solution containing albumin or HES (1–3%) were calculated from densities and viscosities extrapolated at infinite dilutions. Flow activation energy (E) of 0.2% NaHA in phosphate-buffered saline containing albumin or HES was obtained from the temperature-dependence of viscosities. A 3% albumin solution decreased v of NaHA by 3% compared to HES. A 3% HES solution, but not albumin, decreased [η] of NaHA by 34%, and decreased E values by 11% compared to albumin. These findings suggest that HES locally restricts NaHA dispersion, whereas albumin contracts NaHA structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalbumins 3ahyaluronic acid 3asodium chloride 3astarch 3aviscosity 0aESL 0aHA 0aHES 0aNaHA 0aPBS 0aAlbumin 0aDensity 0aEndothelial surface layer 0aHyaluronate 0aHydroxyethyl starch 0aViscosity0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 201 p.60-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300001800288520115900306592002801465650001701493650001601510650001301526650001301539650000901552650002901561650001101590650001501601650001201616650001301628650001601641650001401657653000801671653002901679653002301708653002301731653001901754700001601773773012201789856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60713037720221121144447.0201104e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManka, Szymon W.10aThermodynamic and Mechanistic Insights into Coupled Binding and Unwinding of Collagen by Matrix Metalloproteinase 1  ap. 5985-5993.  aLocal unwinding of the collagen triple helix is a necessary step for initiating the collagen degradation cascade in extracellular matrices. A few matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to support this key process, but its energetic aspects remain unknown. Here, we captured the thermodynamics of the triple helix unwinding by monitoring interactions between a collagen peptide and MMP-1(E200A) – an active-site mutant of an archetypal vertebrate collagenase – at increasing temperatures, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Coupled binding and unwinding manifests as a curved relationship between the total enthalpy change and temperature of the reaction, producing increasingly negative heat capacity change (ΔΔCₚ ≈ −36.3 kcal/molK²). A specially designed solid-phase binding and cleavage assay (SPBCA) reported strain in the catalytically relevant unwound state, suggesting that this state is distinct from the horizon of sampled conformations of the collagenase-susceptible site. MMP-1 appears to blend selected fit with induced fit mechanisms to catalyse collagen unwinding prior to cleavage of individual collagen chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acalorimetry 3acollagen 3aenthalpy 3aheat 3ainterstitial collagenase 3amixing 3amonitoring 3amutants 3apeptides 3atemperature 3atitration 0aMMP 0aSelected and induced fit 0aCoupled equilibria 0aCollagen unwinding 0aCollagenolysis1 aBrew, Keith0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 432, no. 22 p.5985-5993dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245013300197300001800330520097400348592002801322650003401350650001301384650001601397650002201413650001401435700001601449700005801465700001501523700001701538700005701555700005301612773014701665856007601812852000901888655001201897IND60688553020221118132202.0200415e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068855302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c021882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Qilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8871-832910aDiscovering Large Isotropic Negative Thermal Expansion in Framework Compound AgB(CN)₄ via the Concept of Average Atomic Volume  ap. 6935-6939.  aExploring isotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) compounds is interesting, but remains challenging. Here, a new concept of “average atomic volume” is proposed to find new NTE open-framework materials. According to this guidance, two NTE compounds, AgB(CN)₄ and CuB(CN)₄, have been discovered, of which AgB(CN)₄ exhibits a large NTE over a wide temperature range (αᵥ = −40 × 10–⁶ K–¹, 100–600 K). The analysis by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and first-principles calculation indicate that (i) the NTE driving force comes from the transverse vibrations of bridge chain atoms of C and N, corresponding to the low-frequency phonon modes; and (ii) the same transverse vibration direction of C and N atoms is a key factor for the occurrence of strong NTE in AgB(CN)₄. The present concept of “average atomic volume” can be a simple parameter to explore new NTE compounds especially in those open-framework materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aisotropy 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 3avibration1 aWang, Jiaqi1 aSanson, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3218-35531 aSun, Qiang1 aLiang, Erjun1 aXing, Xianran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0704-88861 aChen, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7330-89760 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 142, no. 15 p.6935-6939dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c021883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245004600209300001600255520175100271592002802022650001502050650001402065650001102079650001602090650001002106650001702116650000902133650001402142650001802156650002402174650001602198650001102214650001502225653000902240653001602249653002502265653002702290700001802317700002502335700002502360773010202385856008702487852000902574655001202583IND60545754920221119123341.0170719e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yi-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-442110aIron as a source of color in river waters  ap. 914-923.  aOrganic chromophores of total organic carbon (TOC) and those of iron (Fe) contribute to the color of water, but the relative contributions of colored organic carbon (COC%) and Fe (Fe%) are poorly known. In this study, we unraveled Fe% and COC% in 6128 unfiltered water samples collected from 94 Finnish river sites of contrasting catchment properties. According to regression analysis focusing on TOC alone, on average 84% of the mean TOC consisted of COC, while 16% was non-colored or below the color-detection limit. COC and Fe were much more important sources of color than phytoplankton (chlorophyll a as a proxy) or non-algal particles (suspended solids as a proxy). When COC and Fe were considered as the only two sources of color, COC% ranged from 16.8% to 99.5% (mean 71%) and Fe% from 0.5% to 83.2% (mean 29%). Similar Fe% and COC% values were obtained when color was estimated from the absorption coefficients of COC and Fe at 490nm. Fe% increased as a function of the concentration of Fe and was well predicted by the TOC-to-Fe mass ratio. In 608 samples with TOC-to-Fe ratios of <4.5, Fe dominated the color. TOC-to-Fe ratios varied widely within most sites, but in relation to hydrology. In catchments with a peatland coverage of >30%, peak flow exported elevated amounts of TOC relative to Fe and resulted in a high COC%. Base flow, instead, mobilized elevated amounts Fe relative to TOC and resulted in a high Fe%. In a catchment covered with 31% of agricultural fields, peak flow transported eroded soil particles high in Fe and thus resulted in a high Fe%, while during base flow the water was high in COC%. This study demonstrated that Fe% and COC% vary widely in river water depending on the catchment properties and hydrology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abase flow 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aeroded soils 3airon 3apeatlands 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3ariver water 3arivers 3awatersheds 0aIron 0aWater color 0aTotal organic carbon 0aAbsorption coefficient1 aRäike, Antti1 aHartikainen, Helinä1 aVähätalo, Anssi V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.914-923dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245015900158300001800317520179600335592002802131653001502159653001302174653002202187653002002209653002602229653001902255700002302274773010602297856007202403852000902475655001202484IND60127122320221121183342.0151110e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012712232DNAL7 a10.1554/02-4952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFetzner, James W.10aLinear habitats and the nested clade analysis: an empirical evaluation of geographic versus river distances using an ozark crayfish (decapoda: cambaridae)  ap. 2101-2118.  aThe nested clade analysis can be extremely useful in testing for an association between genetic variation and geography and in explaining these observed patterns in terms of historical or contemporary population processes. The strength of this method lies in its ability to test a variety of processes simultaneously under a rigorous statistical framework. Indeed, many recent studies have used the nested analysis in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic taxa. However, it has been suggested that riverine, riparian, or coastal species may be better examined using river (or coastal) distances rather than the standard geographic (great circle) distances among populations. It is thought that the standard geographic distances may not adequately describe the actual distances involved between populations of species inhabiting these one-dimensional (riverine) habitats. Therefore, we analyzed population data from an Ozark crayfish, Orconectes luteus, to examine the effects on the results of a nested clade analysis using river distances. In most cases, the haplotypes detected in this crayfish were unique to a particular drainage or a group of neighboring drainages, indicating very little movement of individuals among drainages. Five major population groups were detected, corresponding to many of the major river drainages sampled in this study. The two types of distance analyses obtain similar results for higher-level (older) clades, but differ in many of the inferences made for lower-level (younger) clades. However, we suggest that the comparison of both types of analyses for riverine species may enhance the process of elucidating historical and contemporary population processes, especially in cases where the transfer of individuals among different drainages are involved.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCambaridae 0acrayfish 0agenetic variation 0alinear habitats 0anested clade analysis 0aphylogeography1 aCrandall, Keith A.0 tEvolution.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.2101-2118dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F02-4953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245008200212300001800294520169300312592002802005650002202033650002402055650001002079650001202089650002102101650001602122650001102138653000902149653001202158653002602170653001302196653001302209653001102222700005502233700002402288700002602312700002302338700001902361700002402380700002502404700006102429700001602490700002302506700006002529700001702589700001902606700002102625773009902646856008602745852000902831655001202840IND60742989220221118135749.0210708e20210713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074298922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDassah, Sylvester1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1880-550710aExtended follow-up of children in a phase2b trial of the GMZ2 malaria vaccine  ap. 4314-4319.  aThe GMZ2/alum candidate malaria vaccine had an efficacy of 14% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6%, 23%) against clinical malaria over 6 months of follow-up in a phase2b multicentre trial in children 1–5 years of age. Here we report the extended follow up of safety and efficacy over 2 years.A total of 1849 (GMZ2 = 926, rabies = 923) children aged 12–60 months were randomized to receive intramuscularly, either 3 doses of 100 μg GMZ2/alum or 3 doses of rabies vaccine as control 28 days apart. The children were followed-up for 24 months for clinical malaria episodes and adverse events. The primary endpoint was documented fever with parasitaemia of at least 5000/μL.There were 2,062 malaria episodes in the GMZ2/alum group and 2,115 in the rabies vaccine group in the intention-to-treat analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) of 6.5% (95%: CI −1.6%, 14.0%). In children aged 1–2 years at enrolment, VE was 3.6% (95 %CI: −9.1%, 14.8%) in the first year and −4.1% (95 %CI: −18.7%, 87%) in the second year. In children aged 3–5 years at enrolment VE was 19.9% (95 %CI: 7.7%, 30.4%) in the first year and 6.3% (95 %CI: −10.2%, 20.3%) in the second year (interaction by year, P = 0.025, and by age group, P = 0.085). A total of 187 (GMZ2 = 91, rabies = 96) serious adverse events were recorded in 167 individuals over the entire period of the study. There were no GMZ2 vaccine related serious adverse events.GMZ2/alum was well tolerated. Follow-up over 2 years confirmed a low level of vaccine efficacy with slightly higher efficacy in older children, which suggests GMZ2 may act in concert with naturally acquired immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive immunity 3aconfidence interval 3afever 3amalaria 3amalaria vaccines 3aparasitemia 3arabies 0aGMZ2 0aVaccine 0aPlasmodium falciparum 0aEfficacy 0aChildren 0aAfrica1 aAdu, Bright1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3622-21371 aSirima, Sodiomon B.1 aMordmüller, Benjamin1 aNgoa, Ulysse Ateba1 aAtuguba, Frank1 aArthur, Fareed K.N.1 aMensah, Benedicta A.1 aKaddumukasa, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7390-73301 aBang, Peter1 aKremsner, Peter G.1 aMategula, Donnie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7109-90421 aFlach, Clare1 aMilligan, Paul1 aTheisen, Michael0 tVaccine.g2021 July 13, v. 39, no. 31 p.4314-4319dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011300164300002000277520107400297592002801371650001901399650001301418650001301431650001901444650002601463650002101489650001701510650001701527650001901544650001901563700001501582700005601597700001801653700001901671700001301690773017301703856008001876852000901956655001201965IND60601943120221116180650.0180709e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060194312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b036612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuping10aSynthesis of Al2O3–Y2O3 Ceramic Coatings on the Fe–Cr–Al Wire via Aqueous Cathodic Plasma Electrolysis  ap. 15058-15064.  aThe Al₂O₃–Y₂O₃ coating was successfully prepared by cathodic plasma electrolysis on the FeCrAl wire. Influences of the electrolyte composition and the processing parameters on the microstructure and property of the Al₂O₃–Y₂O₃ ceramic coating were systematically investigated. The coating was mainly composed of γ-Al₂O₃, α-Al₂O₃, and Y₂O₃. Experimental results showed that the thickness of the coating was gradually increased with the increase of working voltage, while the bonding became poor. With an increase in the deposition time, the thickness and the electrical resistance of the Al₂O₃–Y₂O₃ coating were increased in a certain range. When the Al₂O₃–Y₂O₃ coating was deposited at 110 V for 60–90 s, the bonding between the coating and the substrate was superior, and the coating microstructure was dense, continuous, and uniform with the electrical resistance reaching up to ∼40 MΩ. The formation mechanism of the coating was also discussed based on the electrochemical mechanism and the plasma discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aceramics 3acoatings 3aelectric power 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3amicrostructure 3aprocess design1 aChen, Chao1 aChen, Weiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5170-36441 aCheng, Huanwu1 aWang, Yingchun1 aWang, Lu0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 56, no. 51 p.15058-15064dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b036613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008300158300001600241520083600257592002801093650001601121650001901137650001401156650001701170650001001187650001401197650001001211650000901221650001101230651001001241653001601251653001401267653001501281653001801296653001401314700001901328700002401347773014401371856007201515852000901587655001201596IND60747538220221122224420.0210814e20210806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074753822DNAL7 a10.1898/NWN20-132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, Cody F10aDirect observations of a wolverine scavenging at an active gray wolf kill site  ap. 157-160.  aScavenging carrion is an important source of nutrition for Wolverines (Gulo gulo), which are facultative scavengers. Other large carnivores, particularly Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), may compete with and exclude Wolverines from carrion or pose a risk of death or injury to Wolverines attempting to consume these resources. We used a video-camera trap to document a Wolverine scavenging an Elk (Cervus elaphus) being actively consumed by a Gray Wolf in Idaho. The Wolverine investigated the kill, ate, scent marked, and removed pieces of the carcass to cache at other sites. Between the 2nd and 3rd visit by the Wolverine, a wolf returns to feed at the kill. These observations establish that Wolverines do not necessarily avoid kills when Gray Wolves are present and that species interactions are more complex than generally thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCervus elaphus 3aGulo gulo 3adead animals 3adeath 3anutrition 3aodors 3arisk 3awolves 3aIdaho 0acompetition 0aGray Wolf 0ascavenging 0ascent marking 0aWolverine1 aGolla, Julie M1 aAllen, Maximilian L0 tNorthwestern naturalist.g2021 Aug. 6, v. 102, no. 2 p.157-160dSociety for Northwestern Vertebrate BiologywJournal:13816x1051-17337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1898/NWN20-133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015100167300002000318520113300338592002801471650000901499650001201508650001401520650002201534650001201556650001401568650002801582650001501610650002001625653002801645653001201673653001901685653001501704653002001719653002501739700001601764700003601780700006001816773015001876856008002026852000902106655001202115IND60621990420221120164421.0181123e20181025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062199042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b041442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,10aNovel Two-Step Process Utilizing a Single Enzyme for the Production of High-Titer 3,6-Anhydro-l-galactose from Agarose Derived from Red Macroalgae  ap. 12249-12256.  a3,6-Anhydro-l-galactose (l-AHG), a major component of agarose derived from red macroalgae, has excellent potential for industrial applications based on its physiological activities such as skin whitening, moisturizing, anticariogenicity, and anti-inflammation. However, l-AHG is not yet commercially available due to the complexity, inefficiency, and high cost of the current processes for producing l-AHG. Currently, l-AHG production depends on a multistep process requiring several enzymes. Here, we designed and tested a novel two-step process for obtaining high-titer l-AHG by using a single enzyme. First, to depolymerize agarose preferentially into agarobiose (AB) at a high titer, the agarose prehydrolysis using phosphoric acid as a catalyst was optimized at a 30.7% (w/v) agarose loading, which is the highest agarose or agar loading reported so far. Then AB produced by the prehydrolysis was hydrolyzed into l-AHG and d-galactose (d-Gal) by using a recently discovered enzyme, Bgl1B. We suggest that this simple and efficient process could be a feasible solution for the commercialization and mass production of l-AHG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aagarose 3acatalysts 3acommercialization 3aenzymes 3agalactose 3aindustrial applications 3amacroalgae 3aphosphoric acid 0a3,6-anhydro-l-galactose 0aagarose 0ared macroalgae 0aagarobiose 0aphosphoric acid 0aagarobiose hydrolase1 aYun, Eun Ju1 aLee, Paul S.q(Paul Sang Hyun),1 aKim, Kyoung Heon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4600-86680 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Oct. 25, v. 66, no. 46 p.12249-12256dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b041443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014600206300001600352500001900368520132200387592002801709596005701737596005701794596005701851650001001908650001101918650001901929650001201948650000901960650001401969650001901983650001602002650001802018650001402036650001302050650000902063650001302072650002002085650001102105650001702116700002302133773014302156856008202299852000902381655001202390IND60724696820221117233429.0210123e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072469682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-020-02024-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimoda, Seiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2989-696610aPotential benefits of promoting snowmelt by artificial snow blacking on the growth of winter wheat and their dependence upon regional climate  ap. 223-233.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn earlier onset of regrowth after snow disappearance can enable wheat cultivars to avoid the hotter grain-filling period, without the need for early sowing in snowy regions. A blackened snow surface easily accelerates snow melting by absorbing solar radiation. In this study, we compare the yield components associated with snowmelt acceleration over 4 years and in 2 locations (Sapporo, SP, and Memuro, MM) in Japan, which exhibit contrasting autumn and spring climates. Early snow melting by snow-blackening accelerated wheat growth in MM by a maximum of 4 days for heading and 3 days for anthesis. Moreover, accelerating wheat phenological growth improved the grain yield in MM in 2016. This is because wheat plants were less likely to experience the localised cool and rainy weather that typically occurs during anthesis in mid-June. Early anthesis would decrease the likelihood that wheat plants experiencing lower sunlight intensity during the grain-filling period owing to exposure to rainy weather. However, warmer autumn conditions in SP likely hindered the development of high-level cold resistance in overwintering wheat. Accelerating snowmelt is one possible tool for mitigating the fluctuations in regional wheat production; however, the effectiveness of snow-blackening depends on the regional climate.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H00963cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a19KT0041cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H03110cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aJapan 3aautumn 3abioclimatology 3aclimate 3acold 3acultivars 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3aoverwintering 3aphenology 3aregrowth 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3awinter wheat1 aHamasaki, Takahiro0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2021 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.223-233dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-02024-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010800173300001600281520170400297592002802001650001202029650001602041650001102057650001702068650001702085650001102102650001202113650001702125650002702142653000702169653000702176653000702183653000902190653002102199653001102220653001502231653001402246700001802260773010202278856008702380852000902467655001202476IND60537825220221121053502.0190405e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053782522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFizaine, Florian10aRenewable electricity producing technologies and metal depletion: A sensitivity analysis using the EROI  ap. 106-118.  aMore and more attention is being paid to renewable technologies because they are seen as a great opportunity to disengage our society from its dependence on fossil fuels. Such flow-based energy resources that rely on solar energy are supposed to lead us toward a sustainable energy future. However, because of their high capital intensity, renewable technologies require large amounts of matter, including both common and rare metals. These metals require energy for their production, and more specifically for their extraction. The energy cost associated with metal extraction is linked to mineral ore grade, meaning that as depletion progresses, energy cost increases. In addition, renewable energy resources deliver less net energy to society compared to fossil fuels, because of their diffuse nature. It is therefore easy to see that a close relationship exists between energy and metal sectors. In this article, we describe more precisely this relationship by investigating how the energy requirement associated with metal extraction could impact the energy-return-on-investment (EROI) of different renewable and nuclear technologies. More precisely, we present a methodology that can be used to calculate the sensitivity of the EROI of a given technology to a specific or to multiple metal ore grade degradation. We found that if considered separately, the qualitative depletion of a given metal has no significant impact on the EROI of renewable and nuclear technologies, unless its concentration approaches very low grade. However, if all metals are considered together, the EROI of these same technologies could be importantly diminished, especially if they tend to very low concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3afossil fuels 3ametals 3asociety 3asolar energy 3asustainable technology 0aQ3 0aQ4 0aQ5 0aEROI 0aRenewable energy 0aMetals 0aNet energy 0aDepletion1 aCourt, Victor0 tEcological economics.g2015 Feb., v. 110 p.106-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008500174300001600259520172500275592002802000650001302028650001302041650001302054650001502067650001702082650001402099650001302113650001602126650002202142650001402164650001602178650001102194650001102205650001302216650001602229650001202245650001602257650001502273651001802288653001502306653001102321653001802332653001802350653001802368653001102386700002302397773010202420856008702522852000902609655001202618IND60545755320221119123147.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyberg, Karen R.10aTrends in pesticide concentrations and use for major rivers of the United States  ap. 431-444.  aTrends in pesticide concentrations in 38 major rivers of the United States were evaluated in relation to use trends for 11 commonly occurring pesticide compounds. Pesticides monitored in water were analyzed for trends in concentration in three overlapping periods, 1992–2001, 1997–2006, and 2001–2010 to facilitate comparisons among sites with variable sample distributions over time and among pesticides with changes in use during different periods and durations. Concentration trends were analyzed using the SEAWAVE-Q model, which incorporates intra-annual variability in concentration and measures of long-term, mid-term, and short-term streamflow variability. Trends in agricultural use within each of the river basins were determined using interval-censored regression with high and low estimates of use.Pesticides strongly dominated by agricultural use (cyanazine, alachlor, atrazine and its degradate deethylatrazine, metolachlor, and carbofuran) had widespread agreement between concentration trends and use trends. Pesticides with substantial use in both agricultural and nonagricultural applications (simazine, chlorpyrifos, malathion, diazinon, and carbaryl) had concentration trends that were mostly explained by a combination of agricultural-use trends, regulatory changes, and urban use changes inferred from concentration trends in urban streams. When there were differences, concentration trends usually were greater than use trends (increased more or decreased less). These differences may occur because of such factors as unaccounted pesticide uses, delayed transport to the river through groundwater, greater uncertainty in the use data, or unquantified land use and management practice changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalachlor 3aatrazine 3acarbaryl 3acarbofuran 3achlorpyrifos 3acyanazine 3adiazinon 3agroundwater 3aland use planning 3amalathion 3ametolachlor 3amodels 3arivers 3asimazine 3astream flow 3astreams 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aUnited States 0aPesticides 0aTrends 0aPesticide use 0aSurface water 0aWater quality 0aRivers1 aGilliom, Robert J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 538 p.431-444dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007200159300001600231520155500247592002801802650001801830650001201848650002401860650001101884650001401895650001401909650001401923651002101937653001901958653002101977653002101998653001902019653002002038653001302058773014402071856007202215852000902287655001202296IND60747538420221122224431.0210814e20210806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074753842DNAL7 a10.1898/NWN20-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurger, Alan E.,10aRecurrent ingestion of grit by common nighthawks (chordeiles minor)  ap. 120-130.  aGrit ingestion is widespread among birds, as an aid for grinding up food and as a dietary supplement of calcium, but is less common among insectivores, especially aerial feeders like nightjars (Caprimulgidae). I report recurrent visits by Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) to a gravel driveway in British Columbia at dusk over a 4-y period. These ground visits were highly consistent (nighthawks landed during 93% of 72 dusk watches) and visits were highly concentrated both in time (95% of time on the ground between 10 and 57 min after sunset) and space (91% of the birds' time was spent in 2 areas comprising only 31% of the visible study site). Birds pecked at the ground in 97% of 198 focal-animal watches. In 43 visits the nighthawks picked up or swallowed some item; in 24 cases this was a small piece of gravel and no other items were identified. Surveys of ground arthropods in the study area over 3 y showed that potential prey were sparse (mean <2 insects m–²) and the most common insects were unsuitable prey (tiny 3-mm ants). I conclude that the only reason for the nighthawks to consistently visit this gravel area was to ingest grit. The gravel ingested was crushed limestone, which might support a calcium uptake hypothesis. Grit ingestion, occurring within a restricted dusk period, might not explain why nightjars often sit on gravel roads at night, which is a major source of mortality for several species.

Signal detection theory offers a theoretical framework that generates testable hypotheses regarding where animals should place scent signals in the environment in a way that maximizes their probability of detection by target receivers while minimizing costs of production and distribution. Solitary and reliant on chemical communication, the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, offers an interesting model to test these ideas. We studied scent-marking patterns in wild giant pandas in the Foping Nature Reserve by surveying areas containing a high density of scent posts. Pandas did not deploy scent marks randomly in this environment, but targeted trees with specific characteristics that promoted signal persistence, range and/or likelihood of detection. Variables affecting selection of scent-marking sites included bark roughnesss, presence of moss on the tree trunk, tree diameter and distance to the trail. That pandas should be efficient with their use of chemosignals comes as no surprise, as mounting evidence is suggesting that many aspects of giant panda life history are constrained by their energetically poor diet. We also found seasonal and sex differences in marking patterns, indicating a role for scent marking in reproduction and competition. Males scent-marked throughout the year, whereas females scent-marked predominantly during the mating season, suggesting functional differences in scent marking between the sexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3alife history 3aprobability 3aanimals 3amales 3amodels 3agender differences 3ascent marking behavior 3atree and stand measurements 3atree trunk 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3atrees 3abreeding season 3amosses and liverworts 3aodors 3abark 3afemales 3aconservation areas 0amating season1 aSwaisgood, Ronald R.1 aZhang, Zejun1 aHu, Yibo1 aMa, Xizhen,1 aWei, Fuwen0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 July, v. 84, no. 1 p.39-44dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245011900217300001600336506007600352520137200428592002801800506003701828650002501865650001201890650002101902650001501923650002801938650001601966650001701982650003501999650001102034650001802045650001202063650001402075650002202089650001102111700001902122700002302141700002402164773008702188856008102275852000902356655001202365IND60120564920221207135308.0150208e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012056492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-012-0472-92doi7 aPMC37284312pmcid7 a232479212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorowska-Wykręt, Dorota10aDefects in leaf epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with CDKA;1 activity reduced in the shoot apical meristem  ap. 955-961.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Arabidopsis thaliana, like in other dicots, the shoot epidermis originates from protodermis, the outermost cell layer of shoot apical meristem. We examined leaf epidermis in transgenic A. thaliana plants in which CDKA;1.N146, a negative dominant allele of A-type cyclin-dependent kinase, was expressed from the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS promoter, i.e., in the shoot apical meristem. Using cleared whole mount preparations of expanding leaves and sequential in vivo replicas of expanding leaf surface, we show that dominant-negative CDKA;1 expression results in defects in epidermis continuity: loss of individual cells and occurrence of gaps between anticlinal walls of neighboring pavement cells. Another striking feature is ingrowth-like invaginations of anticlinal cell walls of pavement cells. Their formation is related to various processes: expansion of cells surrounding the sites of cell loss, defected cytokinesis, and presumably also, the actual ingrowth of an anticlinal cell wall. The mutant exhibits also increased variation in cell size and locally reduced waviness of anticlinal walls of pavement cells. These unusual features of leaf epidermis phenotype may shed a new light on our knowledge on morphogenesis of jigsaw puzzle-shaped pavement cells and on the CDKA;1 role in regulation of plant development via influence on cytoskeleton and plant cell wall.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalleles 3aapical meristems 3acell walls 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytokinesis 3acytoskeleton 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3ashoots1 aElsner, Joanna1 aDe Veylder, Lieven1 aKwiatkowska, Dorota0 tProtoplasma.g2013 Aug., v. 250, no. 4 p.955-961dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-012-0472-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245009800159300002000257520181700277592002802094650001302122650001402135650002102149650003102170650001002201650000902211650002202220650001202242650001302254650000902267650002802276650001402304650001902318650002102337650001302358650002402371650002502395650001702420650001302437653001302450653001302463653002502476653001902501653002102520700001302541700001902554700001302573700002102586700001202607700001902619700005602638773015002694856008002844852000902924655001202933IND60621990520221120164412.0181123e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062199052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b043412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jia10aLycopene Triggers Nrf2–AMPK Cross Talk to Alleviate Atrazine-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Mice  ap. 12385-12394.  aAtrazine (ATR), an environmental persistent and bioaccumulative herbicide, has been associated with environmental nephrosis. Lycopene (LYC) exhibits important properties of nephroprotection, but there are limited data on the specific underlying mechanism. The primary objective of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of LYC on ATR-induced nephrotoxicity in mice. The mice were divided randomly into 6 groups and treated as follows: control group (C), 5 mg/kg LYC group (L), 50 mg/kg ATR group (A1), 200 mg/kg ATR group (A2), 50 mg/kg ATR plus 5 mg/kg LYC group (A1+L), and 200 mg/kg ATR plus 5 mg/kg LYC group (A2+L) by oral gavage administration for 21 days. We found that pretreatment with LYC significantly suppressed the ATR-induced renal tubular epithelial cell swelling. Furthermore, LYC mitigated ATR-induced dysregulation of oxidative stress markers by reducing MDA, H₂O₂ levels, and increasing SOD, GPx, CAT concentration, and Nrf2 activation. Moreover, LYC activated the autophagic flux by a detectable change in autophagy-related genes (Beclin-1 and ATGs) and proteins (p62/SQSTM) and by the formation of autophagic vacuole (AV) and LC3 aggregation, in parallel with AMPK activation (pAMPK/AMPK). Herein, ATR-up-regulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and Nrf2-regulated redox genes, including quinoneoxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxidase-1 (HO1), whereas LYC down-regulated those of the above genes. In addition, LYC suppressed ATR-induced activation of autophagy (increased LC3II/LC3I, ATGs, Beclin1, and p62, in parallel with increased AMPK activation). Collectively, our findings identified a cross talk between AMPK-activated autophagy and the Nrf2 signaling pathway in LYC-mediated nephroprotection against ATR-induced toxicity in mice kidney.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3aautophagy 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheme 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akidneys 3alycopene 3amice 3anephroprotective effect 3anephrosis 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atherapeutics 3avacuoles 0aatrazine 0alycopene 0aNrf2-AMPK cross talk 0anephrotoxicity 0anephroprotection1 aXia, Jun1 aZhao, Hua-Shan1 aHou, Rui1 aTalukder, Milton1 aYu, Lei1 aGuo, Jian-Ying1 aLi, Jin-Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5133-91650 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Oct. 26, v. 66, no. 46 p.12385-12394dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b043413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012600169300001600295500001500311520203400326592002802360650002002388650002402408650002102432650001502453650002202468650001402490650001202504650001102516650002102527650001802548650002502566650000902591653002602600653002102626653002102647653001102668653002402679653002502703700001602728700001202744700001602756700001602772700001702788773010202805856008702907852000902994655001203003IND60545755420221119123353.0170719e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Wei10aSoil respiration and carbon loss relationship with temperature and land use conversion in freeze–thaw agricultural area  ap. 215-222.  a2019-12-06  aSoil respiration (Rs) was hypothesized to have a special response pattern to soil temperature and land use conversion in the freeze–thaw area. The Rs differences of eight types of land use conversions during agricultural development were observed and the impacts of Rs on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss were assessed. The land use conversions during last three decades were categorized into eight types, and the 141 SOC sampling sites were grouped by conversion type. The typical soil sampling sites were subsequently selected for monitoring of soil temperature and Rs of each land use conversion types. The Rs correlations with temperature at difference depths and different conversion types were identified with statistical analysis. The empirical mean error model and the biophysical theoretical model with Arrhenius equation about the Rs sensitivity to temperature were both analyzed and shared the similar patterns. The temperature dependence of soil respiration (Q10) analysis further demonstrated that the averaged value of eight types of land use in this freeze–thaw agricultural area ranged from 1.15 to 1.73, which was lower than the other cold areas. The temperature dependence analysis demonstrated that the Rs in the top layer of natural land covers was more sensitive to temperature and experienced a large vertical difference. The natural land covers exhibited smaller Rs and the farmlands had the bigger value due to tillage practices. The positive relationships between SOC loss and Rs were identified, which demonstrated that Rs was the key chain for SOC loss during land use conversion. The spatial–vertical distributions of SOC concentration with the 1.5-km grid sampling showed that the more SOC loss in the farmland, which was coincided with the higher Rs in farmlands. The analysis of Rs dynamics provided an innovative explanation for SOC loss in the freeze–thaw agricultural area.

This paper uses data from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) to address three areas of particular concern: the prevalence of growing your own food and how this has changed over time; the individual and household context in which growing takes place; and whether those who grow their own food are happier than those who do not. Results showed that there was a marked increase in growing your own food in Europe, in the period 2003–2007. This increase is largely associated with poorer households and thus, possibly, economic hardship. In the UK however the increase in growing your own food is predominantly associated with older middle class households. Across Europe, whether causal or not, those who grew their own were happier than those who did not. The paper therefore concludes that claims about the gentrification of growing your own may be premature. Despite contrary evidence from the UK, the dominant motive across Europe appears to be primarily economic — to reduce household expenditure whilst ensuring a supply of fresh food.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3ahousehold expenditure 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3amotivation 3aquality of life 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGentrification 0aHappiness 0aIndependence 0aSufficiency1 aMitchell, R.1 aRavenscroft, N.1 aStapleton, L.M.0 tEcological economics.g2015 Feb., v. 110 p.71-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008400161520131600245592002801561650000801589650001501597650001501612650001001627650002001637650005601657650001501713650001001728650002201738650001101760650002101771650001101792650001101803650001201814650000901826650001401835650001301849650001401862650001701876650002001893700002501913700001601938700002101954700002301975700001901998700002102017700002902038773011802067856007702185852000902262655001202271IND60703058720221121042303.0200719e20200529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070305872DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110606032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhongyu 10aHuman Nasal Epithelial Organoids for Therapeutic Development in Cystic Fibrosis  aWe describe a human nasal epithelial (HNE) organoid model derived directly from patient samples that is well-differentiated and recapitulates the airway epithelium, including the expression of cilia, mucins, tight junctions, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and ionocytes. This model requires few cells compared to airway epithelial monolayer cultures, with multiple outcome measurements depending on the application. A novel feature of the model is the predictive capacity of lumen formation, a marker of baseline CFTR function that correlates with short-circuit current activation of CFTR in monolayers and discriminates the cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype from non-CF. Our HNE organoid model is amenable to automated measurements of forskolin-induced swelling (FIS), which distinguishes levels of CFTR activity. While the apical side is not easily accessible, RNA- and DNA-based therapies intended for systemic administration could be evaluated in vitro, or it could be used as an ex vivo biomarker of successful repair of a mutant gene. In conclusion, this highly differentiated airway epithelial model could serve as a surrogate biomarker to assess correction of the mutant gene in CF or other diseases, recapitulating the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aautomation 3abiomarkers 3acilia 3acystic fibrosis 3acystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 3aepithelium 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3amucins 3amutants 3anose 3aorganoids 3apatients 3aphenotype 3atherapeutics 3atight junctions1 aAnderson, Justin  D.1 aDeng, Lily 1 aMackay, Stephen 1 aBailey, Johnathan 1 aKersh, Latona 1 aRowe, Steven  M.1 aGuimbellot, Jennifer  S.0 tGenes.g2020 May 29, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04101naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013500174300001800309520221200327592002802539650002102567650002802588650003302616650001402649650002602663650001602689650001302705650001502718650001502733650001202748650001602760650003802776650001302814650001002827650001502837650001402852650001902866650002102885650001002906650001502916650000902931650001902940650001102959650001302970650002802983650001403011650001703025650002103042650001603063650001403079653001203093653002403105653002703129653000803156700006603164700002703230773009903257856008603356852000903442655001203451IND60742989820221118140318.0220426e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074298982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarhan, Amal Tarek10aRecombinant Ax21 protein is a promising subunit vaccine candidate against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a murine infection model  ap. 4471-4480.  aStenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging pathogen that can cause several disease manifestations such as bacteremia, meningitis, respiratory tract infections and others. More seriously, this pathogen has a highly evolving antibiotic resistance profile. Antibiotic misuse is further aggravating the situation by inducing the development of multi- and even pan-resistance. Thus, employing diverse strategies to overcome this increasing antibiotic resistance is of paramount importance. In general, vaccination is one of these strategies that prevents the onset of infection, provides long term protection against infection, and most importantly diminishes the antibiotic consumption, thus, resulting in controlling resistance. Unfortunately, vaccine research concerning S. maltophilia is very scarce in the literature. Ax21 protein is an outer membrane protein implicated in several virulence mechanisms of S. maltophilia such as quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance. Our computational analysis of Ax21 revealed its potential immunogenicity. In the current study, Ax21 protein of S. maltophilia was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Mice were immunized with the purified recombinant antigen using Bacillus Calmette-Guérin(BCG) and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) as immune-adjuvants. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed significant antigen-specific IgG1, IgG2a and total IgG levels in immunized mice which reflected successful immune stimulation. Immunized mice that were challenged with S. maltophilia showed a substantialreduction in bacterial bioburden in lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. In addition, liver histological examination demonstrated a remarkable decrease in pathological signs such as necrosis, vacuolation, bile duct fibrosis and necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and hemorrhage. Whole cell ELISA and opsonophagocytic assay confirmed the ability of serum antibodies from immunized mice to bind and facilitate phagocytosis of S. maltophilia, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the vaccine protective efficacy of Ax21 outer membrane protein against S. maltophilia infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aadjuvants 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantigens 3abacteremia 3abile ducts 3abiofilm 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrosis 3aheart 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aliver 3ameningitis 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccination 3avirulence 0aVaccine 0aAx21 family protein 0aOuter membrane protein 0aBCG1 aBahey-El-Din, Mohammed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3457-90841 aZaghloul, Taha Ibrahim0 tVaccine.g2021 July 22, v. 39, no. 32 p.4471-4480dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012400163520141900287592002801706650001601734650001001750650002201760650002001782650001001802650001101812650001001823650002401833650001301857650002301870650001001893650001701903650001201920650000901932700001901941700002501960700001601985700001502001700001502016700001402031700001702045700001602062700001202078700001802090700001802108773011802126856007702244852000902321655001202330IND60703058820221121042427.0200719e20200529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070305882DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110606042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianqing 10aIdentification of the Ovine Keratin-Associated Protein 2-1 Gene and Its Sequence Variation in Four Chinese Sheep Breeds  aKeratin-associated proteins are important components of wool fibers. The gene encoding the high-sulfur keratin-associated protein 2-1 has been described in humans, but it has not been described in sheep. A basic local alignment search tool nucleotide search of the Ovine Genome Assembly version 4.0 using a human keratin-associated protein 2-1 gene sequence revealed a 399-base pair open reading frame, which was clustered among nine previously identified keratin-associated protein genes on chromosome 11. Polymerase chain reaction–single strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed four different banding patterns, with these representing four different sequences (A–D) in Chinese sheep breeds. These sequences had the highest similarity to human keratin-associated protein 2-1 gene, suggesting that they represent variants of ovine keratin-associated protein 2-1 gene. Nine single nucleotide variations were detected in the gene, including one non-synonymous nucleotide substitution. Differences in variant frequencies between fine-wool sheep breeds and coarse-wool sheep breeds were detected. The gene was found to be expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression level in skin, and moderate expression levels in heart and lung tissue. These results reveal that the ovine keratin-associated protein 2-1 gene is variable and suggest the gene might affect variation in mean fiber diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenome assembly 3aheart 3ahumans 3alungs 3aopen reading frames 3aproteins 3asequence diversity 3asheep 3asheep breeds 3atissues 3awool1 aZhou, Huitong 1 aHickford, Jon  G.

These calls often vary in acoustic structure depending on the type or level of predation risk, thereby eliciting the appropriate escape responses in conspecifics. Such complexity in communication may also be advantageous in situations in which animals recruit other individuals to mob predators because different risks may sometimes require different mobbing responses. I tested this idea in Japanese great tits, Parus major minor, which produce acoustically distinct mobbing calls for two different nest predators: ‘chicka’ calls for jungle crows, Corvus macrorhynchos, and ‘jar’ calls for Japanese rat snakes, Elaphe climacophora. A playback experiment revealed that adult great tits responded to different mobbing calls with qualitatively different behaviours: they scanned the horizon in response to ‘chicka’ calls and gazed towards the ground in response to ‘jar’ calls. These two responses help adults search for and detect the corresponding predators since crows fly to the nest and snakes approach from the ground. This study demonstrates that the mobbing calls of Japanese great tits transmit referential information about predator types and elicit the appropriate predator-searching behaviours in adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus 3aElaphe 3aParus major 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aantipredatory behavior 3acrows 3amammals 3anests 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3asnakes0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 July, v. 84, no. 1 p.53-57dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245007600168520095900244592002801203650002701231650001301258650001501271650001101286650002201297650002501319650002801344650002901372650001301401700001801414700002601432773011801458856007701576852000901653655001201662IND60703059020221121052841.0200719e20200530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070305902DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110606072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozhukhar, Nataliya 10aUnusual mtDNA Control Region Length Heteroplasmy in the COS-7 Cell Line  aThe COS-7 cell line is a workhorse of virology research. To expand this cell line’s utility and to enable studies on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and replication, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of its mitochondrial genome by Sanger sequencing. In contrast to other available mtDNA sequences from Chlorocebus aethiops, the mtDNA of the COS-7 cell line was found to contain a variable number of perfect copies of a 108 bp unit tandemly repeated in the control region. We established that COS-7 cells are heteroplasmic with at least two variants being present: with four and five repeat units. The analysis of the mitochondrial genome sequences from other primates revealed that tandem repeats are absent from examined mtDNA control regions of humans and great apes, but appear in lower primates, where they are present in a homoplasmic state. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mtDNA length heteroplasmy in primates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aPongidae 3acell lines 3ahumans 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3atandem repeat sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirology1 aMitta, Sunil 1 aAlexeyev, Mikhail  F.0 tGenes.g2020 May 30, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245013600184300001400320520196800334592002802302650001002330650002702340650001502367650002702382650001402409650001302423650001502436650001102451650002102462650001502483650001602498650001902514650002502533650002302558650001902581650001202600650001202612650005102624650001402675650001102689650004202700650001102742650001902753650001802772650002002790650000902810650003002819650001602849650003002865650001702895650002002912650001002932650004902942651002502991651002503016700002203041700002503063700001903088700002003107700002203127773008203149856004803231852000903279655001203288IND50066312120221121105748.0130510e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006631212DNAL7 a233779822pmid7 a10.1007/s10393-013-0818-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowling, Zara10aLinking Mosquito Infestation to Resident Socioeconomic Status, Knowledge, and Source Reduction Practices in Suburban Washington, DC  ap. 36-47.  aEliminating water-holding containers where mosquitoes oviposit and develop (source reduction) can help manage urban disease-vector mosquitoes. Source reduction requires residents to be knowledgeable of effective practices and motivated to implement them. We tested relationships between demographics, resident knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and mosquito infestation by administering larval mosquito surveys and KAP questionnaires in Washington, DC. Respondents who reported practicing source reduction had lower numbers of pupae-positive containers and Culex pipiens-positive containers, but not Aedes albopictus-positive containers or water-holding containers, in their yards. When controlling for numbers of water-holding containers in statistical models, residents who reported source reduction had lower numbers of A. albopictus-positive containers in addition to numbers of pupae-positive containers and C. pipiens-positive containers. These results suggest that while active container reduction may be effective at reducing C. pipiens and overall pupal production, it may be offset by other resident activities that add containers to yards, and that source reduction that involves mosquito habitat management without outright container removal can also be effective at reducing A. albopictus. Source reduction was related to respondent knowledge of mosquitoes and, in particular, specific knowledge of mosquito development, which both varied with demographics alongside respondent motivation to control mosquitoes. Respondents from high socioeconomic status households reported greater knowledge but lower motivation than respondents from middle and low socioeconomic-status households. We conclude that mosquito-related education will help promote community-based container management as part of integrated mosquito management programs, particularly in middle and low socioeconomic status neighborhoods with lower knowledge and high motivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex 3aattitudes and opinions 3acontainers 3ademographic statistics 3aeducation 3ahabitats 3ahouseholds 3alarvae 3amosquito control 3amotivation 3aoviposition 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomic status 3astatistical models 3asuburban areas 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectors 2aLinear Models 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aOviposition 2aResidence Characteristics 2aSocial Class 2aSuburban Health 2aWater 2aWest Nile Feverxmicrobiologyxtransmission. 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aDistrict of Columbia1 aArmbruster, Peter1 aLaDeau, Shannon Lea,1 aDeCotiis, Mark1 aMottley, Jihana1 aLeisnham, Paul T.0 tEcohealth.g2013 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.36-47dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-013-0818-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012500167300001600292520175000308592002802058650001802086650001502104650001402119650001202133650001002145650002702155650001802182650001302200650001802213650001402231650000902245650001602254650002102270650003802291650003702329653000902366653002602375653003002401653001402431653002602445700001802471700001902489700001602508773012402524856008302648852000902731655001202740IND60636636620221121053520.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063663662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2019.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seunghoon10aProbing the oxidation reactivity of ultra-low-sulfur diesel soot with controlled particle size and organic mass fraction  ap. 264-273.  aThe oxidation reactivity of soot plays a key role in the regeneration of diesel particulate filters, which are used to prevent atmospheric soot emissions. Thus, discovering correlations between this reactivity and the characteristics of soot is essential. The present study investigated the effects of pyrolysis temperature (1200–1400 °C), fuel mole fraction (0.0007–0.0058), and pyrolysis time (0.15–0.46 s) on the physical and chemical properties of synthesized soot. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) and nitrogen carrier gas were used to synthesize soot under oxygen-free conditions. The particle size and composition were controlled, and the soot nanostructure was modified by adjusting the pyrolysis conditions. The characteristics of soot were analyzed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), particle sizers, combustion type PM analyzer, and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). According to the analysis results, when fuel mole fraction and pyrolysis time were insufficient, high pyrolysis temperature contributed to soot growth and development of a highly ordered graphitic structure. However, with relatively sufficient fuel mole fraction and pyrolysis time, the best soot growth was observed at an intermediate pyrolysis temperature (1300 °C). The synthesized soot had an organic mass fraction (OMF) range of 0.05–0.62, while mass reduction due to oxidation during thermogravimetric analysis appeared at a temperature range of 406–670 °C. In conclusion, the oxidation temperature could be correlated to the primary particle size and OMF, and the pyrolysis conditions played a role in the formation and growth of soot, while the carbonization level attributable to such process affect soot oxidation reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonization 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afilters 3afuels 3agrowth and development 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3asoot 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSoot 0aOxidation temperature 0aDiesel particulate filter 0aPyrolysis 0aOrganic mass fraction1 aLim, Sangchul1 aLee, Hyeonsung1 aPark, Sunho0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2019 June, v. 140 p.264-273dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245012400182300001800306500002400324500001500348520227800363650001902641650002302660650001202683650002502695650001902720650001102739650002502750650002102775650002002796650002402816650002002840650002002860651000902880653002002889700001402909700002002923773009802943852000903041856008903050930003303139945002503172946001103197655001203208IND4398855020221118063305.0071211e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439885502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2007.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ2001 aPark, E.J.10aGlucose additions to aggregates subjected to drying/wetting cycles promote carbon sequestration and aggregate stability  ap. 2758-2768.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiogeochemical mechanisms at microscale regions within soil macroaggregates strengthen aggregates during repeated DW cycles. Knowledge of additional biogeochemical processes that promote the movement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into and throughout soil aggregates and soil aggregate stabilization are essential before we can more accurately predict maximum carbon (C) sequestration by soils subjected to best management practices. We investigated the spatial distribution of 13C-glucose supplied to individual soil macroaggregate surfaces and subjected to multiple drying and wetting (DW) cycles. Subsequent distribution of added glucose-C, CO2 respiration, increased microbial community activity and concomitant changes in soil aggregate stabilization were monitored. Moist macroaggregates were treated with no DW cycles and zero glucose C (Control), 5 DW cycles and zero glucose (DW0G), and 5 DW cycles with additions of 250 μg glucose-13C/g soil during each cycle (DW+G). Repeated additions of glucose-C to aggregate surfaces reduced the mineralization of pre-existing soil C by an average of 45% and established concentric gradients of glucose-derived C. It is concluded these increasing gradients promoted the diffusion of soluble C into interior regions and became less available to microbial respiration. Spatial gradients of glucose-derived C within aggregates influenced a shift in the abundance of unique ribotypes spatially distributed within aggregates. Rapid decreases in the mineralization rates of glucose-C during repeated DW cycles suggested greater C sequestration by either physical restriction of microbes or chemical sorption of new C that diffused into aggregates. Aggregate stability decreased significantly following 2-3 DW cycles, when glucose-C was not added. Additions of glucose-C with each DW cycle maintained soil aggregate stability equal to the moist but not cycled control throughout the 5 DW cycles of this study. These data simulate the strengthening of soil aggregates in no tillage agroecosystems which provides continuous additions of DOC compounds generated by decomposing plant residues on the soil surface, and root exudates and decomposition, as well as the mineralization of POM materials within nondisturbed soil profiles. 3amineralization 3asoil water content 3aglucose 3aspatial distribution 3awet-dry cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil respiration 3asilt loam soils 3aaggregate stability 3astable isotopes 3asoil aggregates 3aOhio 0abiogeochemistry1 aSul, W.J.1 aSmucker, A.J.M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2007 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.2758-2768dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2007.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03742naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001700185245007500202300001800277500002400295500001500319520231300334650002902647650002302676650002402699650001702723650002702740650001302767650001702780650002202797650002202819650002002841650002302861650001902884651001302903653002002916700001502936700002002951773009802971852000903069856008903078930003303167945002503200946001103225655001203236IND4398854420221118063326.0071211e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439885442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2007.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ200 0aK001 0aB2001 aGrandy, A.S.10aCarbon structure and enzyme activities in alpine and forest ecosystems  ap. 2701-2711.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe chemical structure of soil organic matter fractions and its relationship to biological processes remains uncertain. We used pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to analyze the molecular structure of light and heavy fraction C from soils in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado. The soil samples, each replicated three times, were from two elevations (alpine and low forest) within two geochemically distinct basins (igneous and sedimentary). We also analyzed whether variation in the activity of nine enzymes that mediate soil organic matter turnover and nutrient cycling could explain differences in C structure. We found that, across basins and elevation, light fraction and heavy fraction C had distinct chemistries. The light fraction was characterized by an abundance of plant lignin biomarkers, including phenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinyl-(vinylguaiacol) and phenol, 2-methoxy-(guaiacol); in contrast heavy fraction had very little unaltered lignin but an abundance of polysaccharides, such as furfural, and proteins such as pyrrole. In alpine sites, light fraction was less abundant (4.27 versus 31.79 g kg-1) and had a lower C/N ratio (17.25 versus 32.01) than in forests. The alpine sites also had higher activities of phosphatase, β-d-1,4-cellobiosidase, β-1,4-glucosidase, l-leucine aminopeptidase, and β-1,4-xylosidase. Protein abundance in the heavy fraction was correlated with peptidase, β-1,4-glucosidase, and phosphatase activities; in the light fraction, protein abundance was correlated with peptidase, xylosidase, and β-d-1,4-cellobiosidase activities. β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase was negatively correlated with polysaccharides in the light and heavy fractions and positively correlated with lignin in the light fraction. However, there were not always significant correlations between enzymes and substrates. We suggest that this is likely because soil organic matter chemistry reflects long-term decomposition processes while enzyme dynamics fluctuate with current conditions or due to the presence of a pool of sorbed enzymes in the heavy fraction. While alpine and forest ecosystem C distribution and enzyme activities varied, substantial depletion of lignin derivatives in the heavy fraction across sites suggest that these compounds do not persist in stable soil C pools. 3asoil chemical properties 3agas chromatography 3asoil organic matter 3asoil enzymes 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3aaltitude 3aforest soils 3aspatial variation 3amass spectrometry 3aenzyme activity 3achemical structure 3asoil separates 3aColorado 0abiogeochemistry1 aNeff, J.C.1 aWeintraub, M.N.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2007 Nov., v. 39, no. 11 p.2701-2711dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2007.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03294naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100002300137245010100160300001600261500002400277500001500301520174700316650001202063650001602075650002202091650001802113650001402131650002202145650001902167650001802186650002802204651001002232653001502242653002502257700002002282700001802302700002002320700002202340700002002362700001902382700002202401700001902423700003302442773012702475852000902602856007002611930003302681945002502714946001302739655001202752IND4377810620221118063332.0060212e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437781062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aKuriyama, Shinichi10aGreen tea consumption and cognitive function: a cross-sectional study from the Tsurugaya Project  ap. 355-361.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Although considerable experimental and animal evidence shows that green tea may possess potent activities of neuroprotection, neurorescue, and amyloid precursor protein processing that may lead to cognitive enhancement, no human data are available. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between green tea consumption and cognitive function in humans. DESIGN: We analyzed cross-sectional data from a community-based Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) conducted in 2002. The subjects were 1003 Japanese subjects aged [>/=]70 y. They completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions about the frequency of green tea consumption. We evaluated cognitive function by using the Mini-Mental State Examination with cutoffs of <28, <26, and <24 and calculated multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Higher consumption of green tea was associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment. At the <26 cutoff, after adjustment for potential confounders, the ORs for the cognitive impairment associated with different frequencies of green tea consumption were 1.00 (reference) for </=3 cups/wk, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.33, 1.19) for 4-6 cups/wk or 1 cup/d, and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.72) for [>/=]2 cups/d (P for trend = 0.0006). Corresponding ORs were 1.00 (reference), 0.60 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.02), and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.38) (P for trend = 0.33) for black or oolong tea and 1.00 (reference), 1.16 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.73), and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.80) (P for trend = 0.70) for coffee. The results were essentially the same at cutoffs of <28 and <24. CONCLUSION: A higher consumption of green tea is associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment in humans. 3aelderly 3afood intake 3aAlzheimer disease 3aconsciousness 3agreen tea 3aelderly nutrition 3arisk reduction 3amental health 3across-sectional studies 3aJapan 0asenescence 0acognitive impairment1 aHozawa, Atsushi1 aOhmori, Kaori1 aShimazu, Taichi1 aMatsui, Toshifumi1 aEbihara, Satoru1 aAwata, Shuichi1 aNagatomi, Ryoichi1 aArai, Hiroyuki1 aDissecting Tablec(Musician)0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.355-361dJournal of Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060314b20060402c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245012000194300001800314500002400332520125100356650001301607650001301620650002401633650001501657650001201672650001101684650002501695650001401720650002501734650002201759650001801781650002701799650002501826650002201851650002801873650001401901650002501915650002501940650001401965650006301979651001002042651001002052651001002062651001502072651001002087700002202097773010402119852000902223856005502232655001202287IND4385339120221118063138.0061119e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438533912DNAL7 a171074752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03094.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTOMITAKA, YASUHIRO12aA phylogeographical study of the Turnip mosaic virus population in East Asia reveals an 'emergent' lineage in Japan  ap. 4437-4457.  aIncludes references  aThe genetic structure of populations of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in East Asia was assessed by making host range and gene sequence comparisons of 118 isolates utilizing a population genetic approach. Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal-BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal-BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but are discrete lineages. 3aBrassica 3aRaphanus 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3ahost range 3aislands 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3asequence analysis 2aBase Sequence 2aCrossing Over, Genetic 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Viralxgenetics 2aGeography 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aPhylogeny 2aTymovirusxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 3aChina 3aJapan 0aChina 0aEast Asia. 0aJapan1 aOHSHIMA, KAZUSATO0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Dec., v. 15, no. 14 p.4437-4457dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03094.x 7aarticle03128naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009400165300001600259500002400275520233100299650002302630650001402653650001902667650001302686773010602699852000902805856004802814655001202862IND4436714820221118063231.0100507e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443671482DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738100200652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedvedev, S.

Family Hystrichopsyllidae (Part 5)  ap. 203-217.  aIncludes references  aBased on analysis of homologous character states and considering the molecular-biological data (Whiting et al., 2008), phylogenetic relationships of the tribes and subfamilies of the family Hystrichopsyllidae are discussed. In some cases, homologous states of the skeleton characters mark the clades revealed by the moleculargenetic analysis, but are shared by taxa from other clades. In contrast to the molecular-genetic data, morphological characters indicate the phylogenetic integrity of the family Hystrichopsyllidae. Morphological characters depict the subfamily Anomiopsyllinae as a monophyletic taxon (having synapomorphic states of the metaphragma, metasternite, and the mesosternal apodeme) closest to the subfamilies Neopsyllinae and Rhadinopsyllinae. The subfamilies Neopsyllinae, Rhadinopsyllinae, and Stenoponiinae have a non-thickened metasternite; the former two subfamilies also have in common a similar structure of articulation of the digitoid with the clasper, type of the metaphragma modification, and the presence of the sclerotized central sclerite. Homologous modifications of the metaphragma are also present in fleas of the subfamily Stenoponiinae. Close to this group are the subfamily Hystrichopsyllinae whose representatives also possess non-thickened metasternal apodemes, and the subfamily Listropsyllinae with its frontal sclerotized tubercle being a specialized modification of the frontal sclerotized fold. A specific feature shared by fleas of the subfamilies Hystrichopsyllinae and Listropsyllinae is the presence of the metasternal furca with high sharp processes and a high medial ridge. The closeness of these taxa is supported by the results of molecular-genetic analysis. The subfamilies Doratopsyllinae and Ctenophthalminae (tribes Ctenophthalmini and Carterettini) are united by the type of the attachment of the mesopleural rod to the special ridge at the upper margin of the mesopleuron. According to the molecular-genetic data, the tribe Neotyphloceratini is related to these subfamilies, even though its members have no ridge on the mesopleuron. The similarity in the structure of the furca (the presence of high dorsal processes with rounded apices and a high median ridge) and in the length ratio of the fulcrum lobes relates the subfamilies Ctenophthalminae and Dinopsyllinae. 3aHystrichopsyllidae 3aphylogeny 3asclerotization 3askeleton0 tEntomological revue.g2010 May, v. 90, no. 2 p.203-217dSP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax0013-87387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0013873810020065 7aarticle03156naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245012900193300001600322500002400338520147000362650002001832650000901852650001601861650001101877650000901888650001001897650001401907650001701921650001001938650001201948650002101960650001101981650003701992650003402029650006002063650001102123650001802134650002102152650005402173650004102227650001702268650002002285650001402305650002702319650002202346650001002368700001402378700001802392773011602410852000902526856005502535655001202590IND4423189520221118063220.0090714e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442318952DNAL7 a189920882pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.01038.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanasinghe, RMSBK10aIncidence of Error in Oestrus Detection Based on Secondary Oestrus Signs in a 24-h Tie-Stalled Dairy Herd with Low Fertility  ap. 643-646.  aIncludes references  aOestrus detection error and conception rates after AI based only on secondary oestrus signs were evaluated in a high yielding, 24-h tie-stalled dairy herd with low fertility, using milk progesterone profiles. Oestrus detection was based on the secondary oestrus signs such as restlessness, swelling, congestion of vulva and clear mucus discharge. Sixty eight AI conducted after observing the secondary oestrus signs in 44 animals were included in the study. Of the 68 AI, 53 (77.9%) were conducted in the follicular phase, and 13 (19.1%) and 2 (2.9%) were carried out in the luteal phase and during pregnancy, respectively. The overall error in oestrus detection based on milk progesterone profiles was 22.1%. The oestrus detection error did not differ significantly among different secondary oestrus signs. None of the AI conducted in the luteal phase resulted in conception, whereas 20.8% of AI conducted in the follicular phase resulted in conception. No significant difference in the conception rates among the groups of cows with different secondary oestrus signs was shown. The high incidence of oestrus detection error in this study might have been caused by the detection of cows in oestrus based only on secondary oestrus signs due to the confinement of animals. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of heat detection error in the 24-h tie-stalled dairy herd and oestrus detection based only on secondary oestrus signs resulted in low conception rate. 3aconception rate 3acows 3adairy herds 3aestrus 3amilk 3amucus 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3avulva 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aDiagnostic Errorsxveterinary 2aEstrus Detectionxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aFertilization 2aFollicular Phase 2aInfertility, Femalexphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLuteal Phase 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexanalysis 2aTreatment Outcome 2aVulva1 aNakao, T.1 aKobayashi, A.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2009 Aug., v. 44, no. 4 p.643-646dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2007.01038.x 7aarticle04819naa a2200961 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174072000900192072000900201100002300210245013000233300001800363500002400381500001500405506007600420520167500496506003702171650001602208650001702224650001802241650001302259650001102272650001802283650002602301650001302327650001902340650002002359650001002379650002502389650001902414650002402433650001202457650008602469650001802555650002902573650004402602650001102646650004502657650005002702650000902752650002502761650002802786650004102814650001402855650004802869650005102917650001402968650003902982653001803021653002003039653003303059653002203092653002803114653001203142700001803154700002003172700002003192700002003212700002203232700001903254700002103273700002403294700002303318700001903341700002003360700002603380700002203406700001903428700002403447773013403471852000903605856009103614856006903705930003303774945002503807946001303832655001203845IND4377662320221207145110.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766232DNAL7 a164617012pmid7 aPMC13929182pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1467-1475.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF832 0aF8211 aMarzorati, Massimo12aA Novel Bacteroidetes Symbiont Is Localized in Scaphoideus titanus, the Insect Vector of Flavescence Dorée in Vitis vinifera  ap. 1467-1475.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlavescence dorée (FD) is a grapevine disease that afflicts several wine production areas in Europe, from Portugal to Serbia. FD is caused by a bacterium, "Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis," which is spread throughout the vineyards by a leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus (Cicadellidae). After collection of S. titanus specimens from FD-contaminated vineyards in three different areas in the Piedmont region of Italy, we performed a survey to characterize the bacterial microflora associated with this insect. Using length heterogeneity PCR with universal primers for bacteria we identified a major peak associated with almost all of the individuals examined (both males and females). Characterization by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a major band that, after sequencing, showed a 97 to 99% identity with Bacteroidetes symbionts of the "Candidatus Cardinium hertigii" group. In addition, electron microscopy of tissues of S. titanus fed for 3 months on phytoplasma-infected grapevine plants showed bacterial cells with the typical morphology of "Ca. Cardinium hertigii." This endosymbiont, tentatively designated ST1-C, was found in the cytoplasm of previtellogenic and vitellogenic ovarian cells, in the follicle cells, and in the fat body and salivary glands. In addition, cell morphologies resembling those of "Ca. Phytoplasma vitis" were detected in the midgut, and specific PCR assays indicated the presence of the phytoplasma in the gut, fat body and salivary glands. These results indicate that ST1-C and "Ca. Phytoplasma vitis" have a complex life cycle in the body of S. titanus and are colocalized in different organs and tissues.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhytoplasma 3ainsect pests 3aribosomal RNA 3abacteria 3amidgut 3aendosymbionts 3aphytoplasmal diseases 3afat body 3ainsect vectors 3asalivary glands 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aVitis vinifera 3aScaphoideus titanus 2aAnimals 2aBacteroidetesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxultrastructure. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFat Bodyxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aHemipteraxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aInsect Vectorsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOvaryxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aSalivary Glandsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aSymbiosis 2aVitisxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 0aBacteroidetes 0adisease vectors 0aCandidatus Phytoplasma vitis 0aflavescence doree 0amolecular sequence data 0aovaries1 aAlma, Alberto1 aSacchi, Luciano1 aPajoro, Massimo1 aPalermo, Simona1 aBrusetti, Lorenzo1 aRaddadi, Noura1 aBalloi, Annalisa1 aTedeschi, Rosemarie1 aClementi, Emanuela1 aCorona, Silvia1 aQuaglino, Fabio1 aBianco, Piero Attilio1 aBeninati, Tiziana1 aBandi, Claudio1 aDaffonchio, Daniele0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.1467-1475dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.1467-1475.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060531b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle01342naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245011300171300001600284500002400300520031700324650002900641650001500670650001600685650001200701650002600713650001000739650001300749650001400762700001500776700001700791773013000808852000900938856005700947655001201004IND4445731220221118063344.0101126s1985    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444573122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.1985.tb04827.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, K.S.12aA Technique for Artificial Inoculation of Cauliflower Seedlings with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary  ap. 191-192.  aIncludes references  aThe technique involves partial colonisation of detached petals with either the ascospores or the mycelium for initiating subsequent infection of the cauliflower seedlings.

The mass transfer limitations problem crucial at 30°C due to the viscosity of CPO has been addressed. The process parameters that are closely related to mass transfer effects like enzyme loading, agitation speed and reaction time were optimized. An optimum methanol to oil substrate molar ratio at 6.5:1 was observed and maintained throughout the experiments. The optimum operating condition for the transesterification process was found at 6.67 wt% of enzyme loading and at 150rpm of agitation speed. The corresponding initial reaction and FAME yield obtained at 6h were 89.29% FAME yield/hr and 85.01%, respectively. The 85% FAME yield obtained at 30°C operation of CPO transesterification shows that the process is potentially feasible for the biodiesel synthesis. 3aagitation 3abiodiesel 3aenzymes 3amass transfer 3amethanol 3apalm oils 3atransesterification 3aviscosity 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aEsterification 2aEstersxanalysis 2aFeasibility Studies 2aKinetics 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aModels, Chemical 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aKamaruddin, Azlina Harun1 aBhatia, Subhash0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 23 p.8948-8954dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.039 7aarticle02690naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002200133024001900155040001800174072000900192072000900201100002300210245010400233300001800337500002400355506007600379520108200455506003701537650002901574650001101603650002101614650001301635650002301648650001401671650002101685650002101706650001201727653001701739653001701756700002801773700002101801773013401822852000901956856009101965856006902056930003302125945002502158946001302183655001202196IND4377660620221207143408.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766062DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1330-1335.20062doi7 aPMC13929532pmcid7 a164616842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aF6001 aDumont, Frédéric10aInvolvement of Two Specific Causes of Cell Mortality in Freeze-Thaw Cycles with Freezing to -196°C  ap. 1330-1335.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this study was to examine cell viability after freezing. Two distinct ranges of temperature were identified as corresponding to stages at which yeast cell mortality occurred during freezing to -196°C. The upper temperature range was related to the temperature of crystallization of the medium, which was dependent on the solute concentration; in this range mortality was prevented by high solute concentrations, and the proportion of the medium in the vitreous state was greater than the proportion in the crystallized state. The lower temperature range was related to recrystallization that occurred during thawing. Mortality in this temperature range was increased by a high cooling rate and/or high solute concentration in the freezing medium and a low temperature (less than -70°C). However, a high rate of thawing prevented yeast mortality in this lower temperature range. Overall, it was found that cell viability could be conserved better under freezing conditions by increasing the osmotic pressure of the medium and by using an increased warming rate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3acryopreservation 3afreezing 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3amortality 3astarter cultures 3aosmotic pressure 3athawing 0athawing rate 0acooling rate1 aMarechal, Pierre-André1 aGervais, Patrick0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.1330-1335dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.1330-1335.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060530b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle04053naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174072000900192100002200201245015200223300001800375500002400393500001500417506007600432520162500508506003702133650001502170650001202185650000902197650001402206650003102220650002502251650003702276650002502313650002002338650001202358650001802370650001102388650002902399650002502428650001102453650002102464650003802485650003502523650005602558650008602614651001202700653002302712653003102735653003202766653001002798653001902808700002602827700001802853700002102871700002302892700002202915700002002937773013402957852000903091856009103100856006903191930003303260945002503293946001303318655001203331IND4377661720221207143354.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766172DNAL7 a164616952pmid7 aPMC13929732pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1420-1428.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aCoffey, Tracey J.10aFirst Insights into the Evolution of Streptococcus uberis: a Multilocus Sequence Typing Scheme That Enables Investigation of Its Population Biology  ap. 1420-1428.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntramammary infection with Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis throughout the world. Several procedures to differentiate S. uberis isolates have been proposed. However, all are prone to interlaboratory variation, and none is suitable for the description of the population structure. We describe here the development of a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for S. uberis to help address these issues. The sequences of seven housekeeping gene fragments from each of 160 United Kingdom milk isolates of S. uberis were determined. Between 5 and 17 alleles were obtained per locus, giving the potential to discriminate between 1.3 x 10⁷ sequence types. In this study, 57 sequence types (STs) were identified. Statistical comparisons between the maximum-likelihood trees constructed by using the seven housekeeping gene fragments showed that the congruence was no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology, indicating there had been significant recombination within these loci. The population contained one major lineage (designated the ST-5 complex). This dominated the population, containing 24 STs and representing 112 isolates. The other 33 STs were not assigned to any clonal complex. All of the isolates in the ST-5 lineage carried hasA, a gene that is essential for capsule production. There was no clear association between ST or clonal complex and disease. The S. uberis MLST system offers researchers a valuable tool that allows further investigation of the population biology of this organism and insights into the epidemiology of this disease on a global scale.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adairy cows 3aalleles 3aloci 3aevolution 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aStreptococcus uberis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3apopulation structure 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlucuronosyltransferasexgenetics 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiology 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStreptococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 0aEngland 0ahousekeeping genes 0amultilocus sequence typing 0ahousekeeping gene fragments 0agenes 0asequence types1 aPullinger, Gillian D.1 aUrwin, Rachel1 aJolley, Keith A.1 aWilson, Stephen M.1 aMaiden, Martin C.1 aLeigh, James A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.1420-1428dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.1420-1428.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060530b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle04390naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001900163245017400182300001800356520237800374650001202752650001902764650000902783650001802792650001302810650001802823650001602841650001702857650002602874650001902900650002602919650002302945650001702968650001102985650002102996650003103017650001203048650002803060650004203088650004103130650006103171650001103232650001903243650001803262650001803280650002203298650003403320650000903354650002503363650002503388700001803413700002003431700001703451773019203468852000903660930003303669945002503702946001303727655001203740IND4363948320221118063150.0040818e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436394832DNAL7 a152544872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGauthier, M.S.10aEffects of introducing physical training in the course of a 16-week high-fat diet regimen on hepatic steatosis, adipose tissue fat accumulation, and plasma lipid profile  ap. 1064-1071.  aOBJECTIVE: We recently reported that an 8-week high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis was completely prevented if an exercise training programme was introduced and pursued concurrently with the diet. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which introducing exercise training at mid-point in the course of a 16-week high-fat diet regimen contributes to the reversal of liver lipid infiltration and the reduction of blood lipid profile deterioration and body fat accumulation. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Two groups of rats were fed a high-fat diet (42% kcal) for 16 weeks, one remaining sedentary during this entire period (HF-Sed) and the other being exercise trained for the last 8 weeks (HF-Tr). A third group was fed a standard diet and remained sedentary for all 16 weeks (SD-Sed). Training (5 days/week for 8 weeks) began 8 weeks after introducing the high-fat diet and consisted of treadmill running that was progressively increased to reach 60 min at 26 m/min, 10% grade, for the last 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Various parameters including liver lipid infiltration, fat depots and blood lipids. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, liver lipid infiltration was not significantly higher in HF-Sed than in SD-Sed rats (means +/- s.e.: 14.9 +/- 1.7 vs 12.3 +/- 0.4 mg/g; P > 0.05). High-fat compared to age-matched standard fed rats also showed an absence of difference (P > 0.05) in the weight of total visceral fat pads (13%), plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and leptin concentrations, but depicted significantly (P < 0.01) higher values for subcutaneous fat pad weight and plasma triacyglycerol. Exercise training largely decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation by 30 and 26%, respectively (P < 0.01) as well as NEFA, triacylglycerol, and leptin concentrations (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Liver lipid infiltration does not seem to progress linearly over 16 weeks of high-fat feeding in light of what has previously been observed after 8 weeks of high-fat feeding. Introducing a training programme in the course of a 16-week high-fat diet protocol reduced adiposity, plasma NEFA, and leptin concentrations below the levels observed in standard fed rats. These data indicate that, exercise training, whether conducted concurrently or introduced during the course of a high-fat diet, is an asset to reduce the deleterious effects of a high-fat diet. 3aobesity 3ahuman diseases 3arats 3aanimal models 3aexercise 3ahigh fat diet 3afatty liver 3ablood lipids 3abody fat distribution 3aadipose tissue 3along term experiments 3adisease prevention 3atherapeutics 3aleptin 3atriacylglycerols 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysis 2aFatty Liverxetiologyxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aFemale 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aLipidsxblood 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aCouturier, K.1 aCharbonneau, A.1 aLavoie, J.M.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2004 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1064-1071x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20050717b20050802c00000000  aINDd3CTe2004/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001400146245010400160300001800264520185600282650001202138650001202150650002502162650004102187650001102228650002202239650001102261650000902272650001602281650003402297650005502331650002202386650002402408650002202432700001702454700002002471700001702491700001902508700001302527773019302540852000902733930003302742945002502775946001302800655001202813IND4365667520221118063152.0041118e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436566752DNAL7 a153566622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRyden, A.12aA comparative controlled study of personality in severe obesity: a 2-y follow-up after intervention  ap. 1485-1493.  aOBJECTIVE: The primary purpose was to examine 2-y effects of weight change on personality traits in severely obese subjects treated conventionally or surgically. We also assessed differences between the severely obese patients and a primarily normal-weight reference group. METHOD: Personality traits were assessed using 7 of 15 scales from the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP): Somatic Anxiety, Muscular Tension, Psychasthenia, Psychic Anxiety, Monotony Avoidance, Impulsiveness, and Irritability. A total of 1380 surgical candidates, 1241 conventionally treated patients and 1135 subjects from the SOS (Swedish Obese Subjects) reference study, representing the general population, completed the KSP. Data presented in this study were gathered twice from the patients (prior to treatment and after 2y) and once from the reference subjects. Significance tests and effect sizes (ES) were calculated. RESULTS: At baseline, the obese were characterised as more anxiety prone, impulsive, irritable and less monotony avoiding than the reference group; surgery patients more so than the conventionally treated. At follow-up, it was found that anxiety proneness decreased and Monotony Avoidance increased with increasing weight loss. The conventionally treated were, on average, weight stable and, hence, only a small decrease was noted regarding Somatic Anxiety. The surgery group lost on average 28 kg, and differences between surgically treated and the reference group decreased on all scales except Impulsiveness, which remained unchanged. The largest improvement was in relation to Psychasthenia. CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction maintained for 2y was associated with changes on practically all personality traits in proportion to the magnitude of weight loss. In particular, Psychasthenia seemed to be alleviated, while Impulsiveness was unaffected. 3aobesity 3asurgery 3apsychosocial factors 2aAnxietyxetiologyxsurgeryxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxpsychologyxtherapy. 2aPersonality Disordersxetiologyxsurgeryxtherapy. 2aPersonality Tests 2aProspective Studies 2aTreatment Outcome1 aSullivan, M.1 aTorgerson, J.S.1 aKarlsson, J.1 aLindroos, A.K.1 aTaft, C.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2004 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1485-1493x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20051230b20060102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/12/30  aOther US 7aarticle02890naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245013500180300001600315500002400331520141200355650001301767650002301780650001501803650000901818650001201827650002701839650001901866650002301885650002301908650002101931650001501952650001701967650001801984650002002002650002002022650002902042650003002071650002702101650002302128700002102151700002102172700001702193700001502210773010202225852000902327856004802336655001202384IND4383379820221118063227.0060906e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438337982DNAL7 a168326452pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-006-0343-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalke, K.C.10aComparison of linkage maps from F2 and three times intermated generations in two populations of European flint maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 857-866.  aIncludes references  aIntermated mapping populations are expected to result in high mapping resolution for tightly linked loci. The objectives of our study were to (1) investigate the consequences of constructing linkage maps from intermated populations using mapping methods developed for F2 populations, (2) compare linkage maps constructed from intermated populations (F2Syn3) with maps generated from corresponding F2 and F3 base populations, and (3) investigate the advantages of intermated mapping populations for applications in plant breeding programs. We constructed linkage maps for two European flint maize populations (A x B, C x D) by mapping 105 SSR markers in generations F2 and F2Syn3 of population A x B, and 102 SSR markers in generations F3 and F2Syn3 of population C x D. Maps for F2Syn3 were constructed with mapping methods for F2 populations (Map A) as well as with those specifically developed for intermated populations (Map B). Both methods relate map distances to recombination frequencies in a single meiosis and, therefore, did not show a map expansion in F2Syn3 compared with maps constructed from the respective F2 or F3 base populations. Map A and B differed considerably, presumably because of theoretical shortcomings of Map A. Since loosely linked markers could not unambiguously be mapped in the F2Syn3 populations, they may hamper the construction of linkage maps from intermated populations. 3aZea mays 3achromosome mapping 3aflint corn 3aloci 3ameiosis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Drift 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aMelchinger, A.E.1 aFlachenecker, C.1 aKusterer, B.1 aFrisch, M.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2006 Sept., v. 113, no. 5 p.857-866dSpringerx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-006-0343-x 7aarticle04485naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183072000900192100001300201245007200214300001600286500002400302500001500326506007600341520148200417506003701899650002501936650001901961650003201980650001002012650002502022650002202047650001802069650003302087650001702120650001102137650001802148650001002166650004002176650001402216650002802230650001702258650001902275650004802294650004602342650006702388650003702455650003702492650002802529650002902557650002002586650002902606650003402635650001002669650002902679650002802708650002902736650003202765650001402797650003302811650006202844650003202906650002202938650003402960650006302994650001403057653002803071653002503099653001703124653002203141653002703163653003603190700002303226773010903249852000903358856008203367856005103449930003303500945002503533946001303558655001203571IND4377672320221207144454.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437767232DNAL7 a163878342pmid7 aPMC13565472pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0362512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8321 aYao, Nan10aArabidopsis ACCELERATED CELL DEATH2 Modulates Programmed Cell Death  ap. 397-411.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast protein ACCELERATED CELL DEATH2 (ACD2) modulates the amount of programmed cell death (PCD) triggered by Pseudomonas syringae and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) treatment. In vitro, ACD2 can reduce red chlorophyll catabolite, a chlorophyll derivative. We find that ACD2 shields root protoplasts that lack chlorophyll from light- and PPIX-induced PCD. Thus, chlorophyll catabolism is not obligatory for ACD2 anti-PCD function. Upon P. syringae infection, ACD2 levels and localization change in cells undergoing PCD and in their close neighbors. Thus, ACD2 shifts from being largely in chloroplasts to partitioning to chloroplasts, mitochondria, and, to a small extent, cytosol. ACD2 protects cells from PCD that requires the early mitochondrial oxidative burst. Later, the chloroplasts of dying cells generate NO, which only slightly affects cell viability. Finally, the mitochondria in dying cells have dramatically altered movements and cellular distribution. Overproduction of both ACD2 (localized to mitochondria and chloroplasts) and ascorbate peroxidase (localized to chloroplasts) greatly reduces P. syringae-induced PCD, suggesting a pro-PCD role for mitochondrial and chloroplast events. During infection, ACD2 may bind to and/or reduce PCD-inducing porphyrin-related molecules in mitochondria and possibly chloroplasts that generate reactive oxygen species, cause altered organelle behavior, and activate a cascade of PCD-inducing events.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aprotoporphyrin 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aroots 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitrous oxide 3abacterial diseases of plants 3amitochondria 3aleaves 3acytochemistry 3alight 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola 3aapoptosis 3ahypersensitive response 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aApoptosisxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Infectionsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLight 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Rootsxultrastructure 2aProtein Transport 2aProtoporphyrinsxpharmacology 2aPseudomonas syringaexgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aVirulence 0areactive oxygen species 0achloroplast movement 0acell biology 0aprotoporphyrin IX 0amitochondrial movement 0aACCELERATED CELL DEATH2 protein1 aGreenberg, Jean T.0 tplant cell.g2006 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.397-411dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0362513Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20060404b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/04  aOther US 7aarticle03395naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001300180245016800193300001800361500001500379520137700394650001601771650001901787650000801806650001001814650002201824650000801846650002301854650002001877650001101897650002401908650001501932650001701947650001201964650002301976650001401999650001502013650001002028650000902038650002002047650001102067650001102078650000902089650001602098650002202114650001502136650003202151650001602183650004402199650005102243650001602294651001202310651002702322653001502349700001402364700001602378700001802394773019302412852000902605930003302614945002502647946001302672655001202685IND4375377420221118063339.0051021e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437537742DNAL7 a159972442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJohn, U.10aSmoking status, cigarettes per day, and their relationship to overweight and obesity among former and current smokers in a national adult general population sample  ap. 1289-1294.  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: Weight gain after smoking cessation is perceived to be a barrier against quitting smoking. The goal was to analyze overweight and obesity depending on smoking status and number of cigarettes per day (cpd) among former and current smokers. METHODS: The sample included 7124 residents of Germany aged 18-79 y from a national health examination survey (participation rate: 61.4%). Body weight and height were objectively measured; smoking status and cpd were assessed by a questionnaire administered in a health examination center. RESULTS: The number of cpd was positively related to being overweight and more so to obesity among former smoking men, but not women. The results were adjusted for age, school education, exercise and alcohol consumption. Men who formerly had smoked more than 30 cpd had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.0 for obesity compared to men who had never smoked. CONCLUSION: With an increasing number of cpd more psychological and physiological processes of compensation of nicotine supply after smoking cessation may be expected. Male smokers should be provided with information on how to prevent weight gain after smoking cessation. To foster smoking cessation, female smokers should be informed that women who stop smoking manage to have no increase in the rates of overweight or obesity when considered at the general population level. 3aweight gain 3aquestionnaires 3amen 3awomen 3aphysical activity 3aage 3agender differences 3asmoking (habit) 3aheight 3aalcoholic beverages 3acigarettes 3ahuman health 3aobesity 3aeducational status 3abreathing 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxetiology 2aOverweight 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effectsxepidemiology. 2aSmoking Cessationxstatistics & numerical data 2aWeight Gain 3aGermany 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0aoverweight1 aHanke, M.1 aRumpf, H.J.1 aThyrian, J.R.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2005 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.1289-1294x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle03615naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245013400178300001600312500001500328520121600343650002701559650001901586650002301605650002801628650001001656650001101666650001701677650001901694650001701713650002301730650001501753650001201768650002501780650002001805650001801825650001301843650003501856650003101891650003301922650003301955650001101988650002501999650001102024650003702035650003602072650002902108650001602137650002402153650002602177650004802203650002402251650004202275650003402317653002402351653003002375653001902405653001402424700001602438700001702454700001502471700001602486700001602502700001502518700001802533773019002551852000902741930003302750945002502783946001302808655001202821IND4363946720221118063256.0040818e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436394672DNAL7 a152113602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMaachi, M.10aSystemic low-grade inflammation is related to both circulating and adipose tissue TNFalpha, leptin and IL-6 levels in obese women  ap. 993-997.  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE: We assessed the relationships between four circulating acute phase proteins and the circulating and adipose tissue levels of three adipocytokines. SUBJECTS: In all, 15 nondiabetic obese women with a body mass index (BMI) above 32 kg/m2 were investigated. METHOD: Circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), fibrinogen, alpha 1 antitrypsin and both circulating and adipose tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and leptin were measured by either nephelometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We found a strong positive correlation between both circulating and adipose tissue levels of IL-6, TNFalpha and leptin and serum CRP levels. All these adipose tissue adipocytokines were also positively correlated with serum AAG levels. These correlations disappeared when adjusted for fat mass, suggesting that the relationship observed was dependent on fat amount. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a strong relationship between adipocytokines and inflammatory markers, and suggest that cytokines secreted by adipose tissue in obese subjects could play a role in increased inflammatory proteins secretion by the liver. 3achemical concentration 3ahuman diseases 3aC-reactive protein 3acardiovascular diseases 3awomen 3aleptin 3ainterleukins 3aadipose tissue 3ainflammation 3amiddle-aged adults 3abiomarkers 3aobesity 3ametabolic inhibitors 3abody mass index 3aglycoproteins 3abody fat 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxanalysis 2aAdipose Tissueximmunology 2aBiomarkersxanalysisxblood. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFibrinogenxanalysis 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodxmetabolism. 2aInterleukin-6xanalysisxblood. 2aLeptinxanalysisxblood. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityximmunology 2aOrosomucoidxanalysis 2aPlasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1xanalysis 2aRegression Analysis 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysis 2aalpha 1-Antitrypsinxanalysis 0aalpha 1 antitrypsin 0aalpha 1 acid glycoprotein 0ablood proteins 0acytokines1 aPieroni, L.1 aBruckert, E.1 aJardel, C.1 aFellahi, S.1 aHainque, B.1 aCapeau, J.1 aBastard, J.P.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2004 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.993-997x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20050717b20050802c00000000  aINDd3CTe2004/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle03793naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002200131024001900153040001800172072000900190072000900199072000900208100002000217245015000237300001600387500002400403500001500427506007600442520174900518506003702267650002702304650001802331650002602349650003202375650002302407650002502430650002002455650001002475650002702485650002502512650002702537650002102564650002002585653002002605653001502625653001202640700002302652700002402675700002302699700003202722700002102754700002202775773013202797852000902929856008902938856006903027930003303096945002503129946001303154655001203167IND4377665920221207143202.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766592DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.986-993.20062doi7 aPMC13929262pmcid7 a164616392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF200 0aF6001 aWu, Sheng-Cheng10aIdentification of an endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-Xylanase from Magnaporthe grisea by Gene Knockout Analysis, Purification, and Heterologous Expression  ap. 986-993.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMagnaporthe grisea, a destructive ascomycetous pathogen of rice, secretes cell wall-degrading enzymes into a culture medium containing purified rice cell walls as the sole carbon source. From M. grisea grown under the culture conditions described here, we have identified an expressed sequenced tag, XYL-6, a gene that is also expressed in M. grisea-infected rice leaves 24 h postinoculation with conidia. This gene encodes a protein about 65% similar to endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-glycanases within glycoside hydrolase family GH10. A M. grisea knockout mutant for XYL-6 was created, and it was shown to be as virulent as the parent strain in infecting the rice host. The proteins secreted by the parent strain and by the xyl-6[Delta] mutant were each fractionated by liquid chromatography, and the collected fractions were assayed for endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-glucanase or endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-xylanase activities. Two protein-containing peaks with endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-xylanase activity secreted by the parent strain are not detectable in the column eluant of the proteins secreted by the mutant. The two endoxylanases (XYL-6[alpha] and XYL-6{szligbeta}) from the parent were each purified to homogeneity. N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that XYL-6[alpha] is a fragment of XYL-6{szligbeta} and that XYL-6{szligbeta} is identical to the deduced protein sequence encoded by the XYL-6 gene. Finally, XYL-6 was introduced into Pichia pastoris for heterologous expression, which resulted in the purification of a fusion protein, XYL-6H, from the Pichia pastoris culture filtrate. XYL-6H is active in cleaving arabinoxylan. These experiments unequivocally established that the XYL-6 gene encodes a secreted endo-{szligbeta}-1,4-D-xylanase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aKomagataella pastoris 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anucleotide sequences 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aknockout mutants 3aenzyme activity 0aPichia pastoris 0aXYL-6 gene 0amutants1 aHalley, Jeffrey E.1 aLuttig, Christopher1 aFernekes, Linda M.1 aGutiérrez-Sanchez, Gerardo1 aDarvill, Alan G.1 aAlbersheim, Peter0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.986-993dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.986-993.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060526b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/26  aOther US 7aarticle02939naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174072000900192100001900201245008900220300001800309500002400327506007600351520041200427506003700839650001000876650001900886650002200905650002200927650002700949650001800976650001000994650002501004650007201029650006501101650001701166650001401183650002101197650003701218650002801255650001401283650007201297650005501369650005601424650006101480651001501541651001501556653001701571653002801588700001701616700001801633700002101651700001601672700001901688700002001707700002001727700001701747700001801764700001701782700002001799773013401819852000901953856009101962856006902053930003302122945002502155946001302180655001202193IND4377665720221207143204.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766572DNAL7 a164617352pmid7 aPMC13928832pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1708-1715.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aKuhlman, K.

The red grain color is ubiquitous among the wild ancestors of O. sativa, in which it is closely associated with seed shattering and dormancy. Rc encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that was fine-mapped to an 18.5-kb region on rice chromosome 7 using a cross between Oryza rufipogon (red pericarp) and O. sativa cv Jefferson (white pericarp). Sequencing of the alleles from both mapping parents as well as from two independent genetic stocks of Rc revealed that the dominant red allele differed from the recessive white allele by a 14-bp deletion within exon 6 that knocked out the bHLH domain of the protein. A premature stop codon was identified in the second mutant stock that had a light red pericarp. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the Rc gene was expressed in both red- and white-grained rice but that a shortened transcript was present in white varieties. Phylogenetic analysis, supported by comparative mapping in rice and maize (Zea mays), showed that Rc, a positive regulator of proanthocyanidin, is orthologous with INTENSIFIER1, a negative regulator of anthocyanin production in maize, and is not in the same clade as rice bHLH anthocyanin regulators.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3atranscription factors 3arice 3amessenger RNA 3aalleles 3apericarp 3ahomeotic genes 3aOryza sativa 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3acolor 3anucleotide sequences 3awild relatives 3aOryza rufipogon 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aExonsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0ared pericarp 0aRc gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes1 aThomson, Michael J.1 aPfeil, Bernard E.1 aMcCouch, Susan0 tplant cell.g2006 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.283-294dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0384303Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20060404b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/04  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177100002300186245007800209300001600287500002400303520126600327650001701593650001401610650002101624650002001645650001801665650002501683650001001708650001901718653002801737653001401765653001401779773018001793852000901973856008001982856004802062930003302110945002502143946001302168655001202181IND4377632520221118063419.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437763252DNAL7 a216461912pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.93.2.3042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF400 0aF2001 aLohmann, Lúcia G.10aUntangling the phylogeny of neotropical lianas (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae)  ap. 304-318.  aIncludes references  aThe tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) is a large and morphologically diverse clade of neotropical lianas. Despite being a conspicuous component of the neotropical flora, the systematics of the tribe has remained uncertain due to confusing patterns of morphological variation within the group. Chloroplast (ndhF) and nuclear (PepC) DNA sequences were used here to reconstruct the phylogeny of Bignonieae. Individual analyses of ndhF and PepC were highly similar to one another, yet localized differences in the placement of six species suggests some conflict between data sets. Combined analyses result in trees that are consistent with those from the individual analyses and provide greater support for the suggested relationships. This phylogeny provides important new insights into the systematics of the tribe. It identifies 21 strongly supported species groups, eight of which broadly correspond to currently recognized genera. In addition, each of these 21 species groups is supported by morphological synapomorphies. The consistency between morphological and molecular data suggests that the current phylogeny provides a solid framework for a formal revision of the generic-level classification and for addressing other aspects of the biology of Bignonieae. 3aBignoniaceae 3aphylogeny 3aplant morphology 3achloroplast DNA 3aribosomal DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3agenes 3aplant taxonomy 0amolecular sequence data 0andhF gene 0aPepC gene0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2006 Feb., v. 93, no. 2 p.304-318dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.93.2.3043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle03790naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174072000900192072000900201072000900210100002600219245011800245300001800363500002400381506007600405520164000481506003702121650002502158650001802183650001602201650003202217650001502249650001202264650001102276650001402287650001402301650000902315650001902324650002002343650002102363650001002384650001702394650002002411650004002431650002602471650003502497650002502532650005902557650004302616650002602659653001802685700002702703700002402730773013402754852000902888856009102897856006902988930003303057945002503090946001303115655001203128IND4377659620221207135706.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437765962DNAL7 a164616742pmid7 aPMC13928902pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1258-1266.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF500 0aK0011 aCalvaruso, Christophe10aRoot-Associated Bacteria Contribute to Mineral Weathering and to Mineral Nutrition in Trees: a Budgeting Analysis  ap. 1258-1266.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe principal nutrient source for forest trees derives from the weathering of soil minerals which results from water circulation and from plant and microbial activity. The main objectives of this work were to quantify the respective effects of plant- and root-associated bacteria on mineral weathering and their consequences on tree seedling growth and nutrition. That is why we carried out two column experiments with a quartz-biotite substrate. The columns were planted with or without pine seedlings and inoculated or not with three ectomycorrhizosphere bacterial strains to quantify biotite weathering and pine growth and to determine how bacteria improve pine growth. We showed that the pine roots significantly increased biotite weathering by a factor of 1.3 for magnesium and 1.7 for potassium. We also demonstrated that the inoculation of Burkholderia glathei PML1(12) significantly increased biotite weathering by a factor of 1.4 for magnesium and 1.5 for potassium in comparison with the pine alone. In addition, we observed a significant positive effect of B. glathei PMB1(7) and PML1(12) on pine growth and on root morphology (number of lateral roots and root hairs). We demonstrated that PML1(12) improved pine growth when the seedlings were supplied with a nutrient solution which did not contain the nutrients present in the biotite. No improvement of pine growth was observed when the seedlings were supplied with all the nutrients necessary for pine growth. We therefore propose that the growth-promoting effect of B. glathei PML1(12) mainly resulted from the improved plant nutrition via increased mineral weathering.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia glathei 3asoil bacteria 3arhizosphere 3abiological activity in soil 3aweathering 3abiotite 3aquartz 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3airon 3atree nutrition 3aseedling growth 3aPinus sylvestris 3aroots 3aroot systems 3anutrient uptake 2aBurkholderiaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMagnesiumxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aPinusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 0abioweathering1 aTurpault, Marie-Pierre1 aFrey-Klett, Pascale0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.1258-1266dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.1258-1266.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060530b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009400171300001600265500002400281520125300305650002401558650001201582650001201594650001301606650001501619650002101634650001301655650001201668650001901680650001001699650001601709650001901725650001001744650001601754700002301770700002101793773008701814852000901901856004801910655001201958IND4427204620221118063246.0091012e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442720462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-009-0087-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandenberger, Rick E.10aSpatial patterns of female Ailanthus altissima across an urban-to-rural land use gradient  ap. 437-448.  aIncludes references  aAilanthus altissima is an invasive, dioecious deciduous tree common at the interface between urban and rural areas in the mid-Atlantic region, U.S.A. To examine spatial patterns of abundance and associations with land use type, we mapped all mature female trees in nine 89.5 ha plots (805.5 ha total area) across a typical urban-to-rural land use gradient using aerial images obtained via remote sensing supplemented by detailed ground referencing. Rural plots were dominated by forest and had the lowest density of mature females (0.007 females ha⁻¹); urban and suburban plots did not differ significantly in mean density (0.37 females ha⁻¹ vs. 0.34 females ha⁻¹, respectively). Individuals in urban plots were more evenly distributed, but were not associated with a wider variety of land uses and were closer to roads or openings than those in suburban plots. Given less available habitat per unit area in urban than in suburban environments, these patterns suggest that Ailanthus fits the profile of an invasive species that may be proliferating outward from urban centers. With continued disturbances associated with development in the suburban areas, and timber harvesting in the rural areas, further spread of Ailanthus seems likely. 3aAilanthus altissima 3afemales 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3ainvasive species 3aland use 3alogging 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3arural areas 3asuburban areas 3atrees 3aurban areas1 aWarner, Timothy A.1 aMcGraw, James B.0 tUrban ecosystems.g2009 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.437-448dSpringer USx1083-81557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-009-0087-x 7aarticle03263naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245016300165300001600328500002400344520180700368650002202175650001802197650002302215650001502238650001402253650001202267650001102279650001902290650002402309650001602333650001702349650001002366650001102376650002502387650002002412650001702432650001002449700002002459700002202479700001902501700002202520700002002542700002102562700001502583773010202598852000902700856004802709655001202757IND4438787620221118063154.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443878762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-009-0453-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuóth, Adrienn10aRelationship between osmotic stress-induced abscisic acid accumulation, biomass production and plant growth in drought-tolerant and -sensitive wheat cultivars  ap. 719-727.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of increasing osmotic stress induced by 100-400 mOsm (−0.976 MPa) polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) were investigated in a drought-tolerant (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Mv Emese) and drought-sensitive (cv. GK Élet) wheat cultivar at the three-leaf stage. During osmotic stress, the decline of the water potential (ψ w) was more significant in the leaves, while the abscisic acid (ABA) levels of the roots increased earlier and remained higher in the sensitive than in the tolerant variety. There was an increasing gradient of ABA content toward the youngest leaves in the drought-sensitive GK Élet, while more ABA accumulated in the fully developed, older leaves of the tolerant cultivar Mv Emese. In accordance with the rapid and significant accumulation of ABA, the stomatal conductance decreased earlier in the tolerant cultivar. The effect of water stress on the PSII photochemistry was pronounced only 1 week after the exposure to PEG, as indicated by the earlier decrease of the net CO₂ fixation, the effective quantum yield (ΦPSII) and the photochemical quenching (q P) in light-adapted samples of the tolerant variety in 400 mOsm PEG 6000. The stress treatment caused more significant reductions in these parameters toward the end of the experiment in the sensitive cultivar. In spite of small differences in the photosynthetic characteristics, the net biomass production was not significantly altered by this osmotic stress. The accumulation of ABA controlled the distribution of the biomass between the shoot and root systems under osmotic stress, and contributed to the development of stronger and deeper roots in the drought-sensitive cultivar GK Élet. However, the root elongation did not correlate with the drought sensitivity of these cultivars on the basis of crop yield. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3abiomass production 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adrought 3aleaves 3aphotosystem II 3apolyethylene glycol 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3awater potential 3awater stress 3awheat1 aBenyó, Dániel1 aCsiszár, Jolán.1 aGallé, Ágnes1 aHorváth, Ferenc.1 aCseuz, László1 aErdei, László.1 aTari, Irma0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2010 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.719-727dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-009-0453-6 7aarticle03335naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245009800179300001600277500001500293520105400308650002701362650000801389650001201397650001001409650001101419650001901430650001701449650001901466650000801485650002001493650001701513650001301530650001301543650002501556650002801581650001601609650000901625650004601634650002501680650003201705650001101737650001901748650003801767650001101805650002701816650002901843650002001872650000901892650002701901650001601928650002601944650001601970650001201986653002801998653001002026700001702036700001502053700001702068700001402085700001602099700001702115700001402132700001902146700001602165773019002181852000902371856007802380930003302458945002502491946001302516655001202529IND4381955520221118063210.0060714e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438195552DNAL7 a162611862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Patients and methods: We genotyped a tetranucleotide repeat mapped in the 3'UTR of the LEP gene (LEP-tet) in 109 subjects with cardiovascular events and in 109 control subjects. Results: Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension or diabetes showed not significant association between the genotype of the LEP-tet and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, no differences were observed in the plasma leptin concentrations between cases and control subjects (22+/-19 vs 22+/-14 ng/ml, P=0.52) and in relation to the LEP-tet classes or carriage of specific allelels (P=0.76 for the association between LEP-tet classes and leptin levels in overall analysis). Conclusions: In conclusion, our data do not support an association between the LEP-tet microsatellite polymorphism of the human LEP gene and cardiovascular diseases. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amen 3aalleles 3awomen 3aleptin 3ahyperlipidemia 3arisk factors 3ahuman genetics 3aage 3asmoking (habit) 3ahypertension 3agenotype 3adiabetes 3agenetic polymorphism 2a3' Untranslated Regions 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxgenetics. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitusxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxgenetics 2aLeptinxbloodxgenetics. 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSex Factors 2aSmoking 0acardiovascular diseases 0agenes1 aDi Febbo, C.1 aPintor, S.1 aBaccante, G.1 aGatta, V.1 aMoretta, V.1 aDi Nisio, M.1 aPalka, C.1 aCuccurullo, F.1 aStuppia, L.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2006 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.209-213x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/09/08  aOther US 7aarticle03803naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002300179245004800202300001600250500002400266500001500290506007600305520229900381506003702680650001602717650001602733650001402749650001002763650001702773650001102790650001402801650001002815650001902825650001702844650001702861650002502878650001102903650002502914650001802939650001402957650001902971650001402990650001003004653001803014653001803032700002403050773010003074852000903174856007803183655001203261IND4404607120221207144143.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440460712DNAL7 a182229112pmid7 aPMC27102102pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm3212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Charles A.10aGenome Size Scaling through Phenotype Space  ap. 759-766.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early observations that genome size was positively correlated with cell size formed the basis of hypothesized consequences of genome size variation at higher phenotypic scales. This scaling was supported by several studies showing a positive relationship between genome size and seed mass, and various metrics of growth and leaf morphology. However, many of these studies were undertaken with limited species sets, and often performed within a single genus. Here we seek to generalize the relationship between genome size and the phenotype by examining eight phenotypic traits using large cross-species comparisons involving diverse assemblages of angiosperm and gymnosperm species. These analyses are presented in order of increasing scale (roughly equating to the number of cells required to produce a particular phenotypic trait), following the order of: cell size (guard cell and epidermal), stomatal density, seed mass, leaf mass per unit area (LMA), wood density, photosynthetic rate and finally maximum plant height. SCOPE: The results show that genome size is a strong predictor of phenotypic traits at the cellular level (guard cell length and epidermal cell area had significant positive relationships with genome size). Stomatal density decreased with increasing genome size, but this did not lead to decreased photosynthetic rate. At higher phenotypic scales, the predictive power of genome size generally diminishes (genome size had weak predictive power for both LMA and seed mass), except in the interesting case of maximum plant height (tree species tend to have small genomes). There was no relationship with wood density. The general observation that species with larger genome size have larger seed mass was supported; however, species with small genome size can also have large seed masses. All of these analyses involved robust comparative methods that incorporate the phylogenetic relationships of species. CONCLUSIONS: Genome size correlations are quite strong at the cellular level but decrease in predictive power with increasing phenotypic scale. Our hope is that these results may lead to new mechanistic hypotheses about why genome size scaling exists at the cellular level, and why nucleotypic consequences diminish at higher phenotypic scales.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aguard cells 3acorrelation 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3awood density 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3aphotosynthesis 3aGymnospermae 3aAngiospermae 3aphenotypic variation 3aleaves 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aGenome, Plant 2aPhenotype 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aSeeds 0aConiferophyta 0aMagnoliophyta1 aBeaulieu, Jeremy M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2008 Apr., v. 101, no. 6 p.759-766dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm3213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04268naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001600179245014600195300001600341500002400357506007600381520180600457506003702263650002502300650002602325650002502351650001302376650001802389650002602407650002002433650001202453650001602465650001502481650002202496650002602518650001002544650001102554650003102565650002702596650002202623650002802645650002102673650004002694650003402734650003802768650001302806650003502819650003602854650002702890650003302917650004202950650005202992650004903044650005503093650004903148650005403197650002303251700001803274700001703292700001803309700001903327773011303346852000903459856007803468655001203546IND4432385120221207144159.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443238512DNAL7 a199398882pmid7 aPMC28141052pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp3382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabe, Linda10aOverexpression of serine acetlytransferase produced large increases in O-acetylserine and free cysteine in developing seeds of a grain legume  ap. 721-733.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere have been many attempts to increase concentrations of the nutritionally essential sulphur amino acids by modifying their biosynthetic pathway in leaves of transgenic plants. This report describes the first modification of cysteine biosyntheis in developing seeds; those of the grain legume, narrow leaf lupin (Lupinus angustifolius, L.). Expression in developing lupin embryos of a serine acetyltransferase (SAT) from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSAT1 or AtSerat 2;1) was associated with increases of up to 5-fold in the concentrations of O-acetylserine (OAS), the immediate product of SAT, and up to 26-fold in free cysteine, resulting in some of the highest in vivo concentrations of these metabolites yet reported. Despite the dramatic changes in free cysteine in developing embryos of SAT overexpressers, concentrations of free methionine in developing embryos, and the total cysteine and methionine concentrations in mature seeds were not significantly altered. Pooled F₂ seeds segregating for the SAT transgene and for a transgene encoding a methionine- and cysteine-rich sunflower seed storage protein also had increased OAS and free cysteine, but not free methionine, during development, and no increase in mature seed total sulphur amino acids compared with controls lacking SAT overexpression. The data support the view that the cysteine biosynthetic pathway is active in developing seeds, and indicate that SAT activity limits cysteine biosynthesis, but that cysteine supply is not limiting for methionine biosynthesis or for storage protein synthesis in maturing lupin embryos in conditions of adequate sulphur nutrition. OAS and free methionine, but not free cysteine, were implicated as signalling metabolites controlling expression of a gene for a cysteine-rich seed storage protein.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLupinus angustifolius 3abiochemical pathways 3acysteine 3aembryogenesis 3aessential amino acids 3agene expression 3alegumes 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3aprotein synthesis 3aseed storage proteins 3aseeds 3aserine 3aserine O-acetyltransferase 3asunflower seed protein 3atransgenic plants 2aArabidopsisxenzymology 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCysteinexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aCysteine Synthasexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenotype 2aLupinusxembryologyxgenetics. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMethioninexmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeed Storage Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSerinexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesis. 2aSerine O-Acetyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSulfurxmetabolism1 aWirtz, Markus1 aMolvig, Lisa1 aDroux, Michel1 aHell, Ruediger0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 Mar., v. 61, no. 3 p.721-733dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp3383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02761naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011900186300001600305500002400321520107300345650001001418650001201428650001101440650001201451650001401463650001401477650001601491650001101507650001501518650001301533650001801546650003801564650002701602650001101629650004101640650002801681651001001709651001001719653002901729653001801758653002401776653002201800653002801822700002501850700002201875700002101897700002001918700001701938700001901955700001801974773012201992852000902114856004802123655001202171IND4444330520221118063133.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444433052DNAL7 a200913442pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1302-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasanthavigar, M.10aApplication of water quality index for groundwater quality assessment: Thirumanimuttar sub-basin, Tamilnadu, India  ap. 595-609.  aIncludes references  aAn attempt has been made to understand the hydrogeochemical parameters to develop water quality index in Thirumanimuttar sub-basin. A total of 148 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for major cations and anions. The domination of cations and anions was in the order of Na>Mg>Ca>K for cations and Cl>HCO₃ >SO₄ in anions. The hydrogeochemical facies indicate alkalis (Na and K) exceed alkaline earths (Ca and Mg) and strong acids (Cl and SO₄) exceed weak acid (HCO₃). Water quality index rating was calculated to quantify overall water quality for human consumption. The PRM samples exhibit poor quality in greater percentage when compared with POM due to effective leaching of ions, over exploitation of groundwater, direct discharge of effluents and agricultural impact. The overlay of WQI with chloride and EC correspond to the same locations indicating the poor quality of groundwater in the study area. SAR, Na%, and TH were noted higher during both the seasons indicating most of the groundwater locations not suitable for irrigation purposes. 3aacids 3aalkalis 3aanions 3acations 3achlorides 3aeffluents 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3airrigation 3aleaching 3awater quality 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aHumans 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aGroundwater geochemistry 0aAnthropogenic 0aWater quality index 0aSodium percentage 0aSodium adsorption ratio1 aSrinivasamoorthy, K.1 aVijayaragavan, K.1 aRajiv Ganthi, R.1 aChidambaram, S.1 aAnandhan, P.1 aManivannan, R.1 aVasudevan, S.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Dec., v. 171, no. 1-4 p.595-609dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-1302-1 7aarticle03720naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245012200177300001600299500001500315520143900330650002301769650001001792650002301802650001401825650001701839650002301856650000801879650002401887650002301911650001201934650001301946650002001959650002801979650001002007650001802017650001802035650003002053650001902083650002002102650002802122650002702150650001102177650001102188650001902199650002302218650001802241650005202259650001602311650004602327650002502373650002402398650001502422651001102437651002602448653001902474653002502493700001502518700001402533700001502547700001402562700001402576700001602590773019002606852000902796856006202805930003302867945002502900946001302925655001202938IND4382077620221118063125.0060718e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438207762DNAL7 a164325382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design: A cross-sectional study in a medical center in North Taiwan. Subjects: Five hundred and ninety-four, non-diabetic middle-aged women (age range=40-64 years, mean=48.9+/-5.4 years) were recruited. Measurements: The fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipids levels and anthropometric indices were measured. The homeostasis model assessment was applied to estimate the degree of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Metabolic syndrome was defined by using the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) criteria and modified NCEP criteria (waist circumference >80 cm). Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 6.2% using NCEP criteria, and 8.9% using modified NCEP criteria. Post-menopausal women had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its individual components compared to pre-menopausal women except hyperglycemia and low HDL-C. In multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and menopausal status, both BMI and HOMA-IR were independently associated with the metabolic syndrome. Conclusion: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women. Both obesity and insulin resistance may play an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome among the middle-aged women in North Taiwan. 3ametabolic syndrome 3awomen 3adisease prevalence 3amenopause 3arisk factors 3amiddle-aged adults 3aage 3aregression analysis 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3adiabetes 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aAsian People. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Complications 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLipidsxblood 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxethnologyxetiology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxcomplicationsxethnology. 2aPostmenopausexblood 2aPremenopausexblood 2aPrevalence 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwanxepidemiology. 0ahuman diseases 0astatistical analysis1 aYang, W.S.1 aLee, L.T.1 aChen, C.Y.1 aLiu, C.S.1 aLin, C.C.1 aHuang, K.C.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2006 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.912-917x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/index.html3electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/09/07  aOther US 7aarticle01665naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245014100202300001800343500002400361506007600385520042600461506003700887650002000924650003300944650001100977650001200988650001801000700002401018700001901042700001801061773013501079852000901214856008001223655001201303IND4449855720221207144201.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985572DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02691-102doi7 aPMC30672972pmcid7 a212395482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarugahare, Rona10aDetection of Cryptosporidium molnari Oocysts from Fish by Fluorescent-Antibody Staining Assays for Cryptosporidium spp. Affecting Humans  ap. 1878-1880.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree direct fluorescent-antibody staining assay kits for the detection of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species were used to detect Cryptosporidium molnari from Murray cod, and the cryptosporidia were characterized by using small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA).

S66-S77.  aPaper presented at the 2005 European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) International Workshop held September 29th - October 1st, 2005, Vienna, Austria.  a2019-12-05  aAIM: This paper deals with some methodological aspects of data collection in the context of measuring dietary intake in individuals in their adolescence life stage. METHOD: Experiences from three partners of the HELENA project in dietary intake measurement in children and adolescents are presented in this paper with emphasis on characteristics of under-reporting, long-term diet measurement and food patterns (Dortmund DONALD group), influences of survey duration on under-reporting (Ghent group) and meal habits (Spanish AVENA group). RESULTS: Under-reporters in the DONALD Study, particularly female adolescents, had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than non-under-reporters; BMI could not be explained by different long-term dietary patterns during childhood and adolescence clustered according to fat consumption; consumers of fast food had higher BMI values than nonconsumers. In the Ghent experience, the decline in population mean energy intake as calculated over selected clusters of days is 184 kcal (6.5%) in boys and 116 (5.6%) in girls; the cluster of 1 recording day and the cluster of 3 recording days were not significantly different but they were both significantly different from the 7-day cluster; no significant interaction was observed between the effect of time and BMI. In the AVENA Study, the percentage of adolescents skipping breakfast was higher in females (8.6%) than in males (3.5%, P<0.001); higher BMI values were observed in those skipping breakfast than in those notskipping breakfast, but differences were statistically significant in males at 15 y and in females at 14 and 17 y; adolescents avoiding some food groups for breakfast had higher BMI values (carbohydrates, fruits and pastries in males and milk, fruits and pastries in females). CONCLUSION: Dietary and nutrient intake data in the HELENA project will be obtained by means of repeated 24-h dietary recalls. Data from HELENA might be a basis for developing complex approaches like Healthy Eating Indices. 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3afast foods 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3agirls 3adata collection 3agender differences 3adietary carbohydrate 3achildren 3amilk 3aadolescents 3apastries 3ameasurement 3aboys 3abreakfast 3aEurope 0aliterature reviews 0afruits (food)1 aKersting, M.1 aHenauw, S. de1 aGonzalez-Gross, M.1 aSichert-Hellert, W.1 aMatthys, C.1 aMesana, M.I.1 aRoss, N.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2005 Sept., v. 29 p.S66-S77x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20060118b20060202c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle02486naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010800167300001600275500002400291520133000315650001201645650001801657650002601675650001301701650001201714650001301726650001901739650001301758650001701771650001101788650001301799650001301812650002101825650001101846650001101857700002101868700002101889773009701910852000902007856004802016655001202064IND4433003420221118063111.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443300342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0119-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaptist, Florence10aDirect and indirect control by snow cover over decomposition in alpine tundra along a snowmelt gradient  ap. 397-410.  aIncludes references  aWe assessed direct and indirect effects of snow cover on litter decomposition and litter nitrogen release in alpine tundra. Direct effects are driven by the direct influence of snow cover on edaphoclimatic conditions, whereas indirect effects result from the filtering effect of snow cover on species' abundance and traits. We compared the in situ decomposition of leaf litter from four dominant plant species (two graminoids, two shrubs) at early and late snowmelt locations using a two-year litter-bag experiment. A seasonal experiment was also performed to estimate the relative importance of winter and summer decomposition. We found that growth form (graminoids vs. shrubs) are the main determinants of decomposition rate. Direct effect of snow cover exerted only a secondary influence. Whatever the species, early snowmelt locations showed consistently reduced decomposition rates and delayed final stages of N mineralization. This lower decomposition rate was associated with freezing soil temperatures during winter. The results suggest that a reduced snow cover may have a weak and immediate direct effect on litter decomposition rates and N availability in alpine tundra. A much larger impact on nutrient cycling is likely to be mediated by longer term changes in the relative abundance of lignin-rich dwarf shrubs. 3aPoaceae 3aalpine tundra 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adwarfing 3afilters 3afreezing 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aplant litter 3ashrubs 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3awinter1 aYoccoz, Nigel G.1 aCholer, Philippe0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Mar., v. 328, no. 1-2 p.397-410dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0119-6 7aarticle01222naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121245005000139300001400189520043800203650002400641650001100665650001500676650002000691650001200711650002200723650000900745700000300754773012400757856004200881852000900923655001200932IND6082427020221118063153.0141110e20050716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608242702DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.157.3.682doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aDeveloping policy on the control of bovine TB  ap. 68-69.  aBVA policy on bovine tuberculosis, Subjects practitioners would like included in the undergraduate curriculum, Principles of regulation, Areas of activity for the Veterinary Policy Group, Role of vets in the Meat Hygiene Service–These were among matters discussed at a meeting of the Council of the British Veterinary Association, held at 7 Mansfield Street, London W1, on July 6.

However, little is known about the sorghum bZIP gene family although the sorghum genome has been completely sequenced. In this study, we have carried out a genome-wide identification and characterization of this gene family in sorghum. Our data show that the genome encodes at least 92 bZIP transcription factors. These bZIP genes have been expanded mainly by segmental duplication. Such an expansion mechanism has also been observed in rice, arabidopsis and many other plant organisms, suggesting a common expansion mode of this gene family in plants. Further investigation shows that most of the bZIP members have been present in the most recent common ancestor of sorghum and rice and the major expansion would occur before the sorghum-rice split era. Although these bZIP genes have been duplicated with a long history, they exhibited limited functional divergence as shown by nonsynonymous substitutions (Ka)/synonymous substitutions (Ks) analyses. Their retention was mainly due to the high percentages of expression divergence. Our data also showed that this gene family might play a role in multiple developmental stages and tissues and might be regarded as important regulators of various abiotic stresses and sugar signaling. 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3aleucine zipper 3arice 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aZhou, Junxia1 aZhang, Baolan1 aVanitha, Jeevanandam1 aRamachandran, Srinivasan1 aJiang, Shu-Ye0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2011 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.212-231dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.01017.x 7aarticle01880naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245016100166300001600327500002400343520067700367650002001044650002601064650000901090650001401099650001801113650002401131651002201155700001601177700001501193700001501208700001401223700001501237700001801252700001701270700001701287773011401304852000901418856005501427655001201482IND4445659220221118063207.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444565922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01522.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomeo, T.10aSwordfish (Xiphias gladius Linnaeus 1758) harpoon fishery: a method of evaluation of swordfish presence in the Strait of Messina (Central Mediterranean Sea)  ap. 886-891.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to examine the space and environment variables that contributed to the presence of swordfish in the Strait of Messina during the 2003 and 2004 harpoon fishing activity. The relationships between catches per location and environmental factors (current, moon phase and sea surface temperature) were analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM). The GLM analysis showed differences in CPUE (catch per unit effort) values in terms of swordfish numbers per location over the 2‐year period. The central locations of the Strait were found to be teeming with fish; the CPUE was also higher in these areas during the new and rising moon phases. 3aXiphias gladius 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3afisheries 3alinear models 3asurface temperature 3aMediterranean Sea1 aConsoli, P.1 aPunzon, A.1 aModica, L.1 aRaffa, F.1 aPerzia, P.1 aBattaglia, P.1 aEsposito, V.1 aAndaloro, F.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2010 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.886-891dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01522.x 7aarticle02343naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011000161300001600271500002400287500001500311520120200326650003801528650002401566650002801590650002301618650002501641650001901666650002501685650001801710650001901728650000901747650001501756653001801771700001901789773009201808852000901900856004801909655001201957IND4456880920221118063309.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445688092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-010-0223-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsidoro, D.10aPredicting soil salinity in response to different irrigation practices, soil types and rainfall scenarios  ap. 197-211.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA model was developed to predict rootzone salinity under different irrigation practices on different soil types, with similar rainfall but different monthly distributions. A rootzone daily water and salt balance was performed using eight scenarios: two soil types (coarse textured vs. fine textured), two multi-year series of actual rainfall data and two irrigation practices (surface with fixed number of irrigations and ET-based sprinkler irrigation). All factors influenced the mean electrical conductivity (EC) of the rootzone in the growing season (ECeS): (i) Surface irrigation led to lower ECeS than sprinkler irrigation; (ii) Winter-concentrated rainfall caused lower ECeS than rainfall distributed uniformly throughout the year; and (iii) Coarser-textured soil usually resulted in lower ECeS than the finer textured. The ECeS was related to the total precipitation of the hydrologic year and to the annual leaching fraction (LF) but surprisingly not to the seasonal LF. In most cases, the model predicted lower ECeS than the FAO steady-state approach. Therefore, considering these site-specific features could lead to lower leaching requirements and the safe use of higher salinity water. 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3ameteorological data 3aelectrical conductivity 3asurface irrigation 3aleaching requirement 3awater salinity 3asprinkler irrigation 3asoil salinity 3agrowing season 3arain 3asoil types 0awater balance1 aGrattan, S.

To expand our understanding of these plasmids, the replicon region (6.7 kb) from pBM300 was cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. Sequence analysis showed that the replication protein (RepM300) was highly homologous to two other plasmid Rep proteins of the same strain but to no other known proteins. Furthermore, the location of the replication origin was within the RepM300 coding region, and the origin contained three 12-base direct repeats. Deletion analysis of the replicon confirmed the role of the Rep protein and showed that open reading frame 2 (ORF2) was required for stability. However, the protein encoded by ORF2 is entirely different from the replicon stability proteins encoded by the other two replicons. The entire plasmid was isolated from the plasmid array by integrating a spectinomycin resistance gene and transforming a plasmidless strain, PV361. Complete sequencing showed that pBM300 was 26,300 bp long, had a G+C content of 35.2%, and contained 20 ORFs, two of which encoded proteins that had no similarity to other proteins in the database. The proteins encoded by the plasmid ORFs had similarity to proteins for mobilization and transfer, an integrase, a rifampin resistance protein, a cell wall hydrolase, glutathione synthase, and a biotin carboxylase. The similarities were to several gram-positive genera and a few gram-negative genera and archaea. oriT and ssoT-like regions were detected near two mob genes. These results suggest that pBM300 is a mobilizable hybrid plasmid that confers increased metabolic and germination ability on its host. Its replicon also helps define a new plasmid family.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus megaterium 3abiotin 3acell walls 3adatabases 3agenes 3agermination 3aglutathione synthase 3ahosts 3ahybrids 3anew family 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3areplication origin 3arolling 3asequence analysis 3aspectinomycin 2aBacillus megateriumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRepliconxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aVary, Patricia S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 June, v. 71, no. 6 p.3068-3076dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.6.3068-3076.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02305naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245006200164300001600226500002400242500001500266520096100281650002501242650001701267650002001284650001901304650002101323650002101344650002201365650002201387650002101409650002601430650003201456650005001488650002801538653001701566653002401583653003001607773011801637852000901755930003301764945002501797946001301822655001201835IND4377361220221118063252.0060122e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437736122DNAL7 a164286482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aX2001 aBurke, J.

An approximation of the standardization problem formulated as a linear programming problem is also presented. Two different approaches to finding a solution are provided. The model is implemented in Microsoft Excel and solved with the standard add-in solver available in that program. An example is provided to contrast the difference between the nonlinear programming and its linear approximation, and a second example is used to illustrate the yield implications of ultrafiltered milk protein products in Cheddar cheese production.

This moss releases a pine-scented oleoresin that is very sticky and odoriferous. Rosa x centifolia 'muscosa' was the first moss rose to be obtained by bud-mutation but, interestingly, R. x damascena 'Quatre Saisons Blanc Mousseux' was the first repeat-blooming cultivar, thus interesting breeders. In the present study, the anatomy of these sports (i.e. bud-mutations) is characterized and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the moss versus the petals are identified. They are compared between the two lines and their respective parents. METHODS: Anatomy of the moss is studied by environmental scanning electron microscopy and histochemical light microscopy. Sudan Red IV and Fluorol Yellow 088 are used to detect lipids, and 1-naphthol reaction with N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine to detect terpenes (Nadi reaction). Head-space or solid/liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are used to identify VOCs in moss, trichomes and petals. KEY RESULTS: Moss of the two cultivars has the same structure with trichomes on other trichomes but not exactly the same VOCs. These VOCs are specific to the moss, with lots of terpenes. An identical VOC composition is found in leaves but not in petals. They are nearly the same in the moss mutants and in the respective wild types. CONCLUSIONS: Sepals of moss roses and their parents have a specific VOC pattern, different from that of the petals. The moss corresponds to a heterochronic mutation with trichomes developing on other trichomes. Such a mutation has probably appeared twice and independently in the two lines.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRosa damascena 3aRosa centifolia 3aornamental plants 3aflowers 3aleaves 3aplant glands 3atrichomes 3achemical constituents of plants 3avolatile compounds 3aterpenoids 3aquantitative analysis 3ahistochemistry 3aplant morphology 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 2aChromatography, Gas 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxchemistry. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMonoterpenesxanalysis 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxchemistry. 2aRosaxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxclassification. 3aFrance1 aBergougnoux, V.1 aMartin, M.1 aMauriat, M.1 aBaudino, S.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.231-238dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcj0343Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04022naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002400192245016500216300001800381500002400399506007600423520156000499506003702059650002302096650002702119650002902146650001702175650001002192650001102202650000902213650001302222650001502235650001102250650002102261650002402282650007202306650006602378650001802444650002902462650002102491650002202512650001102534650002402545650002802569650001502597650003702612650002402649650005702673650005202730700001802782700002302800700002202823700002502845700002102870700002102891700002002912700002102932700002302953700002502976700001803001773013303019852000903152856009103161856004803252655001203300IND4377662220221207144458.0060205e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437766222DNAL7 a164617002pmid7 aPMC13929662pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.2.1459-1466.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWescombe, Philip A.10aProduction of the Lantibiotic Salivaricin A and Its Variants by Oral Streptococci and Use of a Specific Induction Assay To Detect Their Presence in Human Saliva  ap. 1459-1466.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalivaricin A (SalA), the first Streptococcus salivarius lantibiotic to be characterized, appears to be inhibitory to most Streptococcus pyogenes strains. A variant of the SalA structural gene (salA1) is present in more than 90% of S. pyogenes strains, but only strains of M serotype 4 and T pattern 4 produce the biologically active peptide. The present study identifies four additional variants (salA2 to salA5) of the SalA structural gene and demonstrates that each of the corresponding inhibitory peptides (SalA2 to SalA5) is produced in vitro. These variants appear to be similar to SalA and SalA1 in their inhibitory activity against Micrococcus luteus and in their ability to act as inducers of SalA production. It had previously been shown that S. pyogenes strain SF370 had a deletion (of approximately 2.5 kb) in the salM and salT genes of the salA1 locus. In the present study, several additional characteristic deletions within the salA1 loci were identified. S. pyogenes strains of the same M serotype all share the same salA1 locus structure. Since S. salivarius is a predominant member of the normal oral flora of healthy humans, strains producing anti-S. pyogenes lantibiotics, such as SalA, may have excellent potential for use as oral probiotics. In the present study, we have used a highly specific SalA induction system to directly detect the presence of SalA in the saliva of humans who either naturally harbor populations of SalA-producing S. salivarius or who have been colonized with the SalA2-producing probiotic S. salivarius K12.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aStreptococcus salivarius 3abacteriocins 3aflora 3ahumans 3aloci 3apeptides 3aprobiotics 3asaliva 3astructural genes 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aBacteriocinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProbiotics 2aSalivaxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStreptococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStreptococcus pyogenesxdrug effectsxgenetics.1 aUpton, Mathew1 aDierksen, Karen P.1 aRagland, Nancy L.1 aSivabalan, Senthuran1 aWirawan, Ruth E.1 aInglis, Megan A.1 aMoore, Chris J.1 aWalker, Glenn V.1 aChilcott, Chris N.1 aJenkinson, Howard F.1 aTagg, John R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.1459-1466dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.2.1459-1466.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02638naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015900129300001600288500002400304520166700328650001701995650001202012650003702024650001002061650001702071650000802088650000902096650001302105700002002118700001602138700002102154773012802175852000902303655001202312IND4402602720221118063134.0080309e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440260272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaly, Robin M.14aThe skeletal benefits of calcium- and vitamin D₃-fortified milk are sustained in older men after withdrawal of supplementation: an 18-mo follow-up study  ap. 771-777.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: In a previous 2-y randomized controlled trial, we showed that calcium- and vitamin D₃-fortified milk stopped or slowed bone loss at several clinically relevant skeletal sites in older men. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine whether the skeletal benefits of the fortified milk were sustained after withdrawal of the supplementation. DESIGN: One hundred nine men >50 y old who had completed a 2-y fortified milk trial were followed for an additional 18 mo, during which no fortified milk was provided. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine, and forearm was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Comparison of the mean changes from baseline between the groups (adjusted for baseline age, BMD, total calcium intake, and change in weight) showed that the net beneficial effects of fortified milk on femoral neck and ultradistal radius BMD at the end of the intervention (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively; P < 0.01 for both) were sustained at 18-mo follow-up (P < 0.05 for both). The nonsignificant between-group differences at the total hip (0.8%; P = 0.17) also persisted at follow-up (0.7%; P = 0.10), but there were no lasting benefits at the lumbar spine. The average total dietary calcium intake in the milk supplementation group at follow-up approximated recommended amounts for Australian men >50 y old (1000 mg/d) but did not differ significantly from that in the control subjects (1021 versus 890 mg/d). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with calcium- and vitamin D₃-fortified milk for 2 y may provide some sustained benefits for BMD in older men after withdrawal of supplementation. 3abone density 3acalcium 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemur 3alumbar spine 3amen 3amilk 3avitamins1 aPetrass, Nicole1 aBass, Shona1 aNowson, Caryl A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.771-777dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245007800196300001800274500002400292500001500316506007600331520158500407506003701992650001802029650002602047650001602073650001302089650002602102650003402128650001402162650001402176650005302190650004502243650006202288650002402350653001202374653001302386700002202399700002102421773011702442852000902559856007802568655001202646IND4425570620221207141725.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442557062DNAL7 a196285722pmid7 aPMC27668242pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp2332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTör, Mahmut10aReceptor-mediated signalling in plants: molecular patterns and programmes  ap. 3645-3654.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA highly evolved surveillance system in plants is able to detect a broad range of signals originating from pathogens, damaged tissues, or altered developmental processes, initiating sophisticated molecular mechanisms that result in defence, wound healing, and development. Microbe-associated molecular pattern molecules (MAMPs), damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), virulence factors, secreted proteins, and processed peptides can be recognized directly or indirectly by this surveillance system. Nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat proteins (NB-LRR) are intracellular receptors and have been targeted by breeders for decades to elicit resistance to crop pathogens in the field. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or receptor like proteins (RLPs) are membrane bound signalling molecules with an extracellular receptor domain. They provide an early warning system for the presence of potential pathogens and activate protective immune signalling in plants. In addition, they act as a signal amplifier in the case of tissue damage, establishing symbiotic relationships and effecting developmental processes. The identification of several important ligands for the RLK-type receptors provided an opportunity to understand how plants differentiate, how they distinguish beneficial and detrimental stimuli, and how they co-ordinate the role of various types of receptors under varying environmental conditions. The diverse roles of extra-and intracellular plant receptors are examined here and the recent findings on how they promote defence and development is reviewed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atissue repair 3aearly warning systems 3afield crops 3apeptides 3aenvironmental factors 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3areceptors 3avirulence 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 0akinases 0aproteins1 aLotze, Michael T.1 aHolton, Nicholas0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 Sept., v. 60, no. 13 p.3645-3654dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp2333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01979naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008300191300001800274500002400292520084100316650002301157650001801180650003701198650002101235650001201256650003401268650001501302650002101317650002301338650002401361650003101385700002401416773010101440852000901541856005501550655001201605IND4447965820221118063249.0110125e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444796582DNAL7 a162628472pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02717.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLUKACS, PAUL M.10aReview of capture-recapture methods applicable to noninvasive genetic sampling  ap. 3909-3919.  aIncludes references  aThe use of noninvasive genetic sampling to identify individual animals for capture-recapture studies has become widespread in the past decade.

Little attention has been paid to the capture-recapture application for this specific type of data beyond stating the effects of assumption violations. Here, we review the broad class of capture-recapture methods that are available for use with DNA-based capture-recapture data, noting the array of biologically interesting parameters such as survival, emigration rates, state transition rates and the finite rate of population change that can be estimated from such data. We highlight recent developments in capture-recapture theory specifically designed for noninvasive genetic sampling data. 3acapture of animals 3adata analysis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aresearch methods 2aAnimals 2aDNAxisolation & purification 2aDemography 2aEcologyxmethods 2aGenetic Techniques 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSpecimen Handlingxmethods1 aBurnham, Kenneth P.0 tMolecular ecology.g2005 Nov., v. 14, no. 13 p.3909-3919dBlackwell Science Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02717.x 7aarticle01998naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245011900190300001800309500002400327520083200351650002701183650001401210650001801224650002101242650002701263650001501290650001101305650004401316650001501360650002101375650001301396650002401409700002101433773009601454852000901550856005301559655001201612IND4402998020221118063239.0080319e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440299802DNAL7 a176432962pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhunia, Puspendu10aAnalysis, evaluation, and optimization of kinetic parameters for performance appraisal and design of UASB reactors  ap. 2132-2140.  aIncludes references  aStudies have been undertaken to explore the applicability of different kinetic models for the performance appraisal of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors treating wastewater in the range of 300-4000mg COD/l.

Both linear and nonlinear regressions have been performed to examine the best-fit among the kinetic models. In this process, five error analysis methods have been used to analyze the data. Apart from optimization of kinetic coefficients with minimization of associated errors, prediction of effluent COD has also been undertaken to verify the applicability of kinetic models.

The density of the population was assessed, and specific features of the butterfly distribution among four high-altitude belts (alpine tundra, subalpine, forest, and steppe) were revealed. Eighty-five habitats were examined and butterfly migration pathways were recorded for 359 hours of route surveys with a total length of 875 km. More than 16.5 thousand individuals belonging to 6 families, 66 genera and 107 species were recorded. The total species abundance of butterflies was found to be maximal in the forest belt; the highest population density was recorded in the alpine-tundra belt. The results obtained indicate that the basic differences among the butterfly populations are determined by the thermal conditions related to the altitude and, to a lesser degree, the degree of forestation. The distribution of most butterfly species over the transboundary territory is primarily determined by the recent environmental conditions, in particular the aridity of the tundra-steppe belt. 3aLepidoptera 3aalpine tundra 3aaltitude 3abutterflies 3afauna 3aforests 3apopulation density 3aspring 3asteppes 3asummer0 tEntomological revue.g2009 July, v. 89, no. 4 p.407-419dSP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax0013-87387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0013873809040046 7aarticle02053naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008800169300001600257500002400273520086400297650002001161650003701181650002201218650002201240650002501262650001301287700001801300700002301318700002501341700002201366700002201388700002201410700002101432700002201453700002201475773010101497852000901598856004801607655001201655IND4434003920221118063412.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443400392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-009-0044-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegelbacher, Gernot10aApplications of landscape genetics in conservation biology: concepts and challenges  ap. 375-385.  aIncludes references  aLandscape genetics plays an increasingly important role in the management and conservation of species.

In this study, an attempt is made to assess generic alliances based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data. METHODS: Six DNA datasets were gathered: plastid trnL intron, trnL-F spacer, matK gene and trnK introns upstream and dowstream from matK and nuclear ITS rDNA. Data were analysed with maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analysis with mixed models (BA). KEY RESULTS: Although relationships between Laeliinae and outgroups are well supported, within the subtribe sequence variation is low considering the broad taxonomic range covered. Localized incongruence between the ITS and plastid trees was found. A combined tree followed the ITS trees more closely, but the levels of support obtained with MP were low. The Bayesian analysis recovered more well-supported nodes. The trees from combined MP and BA allowed eight generic alliances to be recognized within Laeliinae, all of which show trends in morphological characters but lack unambiguous synapomorphies. CONCLUSIONS: By using combined plastid and nuclear DNA data in conjunction with mixed-models Bayesian inference, it is possible to delimit smaller groups within Laeliinae and discuss general patterns of pollination and hybridization compatibility. Furthermore, these small groups can now be used for further detailed studies to explain morphological evolution and diversification patterns within the subtribe.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aOrchidaceae 3agenes 3ahybridization 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplastid DNA 3apollination 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3atrees 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aOrchidaceaexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxclassificationxgenetics.1 aHiggins, Wesley E.1 aDressler, Robert L.1 aWhitten, W.

However, the exact timing of adverse rapid postnatal weight gain is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the associations between rapid weight gain in infancy and in early childhood in relation to body composition at age 17 y. DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted in 248 (103 males) singletons and their mothers. Height and weight were measured at birth, 6 mo, and 3 and 6 y. The rates of weight gain during infancy (0-6 mo) and early childhood (3-6 y) were calculated as changes in sex- and age-adjusted weight SD scores during these time periods. At 17 y, body composition was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. RESULTS: Increasing weight gain during infancy and early childhood were both independently associated with larger body mass index, fat mass, relative fat mass, fat-free mass, and waist circumference at 17 y (P < 0.005 for all; adjusted for sex, birth weight, gestational age, current height, maternal socioeconomic status, and maternal fat mass). Rapid weight gain in infancy, but not in early childhood, also predicted taller height at 17 y (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid weight gain in both infancy and early childhood is a risk factor for adult adiposity and obesity. Rapid weight gain in infancy also predicted taller adult height. We hypothesize that rapid weight gains in infancy and early childhood are different processes and may allow separate opportunities for early intervention against obesity risk later in life. 3aadipocytes 3aweight gain 3aschool children 3acohort studies 3aearly development 3arisk factors 3alean body mass 3awaist circumference 3ainfancy 3aadults 3acompensatory growth 3aadolescents 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3apreschool children 3abirth weight 3ainfants 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAdolescent 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aBody Heightxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aPlethysmographyxmethods 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0aoverweight 0afat free mass 0afat mass 0aair-displacement plethysmography1 aOng, Ken1 aLinne, Yvonne1 aNeovius, Martin1 aBrage, Sören.1 aDunger, D.

In order to understand the effect of isolation on the epiphyte community, we studied epiphyte diversity on three plots in a forest fragment, two riparian forest fragments, and in isolated pastureland trees. We found 118 vascular epiphyte species. On forest plots, both epiphyte richness per tree (Stree) and species turnover rate within trees (βtree) registered the highest values, although the lowest Stree diversity was also found there; additionally inside the forest were host species with clearly different epiphyte community. Stree and βtree diversities of riparian fragments behaved similarly to those of the forest. Isolated trees had the second highest Stree diversity, although their βtree diversity was the lowest. In the forest plots were both, the highest and lowest expected accumulated richness (α diversity); on riparian fragments it was intermediate, and the second lowest α diversity was registered for isolated trees. Species turnover rate among plots (β) was high and was associated with both, isolation and a distance gradient from permanent water sources. The epiphyte community on isolated trees was clearly different to the other habitats. Results suggest that deforestation eliminated dry areas and specific hosts that were important for the maintenance of epiphyte species richness. In pastureland trees the epiphyte βtree diversity diminished, suggesting a simplification of the environment for epiphytes and causing a low α diversity. 3adeforestation 3aepiphytes 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3amontane forests 3ariparian forests 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aMexico 0aSpecies accumulation functions 0aBeta diversity 0aAlpha diversity 0aGamma diversity1 aGarcía-Franco, José G.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.191-207dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9239-6 7aarticle02719naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245018800152300001800340500002400358520155900382650001901941650000901960650001101969650001901980650001701999650001502016650002302031650001102054650002102065650002102086650001502107700001502122700001702137700002102154773011002175852000902285856003902294655001202333IND4418780620221118063443.0090404e20090415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441878062DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.72502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, J.P.10aSensitivity of runoff and soil erosion to climate change in two Mediterranean watersheds. Part II: assessing impacts from changes in storm rainfall, soil moisture and vegetation cover  ap. 1212-1220.  aIncludes references  aThe impacts of climate change on storm runoff and erosion in Mediterranean watersheds are difficult to assess due to the expected increase in storm frequency coupled with a decrease in total rainfall and soil moisture, added to positive or negative changes to different types of vegetation cover. This report, the second part of a two-part article, addresses this issue by analysing the sensitivity of runoff and erosion to incremental degrees of change (from - 20 to + 20%) to storm rainfall, pre-storm soil moisture, and vegetation cover, in two Mediterranean watersheds, using the MEFIDIS model. The main results point to the high sensitivity of storm runoff and peak runoff rates to changes in storm rainfall (2·2% per 1% change) and, to a lesser degree, to soil water content (-1·2% per 1% change). Catchment sediment yield shows a greater sensitivity than within-watershed erosion rates to both parameters: 7·8 versus 4·0% per 1% change for storm rainfall, and - 4·9 versus - 2·3% per 1% change for soil water content, indicating an increase in sensitivity with spatial scale due to changes to sediment connectivity within the catchment. Runoff and erosion showed a relatively low sensitivity to changes in vegetation cover. Finally, the shallow soils in one of the catchments led to a greater sensitivity to changes in storm rainfall and soil moisture. Overall, the results indicate that decreasing soil moisture levels caused by climate change could be sufficient to offset the impact of greater storm intensity in Mediterranean watersheds. 3aclimate change 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil erosion 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astorms 3avegetation cover 3avegetation types 3awatersheds1 aSeixas, J.1 aKeizer, J.J.1 aFerreira, A.J.D.0 tHydrological processes.g2009 Apr. 15, v. 23, no. 8 p.1212-1220dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7250 7aarticle03244naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245013400182300001600316500002400332500001500356520161200371650002501983650001402008650001302022650001802035650001102053650001102064650001502075650002902090650000802119650001302127650001402140650001102154650003202165650002802197650001802225650003502243650006302278650002002341650004202361650004202403650002902445650003802474653001302512700001902525700001902544773008202563852000902645856004802654655001202702IND4422443320221118063451.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442244332DNAL7 a194842592pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-0953-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatsuki, Miho10aApple ethylene receptor protein concentrations are affected by ethylene, and differ in cultivars that have different storage life  ap. 407-417.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthylene plays a crucial role in apple fruit ripening. Ethylene receptors have been identified and are known to be negative regulators of ethylene signalling. We examined ethylene receptors MdERS1 and MdERS2 in 1-MCP-treated and untreated fruit and leaves of cultivar 'Orin' and 'Fuji' apples. MdERS1 and MdERS2 transcription increased rapidly after harvest in control fruit, but in 1-MCP-treated fruit, increases were delayed for 30 days. However, MdERS1 and MdERS2 protein levels behaved differently. MdERS1 decreased gradually in both the control and 1-MCP treatments. MdERS2, however, increased gradually in control 'Fuji' and remained steady in 1-MCP-treated 'Fuji' but remained low in 'Orin'. Exogenous ethylene treatment of fruit increased MdERS1 and MdERS2 expression with slightly decreased protein levels. The ratios of proteins to mRNAs were much lower in 'Orin' fruit, and they decreased with ethylene treatment in both cultivars. However, protein to transcript ratio was higher in 'Fuji' ethylene treated fruit than in air- and ethylene-treated 'Orin' fruit. MdERS1 and MdERS2 transcript levels were increased by exogenous ethylene treatment in air pre-treated leaves, but MdERS1 and MdERS2 protein levels did not change or decrease with ethylene treatment, and the ratio of protein to mRNA was lower in ethylene-treated leaves. Differences between transcription and protein levels may be due to receptor turnover differences in the presence or absence of ethylene. Furthermore, MdERS1 and MdERS2 protein stabilities in the presence of ethylene were different in the two cvs. 'Orin' and 'Fuji'. 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3acultivars 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3aapples 3afruits 3ashelf life 3atranscription (genetics) 3aair 3aripening 3areceptors 3aleaves 2aCyclopropanesxpharmacology 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFood Handling 2aFruitxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aMalusxgenetics 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgenetics 0aproteins1 aHayama, Hiroko1 aNakamura, Yuri0 tPlanta.g2009 July, v. 230, no. 2 p.407-417dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0953-z 7aarticle03472naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245016700170300001600337500002400353520232200377650002702699650002002726650001102746650001102757650001402768650001802782650001502800650001702815650001502832650000902847650002102856650001002877651001102887700002302898773010102921852000903022856005503031655001203086IND4456741920221118063350.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445674192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01805.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidaka, Amane10aAllocation of foliar phosphorus fractions and leaf traits of tropical tree species in response to decreased soil phosphorus availability on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo  ap. 849-857.  aIncludes references  a1. Foliar phosphorus (P) concentration is the sum of the concentrations of P fractions in cells, such as inorganic P and various P-containing biochemical compounds (e.g. nucleic acids, lipids and sugar phosphates). Plants generally reduce foliar P concentration and enhance P-use efficiency in response to low soil P availability. However, how plants allocate P among foliar P fractions to reduce foliar P concentration remains unclear. 2. We investigated foliar P fractions and leaf traits of 21 tropical tree species along a soil P availability gradient across three tropical montane rain forests on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. We chemically and sequentially fractionated foliar P into the following four fractions: structural P (i.e. phospholipids), metabolic P (collectively including Pi, ATP and sugar phosphates), nucleic acid P and residual P (phosphoproteins and unidentified residue). 3. With decreasing soil P availability, foliar P concentration decreased and leaf mass per area (LMA) increased. The reduction in foliar P concentration strongly correlated with the reduction in the concentrations of both metabolic P and nucleic acid P. Although increased LMA implies an increased allocation to structural tissues, there was no trade-off in P allocation between metabolic P and structural P with increasing LMA. This suggests that tropical tree species on P-poor soils increase the toughness of leaves (i.e. prolonged leaf life span) and also maintain high photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) without increasing the cost of P for structural tissues. 4. Phosphorus resorption efficiency increased with decreasing soil P availability. The amount of P resorbed before leaf abscission on P-poor soils exceeded that of metabolic P. This suggests that tropical tree species achieve the high P resorption efficiency by withdrawing immobile fractions (i.e. nucleic acid P and structural P) in addition to metabolic P. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that tree species on P-poor soils reduce the demand for foliar P by reducing concentrations of both metabolic P and nucleic acid P, which may potentially limit growth and productivity. However, these tree species can maintain high whole-plant P-use efficiency, because such responses in foliar P fractions do not decrease PPUE, leaf life span and P resorption efficiency. 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aleaf abscission 3aleaves 3alipids 3alongevity 3anucleic acids 3aphosphorus 3arain forests 3aresorption 3asoil 3asugar phosphates 3atrees 3aBorneo1 aKitayama, Kanehiro0 tjournal of ecology.g2011 May, v. 99, no. 3 p.849-857dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01805.x 7aarticle02910naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009000190300001800280500002400298520116800322650001201490650005101502650002201553650002601575650002301601650001101624650002401635650004401659650001601703650001601719650002501735650000901760650001101769650006701780650003401847650004701881650002901928650003001957650001901987650005102006650002202057650003602079700002302115700001902138700001902157700001702176773011102193852000902304856005502313655001202368IND4391439720221118063214.0070521e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439143972DNAL7 a175044882pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01270.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirou, Amélie10aGrowth promotion of quorum-quenching bacteria in the rhizosphere of Solanum tuberosum  ap. 1511-1522.  aIncludes references  aAmong 17 molecules structurally related to N-acylhomoserine lactone (NAHL), gamma-caprolactone (GCL), 6-caprolactone (6CL) and 4-heptanolide (HTN) were found to stimulate the degradation of NAHL by bacterial communities recovered from bulk and rhizospheric soils. In the 6CL-, GCL- and HTN-treated bacterial consortia, the NAHL-degrading bacteria were more abundant than in control (mannitol-treated) consortia. Moreover, the GCL- and HTN-consortia showed a biocontrol activity against Pectobacterium atrosepticum in soft rot assays with tubers of Solanum tuberosum. When GCL was applied to hydroponic cultures of S. tuberosum, a significant increase of the ratio of NAHL-degrading bacteria among total cultivable bacteria was observed in several independent experiments. Most of these bacteria, the growth of which was stimulated by GCL amendment, were also able to use GCL as a sole carbon source. They belong to the Rhodococcus and Delftia genera. DGGE analysis revealed that GCL treatments affected the structure of bacterial communities. This work highlights the possibility to manage the NAHL-degrading bacteria in a complex environment such as rhizosphere. 3aDelftia 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abacterial communities 3abiological control 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3ahydroponics 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asoil 3atubers 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDelftiaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aQuorum Sensing 2aRhodococcusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSolanum tuberosumxmicrobiology1 aDiallo, Stéphanie1 aKurt, Caroline1 aLatour, Xavier1 aFaure, Denis0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.1511-1522dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01270.x 7aarticle03765naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245011300199300001800312500002400330506007600354520165100430506003702081650000802118650002302126650002802149650001302177650002102190650001402211650001502225650001402240650001002254650002002264650001902284650001702303650001902320650001302339650003002352650001502382650003702397650000902434650001302443650001402456651001502470651001802485700002602503700001802529700001802547700001802565700002302583700001702606700001902623700001502642700002102657700001702678700002502695700001502720700001702735700002102752700002402773700002102797773013602818852000902954856008002963655001203043IND4426559820221207143659.0090925e20091001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442655982DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00266-092doi7 aPMC27530692pmcid7 a196841672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Munirul10aSerogroup, Virulence, and Genetic Traits of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the Estuarine Ecosystem of Bangladesh  ap. 6268-6274.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aForty-two strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were isolated from Bay of Bengal estuaries and, with two clinical strains, analyzed for virulence, phenotypic, and molecular traits. Serological analysis indicated O8, O3, O1, and K21 to be the major O and K serogroups, respectively, and O8:K21, O1:KUT, and O3:KUT to be predominant. The K antigen(s) was untypeable, and pandemic serogroup O3:K6 was not detected. The presence of genes toxR and tlh were confirmed by PCR in all but two strains, which also lacked toxR. A total of 18 (41%) strains possessed the virulence gene encoding thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH), and one had the TDH-related hemolysin (trh) gene, but not tdh. Ten (23%) strains exhibited Kanagawa phenomenon that surrogates virulence, of which six, including the two clinical strains, possessed tdh. Of the 18 tdh-positive strains, 17 (94%), including the two clinical strains, had the seromarker O8:K21, one was O9:KUT, and the single trh-positive strain was O1:KUT. None had the group-specific or ORF8 pandemic marker gene. DNA fingerprinting employing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SfiI-digested DNA and cluster analysis showed divergence among the strains. Dendrograms constructed using PFGE (SfiI) images from a soft database, including those of pandemic and nonpandemic strains of diverse geographic origin, however, showed that local strains formed a cluster, i.e., "clonal cluster," as did pandemic strains of diverse origin. The demonstrated prevalence of tdh-positive and diarrheagenic serogroup O8:K21 strains in coastal villages of Bangladesh indicates a significant human health risk for inhabitants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aantigens 3acluster analysis 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic traits 3ahuman health 3aimage analysis 3apandemic 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprovenance 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arisk 3avillages 3avirulence 3aBangladesh 3aBay of Bengal1 aChowdhury, Wasimul B.1 aBhuiyan, N.A.1 aIslam, Atiqul1 aHasan, Nur A.1 aNair, G.

The most important parameter affecting area designated as forest is the minimum crown density which can be set between 10 and 30 percent. The choice will have implications for the amount of land available in a country for afforestation and reforestation (A/R) activities within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In this paper, we used GIS analysis to look at four case studies from countries involved in the EU-funded ENCOFOR project: Bolivia, Ecuador, Uganda and Kenya. We also looked at the effects of other factors that would exclude land from eligibility for A/R projects. A low threshold of 10 percent crown cover resulted in exclusion of 70 to 90 percent of the land area of all countries except Kenya, which differed from the other countries by its large dryland areas. Much less area was excluded when higher thresholds were used. The spatial analyses showed not only the effects of the choice of the crown cover criterion, but also where the land was available for CDM activities within each country at different thresholds. This is the first time that the effect of the crown cover element of the Kyoto forest definition on land availability and distribution for CDM A/R activities has been quantified. While there are a number of reasons to choose different thresholds, this analysis suggests that countries that are considering using CDM finance for rural development might want to select the higher minimum threshold for crown cover in order to maximize their participation and flexibility. 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3afinance 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3alatitude 3areforestation 3arural development 3aBolivia 3aEcuador 3aKenya 3aUganda1 aZomer, Robert1 aStraaten, Oliver Van1 aMuys, Bart0 tClimatic change.g2007 Apr., v. 81, no. 3-4 p.415-430dKluwer Academic Publishersx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-006-9111-9 7aarticle02126naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245010100171300001600272500002400288520101900312650002201331650000901353650003001362650001001392650001201402650002301414650001301437650002601450650002401476650001901500650001801519650001001537651001301547700001901560773010001579852000901679856005201688655001201740IND4463219520221118063415.0120514e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446321952DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00015-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuchagata, Marcia10aCows, colonists and trees: rethinking cattle and environmental degradation in Brazilian Amazonia  ap. 797-816.  aIncludes references  aThis paper examines the role of cattle production in the evolution of smallholder farming systems in a frontier region of Brazilian Amazonia. There are many incentives for smallholders to raise cattle, but the success of cattle enterprises depends on a number of factors, both endogenous and exogenous to individual farms. A key factor in the intensification of cattle production is pasture management. We identify three models of pasture management, reflecting different levels of specialisation and intensification of production systems. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings indicate that pasture quality and degradation are related to under-utilisation and low stocking rates. This suggests that more intensive systems may be more ecologically sustainable in some contexts. However sustainable intensification strategies, which could potentially contribute to frontier stabilisation, depend on investment in infrastructure, markets and social capital beyond the capacity of individual farms or farmers. 3acattle production 3acows 3aenvironmental degradation 3afarms 3amarkets 3apasture management 3apastures 3aproduction technology 3asmall-scale farming 3asocial capital 3astocking rate 3atrees 3aAmazonia1 aBrown, Katrina0 tAgricultural systems.g2003 June, v. 76, no. 3 p.797-816dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00015-X 7aarticle03491naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245010000202300001600302500002400318500001500342506007600357520157600433506003702009650002502046650002602071650001402097650001402111650001402125650002502139650002002164650001502184650001202199650001102211650006102222650004802283650003002331650001502361650003402376650003002410650002902440650002602469650001402495650001402509650003302523650004902556650002702605653001302632653001202645653001202657700001702669773011302686852000902799856008102808655001202889IND4415958820221207141728.0090206e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441595882DNAL7 a190918732pmid7 aPMC26338342pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1325972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandaokar, Ajin10aMYB108 Acts Together with MYB24 to Regulate Jasmonate-Mediated Stamen Maturation in Arabidopsis  ap. 851-862.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), jasmonate is a key signal required for stamen and pollen maturation and thus for male fertility. Using transcriptional profiling, we have previously identified a set of 13 transcription factors that are proposed to be involved in controlling jasmonate responses in stamens. This finding suggests that a transcriptional cascade regulates the many developmental and biochemical pathways required to ensure fertility; however, the organization of this cascade is currently not understood. Here, we provide a genetic characterization of the role of MYB108 and map its relationship to MYB21 and MYB24, two other transcription factors involved in the jasmonate response in Arabidopsis stamens. Transcriptional profiling and analysis of plants expressing a MYB108:GUS fusion protein demonstrated that MYB108 expression is largely confined to sporophytic tissues of the stamen. Three allelic myb108 mutants exhibited reduced male fertility that was associated with delayed anther dehiscence, reduced pollen viability, and decreased fecundity relative to wild type. These phenotypes were all found to be exacerbated in myb108 myb24 double mutants, which also had shorter stamen filaments. Measurements of MYB108 transcript levels in wild-type and mutant flowers showed that expression of this gene is strongly dependent on MYB21. Taken together, our results indicate that MYB108 and MYB24 have overlapping functions and act downstream of MYB21 in a transcriptional cascade that mediates stamen and pollen maturation in response to jasmonate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aviability 3aphenotype 3afecundity 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3adehiscence 3amutants 3apollen 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDNA Damage 2aFlowersxgrowth & development 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPollenxgrowth & development 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aproteins 0aanthers 0astamens1 aBrowse, John0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 149, no. 2 p.851-862dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1325973Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03097naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245006600170300001600236520162900252650002601881650001801907650001601925650002101941650001301962650002001975650002201995650002302017650002102040650002102061650002102082650001202103650001302115650001902128650002302147650001402170650001102184651001602195653002502211653002102236700001702257700001502274700001702289700001602306773011202322852000902434856009202443930003302535946001102568655001202579IND4423548320221118063230.0090724e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442354832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2009.02021.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReglinski, T.10aManagement of phytophthora root rot in radiata pine seedlings  ap. 723-730.  aChemical and biological agents were evaluated for their ability to suppress root rot, caused by Phytophthora cactorum, in field-grown radiata pine seedlings in New Zealand. Trials were conducted over two seasons in an area of a forest nursery with a natural infestation of P. cactorum, and a history of root rot. In each season, symptoms of root rot developed during April, one month after root pruning, when seedlings were approximately six months old. In trial one, root rot incidence by mid July 2007 was 9·1% in untreated plots and 8·4% in plots that had been treated with metalaxyl-M/mancozeb (14 kg ha⁻¹) at seedling emergence. Disease incidence was lowest (2·1%) in plots that received seven monthly applications of phosphorous acid (6·5 L ha⁻¹). Other treatments, including seed coating with thiram or Trichoderma spp., and foliar applications of methyl jasmonate, did not control disease. In trial two, effects of treatment timing relative to root pruning were investigated. By late June 2008, three months after root pruning, root rot incidence was 22·2% in the untreated plots. Phosphorous acid was the most effective treatment and almost completely suppressed disease (0·1% incidence) when applied fortnightly from February until May (seven applications). Metalaxyl-M/mancozeb (15 kg ha⁻¹) was not effective (21·4% incidence) when applied five months before root pruning. However, disease incidence was reduced when the chemical was applied one week after root pruning (14·9% incidence) and greater control was achieved (8·2% incidence) when the application rate was increased to 50 kg ha⁻¹. 3aPhytophthora cactorum 3aPinus radiata 3aTrichoderma 3aapplication rate 3acoatings 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3afoliar application 3aforest nurseries 3amethyl jasmonate 3aphosphorous acid 3apruning 3aroot rot 3aseed dressings 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3athiram 3aNew Zealand 0ametalaxyl-M/mancozeb 0aphosphorous acid1 aSpiers, T.M.1 aDick, M.A.1 aTaylor, J.T.1 aGardner, J.0 tPlant pathology.g2009 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.723-730dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2009.02021.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009300188300001600281520117000297650001501467650000901482650003301491650003301524650004901557650004901606650003101655650003801686650003501724653002201759653002601781653002101807700001301828700001501841773010601856852000901962856009201971930003302063946001102096655001202107IND4423542620221118063151.0090724e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442354262DNAL7 a196599122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03199.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJEONG, M.-R.10aOverlapping nuclei segmentation based on Bayesian networks and stepwise merging strategy  ap. 188-198.  aThis paper presents a new approach to the segmentation of fluorescence in situ hybridization images. First, to segment the cell nuclei from the background, a threshold is estimated using a Gaussian mixture model and maximizing the likelihood function of the grey values for the cell images. After the nuclei segmentation, the overlapping and isolated nuclei are classified to facilitate a more accurate nuclei analysis. To do this, the morphological features of the nuclei, such their compactness, smoothness and moments, are extracted from training data to generate three probability distribution functions that are then applied to a Bayesian network as evidence. Following the nuclei classification, the overlapping nuclei are segmented into isolated nuclei using an intensity gradient transform and watershed algorithm. A new stepwise merging strategy is also proposed to merge fragments into a major nucleus. Experimental results using fluorescence in situ hybridization images confirm that the proposed system produced better segmentation results when compared to previous methods, because of the nuclei classification before separating the overlapping nuclei. 3awatersheds 3afish 2aCell Nucleusxultrastructure 2aFluorescent Dyesxmetabolism 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxmethods 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescencexmethods 2aLeukocytesxultrastructure 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescencexmethods 2aStaining and Labelingxmethods 0aBayesian networks 0anuclei classification 0astepwise merging1 aKO, B.C.1 aNAM, J.-Y.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2009 Aug., v. 235, no. 2 p.188-198dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03199.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02144naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245010500176300001600281500002400297520124200321650001301563650002001576650004001596650002501636651001501661700002701676773009401703852000901797856004801806655001201854IND4414394620221118063138.0090102e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441439462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9627-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLund-Hansen, Lars Chresten10aParameterization of surface irradiance and primary production in Århus Bay, SW Kattegat, Baltic Sea  ap. 173-179.  aIncludes references  aThe aims of the present study were to develop a parameterization of a one-year-long observed PAR time-series, apply the PAR parameterization in a primary production relation, and compare calculated and observed time-series of primary production. The PAR parameterization was applied in the generally used relation for the primary production (P d): P d = a(BI ₀ Z ₀) + b with observed photic depth (Z ₀) and Chl-a concentrations (B). It was tested whether the PAR parameterization in combination with this simple relation for primary production was able to describe the actual measured primary production. The study is based on a one year long time-series of PAR, CTD-casts (n = 45), and primary production measurements (n = 24) from Århus Bay (56°09' N; 10°20' E), south west Kattegat. Results showed a high and positive correlation between observed and calculated primary production in the bay, as based on the present PAR parameterization combined with the simple primary production relation. The developed PAR parameterization, which calculates total daily surface irradiance per day (M photons m⁻² d⁻¹), can be applied in any ecological application taking into account that it was developed for the latitude of 56° N. 3alatitude 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aprimary productivity 3aBaltic Sea1 aSørensen, Helene Munk0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Mar., v. 620, no. 1 p.173-179dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9627-2 7aarticle03643naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245008700177300001800264500002400282520221200306650002502518650001102543650002402554650002602578650001302604650002302617650002202640650002102662650001502683650001802698650001302716650002602729650002402755650002402779650000902803650002202812650001702834650001302851651001302864700002302877700001502900700002102915700002002936700002202956773009502978852000903073856005503082655001203137IND4429843020221118063146.0091211e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442984302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05863.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, Jeffrey W.10aLocal and landscape correlates of non-native species invasion in restored wetlands  ap. 1031-1039.  aIncludes references  aVulnerability of natural communities to invasion by non-native plants has been linked to factors such as recent disturbance and high resource availability, suggesting that recently restored habitats may be especially invasible. Because non-native plants can interfere with restoration goals, monitoring programs should anticipate which sites are most susceptible to invasion and which species are likely to become problematic at a site. Restored sites of larger area and those with high rates of propagule input should have higher species richness of both natives and non-natives, leading to a positive correlation between the two. However, in restored wetlands, urbanization, riparian landscape settings, and nitrogen enrichment likely favor non-native relative to native species. We sampled 28 restored wetlands in Illinois, USA, modeled the responses of native richness, non-native richness and non-native cover to local and landscape predictors with linear regression, and modeled the presence/absence of 21 non-native species with logistic regressions. Unexpectedly, native and non-native richness were uncorrelated, suggesting different responses to environmental factors. Native richness declined with increasing available soil nitrogen and urbanization in the surrounding landscape. Non-native richness, the richness of non-natives relative to natives, and the likelihood of invasion by several individual invasive species decreased with increasing distance from the city of Chicago, likely in response to decreasing non-native propagule pressure. Total cover of non-natives, however, as well as cover by non-native Phalaris arundinacea, increased with nitrogen availability. Our results indicate that although non-native richness was better predicted by factors related to propagule pressure, non-native species dominance was more closely related to local abiotic factors. Non-native richness in restoration sites may be beyond the control of restoration practitioners, and furthermore, may be of limited relevance for conservation goals. In contrast, limiting the relative dominance of non-natives should be a restoration priority and may be achievable through management of nutrient availability. 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3acities 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient management 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3aurbanization 3awetlands 3aIllinois1 aPeralta, Ariane L.1 aSoni, Arun1 aBaldwin, Patrick1 aKent, Angela D.1 aEndress, Anton G.0 tEcography.g2009 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.1031-1039dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05863.x 7aarticle03886naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245009100189300001800280500002400298520220900322650001902531650002402550650001402574650002102588650002002609650000902629650001202638650002002650650001702670650001602687650002302703650002202726650001202748650001402760650004402774650001602818650001102834650002102845650002102866650001402887650001202901650001402913650001602927650001702943650003702960651002902997700002403026700002303050700002103073700002603094773011203120852000903232856005503241655001203296IND4460542120221118063201.0110729e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446054212DNAL7 a215178422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01850.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Sam B.10aRate of egg maturation in marine turtles exhibits ‘universal temperature dependence'  ap. 1034-1041.  aIncludes references  a1. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) predicts that, after correcting for body mass variation among organisms, the rates of most biological processes will vary as a universal function of temperature. However, empirical support for ‘universal temperature dependence' (UTD) is currently equivocal and based on studies of a limited number of traits. 2. In many ectothermic animals, the rate at which females produce mature eggs is temperature dependent and may be an important factor in determining the costs of reproduction. 3. We tested whether the rate of egg maturation in marine turtles varies with environmental temperature as predicted by MTE, using the time separating successive clutches of individual females to estimate the rate at which eggs are formed. We also assessed the phenotypic contribution to this rate, by using radio telemetry to make repeated measurements of interclutch intervals for individual green turtles (Chelonia mydas). 4. Rates of egg maturation increased with seasonally increasing water temperatures in radio-tracked green turtles, but were not repeatable for individual females, and did not vary according to maternal body size or reproductive investment (number and size of eggs produced). 5. Using a collated data set from several different populations and species of marine turtles, we then show that a single relationship with water temperature explains most of the variation in egg maturation rates, with a slope that is statistically indistinguishable from the UTD predicted by MTE. However, several alternative statistical models also described the relationship between temperature and egg maturation rates equally parsimoniously. 6. Our results offer novel support for the MTE's predicted UTD of biological rates, although the underlying mechanisms require further study. The strong temperature dependence of egg maturation combined with the apparently weak phenotypic contribution to this rate has interesting behavioural implications in ectothermic animals. We suggest that maternal thermoregulatory behaviour in marine turtles, and many other reptiles, is consistent with a strategy of adaptively increasing body temperatures to accelerate egg maturation. 3aChelonia mydas 3aambient temperature 3abody size 3abody temperature 3adata collection 3aeggs 3afemales 3aradio telemetry 3areproduction 3asea turtles 3astatistical models 3awater temperature 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aBody Temperature Regulationxphysiology 2aClutch Size 2aFemale 2aNesting Behavior 2aOvumxphysiology 2aPhenotype 2aSeasons 2aTelemetry 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aTurtlesxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aIslands of the Atlantic.1 aBlount, Jonathan D.1 aGodley, Brendan J.1 aWitt, Matthew J.1 aBroderick, Annette C.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 80, no. 5 p.1034-1041dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01850.x 7aarticle03310naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245014100208300001800349500002400367500001500391506007600406520179300482506003702275650002602312650001502338650002202353650001802375650001302393650001302406650001402419650002202433650001102455650001902466650002102485650002402506650002102530650002702551653001302578700002202591773013802613852000902751856008002760655001202840IND4442322820221207135615.0100910e20100915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444232282DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00484-102doi7 aPMC29374982pmcid7 a206754512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlebusch, Maximilian10aRequirement of the Nitrogen Starvation-Induced Protein Sll0783 for Polyhydroxybutyrate Accumulation in Synechocystis sp.

Therefore, cyanobacteria have developed multiple responses, which are controlled by transcription factor NtcA and the PII-signaling protein, to adapt to nitrogen deficiency. Transcriptional analyses of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 under nitrogen-deficient conditions revealed a highly induced gene (sll0783) which is annotated as encoding a conserved protein with an unknown function. This gene is part of a cluster of seven genes and has potential NtcA-binding sites in the upstream region. Homologues of this cluster occur in some unicellular, nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria and in several Alpha, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, as well as in some Gram-positive bacteria. Most of the heterotrophic bacteria harboring this gene cluster are able to fix nitrogen and to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), whereas of the cyanobacteria, only Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 can accumulate PHB. In this work, a Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 sll0783 gene knockout mutant is characterized. This mutant is unable to accumulate PHB, a carbon and energy storage compound. In contrast, the levels of the carbon storage compound glycogen and the PHB precursor acetyl coenzyme A were similar to those of the wild type, indicating that the PHB-deficient phenotype does not likely result from a global deficiency in carbon metabolism. A specific deficiency in PHB synthesis was implied by the fact that the mutant exhibits impaired PHB synthase activity during prolonged nitrogen starvation. However, the expression of PHB synthase-encoding genes was not strongly affected in the mutant, suggesting that the impaired PHB synthase activity observed depends on a posttranscriptional process in which the product of sll0783 is involved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3ametabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3aSynechocystis 3anitrogen 3aglycogen 3anutrients 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3acarbon 3agene targeting 3aknockout mutants 3apolyhydroxybutyrate 3amultigene family 3aGram-positive bacteria 0aproteins1 aForchhammer, Karl0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Sept. 15, v. 76, no. 18 p.6101-6107dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00484-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04896naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245012600169300001800295500002400313520355800337650002603895650002503921650001103946650001203957650002203969650002003991650001004011650001204021650002104033650001504054650001404069650001304083650001504096650000904111650001004120650001004130650001604140650001004156651001304166700002204179700002404201700001804225773011104243852000904354856005104363655001204414IND4431999820221118063136.0100129e20100220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443199982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClose, Dugald C.10aCan climate at the seed-source predict the success of eucalypts planted on sites that have been grazed for over 100 years  ap. 1025-1032.  aIncludes references  aMany regions of southern Australia exposed to broad-acre grazing are denuded of trees. Re-establishing trees in these landscapes is important for both environmental and economic reasons. We investigated whether climate at the site of origin of the seed can inform species selection for tree establishment on ex-pasture sites within agricultural landscapes. We established trials at four sites in the sheep and cattle grazing region of the Midlands of Tasmania at: ‘Woodland Park'; ‘Sorrel Springs'; ‘Inverel' and ‘Glen Morey' farms (long-term average rainfalls of 584, 520, 520, and 479mm, respectively). Eucalypt species were selected, based on high tolerance to frost and drought inferred from climate at the sites of origin and based on the limited scientific literature available, from across Tasmania and mainland Australia. We investigated the mortality, health and height growth of 18 eucalypt species three months, one and six years after planting. Climatic data from the site of origin of the seed of these species was used to group species into categories of mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall at seed-source. Sensitivity of species to environment was investigated and compared using modified joint regression. At three planting sites, Woodland Park, Sorrel Springs (except health of the temperature category comparison at six years) and Inverel, we found significantly greater height and health one and six years after planting for local (Tasmanian) compared to non-local (Australian mainland) species, and for species where the site of origin of seed was categorised as low or medium mean annual temperature compared with those categorised as high mean annual temperature. There were no significant differences in mortality for these comparisons. At Glen Morey, height was significantly greater at six years after planting of local compared to non-local species and of species from low and medium mean annual temperature categories compared with the high mean annual temperature category. Mortality was significantly greater in local than non-local species six years after planting. Health was not significantly different for these comparisons. Differences in height, health or mortality of species categorised into mean annual rainfall at seed-source were largely non-significant at all sites one and six years after planting. A study of the sensitivity of species to environment of planting indicated that Tasmanian species were less sensitive than mainland species when height data was compared. When health data was compared, species with a site of origin of seed categorised as low rainfall were less sensitive to environment than species categorised as medium and high-mean rainfall. When mortality data was used significant differences were identified in the sensitivity of species to planting environment but this was not related to locality, mean annual temperature or rainfall at seed-source. Species that attained above average height and low mortality across three or more sites included Eucalyptus pulchella, Eucalyptus perineana (Tasmanian species), and Eucalyptus microcarpa, Eucalyptus benthamii and Eucalyptus melliodora (mainland species). Whilst temperature (and to a lesser extent rainfall) at seed-source is a good indicator of the success of tree establishment, high variability between sites points to the need to consider climate, browsing pressure and farm management at the paddock-scale when planning revegetation plantings. This has important implications for carbon sequestration plantings. 3aEucalyptus melliodora 3acarbon sequestration 3acattle 3aclimate 3adrought tolerance 3afarm management 3afarms 3agrazing 3aland restoration 3alandscapes 3amortality 3aplanting 3aprediction 3arain 3aseeds 3asheep 3atemperature 3atrees 3aTasmania1 aDavidson, Neil J.1 aChurchill, Keith C.1 aCorkrey, Ross0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Feb. 20, v. 259, no. 5 p.1025-1032dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.12.010 7aarticle03182naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245008500148300001400233500002400247520153100271650001001802650001501812650000901827650001501836650001201851650001401863650001501877650002601892650001901918650002101937650001801958650001501976650001001991650001202001650009102013650002102104650002402125650002202149650002102171650003302192650008102225650004202306650000902348650002102357650002702378700001602405700001502421700001402436700001402450700001702464773012602481852000902607655001202616IND4463184420221118063206.0120510e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446318442DNAL7 a149959622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbarellos, G.10aMultiple once-daily dose pharmacokinetics and renal safety of gentamicin in dogs  ap. 21-25.  aIncludes references  aIn this study the pharmacokinetics and renal safety of gentamicin in healthy dogs was investigated after multiple dosing. Six adult male dogs received once-daily gentamicin (6 mg/kg) intramuscularly for 5 days. Serial blood samples were taken on days 1 and 5 of treatment, and at predose, 1 and 6 h on days 2, 3 and 4. Urinalysis, hematology and serum biochemistry evaluation were carried out before, 7 and 14 days after the first gentamicin administration. Mean value of the main pharmacokinetic parameters were: AUC (μg·h/mL), 97.4 and 100.2; terminal half-life (harmonic mean), 0.76 and 1.01 h; ClB/F (mL/min·kg), 1.24 and 1.10; VD(area)/F (L/kg), 0.084 and 0.10; MRT (h), 1.48 and 1.77; C(max) (μg/mL), 54.5 and 49.2; t(max) (h), 0.40 and 0.48 for the first and last dose, respectively. Accumulation was determined as R1 = 0.97 and R2 = 1.22. Mean trough gentamicin serum concentrations were 0.06, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1 and 0.1 μg/mL for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth dose, respectively. Statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) were found for last dose MRT and fourth and fifth trough gentamicin serum concentrations. Laboratory tests detected a slight increase in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations (one dog), decreased specific urine gravity (one dog) and presence of few granular casts (two dogs). It is concluded that once-daily administration of gentamicin may provide adequate serum levels to treat most susceptible gram-negative infections with little or no nephrotoxicity in dogs. 3ablood 3acreatinine 3adogs 3agentamicin 3agravity 3ahalf life 3ahematology 3alaboratory techniques 3anephrotoxicity 3apharmacokinetics 3aurea nitrogen 3aurinalysis 3aurine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCreatininexblood 2aDogsxmetabolism 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aGentamicinsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aMale 2aSpecific Gravity 2aUrinalysisxveterinary1 aMontoya, L.1 aAmbros, L.1 aKreil, V.1 aHallu, R.1 aRebuelto, M.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2004 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.21-25dBlackwell Sciencex0140-77837nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245018600185300001600371500002400387520086100411650001601272650001301288650001001301650001501311650001501326650001201341650001301353650001401366650001401380650001401394650005201408650002401460650003901484650006301523650004701586650001801633650002801651650003701679650004901716650002101765650006101786650002201847650002801869650001301897650001401910650005901924650003201983650003402015700002102049700001702070700002302087773010302110852000902213856004802222655001202270IND4422141020221118063536.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442214102DNAL7 a194125712pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-009-9489-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenner, Eric D.12aA mutation in the Proteosomal Regulatory Particle AAA-ATPase-3 in Arabidopsis impairs the light-specific hypocotyl elongation response elicited by a glutamate receptor agonist, BMAA  ap. 523-533.  aIncludes references  aBMAA is a cycad-derived glutamate receptor agonist that causes a two- to three-fold increase in hypocotyl elongation on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the light. To probe the role of plant glutamate receptors and their downstream mediators, we utilized a previously described genetic screen to identify a novel, BMAA insensitive morphology (bim) mutant, bim409. The normal BMAA-induced hypocotyl elongation response observed on wild-type seedlings grown in the light is impaired in the bim409 mutant. This BMAA-induced phenotype is light-specific, as the bim409 mutant exhibits normal hypocotyl elongation in etiolated (dark grown) plants (+ or - BMAA). The mutation in bim409 was identified to be in a gene encoding the Proteosomal Regulatory Particle AAA-ATPase-3 (RPT3). Possible roles of the proteosome in Glu-mediated signaling in plants is discussed. 3aArabidopsis 3aagonists 3agenes 3aglutamates 3ahypocotyls 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3aseedlings 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acids, Diaminoxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sitesxgenetics 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Agonistsxpharmacology 2aGenes, Recessive 2aHypocotylxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aFeinberg, Philip1 aRunko, Suzan1 aCoruzzi, Gloria M.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2009 July, v. 70, no. 5 p.523-533dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-009-9489-7 7aarticle04527naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001400160245017700174300001800351500002400369520197200393650002202365650001802387650001902405650001502424650001202439650001302451650001302464650002002477650001002497650002102507650002102528650001702549650001902566650002802585650001402613650002002627650002102647650002502668650001202693650003102705650001702736650003702753650002702790650001302817650003802830650001602868650003602884650005002920650002102970650002102991650002703012650005403039650006103093650004003154650005503194650003203249650003703281650004903318650006103367650002703428650002203455700001803477700001803495700001903513700002003532773011503552852000903667856008103676655001203757IND4413423620221118063541.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441342362DNAL7 a189459332pmid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1268132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lijun10aTranscriptional Modulation of Ethylene Response Factor Protein JERF3 in the Oxidative Stress Response Enhances Tolerance of Tobacco Seedlings to Salt, Drought, and Freezing  ap. 1953-1963.  aIncludes references  aAbiotic stresses such as drought, cold, and salinity affect normal growth and development in plants. The production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative stress under these abiotic conditions. Recent research has elucidated the significant role of ethylene response factor (ERF) proteins in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. Our earlier functional analysis of an ERF protein, JERF3, indicated that JERF3-expressing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) adapts better to salinity in vitro. This article extends that study by showing that transcriptional regulation of JERF3 in the oxidative stress response modulates the increased tolerance to abiotic stresses. First, we confirm that JERF3-expressing tobacco enhances adaptation to drought, freezing, and osmotic stress during germination and seedling development. Then we demonstrate that JERF3-expressing tobacco imparts not only higher expression of osmotic stress genes compared to wild-type tobacco, but also the activation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation/metabolism and oxidative genes. More importantly, this regulation of the expression of oxidative genes subsequently enhances the activities of superoxide dismutase but reduces the content of ROS in tobacco under drought, cold, salt, and abscisic acid treatments. This indicates that JERF3 also modulates the abiotic stress response via the regulation of the oxidative stress response. Further assays indicate that JERF3 activates the expression of reporter genes driven by the osmotic-responsive GCC box, DRE, and CE1 and by oxidative-responsive as-1 in transient assays, suggesting the transcriptional activation of JERF3 in the expression of genes involved in response to oxidative and osmotic stress. Our results therefore establish that JERF3 activates the expression of such genes through transcription, resulting in decreased accumulation of ROS and, in turn, enhanced adaptation to drought, freezing, and salt in tobacco. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabscisic acid 3aacid treatment 3aaerobiosis 3adrought 3aethylene 3afreezing 3agene expression 3agenes 3aoxidative stress 3aplant adaptation 3aplant growth 3aplant proteins 3areactive oxygen species 3aseedlings 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3atranscriptional activation 3awater stress 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aAmitrolexpharmacology 2aFreezing 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGermination 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aOxidative Stress 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aZhang, Zhijin1 aZhang, Haiwen1 aWang, Xue-Chen1 aHuang, Rongfeng0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Dec., v. 148, no. 4 p.1953-1963dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1268133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03325naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001200133245016000145300001800305300002600323520180700349650001302156650002602169650002702195650001402222650001702236650002202253650000902275650000802284650002402292650001502316650001002331650005402341650001002395650003402405650001802439650001502457650001102472650000902483650005002492650002102542651001002563651001002573653002502583700001502608700001502623773008202638852000902720939003302729945000802762946001302770655001202783991631603130742620221118063450.0900201e198909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900001712DNAL7 a27952462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Y.10aBiochemical studies of a selenium-deficient population in China: measurement of selenium, glutathione peroxidase and other oxidant defense indices in blood  ap. 1318-1326.  ap. 1318-1326. charts.  aSelenium deficiency is necessary for the development of the cariomyopathy known as Keshan disease. Healthy boys and men (19-22 per group) from a low selenium area (Dechang County) and from an area where sodium selenite was added to salt (Mianning County) were studied. Keshan disease was endemic in Dechang but occurred rarely in Mianning. After an initial blood sampling, each subject received daily selenium supplements (100 microgram selenium for boys and 200 micrograms for men) as sodium selenate for 14 d. Blood was sampled again at 7 and 14 d. Boys from Dechang had blood selenium levels similar to levels reported for patients with Keshan disease. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity in boys and men from Dechang was 33 and 43%, respectively, of values from the corresponding groups in Mianning. Comparison of plasma selenium concentrations in boys and men from Dechang gave values of 33 and 38%, respectively, of the corresponding groups in Mianning. Selenium status did not affect red blood cell superoxide dismutase or catalase activities. Plasma vitamin E concentration was below the normal range in all groups but was unaffected by selenium status. Measurements of plasma malondialdehyde revealed no difference between subjects from Dechang and subjects from Mianning. Selenium supplementation raised plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and plasma selenium concentration in all groups. Groups with higher plasma selenium concentration had relatively smaller increases in glutathione peroxidase activity than in selenium concentration. These results characterize the selenium deficiency in subjects at risk for developing Keshan disease. The results obtained with supplementation of selenium indicate the presence of additional plasma forms of selenium besides glutathione peroxidase. 3aselenium 3anutrient deficiencies 3aglutathione peroxidase 3avitamin E 3ablood plasma 3ablood composition 3aboys 3amen 3adietary supplements 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCardiomyopathiesxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aChild 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexblood 2aHealth Status 2aHematocrit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSeleniumxbloodxdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin Exblood 3aChina 0aChina 0aselenium supplements1 aHill, K.E.1 aBurk, R.F.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Sept., v. 119, no. 9 p.1318-1326x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02616naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008500151300001800236300002600254520122900280650002001509650000901529650002601538650001401564650001001578650002401588650002301612650001201635650002001647650002501667650002101692650001101713650001101724650001101735650001601746650002601762650000901788650001601797650002401813650003501837650001801872700001801890700001801908700001501926773008201941852000902023939003302032945000802065946001302073655001202086991631602700742620221118063518.0900209e198911  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900002032DNAL7 a26006712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerfass, R.E.10aIntrinsic and extrinsic stable isotopic zinc absorption by infants from formulas  ap. 1661-1669.  ap. 1661-1669. charts.  aThe kinetics of fecal elimination and the extent of fractional absorption of intrinsic and extrinsic zinc from infant formula were studied in 11 human infants by using a direct, simultaneous dual-label method based on fecal monitoring of unabsorbed stable isotope labels. The relative positions of the two stable isotopic tags (67Zn, 70Zn) as extrinsic and intrinsic labels were reversed in two separate determinations of fractional absorption. Administration of doubly labeled formula for 24 h or less permitted elimination of unabsorbed labels before the end of a 72-h metabolic interval. The extent of enrichment and the kinetics of fecal elimination of unabsorbed extrinsic stable isotopic zinc tag were observed to agree closely with the corresponding values for the intrinsic tag. Fractional absorption of intrinsic and extrinsic tags was highly correlated and did not differ significantly. The ratio of fractional absorption of extrinsic tag to that of intrinsic tag was 1.05 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SD). The results constitute strong support for validation of the use of enriched stable isotopes at low levels (less than or equal to 10%) of extrinsic addition to milk-based diets for studies of zinc absorption by humans. 3ainfant formulas 3azinc 3aintestinal absorption 3aexcretion 3afeces 3amathematical models 3anutrition research 3ainfants 3abalance studies 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aFecesxanalysis. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Food 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aMathematics 2aRegression Analysis 2aZincxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aZinc Isotopes1 aZiegler, E.E.1 aEdwards, B.B.1 aHouk, R.S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Nov., v. 119, no. 11 p.1661-1669x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03066naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245007600173300001600249500001500265520185000280650001202130650001702142650001702159650001702176650001102193650001202204650001802216650003002234650001602264653002602280653001602306653001402322700002002336700001802356700001502374700001502389773006002404852000902464856007802473930003302551945001302584946001102597655001202608IND2059227420221118063458.0970828s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205922742DNAL7 a241936262pmid7 a10.1007/BF001977942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParry, A.D.10aAbscisic-acid metabolism in a wilty mutant of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia  ap. 237-243.  a2019-12-05  aA mutant of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, CKR1, isolated on the basis of its enhanced resistance to cytokinins was found to have a greater tendency to wilt than the wild type (Blonstein et al., 1991, Planta 183, 244-250). Further characterisation has shown that the wiltiness in the mutant is not caused by an insensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) because the external application of ABA leads to stomatal closure and phenotypic reversion. The basal ABA level in the mutant is < 20% of that in the wild type. Following stress, the ABA level in wild-type leaves increases by approx 9-to 10-fold while the mutant shows only a slight increase. This deficiency in ABA is unlikely to be the consequence of accelerated catabolism as the levels of two major metabolites of ABA, phaseic and dihydrophaseic acid, are also much reduced in the mutant. The qualitative and quantitative distributions of carotenoids, the presumed presursors of ABA, are the same for the leaves of both wild type and mutant. Biosynthesis of ABA at the C15 level was investigated by feeding xanthoxin (Xan) to detached leaves. Wild-type leaves convert between 9-19% of applied Xan to ABA while the mutant converts less than 1%. The basal level of trans-ABA-alcohol (t-ABA-alc) is 3-to 10-fold greater in the mutant and increases by a further 2.5- to 6.0-fold after stress. This indicates that the lesion in the wilty mutant of N. plumbaginfolia affects the conversion of ABA-aldehyde to ABA, as in the flacca and sitiens mutants of tomato and the droopy mutant of potato (Taylor et al., 1988, Plant Cell Environ. 11, 739-745; Duckham et al., 1989, J. Exp. Bot. 217, 901-905). Wild-type tomato and N. plumbaginifolia leaves can convert trans-Xan into t-ABA-alc, and Xan into ABA, while those of flacca and the wilty N. plumbaginifolia mutant convert both Xan and t-Xan to t-ABA-alc. 3awilting 3abiosynthesis 3axanthophylls 3awater stress 3aleaves 3amutants 3aabscisic acid 3aNicotiana plumbaginifolia 3ametabolites 0aplant-water relations 0acarotenoids 0axanthoxin1 aBlonstein, A.D.1 aBabiano, M.J.1 aKing, P.J.1 aHorgan, R.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 183, no. 2 p.237-243x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001977943Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02133naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500001500244520105600259650001601315650001401331650001701345650001401362650001601376650002401392650001701416650002001433653001701453653001701470653002201487700001701509700001401526700001501540700001401555700001601569773006001585852000901645930003301654945001301687946001101700655001201711IND2059228220221118063419.0970828s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205922822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofmann, E.10aPartial purification of sequestered particles of phytochrome from oat (Avena sativa L.) seedlings  ap. 265-273.  a2019-12-05  aSequestered particles of phytochrome (SAPs) were partially purified from red-light-irradiated oat coleoptiles. Phytochrome pelletability was enhanced by using buffers containing 10 mM Mg2+ or high concentrations (0.6-0.8 M) of orthophosphate (Pi). Combining the pelletability of phytochrome in the presence of Mg2+ with that in the presence of 0.6 Pi resulted in a strong enrichment (about 100-fold) of pelletable phytochrome. Antisera were raised against Mg2+-Pi-pellets from dark-grown seedlings. Using these antisera, no evidence was found by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry that SAPs contain major proteins other than phytochrome. The major contamination of these enriched SAP preparations consisted of protein crystals which are probably catalase. The preparations contained methyltransferase and protein-kinase activities which were not associated with SAPs. Phytochrome purified from SAPs served as a substrate for protein-kinase activity but not for the methyltransferase activity. Phytochrome itself did not show any kinase activity. 3acoleoptiles 3amagnesium 3aAvena sativa 3ared light 3aphytochrome 3aimmunocytochemistry 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 0apurification 0alocalization 0amethyltransferase1 aHarter, G.K.1 aGrimm, R.1 aHarter, K.1 aSpeth, V.1 aSchafer, E.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 183, no. 2 p.265-273x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02954naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245017300172300001600345500001500361520156300376650001901939650001601958650002101974650001701995650001702012650002202029650001202051650002302063650001702086650001902103650001602122650001102138653001402149653001602163653002502179653001102204653001102215653001002226700002002236773006002256852000902316856007802325930003302403945001302436946001102449655001202460IND2059225820221118063716.0970828s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205922582DNAL7 a241936182pmid7 a10.1007/BF001977862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornic, G.10aPartitioning of photosynthetic electron flow between CO2 and O2 reduction in a C3 leaf (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) at different CO2 concentrations and during drought stress  ap. 178-184.  a2019-12-05  aPhotosystem II chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf net gas exchanges (CO2 and H2O) were measured simultaneously on bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) submitted either to different ambient CO2 concentrations or to a drought stress. When leaves are under photorespiratory conditions, a simple fluorescence parameter delta F/Fm (B. Genty et al. 1989. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 990, 87-92; delta F = difference between maximum, Fm, and steady-state fluorescence emissions) allows the calculation of the total rate of photosynthetic electron-transport and the rate of electron transport to O2. These rates are in agreement with the measurements of leaf O2 absorption using (18)O2 and the kinetic properties of ribulose- 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase:oxygenase. The fluorescence parameter, delta F/Fm, showed that the allocation of photosynthetic electrons to O2 was increased during the desiccation of a leaf. Decreasing leaf net CO2 uptake, either by decreasing the ambient CO2 concentration or by dehydrating a leaf, had the same effect on the partitioning of photosynthetic electrons between CO2 and O2 reduction. It is concluded that the decline of net CO2 uptake of a leaf under drought stress is only due, at least for a mild reversible stress (causing at most a leaf water deficit of 35%), to stomatal closure which leads to a decrease in leaf internal CO2 concentration. Since, during the dehydration of a leaf, the calculated internal CO2 concentration remained constant or even increased we conclude that this calculation is misleading under such conditions. 3acarbon dioxide 3awater vapor 3aphotorespiration 3agas exchange 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3adrought 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3awater stress 3aphotosystem II 3achlorophyll 3aoxygen 0areduction 0adesiccation 0awater vapor movement 0auptake 0aefflux 0alight1 aBriantais, J.M.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 183, no. 2 p.178-184x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001977863Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03510naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245014400177300001600321500001500337520210000352650001602452650002002468650001802488650002002506650001502526650002502541650002202566650002002588650002002608650002202628650001102650650001102661650001402672650002502686650001902711650002002730653002602750653001902776700001702795773006002812852000902872856007802881930003302959945001302992946001103005655001203016IND2059227020221118063802.0970828s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205922702DNAL7 a241936242pmid7 a10.1007/BF001977922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgson, R.A.J.10aSuperoxide production by thylakoids during chilling and its implication in the susceptibility of plants to chilling-induced photoinhibition  ap. 222-228.  a2019-12-05  aFactors influencing the rate of superoxide (O2-) production by thylakoids were investigated to determine if increased production of the radical was related to injury induced by chilling at a moderate photon flux density (PFD). Plants used were Spinacia oleracea L., Cucumis sativus L. and Nerium oleander L. grown at either 20 degrees C or 45 degrees C. Superoxide production was determined by electron-spin-resonance spectroscopy of the O2--dependent rate of oxidation of 2-ethyl-1-hydroxy- 2,5,5-trimethyl-3-oxazolidine (OXANOH) to the corresponding oxazolidinoxyl radical, OXANO.. For all plants, the steady-state rate of O2- production by thylakoids, incubated at 25 degrees C and 350 micromols photon.m-2 s-1 (moderate PFD) with added ferredoxin and NADP, was between 7.5 and 12.5 micromols.(mg chlorophyll)-1 h-1. Incubation at 5 degrees and a moderate PFD, decreased the rate of O2- production 40% and 15% by thylakoids from S. oleracea and 20 degrees C-grown N. oleander, chilling-insensitive plants, but increased the rate by 56% and 5% by thylakoids from C. sativus and 45 degrees C-grown N. oleander, chilling-sensitive plants. For all plants, the addition of either ferredoxin or methyl viologen increased the rate of O2--production at 25 degrees C by 75-100%. With these electron acceptors, lowering the temperature to 5 degrees C caused only a slight decrease in O2 production. In the absence of added electron acceptors. thylakoids produced O2- at a rate which was about 45% greater than that when ferredoxin and NADP were present. The addition of 3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea reduced O2- production under all conditions tested. The results show that the rate of O2- production increases in thylakoids when the rate of electron transfer to NADP is reduced. This could explain differences in the susceptibility of thylakoids from chilling-sensitive and chilling-insensitive plants to chilling at a moderate PFD and is consistent with the proposal that O2- production is involved in the injury leading to the inhibition of photosynthesis induced under these conditions. 3atemperature 3achilling injury 3afree radicals 3aCucumis sativus 3athylakoids 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotoinhibition 3alight intensity 3aelectron transfer 3aanions 3aoxygen 3aoxidation 3ametabolic inhibitors 3acold tolerance 3aNerium oleander 0abiological resistance 0aphotosynthesis1 aRaison, J.K.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 183, no. 2 p.222-228x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001977923Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02053naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245011700149300001600266300002400282500001500306520045800321650002300779650003800802650003300840650003000873650001100903650002000914650002300934650001000957650002600967650001000993650002101003650003101024650004701055650001101102650002901113650002001142650004701162651001801209653002501227653002901252653002201281653002401303653002401327700001801351773007901369852000901448939003301457945000801490946001301498655001201511991631601520742620221118063641.0910326e199101  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910007212DNAL7 a19920522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, V.R.10aProtein evaluation, amino acid scoring and the food and drug administration's proposed food labeling regulations  ap. 145-150.  ap. 145-150. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThis article questions the Food and Drug Administration's proposed methods for determining protein quality for labeling purposes which use casein as a reference protein, and the Protein Efficiency Ration (PER).

Maris Huntsman) grown at 20 degrees C under long days the reduced-height genes, Rht1 (semi-dwarf) and Rht3 (dwarf) reduced the rate of extension of leaf 2 by 12% and 52%, respectively, compared with corresponding rht (tall) lines. Lowering the growing temperature from 20 degrees to 10 degrees C reduced the rate of linear extension of leaf 2 by 2.5-fold (60% reduction) in the rht3 line but by only 1.6-fold (36% reduction) in the Rht3 line. For both genotypes, the duration of leaf expansion was greater at the lower temperature so that final leaf length was reduced by only 35% in the rht3 line and was similar in the Rht3 line at both temperatures. Seedlings of the rht3 (tall) line growing at 20 degrees C responded positively to root-applied gibberellin A1 (GA1) in the range 1-10 micromolar GA1; there was a linear increase in sheath length of leaf 1 whereas the Rht3 (dwarf) line remained unresponsive. Gibberellins A1, 3, 4, 8, 19, 20, 29, 34, 44 and 53 were identified by full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in aseptically grown 4-d-old shoots of the Rht3 line. In 12-d-old seedlings grown at 20 degrees C, there were fourfold and 24-fold increases in the concentration of GA1 in the leaf expansion zone of Rht1 and Rht3 lines, respectively, compared with corresponding rht lines. Although GA3 was present at a similar level to GA1 in the rht3 (tall) line it accumulated only fivefold in the Rht3 (dwarf) line. The steady-state pool sizes of endogenous GAs were GA19 > > GA20 = GA1 in the GA-responsive rht3 line whereas in the GA non-responsive Rht3 line the content of GA19 approximately GA20 < < < GA1. It is proposed that one It the consequences of GA1 action is suppression of GA19-oxidase activity such that the conversion of GA19 to GA20 becomes a rate-limiting step on the pathway to GA1 in GA-responsive lines. In the GA-non-responsive Rht lines it is suggested that GA19 oxidase is not down-regulated to the same extent and GA1 accumulates before the next rate-limiting step on the pathway, its 2 beta-hydroxylation to GA8. The steady-state pool sizes of GA19, 20, 1, 3 and 8 were similar in developmentally equivalent tissues of the rht3 (tall) line growing at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C despite a 2.5-fold difference in the rate of leaf expansion. In contrast, in the Rht3 (dwarf) line, the extent of accumulation of GA1 reflected the severity of the phenotype at the two temperatures with slower growing tissues accumulating less, not more, GA1. These results are interpreted as supporting the proposed model of regulation of the GA-biosynthetic pathway rather than previous suggestions that GA1 accumulates in GA-insensitive dwarfs as a consequence of reduced growth rates. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant development 3agibberellins 3aair temperature 3amutants 3agene expression 3adwarf cultivars 3aline differences 3aleaves 3aphotoperiod 3aalleles 3aseedlings 3agenotype 0aleaf sheaths 0agrowth rate 0agrowth1 aLenton, J.R.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 183, no. 2 p.229-236x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001977933Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03269naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002300157245008100180300001600261500001500277520210300292650001802395650001402413650001402427650001902441650001902460650001902479650001102498650002102509653001802530653001802548653001102566653002402577653001402601700001602615773006002631852000902691856007802700930003302778945001302811946001102824655001202835IND2060405420221118063701.0971104s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206040542DNAL7 a241941462pmid7 a10.1007/BF001953302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson-Beers, K.10aUltrastructure of and plasmodesmatal frequency in mature leaves of sugarcane  ap. 291-306.  a2019-12-05  aVascular bundles and contiguous tissues of leaf blades of sugarcane (Saccharum interspecific hybrid L62-96) were examined with light and transmission electron microscopes to determine their cellular composition and the frequency of plasmodesmata between the various cell combinations. The large vascular bundles typically are surrounded by two bundle sheaths, an outer chlorenchymatous bundle sheath and an inner mestome sheath. In addition to a chlorenchymatous bundle sheath, a partial mestome-sheath borders the phloem of the intermediate vascular bundles, and at least some mestome-sheath cells border the phloem of the small vascular bundles. Both the walls of the chlorenchymatous bundle-sheath cells and of the mestome-sheath cells possess suberin lamellae. The phloem of all small and intermediate vascular bundles contains both thick- and thin-walled sieve tubes. Only the thin-walled sieve tubes have companion cells, with which they are united symplastically by pore-plasmodesmata connections. Plasmodesmata are abundant at the Kranz mesophyll-cell-bundle-sheath-cell interface associated with all sized bundles. Plasmodesmata are also abundant at the bundle-sheath-cell-vascular-parenchyma cell- vascular-parenchyma-cell-vascular-parenchyma cells and mestome-sheath-cell-vascular-parenchyma cells interfaces in small and intermediate bundles. The thin-walled sieve tubes and companion cells of the large vascular bundles are symplastically isolated from all other cell types of the leaf. The same condition is essentially present in the sieve-tube-companion-cell complexes of the small and intermediate vascular bundles. Although few plasmodesmata connects either the thin-walled sieve tubes or their companion cells to the mestome sheath of small and intermediate bundles, plasmodesmata are somewhat more numerous between the companion cells and vascular-parenchyma cells. The thick-walled sieve tubes are united with vascular-parenchyma cells by pore-plasmodesmata connections. The vascular-parenchyma cells, in turn, have numerous plasmodesmatal connections with bundle-sheath cells. 3aplasmodesmata 3ahistology 3aSaccharum 3asieve elements 3acell membranes 3aultrastructure 3aleaves 3avascular bundles 0aplant tissues 0aplant anatomy 0aphloem 0acell ultrastructure 0ainterface1 aEvert, R.F.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 3 p.291-306x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001953303Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245018000124300001400304520151200318650002301830650001201853650002201865650001801887650002201905650001401927650001501941650001801956650001301974650001401987650001802001650001902019650001202038650001702050650001702067650001402084650002502098650002102123650001402144650001102158650003702169650002202206653001902228700001502247700001402262773005802276852000902334930003302343945001302376946001102389655001202400IND2059247620221118063357.0970829s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205924762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Z.H.10aLight-dependent pH changes in leaves of C3 plants. IV. Action spectra indicate indirect energization of proton transport into mesophyll vacuoles by cyclic photophorphorylation  ap. 30-34.  aAction spectra in the red region of the spectrum for light-dependent cytosolic alkalization in leaves of C3 plants which also received a low background of blue light differed from the action spectra for light-dependent vacuolar acidification. Light above 680 nm was less effective in supporting the cytosolic alkalization reaction than light below 680 nm. In contrast, in leaves illuminated in CO2-free air the light-dependent vacuolar acidification exhibited a maximum at or even above 700 nm. When photorespiratory carbohydrate oxidation was suppressed in low oxygen, a substantially changed action spectrum of the acidification reaction resembled in shape that of the cytosolic alkalization with the exception that it was extended towards the far-red. From the presented data and from previously published data (Yin et al., 1990b. Planta 182, 253-261: Yin et al., 1990c, Planta 182, 262-269) it is concluded that in the presence of a weak background of blue light, and in the absence of CO2 which drains electrons from the electron transport chain, cyclic photophosphorylation induced by far-red light permits increased export of dihydroxyacetone phosphate from the chloroplasts into the cytosol where its oxidation increases the cytosolic energy state giving rise to increased proton transport across the tonoplast. The data do not lend support to the view that export of malate from the chloroplasts and its oxidation in the mitochondria contribute significantly to cytosolic energization in the light. 3aPelargonium zonale 3aFuchsia 3aSpinacia oleracea 3ahydrogen ions 3auptake mechanisms 3ared light 3ablue light 3afar-red light 3avacuoles 3atonoplast 3aacidification 3aalkalinization 3acytosol 3achloroplasts 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aphotophosphorylation 3aphotorespiration 3acultivars 3aleaves 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aspectral analysis 0aproton pumping1 aSiebke, K.1 aHeber, U.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 1 p.30-34x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02395naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128300001400212520144300226650002201669650001501691650002101706650001901727650001101746650001101757650001501768650001601783650001201799653001601811653001501827653000901842653001101851653002301862773005801885852000901943930003301952945001301985946001101998655001202009IND2059252020221118063510.0970829s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205925202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutschera, U.10aOsmotic relations during elongation growth in hypocotyls of Helianthus annuus L  ap. 61-66.  aThe relationship between growth, change in cell osmotic pressure and accumulation of osmotic solutes was investigated in hypocotyls of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings. During growth in darkness the osmotic pressure decreased by 50% between days 2 and 6 after sowing. After irradiation of dark-grown seedlings with continuous white light (WL) an inhibition of hypocotyl growth was measured, but the osmotic pressure of the growing cells was not lower than in the dark-grown control. Growth in darkness and after WL irradiation was accompanied by an increase in the amount of osmotic substances (soluble sugars) which was proportional to the increase in length of the organ. During growth in continuous WL the cell osmotic pressure decreased by 45% between days 2 and 6 after sowing. The transfer of WL-grown seedlings to darkness ("re-etiolation") resulted in a rapid acceleration of hypocotyl growth, but the cell osmotic pressure was the same as that of the WL-grown control. Growth in continuous WL was accompanied by a corresponding accumulation of osmotic substances (soluble sugars). The transition from WL to darkness resulted in an enhanced accumulation of osmotica and an increase in cell-wall extensibility. The results indicate that the relative maintenance of cell osmotic pressure during rapid hypocotyl growth in darkness is caused by an enhanced accumulation of soluble sugars into the growing cells of the organ. 3aHelianthus annuus 3ahypocotyls 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmoregulation 3aturgor 3asugars 3acell walls 3awhite light 3asolutes 0astimulation 0ainhibition 0adark 0agrowth 0aphotomorphogenesis0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 1 p.61-66x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03381naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245006400145300001600209500001500225520177800240650002502018650001602043650001702059650001102076650001002087650001202097650001002109650006702119650005502186650001602241650004002257650003202297650002502329650001302354650007002367650007902437650004202516650003602558653001602594653001502610653001802625653002402643653001302667653001502680700001802695773006002713852000902773930003302782945001302815946001102828655001202839IND2060425720221118063545.0971105s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206042572DNAL7 a115406482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaether, N.10aGravitropism and starch statoliths in an Arabidopsis mutant  ap. 491-497.  a2019-12-05  aThe mutant TC7 of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. has been reported to be starch-free and still exhibit root gravitropism (T. Caspar and B. G. Pickard 1989, Planta 177, 185-197). This is not consistent with the hypothesis that plastic starch has a statolith function in gravity perception. In the present study, initial light microscopy using the same mutant showed apparently starch-free statocytes. However, ultrastructural examination detected residues of amyloplast starch grains in addition to the starch-depleted amyloplasts. Applying a point-counting morphometric method, the starch grains in the individual amyloplasts in the mutant were generally found to occupy more than 20% and in a few cases up to 60% of the amyloplast area. In the wild type (WT) the starch occupied on average 98% of the amyloplast area and appeared as densely packed grains. The amyloplasts occupied 13.9% of the area of the statocyte in the mutant and 23.3% of the statocyte area in the WT. Sedimentation of starch-depleted amyloplasts in the mutant was not detected after 40 min of inversion while in the WT the amyloplasts sedimented at a speed of 6 micrometers.h-1. The gravitropic reactivity and the curvature pattern were also examined in the WT and the mutant. The time-courses of root curvature in the WT and the mutant showed that when cultivated under standard conditions for 60 h in darkness, the curvatures were 83 degrees and 44 degrees, respectively, after 25 h of continuous stimulation in the horizontal position. The WT roots curved significantly more rapidly and with a more normal gravitropic pattern than those of the mutant. These results are discussed in relation to the results previously obtained with the mutant and with respect to the starch-statolith hypothesis. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamyloplasts 3agravitropism 3astarch 3acells 3amutants 3aroots 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aGravitation 2aGravitropismxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGravity Sensingxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMutation 2aPlant Root Capxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlastidsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aStarchxdeficiencyxphysiology. 0acomparisons 0aorganelles 0astarch grains 0acell ultrastructure 0aplastids 0astatocytes1 aIversen, T.H.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 4 p.491-497x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02080naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009000126300001600216500001500232520097200247650001401219650002101233650001601254650001701270650001601287650001501303650001301318650001901331650001401350650001301364650002001377650001201397650001001409650002801419650001101447653001401458700001801472700001801490773006001508852000901568930003301577945001301610946001101623655001201634IND2060424720221118063500.0971105s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206042472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeiners, S.10aPermeabilization of the plasmalemmma and wall of soybean root cells to macromolecules  ap. 443-447.  a2019-12-05  aA technique has been developed that results in the reversible permeabilization of the cell wall and plasmalemma of soybean (Glycine max (L.)

They are then coincubated in separate experiments with fluorescent-derivatized dextrans (20-70 kDa) or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G to ascertain the exclusion size of macromolecules capable of diffusing across the cell wall and plasmalemma into the cytoplasm. Following an incubation period of 30 min, it was observed by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy that all derivatized macromolecules tested (20-140 kDa) could be incorporated into the cytoplasm, but not into the vacuole. This procedure did not appear to affect cell viability adversely. A normal doubling time was observed for these cells following the permeabilization procedure. 3aviability 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aGlycine max 3apermeability 3afluorescein 3acell walls 3avacuoles 3acultured cells 3adiffusion 3asaponins 3aplasma membrane 3adextran 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3acallus 0acytoplasm1 aGharyal, P.K.1 aSchindler, M.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 4 p.443-447x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02190naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245014300173300001600316520087100332650001801203650002201221650001101243650002401254650001801278650002101296650001801317650002501335650002501360650004501385650002301430653001601453653002801469700001401497700001501511700001401526773006001540852000901600856007801609930003301687945001301720946001101733655001201744IND2060407320221118063640.0971104s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206040732DNAL7 a241941522pmid7 a10.1007/BF001953362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomoney, C.12aA developmentally regulated early-embryogenesis protein in pea (Pisum sativum L.) is related to the heat-shock protein (HSP70) gene family  ap. 350-355.  aA cDNA clone, pCD7, was shown to hybrid-select from developing seeds of Pisum sativum L. an mRNA that translated into a polypeptide of apparent Mr 90 000.

Hybridizations to P. sativum DNA identified polymorphisms in the genomic DNA corresponding to pCD7 and the segregation of these in selected crosses indicated the existence of at least two genetic loci, one of which mapped to an existing linkage group. 3aPisum sativum 3acomplementary DNA 3aclones 3aheat shock proteins 3aembryogenesis 3aseed development 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3alinkage (genetics) 0asegregation 0amolecular sequence data1 aEllis, N.1 aTurner, L.1 aCasey, R.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 3 p.350-355x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001953363Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02201naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245014200173300001600315500001500331520080500346650001901151650002201170650001401192650001901206650001601225650002401241650001601265650001201281650001201293650001901305650001401324650002101338650001101359650001801370653001801388653001501406653002001421700001801441700001501459700001701474773006001491852000901551856007801560930003301638945001301671946001101684655001201695IND2060407620221118063643.0971104s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206040762DNAL7 a241941532pmid7 a10.1007/BF001953372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFladung, M.10aCorrelated alterations in leaf and flower morphology and rate of leaf photosynthesis in a midribless (mbl) mutant of Panicum maximum Jacq  ap. 356-361.  a2019-12-05  aA midribless (mbl) mutant of Panicum maximum Jacq. induced by ethylmethanesulfonate treatment was characterized with respect to morphological and physiological features. The absence of the midrib was accompanied by a reduction of the large veins in the leaf lamina from 25% of total veins found in the wildtype to 13%. The florets of the mutant had no carper but one or two extra stamens were observed. Similar phenotypic changes have been described for an ovaryless (ovl) mutant of barley. This supports the suggestion that a common morphogenetic determinant in wildtype plants induces both the development of the main midrib in leaves and the carper in florets. Photosynthetic rate, CO2-compensation point and export of photosynthates, however, were similar in leaves of mutant and wildtype plants. 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant development 3agynoecium 3aphotosynthates 3amutagenesis 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aplant veins 3astamens 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3amesophyll 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 3aorganogenesis 0aplant anatomy 0aparenchyma 0aPanicum maximum1 aBossinger, G.1 aRoeb, G.W.1 aSalamini, F.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 184, no. 3 p.356-361x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001953373Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02269naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003600097040001800133100001900151245010600170300001600276300002400292520119700316650001701513650002701530650002301557650002101580650001701601650001601618653002301634653002001657700002001677773009801697852000901795856004901804939003301853945000801886946001301894655001201907991631598270742620221118061858.0890711e198906  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890011252DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-52.6.3762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, M.A.10aSurvival of large populations of Listeria monocytogenes on chicken breasts processed using moist heat  ap. 376-378.  ap. 376-378. charts.  aThe ability of Listeria monocytogenes to survive and proliferate on chicken processed using a moist heating method was investigated. Chicken breasts were inoculated with 10(6)-10(7) microorganisms/g, cooked to one of five different cooking temperatures, then either vacuum packaged or wrapped in an oxygen permeable film and stored at 4 degrees C for up to 4 weeks or at 10 degrees C for up to 10 d. Lethality was directly related to the cooking temperatures employed in this study, however survivors were encountered at each of the heat treatments employed. By the fourth week of storage at 4 degrees C, the L. monocytogenes population in all of the samples, except those cooked to 82.2 degrees C increased significantly. In contrast, within the first week of storage at 4 degrees C the population increased in only three samples (73.9 degrees C film overwrap, 65.6 degrees C and 71.1 degrees C vacuum packaged). Storage at 10 degrees C allowed microbial populations in 6 of the 10 treatments to significantly increase within 3 d, with the remaining 4 significantly increasing within 10 d. Differences in packaging influenced the growth rate of L. monocytogenes at both storage temperatures. 3achicken meat 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood contamination 3avacuum packaging 3acold storage 3aplate count 0aprocessed products 0aheat processing1 aCarpenter, S.L.0 tJournal of food protection.g1989 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.376-378wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-52.6.376  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02803naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245010400173300001600277500001500293520161600308650004901924650001401973650001801987650001502005650001802020650001002038650002502048650002802073650001102101650001902112653001502131700001702146700001402163773006002177852000902237856007802246930003302324945001302357946001102370655001202381IND2060528020221118062142.0971114s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206052802DNAL7 a241864102pmid7 a10.1007/BF002010482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorst, J.R.10aLevels of p34(cdc2)-like protein in dividing, differentiating and dedifferentiating cells of carrot  ap. 304-310.  a2019-12-05  ap34(cdc2) is a key cell-cycle protein in fission yeast that is necessary for progress in the cell cycle from the G1 to the S phase and from G2 through mitosis. Homologues of p34(cdc)2 have been found in all eukaryotes that have been investigated. Levels of p34(cdc2)-like protein were studied by quantitative Western blotting in developing cotyledons of Daucus carota L. (carrot) seedlings, in explants from the same seedlings transferred to tissue-culture media with and without 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and in nutrient-starved suspension cultures derived from carrot callus. During the cessation of cell division, which accompanies development of the cotyledon to maturity, there was a 16-fold decline in the level of the p34(cdc2)-like protein. Auxin-stimulated dedifferentiation in excised tissue from mature cotyledons was accompanied by restoration of the level of p34(cdc2)-like protein, and the responding cells formed a callus. These data support our earlier proposition, based upon evidence from wheat leaf, that changes in the level of p34(cdc2)-like protein act in the switch between cycling and differentiation. Persisting high levels of p34(cdc2)-like protein in suspension cultures, when division was stopped by nutrient limitation, indicated that decline of the protein was not an inevitable consequence of the cessation of division. Decline of p34(cdc2) in differentiation may therefore be a regulated process that determines exit from the cell cycle and the converse increase in p34(cdc2) may be a regulated process controlling dedifferentiation and resumption of cell division. 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aseedlings 3aDaucus carota 3acotyledons 3acell division 3a2,4-D 3acell differentiation 3acell suspension culture 3acallus 3atissue culture 0acell cycle1 aJohn, P.C.L.1 aSek, F.J.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 3 p.304-310x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002010483Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02212naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245014700169300001400316520084100330650002901171650002201200650001701222650001001239650001901249650002601268650003001294650004501324650001801369650002201387650001001409651000901419653003501428653001701463700001801480700002101498773012601519852000901645856009201654930003301746946001101779655001201790IND4429845520221118061918.0091211e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442984552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01566.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZirak, Leila10aCharacterization of Phytoplasmas Related to 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' and Peanut WB Group Associated With Sweet Cherry Diseases in Iran  ap. 63-65.  aSymptoms suggestive of phytoplasma diseases were observed in infected sweet cherry trees growing in the central regions of Iran.

To evaluate and control Legionella contamination in industrial cooling tower water, microbiological monitoring was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the following different disinfection treatments: (i) continuous chlorine concentration of 0·01 ppm and monthly chlorine shock dosing (5 ppm) on a single cooling tower; (ii) continuous chlorine concentration of 0·4 ppm and monthly shock of biocide P3 FERROCID 8580 (BKG Water Solution) on seven towers. Legionella spp. and total bacterial count (TBC) were determined 3 days before and after each shock dose. Both strategies demonstrated that when chlorine was maintained at low levels, the Legionella count grew to levels above 10⁴ CFU l⁻¹ while TBC still remained above 10⁸ CFU l⁻¹. Chlorine shock dosing was able to eliminate bacterial contamination, but only for 10-15 days. Biocide shock dosing was also insufficient to control the problem when the disinfectant concentration was administered at only one point in the plant and at the concentration of 30 ppm. On the other hand, when at a biocide concentration of 30 or 50 ppm was distributed throughout a number of points, depending on the plant hydrodynamics, Legionella counts decreased significantly and often remained below the warning limit. Moreover, the contamination of water entering the plant and the presence of sediment were also important factors for Legionella growth. For effective decontamination of outdoor industrial cooling towers, disinfectants should be distributed in a targeted way, taking into account the possible sources of contamination. The data of the research permitted to modify the procedure of disinfection for better reduce the water and aerosol contamination and consequently the exposure risk. 3aLegionella 3aaerosols 3abacterial contamination 3abiocides 3achlorine 3acooling 3adecontamination 3adisease incidence 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3ahydrodynamics 3alegionellosis 3amonitoring 3aplate count 3arisk 3asediments 3awater pollution 2aChlorine 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aDisinfectants 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aIndustry 2aLegionellaxgrowth & development 2aLegionella pneumophilaxgrowth & development 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0abiocide 0aenvironmental water 0aindustrial cooling towers1 aVerani, M.1 aBattistini, R.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2010 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.24-29dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02750.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091211b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03173naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245010100199300001400300520141700314650002501731650002001756650001301776650001401789650000901803650000901812650001601821650001801837650001001855650001401865650001601879650002401895650004701919650003801966650001002004650003002014650004202044650006202086650002402148650005702172653001702229653000902246653000902255653002002264653000802284700002402292700002402316773012202340852000902462856009202471930003302563946001102596655001202607IND4429832220221118061815.0091211e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442983222DNAL7 a198432582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02050.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKEBROM, TESFAMICHAEL H.10aSuppression of sorghum axillary bud outgrowth by shade, phyB and defoliation signalling pathways  ap. 48-58.  aIn recent years, several genetic components of vegetative axillary bud development have been defined in both monocots and eudicots, but our understanding of environmental inputs on branching remains limited. Recent work in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) has revealed a role for phytochrome B (phyB) in the control of axillary bud outgrowth through the regulation of Teosinte Branched1 (TB1) gene. In maize (Zea mays), TB1 is a dosage-dependent inhibitor of axillary meristem progression, and the expression level of TB1 is a sensitive measure of axillary branch development. To further explore the mechanistic basis of branching, the expression of branching and cell cycle-related genes were examined in phyB-1 and wild-type sorghum axillary buds following treatment with low-red : far-red light and defoliation. Although defoliation inhibited bud outgrowth, it did not influence the expression of sorghum TB1 (SbTB1), whereas changes in SbMAX2 expression, a homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) branching inhibitor MAX2, were associated with the regulation of bud outgrowth by both light and defoliation. The expression of several cell cycle-related genes was also decreased dramatically in buds repressed by defoliation, but not by phyB deficiency. The data suggest that there are at least two distinct molecular pathways that respond to light and endogenous signals to regulate axillary bud outgrowth. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSorghum bicolor 3aZea mays 3abranching 3abuds 3acorn 3adefoliation 3afar-red light 3agenes 3ameristems 3aphytochrome 3asignal transduction 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLight 2aPhytochrome Bxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSorghumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aaxillary bud 0aMAX2 0aphyB 0ashoot branching 0aTB11 aBRUTNELL, THOMAS P.1 aFINLAYSON, SCOTT A.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2010 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.48-58dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02050.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091211b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02559naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002500157245010400182300001600286500001500302520144700317650001601764650002001780650001501800650001801815650001401833650002501847653002401872653001501896653001101911653001601922700001901938773006001957852000902017856007802026930003302104945001302137946001102150655001202161IND2060543220221118062052.0971115s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054322DNAL7 a241863402pmid7 a10.1007/BF001940592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolters-Arts, A.M.C.10aDeposition and reorientation of cellulose microfibrils in elongating cells of Petunia stylar tissue  ap. 179-189.  a2019-12-05  aAccording to Roelofsen and Houwink's (1953, Acta Bot. Neerl. 2, 218-225) multinet growth hypothesis, microfibrils originally deposited transversely in the cell wall become gradually reoriented towards more axial orientations during cell elongation. To establish the extent of reorientation, microfibrils were studied during their deposition and elongation, using stylar parenchyma and transmitting tissue cells of Petunia hybrida L. At the inner surface of very young cells, microfibrils were deposited in alternating Z- and S-helical orientations. The following sequence in deposition, from the exterior to the interior side of the wall, could be inferred: Axial: 150 degrees-180 degrees (Z-helical), 0 degrees-30 degrees (S-helical); oblique: 110 degrees-150 degrees (Z-helical), 30 degrees-70 degrees (S-helical); transverse: 90 degrees-110 degrees (Z-helical), 70 degrees-90 degrees (S-helical). With the increasing pitch, the density of the deposited microfibrils increased as well, giving rise to an alternating helical texture. During elongation, only transversely S- and Z-helically oriented microfibrils were deposited and all microfibrils underwent a certain reorientation as described in the multinet growth hypothesis. The texture resembled that of young cells and the wall maintained its thickness. The extent of passive reorientation was in agreement with the theoretical calculations made by Preston (Planta 155, 356-363 1982). 3acell growth 3aPetunia hybrida 3acell walls 3aplant anatomy 3acellulose 3acell wall components 0atransmitting tissue 0aparenchyma 0astyles 0aorientation1 aSassen, M.M.A.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 2 p.179-189x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001940593Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01596naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010300125300001600228520063900244650002000883650001700903650001400920650001400934650001600948650000700964650001800971650002300989650001501012653001701027653002001044700001701064700001501081773006001096852000901156930003301165945001301198946001101211655001201222IND2060540220221118062037.0971115s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokubo, A.10aGalactose prevents proton excretion but not IAA-induced growth in segments of azuki bean epicotyls  ap. 284-287.  aWe investigated the effect of galactose on IAA- induced elongation and proton excretion in azuki bean (Vigna angularis Ohwi et Ohaslii) segments in order to confirm whether or not protons were involved in auxin- induced growth.

Implementation of conservation measures would decrease the volume of water use and also exert less pressure on the water distribution system as well as the wastewater treatment system. Allocation of ground water in the Great Lakes basin must conform to priorities established at the community level. Groundwater pricing should reflect the full costs arising from ground water use. A differential pricing structure would help conserve water in the residential and industrial sectors. A user-friendly database on ground water use, quality and quantity for the entire Great Lakes basin is also essential. New policies for sustainable groundwater allocation, regulating water prices for water conservation, conservation education, pollution prevention, recycling and reuse of water as well as effective information management provide new directions for managing the groundwater demand in the Great Lakes basin. 3abasins 3adatabases 3aeducation 3agroundwater 3ainformation management 3apollution control 3aprices 3awastewater treatment 3awater conservation 3awater distribution 3awater policy 3awater reuse 3aGreat Lakes 0aDemand management 0aAllocation 0aConservation 0aPricing 0aReuse 0aNew policies1 aMitchell, Anne 0 tWater resources management.g2009 Feb., v. 23, no. 3 p.457-475dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-008-9283-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02785naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245012800171300001600299500001500315520169400330650002302024650001202047650002002059650001402079650001502093650002102108650001902129650001902148653001502167653001302182773006002195852000902255856007802264930003302342945001302375946001102388655001202399IND2060545920221118061857.0971117s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054592DNAL7 a241864272pmid7 a10.1007/BF002010652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRikin, A.10aTemperature-induced phase shifting of circadian rhythms in cotton seedlings as related to variations in chilling resistance  ap. 407-414.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationship between the degree of chilling resistance and phase shifting caused by low-temperature pulses was examined in two circadian rhythms in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Deltapine 50) seedlings grown under light-dark cycles of 12:12 h at 33 degrees C. The seedlings showed a circadian rhythm of chilling resistance and of cotyledon movement. A pulse of 19 degrees C for 12 h during the chilling-sensitive phase (light period) caused a phase delay of 6 h, while a similar temperature pulse during the chilling-resistant phase (dark period) did not cause any phase shift. Exposure to 19 degrees C, 85% RH (relative humidity) for 12 h during the dark period induced chilling resistance in the following otherwise chilling-sensitive light period. In this light period a 12-h 19 degrees C pulse did not cause a phase shift of chilling resistance. Pulses of low temperatures (5-19 degrees C) were more effective in causing phase delays in the rhythm of cotyledon movement when given during the chilling-sensitive phase than when given during the chilling-resistant phase. A 12-h pulse of 5 degrees C, 100% RH during the light period caused a phase delay of cotyledon movement of 12 h. However, when that pulse had been preceded by a chill-acclimating exposure to 19 degrees C, 85% RH for 12 h during the dark period the phase delay was shortened to 6 h. The correlation between higher degree of chilling resistance and the prevention or shortening of the phase delay caused by low temperatures indicates that the mechanism that increases chilling resistance directly or indirectly confers greater ability for prevention of phase shifting by low temperatures in circadian rhythms. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acooling 3aair temperature 3aseedlings 3acotyledons 3acircadian rhythm 3acold tolerance 3aphotoperiodism 0aadaptation 0amovement0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 3 p.407-414x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002010653Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04157naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245007600142300001600218520267400234650001302908650001502921650001602936650001702952650002002969650000902989650001302998650001003011650002003021650001803041650006603059650001603125650001703141650001003158650004903168650006903217650001303286650002403299650001603323650001703339650006503356653001403421653001303435653001403448653001103462700001603473773006003489852000903549930003303558945001303591946001103604655001203615IND2060547420221118061911.0971117s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054742DNAL7 a115406502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNick, P.10aInduction of transverse polarity by blue light: an all-or-none response  ap. 415-424.  aPhototropic stimulation induces a spatial memory. This was inferred from experiments with maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles involving opposing blue-light pulses, separated by variable time intervals, and rotation on a horizontal clinostat (Nick and Schafer, 1988b, Planta 175, 380-388). In those experiments, individual seedlings either curved towards the first or towards the second pulse, or they remained straight. Bending, if it occurred, seemed to be an all-or-none response. Intermediates, i.e. plants, bending only weakly, were not observed. In the first part of the present study it was attempted to create such intermediates. For this purpose the strength of the first, inducing, and the second, opposing, pulse was varied. The result was complex: (i) Individual seedlings maintained the all-or-none expression of spatial memory. (ii) However, on the level of the whole population, the time intervals at which a given response type dominated depended on the fluence ratio. (iii) Furthermore, the final curvature was determined by the fluence ratio. These results are discussed in terms of a blue-light-induced transverse polarity. This polarity initiates from a labile precursor, which can be reoriented by an opposing stimulation (indicated by the strong bending towards the second pulse). The strong curvatures towards the first pulse over long time intervals reveal that, eventually, the blue-light-induced transverse polarity becomes stabilised and thus immune to the counterpulse. In the second part of the study, the relation between phototropic transduction and transverse polarity was characterised by a phenomenological approach involving the following points: (i) Sensory adaptation for induction of transverse polarity disappears with a time course similar to that for phototropic sensory adaptataion. (ii) The fluence-response for induction of transverse polarity is a saturation curve and not bell-shaped like the curve for phototropism. (iii) For strong counterpulses and long time intervals the clinostat-elicited nastic response (Nick and Schafer 1989, Planta 179, 123-131) becomes manifest and causes an "aiming error" towards the caryopsis. (iv) Temperature-sensitivity of polarity induction was high in the first 20 min after induction, then dropped sharply and rose again with the approach of polarity fixation. (v) Stimulus-summation experiments indicated that, for different inducing fluences, the actual fixation of polarity happened at about 2 h after induction. These experiments point towards an early separation of the transduction chains mediating phototropism and transverse polarity, possibly before phototropic asymmetry is formed. 3aZea mays 3ablue light 3acoleoptiles 3aphototropism 3alight intensity 3acold 3aduration 3ashape 3anastic movement 2aCell Polarity 2aCotyledonxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aGravitation 2aGravitropism 2aLight 2aPhototropismxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPlant Shootsxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aRotation 2aSignal Transduction 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aZea maysxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 0aasymmetry 0apolarity 0ainduction 0agrowth1 aSchafer, E.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 3 p.415-424x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02496naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010800128300001600236520131200252650001901564650001401583650001601597650002101613650002901634650001601663650001501679650001701694650002001711650001001731650002001741650001301761650002601774650003601800653000901836700001701845700001701862700002501879700002001904773006001924852000901984930003301993945001302026946001102039655001202050IND2060544620221118061753.0971117s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanovas, F.M.10aAccumulation of glutamine synthase during early development of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) seedlings  ap. 373-378.  aSeedlings of Pinus pinaster Aiton accumulated chlorophyll (Chl) when grown in complete darkness. Contents of Chl a and Chl b increased during germination, reaching similar levels in light- and dark-grown plants. Glutamine-synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) activity was detected in the embryo and its level increased markedly in cotyledons of dark-germinated seedlings. Similar levels of GS activity were observed when the seeds were germinated in the presence of white light. Only one GS form, which eluted at about 0.1 M KCl, was found by ion-exchange chromatography. A predominant GS polypeptide of 43 kDa was detected in cotyledons, and its steady-state level increased with development in a light-independent fashion. In roots and needles, a related GS polypeptide of 43 kDa was the unique species detectable by western blot analysis. Immunoblots of soluble proteins from isolated chloroplasts showed low abundance of GS protein, indicating that glutamine synthesis in pine cotyledons occurs mainly in the cytosol. Nitrogen-feeding experiments carried out with detached shoots indicated that neither NO3- nor NH4+ regulate GS levels and the polypeptide pattern. Our results indicate that environmental factors, such as light and nitrogen supply, have a limited role in GS accumulation during pine development. 3aPinus pinaster 3aseedlings 3achlorophyll 3aseed germination 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3awhite light 3acotyledons 3achloroplasts 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aconifer needles 3anitrates 3anutrient availability 3achemical constituents of plants 0adark1 aCanton, F.R.1 aGallardo, F.1 aGarcia-Gutierrez, A.1 aVicente, A.

This occurred during a period in which there was no measurable change in plant growth rate and where the incorporation of [3H]leucine into membrane and soluble proteins was unaffected. Reduced N translocation was associated with six- to eightfold increases in the level of asparagine and two- to fourfold increases in glutamine in root tissue; during the first 4 d of SO4(2-) deprivation there were no corresponding increases in amides in leaf tissue. The provision of 1 mol.m-3 methionine halted, and to some extent reversed the decline in NO3(-) uptake and N translocation which occurred during continued SO4(2-) deprivation. This treatment had relatively little effect in lowering amide levels in roots. Experiments with excised root systems indicated that SO4(2-) deprivation progressively lowered the hydraulic conductivity, Lp, of roots; after 4 d the Lp of SO4(2-)-deprived excised roots was only 20% of that of +S controls. In the expanding leaves of intact plants, SO4(2-) deprivation for 5 d was found to lower stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis, in the order given, to 33%, 37% and 18% of control values. The accumulation of amides in roots is probably explained by a failure to export either the products of root nitrate assimilation or phloem-delivered amino-N. This may be correlated with the lowered hydraulic conductivity. Enhanced glutamine and-or asparagine levels probably repressed net uptake of NO3(-) and 13NO3(-) influx reported earlier (Clarkson et al. 1989, J. Exp. Bot. 40, 953-963). Attention is drawn to the similar hydraulic signals occurring in the early stages of several different types of mineral-nutrient stresses. 3aHordeum vulgare 3ashoots 3aleucine 3aasparagine 3aglutamine 3aroots 3asulfates 3anutrient deficiencies 3axylem 3aamides 3atranspiration 3aphotosynthesis 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient transport 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3amethionine 3asap flow 3aroot shoot ratio1 aClarkson, D.T.1 aSaker, L.R.1 aRooney, J.M.1 aPurves, J.V.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 2 p.269-278x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001940703Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02986naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245017200172300001600344500001500360520174000375650001902115650002502134650001702159650002202176650002302198650001902221650001802240650001602258650001102274653001702285653001802302653002102320700001902341773006002360852000902420856007802429930003302507945001302540946001102553655001202564IND2060544120221118062007.0971115s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054412DNAL7 a241863492pmid7 a10.1007/BF001940682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornic, G.10aEffect of temperature on net CO2 assimilation and photosystem II quantum yield of electron transfer of French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves during drought stress  ap. 255-260.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of leaf temperature on stomatal conductance and net CO2 uptake was studied on French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) using either dehydrated attached leaves (25-40% water deficit) or cut leaves supplied with 10(-4) M abscisic acid (ABA) solution to the transpiration stream. Decreasing leaf temperature caused stomatal opening and increased net CO2 uptake (which was close to zero at around 25 degrees C) to a level identical to that of control leaves (without water deficit) at around 15 degrees C. (i) The ABA effect on stomatal closure was modulated by temperature and, presumably, ABA is at least partly responsible for stomatal closure of french bean submitted to a drought stress. (ii) For leaf temperatures lower than 15 degrees C, net CO2 uptake was no longer limited by water deficit even on very dehydrated leaves. This shows that dehydrated leaves retain a substantial part of their photosynthetic capacity which can be revealed at normal CO2 concentrations when stomata open at low temperature. In contrast to leaves fed with ABA, decreasing the O2 concentration from 21% to 1% O2 did not increase either the rate of net CO2 uptake or the thermal optimum for photosynthesis of dehydrated leaves. The quantum yield of PSII electron flow (measured by deltaF/Fm) was lower in 1% O2 than in 21% O2 for each leaf pretreatment given (non-dehydrated leaves, dehydrated leaves, and leaves fed with ABA) even within a temperature range in which leaf photosynthesis at normal CO2 concentration was the same in these two O2 concentrations. It is concluded that this probably indicates an heterogeneity of photosynthesis, since this difference in quantum yield disappears when using high CO2 concentrations during measurements. 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3agas exchange 3awater deprivation 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aphotosynthesis 3aabscisic acid 3atemperature 3aleaves 0awater stress 0awater deficit 0aleaf temperature1 aGhashghaie, J.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 2 p.255-260x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001940683Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02902naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245014800172300001600320500001500336520167800351650002802029650001002057650001602067650001802083650001202101650001302113650003602126650002002162650001102182653002402193653002302217653001902240700001702259773006002276852000902336856007802345930003302423945001302456946001102469655001202480IND2060543920221118061954.0971115s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054392DNAL7 a241863472pmid7 a10.1007/BF001940662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatzke, K.12aA comparative study into the chemical constitution of cutins and suberins from Picea abies (L.)

Long-chain monobasic, omega-hydroxymonobasic, dihydroxymonobasic, trihydroxymonobasic and epoxyhydroxymonobasic alkanoic acids constituted the major aliphatic monomers of leaf cutins. The total amounts of cutin monomers ranged from 629 mg.m-2 (Fagus) to 1350 mg.m-2 (Quercus). Cutin composition and amounts did not significantly differ between current year and three-year-old needles of Picea. Trans-esterification of periderm samples yielded a much greater variety of aliphatic monomers than obtained from cutins. In addition to the substance classes found with cutins, suberin depolymerisates also contained alpha-omega-dibasic acids while dihydroxymonobasic acids were lacking. Depolymerisates from periderms taken from different locations on a Picea tree did not differ significantly in their relative composition. The results are discussed in terms of the distinctive characteristics of the aliphatic portions of cutins and suberins, respectively. Discriminant analysis is applied for formulating a quantitative and inarbitrary classification rule for cutins and suberins. The precision, statistical significance and robustness of this classification rule are tested by employing it to a large set of compositional data (70 plant species) from the literature. The relevance of data obtained by depolymerization methods for elucidating the physical structure of cutins and suberins in situ is evaluated. 3ainterspecific variation 3acutin 3aPicea abies 3aQuercus robur 3asuberin 3aperiderm 3achemical constituents of plants 3aFagus sylvatica 3aleaves 0aspecies differences 0aaliphatic monomers 0aalkanoic acids1 aRiederer, M.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 2 p.233-245x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001940663Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02610naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014900127300001600276500001500292520141400307650001901721650001101740650002001751650001101771650001101782650001701793650001201810650002001822650001601842650002001858650002801878650002001906650001901926650001901945653002301964653001701987653001902004700001502023773006002038852000902098930003302107945001302140946001102153655001202164IND2060544420221118061907.0971115s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206054442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarage, P.K.14aThe occurrence of photoinhibition of an over-wintering crop of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus L.) and its correlation with changes in crop growth  ap. 279-286.  a2019-12-05  aThe maximum quantum yield of CO2 uptake (phi), as a measure of light-limited photosynthetic efficiency, of a Brassica napus crop was measured on most days from mid-October until mid-April. During the winter, phi was decreased by up to 50%. From January to March, leaves exposed to direct sunlight on days with minimum air temperatures near or below 0 degrees C showed significant reductions in phi. However, control leaves, artificially shaded from direct sunlight on these days, did not show any decrease. This provides statistical evidence for a light-dependent inhibition of CO2 uptake in the field, termed here photoinhibition. Recovery of phi during warmer interludes was slow, requiring approx. 2-3 d. Concurrent measurements of light interception by the crop canopy and dry-matter accumulation showed that the efficiency with which intercepted light was converted into dry matter varied, declin between January and March to 33% of the value recorded in the warmer autumn months. Conversion efficiency was significantly and positively correlated with quantum yield. In a closed crop canopy during winter, light will be limiting for photosynthesis for much of the time. Under these conditions depression of phi at the leaf level may contribute significantly to decreased dry-matter accumulation at the crop level, since the light-limited rate of CO2 uptake is likely to govern canopy photosynthetic rate. 3acarbon dioxide 3acanopy 3asolar radiation 3awinter 3aautumn 3agas exchange 3acooling 3aair temperature 3acold stress 3aphotoinhibition 3adry matter accumulation 3alight intensity 3aBrassica napus 3acold tolerance 0asouth east england 0ainterception 0aphotosynthesis1 aLong, S.P.0 tPlanta.g1991, v. 185, no. 2 p.279-286x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02590naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007600174300001600250520147400266592002801740650001501768650001301783650001701796650000901813650001801822650001301840650001301853650001801866650003101884650002301915650001801938650001201956700002201968700001801990773010202008856008502110852000902195655001202204IND60636542520221118233101.0190410e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063654252DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60326-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHIEDUNG, Henning10aSeasonal Variability of Soil Organic Carbon Fractions Under Arable Land  ap. 380-386.  aCarbon fractions in soils apparently vary not only in space, but also over time. A lack of knowledge on the seasonal variability of labile carbon fractions under arable land hampers the reliability and comparability of soil organic carbon (SOC) surveys from different studies. Therefore, we studied the seasonal variability of two SOC fractions, particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), under maize cropping: POM was determined as the SOC content in particle-size fractions, and DOC was measured as the water-extractable SOC (WESOC) of air-dried soil. Ammonium, nitrate, and water-extractable nitrogen were measured as potential regulating factors of WESOC formation because carbon and nitrogen cycles in soils are strongly connected. There was a significant annual variation of WESOC (coefficient of variation (CV) = 30%). Temporal variations of SOC in particle-size fractions were smaller than those of WESOC. The stocks of SOC in particle-size fractions decreased with decreasing particle sizes, exhibiting a CV of 20% for the coarse sand-size fraction (250–2 000 μm), of 9% for the fine sand-size fraction (50–250 μm), and of 5% for the silt-size fraction (20–50 μm). The WESOC and SOC in particle-size fractions both peaked in March and reached the minimum in May/June and August, respectively. These results indicate the importance of the time of soil sampling during the course of a year, especially when investigating WESOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3aammonium 3aarable soils 3acorn 3alabile carbon 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aparticulate organic matter 3aseasonal variation 3asoil sampling 3asurveys1 aBORNEMANN, Ludger1 aWELP, Gerhard0 tPedosphere.g2017 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.380-386dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60326-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245013600214520168700350592002802037650001802065650002202083650001702105650001402122650001602136650001402152650001602166650003502182650002002217650001902237650001702256650002102273650001002294650001802304650003002322650001502352650001602367650001702383650001802400650003702418650001402455653003202469653001602501653001502517653002402532653002202556653001402578700002102592700002102613700002102634700002102655700002202676700002602698700002402724700002002748700002102768700002102789700002402810700002102834773009702855856009002952852000903042655001203051IND60777331720221122050538.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamea, Ghada A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0016-678310aDirect and indirect antiparasitic effects of chloroquine against the virulent RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii: An experimental study  aToxoplasmosis is a deleterious parasitic disease with harmful impact on both humans and animals. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antiparasitic effect of chloroquine (CQ), spiramycin (SP), and combination of both against the highly virulent RH HXGPRT (−) strain of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and to explore the mechanisms underlying such effect. We counted the tachyzoites in the peritoneal fluid and liver smears of mice and performed scanning and transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining of tachyzoites. Moreover, relative caspase 3 gene expression was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction of liver tissues and immunoassay of anti-apoptotic markers [B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)] and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) was done in liver tissues by ELISA. In addition, we estimated serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) and performed histopathological examination of liver sections for scoring of inflammation. We found that both CQ and CQ/SP combination significantly reduced parasitic load in the peritoneal fluid and liver smears, induced apical disruption of tachyzoites, triggered host cell apoptosis through elevation of relative caspase 3 gene expression and suppression of both Bcl-2 and XIAP. Also, they upregulated IFN-γ level, reduced serum AST and ALT, and ameliorated liver inflammation. Either of CQ and CQ/SP combination was more effective than SP alone against T. gondii with the CQ/SP combination being more efficient. Therefore, adding CQ to other anti-Toxoplasma therapeutic regimens may be considered in future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aX chromosome 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3achloroquine 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3aliver 3aparasite load 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspiramycin 3atachyzoites 3atherapeutics 3atoxoplasmosis 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirulence 0aToxoplasma gondii RH strain 0aChloroquine 0aSpiramycin 0aElectron microscopy 0aApical disruption 0aapoptosis1 aElmehy, Dalia A.1 aSalama, Amina M.1 aSoliman, Nema A.1 aAfifi, Omayma K.1 aElkaliny, Heba H.1 aAbo El gheit, Rehab E1 aEl-Ebiary, Ahmad A.1 aTahoon, Dina M.1 aElkholy, Reem A.1 aShoeib, Sarah M.1 aEleryan, Mohamed A.1 aYounis, Salwa S.0 tActa tropica.g2022 Aug., v. 232 p.106508-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013500174300001400309520126100323592002801584650001501612650001601627650002201643650002001665650001701685650003801702650001801740650001801758650001401776650001101790650001101801650001301812650002101825650002001846650003001866650002401896650001401920653001201934653002101946653003001967653001801997653003002015653001002045700002702055700003502082700003202117700003502149773011002184856008302294852000902377655001202386IND60628584420221119175159.0190207e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062858442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Fernández, Ana10aFocusing aptamer selection on the glycan structure of prostate-specific antigen: Toward more specific detection of prostate cancer  ap. 83-90.  aThe development of chemical sensors capable of detecting the specific glycosylation patterns of proteins offers a powerful mean for the early detection of cancer. Unfortunately, this strategy is scarcely explored because receptors recognizing the glycans linked to proteins are challenging to discover. In this work, we describe a simple method for directing the selection of aptamers toward the glycan structure of the glycoproteins, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a model target. Using this strategy, we identified one aptamer (PSA-1) that binds the glycan moiety of PSA with reasonable affinity (a dissociation constant of 177 ± 65 nM). Interestingly, an electrochemical sensor with a sandwich format employing the identified aptamer as a signaling receptor, provides a tool of discriminating human PSA from the unglycosylated protein, with a limit of detection of 0.66 ng/mL. The sensor responds to different levels of PSA in serum, correlating well with chemiluminescence ELISA used in hospitals even with higher potential to discriminate clinically meaningful prostate cancer. Although validation on a larger cohort is needed, this is the first demonstration of an aptamer-based sensor to detect PSA by focusing in its glycan moiety  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoligonucleotides 3apolysaccharides 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3areceptors 0aAptamer 0aCancer detection 0aElectrochemical biosensor 0aGlycosylation 0aProstate-specific antigen 0aSELEX1 aMiranda-Castro, Rebeca1 ade-los-Santos-Álvarez, Noemí1 aRodríguez, Eloy Fernández1 aLobo-Castañón, María Jesús0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 128 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245014400208300001600352520126000368592002801628650001901656650002701675650001401702650001201716650001901728650001601747650002701763650001001790650001501800650001801815650002601833650001801859650001801877650001301895651001201908653002801920653001801948653002501966653002401991653001002015653002702025700002502052773009702077856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60592583820221116220854.0200427e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059258382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisse, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6103-655810aRapid detection and quantification of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens by in-vivo fluorometry and flow cytometry  ap. 234-240.  aWe combined profiling of the bloom-forming and potentially toxigenic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens using a multiparameter probe equipped with a phycoerythrin sensor (in vivo fluorometry, IVL) in Lake Mondsee, Austria, with flow cytometric live analyses of discrete samples taken from several depths in the upper 20 m of the water column. Results obtained by IVL and acoustic flow cytometry (AFC) were compared to microscopic analyses of integrated (0–21 m) water samples using fixed material. This comparison was made because the integrated samples are used for the Austrian monitoring programme according to the EU Water Framework Directive. We demonstrate that AFC provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of P. rubescens that are significantly correlated to IVF and microscopic analyses, allowing rapid (within hours) and more precise calculation of P. rubescens biomass than estimates derived from IVL. Our analysis shows that vertically integrated water samples provide unreliable information on the concentration of P. rubescens in the upper surface waters and on the peak concentration of P. rubescens within the water column. We conclude that the protocol that we developed is superior to the current monitoring practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aPlanktothrix rubescens 3aacoustics 3abiomass 3aflow cytometry 3afluorometry 3ain vitro fertilization 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aphycoerythrin 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aAustria 0aAcoustic flow cytometry 0aCyanobacteria 0aHarmful algal blooms 0aIn-vivo fluorometry 0aLakes 0aPlanktothrix rubescens1 aBergkemper, Victoria0 tWater research.g2018 July 01, v. 138 p.234-240dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245017400177300001400351520119800365592002801563650001701591650001201608650001401620650001701634650001301651650001301664650001301677650001601690650002301706653001101729653001501740653001301755653001401768653002401782653001901806700002901825773009901854856008201953852000902035655001202044IND60592583920221116220604.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059258392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogueira Júnior, Miodeli14aThe ecology and developmental changes of meristic characters of the medusa Malagazzia carolinae (Hydrozoa: Leptothecata) from subtropical Southwestern Atlantic estuaries  ap. 34-45.  aIn the present study we show that the meristic marginal characters of the hydromedusa Malagazzia carolinae changes through its ontogeny. We additionally present background-data on abundance and size composition spatial temporal dynamics of this poorly-known medusa from five subtropical Brazilian estuaries (∼24–26.5°S). Data presented are important to improve taxonomy of the group and to track life-history strategies. The number of marginal structures varies considerably: tentacular bulbs ranged between 0 and 7, rudimentary bulbs between 0 and 12 and statocysts between 1 and 22 on each quadrant and their numbers tended to increase with bell diameter. Malagazzia carolinae was nearly absent from the open shallow shelf, and among the five estuaries sampled it was more common and abundant inside Babitonga and Guaratuba Bays, where a well-defined distribution was found, with peaks in January mostly in the inner sectors (mean 8–10ind. 10m−3). Although sampled in wide hydrographic conditions, M. carolinae was mostly found in intermediate salinities (21–26) and temperatures (22–29°C), suggesting it is well adapted to thrive in estuarine subtropical and tropical systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptothecata 3aecology 3aestuaries 3alife history 3aontogeny 3asalinity 3ataxonomy 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 0aMedusa 0aMorphology 0aOntogeny 0aAbundance 0aPopulation dynamics 0aSouth atlantic1 aSilva Nascimento, Lorena0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2018 May, v. 274 p.34-45dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013100157300001400288500002000302520128600322592002801608650001501636650001701651650001501668650001801683650001901701650004101720650001601761650001801777700001701795773014801812856007501960852000902035655001202044IND60786543720221122075904.0220804e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078654372DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.121692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngle, Umesh10aDesign of High‐Productivity Mixed Tocopherol Purification from Deodorized Distillates by Tandem Reverse Phase Chromatography  ap. 83-92.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCurrently, there is a great demand for high‐purity natural tocopherols in food supplements due to their antioxidant and Vitamin E activity. Deodorized distillate (DOD), a by‐product of the vegetable oil refining process, is a major source of these natural tocopherols. Isolation of pure tocopherols from DOD is challenging due to their lower concentration and presence of large quantities of polar and hydrophobic components. Several multistep methods are known in the art for the purification of tocopherols from DOD and crude feed stocks. This work presents a single‐step tandem reverse phase chromatography method for high‐purity tocopherols from DOD containing 4–8% of tocopherols (mixture of α, β, γ, and δ isomers). Tandem chromatography involved two consecutive chromatography columns, in which the first column is operated in frontal adsorption mode for maximum loading with partial removal of impurities and the second column operated in step wise separation mode causing high purity. The Developed tandem two‐column process produces 60% and 95% purity tocopherol grades at a high loading of 381 (g of DOD) per (L of resin). The developed method recovers up to 77% of loaded tocopherols in purified form with a productivity of 3.4 g L⁻¹ hour⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantioxidants 3abyproducts 3adeodorization 3ahydrophobicity 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atocopherols 3avegetable oil1 aLali, Arvind0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2019 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.83-92dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.121693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013500162300001600297520125600313592002801569650002501597650002101622650001901643650001101662650001501673700001501688700001701703700001301720700001501733700001701748700001201765773009601777856008101873990002301954852000901977655001201986IND60093448220221120112408.0141103e20121224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009344822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiyan, Sun10aPrediction of flow behavior of particles in a tapered bubbling fluidized bed using a second-order moment-frictional stresses model  ap. 170-181.  aFlow behavior of gas and particles is simulated by means of the second-order moments method (SOM) in a tapered bubbling fluidized bed. The frictional stress model proposed by Johnson et al. (1990) is used to predicate the frictional stresses of particles. A drag coefficient model for gas–monosized particles flow is proposed for predicting the interaction between gas and solid phase in the tapered bubbling fluidized beds. Distributions of concentration, velocity and moments of particles are predicted in the tapered bubbling fluidized bed. The ratio of the vertical normal second-order moment to the lateral normal second-order moment increases with the increase of tapering angle. The averaged ratios are larger than unity in the inner section (IS region) in the cylinder of the bed. It is, however, reverse in the outside of the cylinder (OS region). The second-order moments are direction-dependence, and the anisotropy of the normal components of the second-order moments is obvious in tapered bubbling fluidized beds. A comparison has been made between the simulations using proposed model and the experimental data. Simulated concentration of particles, bed pressure drop and bed expansion agreed reasonably with experimental measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3adrag coefficient 3afluidized beds 3amodels 3aprediction1 aWeiguo, Xu1 aGuodong, Liu1 aDan, Sun1 aHuilin, Lu1 aYanjia, Tang1 aDan, Li0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Dec. 24, v. 84 p.170-181dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245007700180520107600257592002801333650001501361650001801376650001101394650001801405650001401423650001901437653001501456653001901471653002001490653001801510653002401528653003001552700002001582700002001602773009701622856009001719852000901809655001201818IND60777332120221122035650.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAit Maatallah, Ikram10aTissue tropism: Is it an intrinsic characteristic of Leishmania species?  aThe genus Leishmania comprises a wide range of species, some of which are pathogenic to humans and each of which has a different tissue preference, resulting in one of the three clinical forms of human leishmaniasis: visceral, cutaneous, or mucocutaneous. Although, all pathogenic species are deposited intradermally in the mammalian host upon an infectious sand fly bite, only the viscerotropic strains can leave the skin and reach the internal organs. We assume that Leishmania tissue tropism is not only the result of Leishmania genetic determinism but is also governed by the interaction of the parasite with different vectorial and human host elements. To shed light on these elements and key steps determining the course of the infection, we describe throughout this review the disease's progression from the early stages of infection taking place in the skin to the late stages succeeding in the parasite's visceral dissemination. Hence, we address the question of Leishmania tropism, through providing relevant hypotheses and answers gathered from the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3aPhlebotominae 3ahumans 3aleishmaniasis 3aparasites 3atissue tropism 0aLeishmania 0aTissue tropism 0aVisceralization 0aSkin immunity 0aDisease progression 0aHost-parasite interaction1 aAkarid, Khadija1 aLemrani, Meryem0 tActa tropica.g2022 Aug., v. 232 p.106512-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245006000178300001800238520105900256592002801315650000801343650001801351650001901369650001901388650000901407650001601416650001501432650001101447650000901458651001001467653000901477653001801486653002601504700002501530773008001555856008301635852000901718655001201727IND60096979920221120232422.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009697992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaletovic P., Alexander,10aWind, coal, and the cost of environmental externalities  ap. 1385-1391.  aWe compare the cost of generating electricity with coal and wind in Chile. On average, we estimate that the levelized cost of coal, including externalities, is $84/MWh. It is efficient to abate air pollutants (SOx, NOx and PM2.5) but not CO2. With abatement the cost wrought by environmental externalities equals $23/MWh or 27% of total cost. Depending on the price of coal, the levelized cost may vary between $72 and $99/MWh.The levelized cost of wind is $144/MWh with capacity factor of 24%. This cost includes backup capacity to maintain LOLP, which equals $13/MWh or 9% of total cost. The levelized cost of wind varies between $107/MWh with capacity factors of 35% to $217/MWh with capacity factors of 15%.Wind is competitive only with capacity factors around 35% and very high coal prices. Alternatively, a carbon price of $73/tCO2 ($268/tc) would make coal and wind equally costly. But this value implies a marginal damage at the 98th percentile of the distribution deduced from Tol's (2011) estimates, rather far from the mean, $16/tCO2 ($59/tc).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acoal 3aelectricity 3apollutants 3aprices 3awind 3aChile 0aCoal 0aExternalities 0aWind power generation1 aMuñoz, Cristián M.0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.1385-1391dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009200167300001600259520186400275592002802139650002902167650001602196650001502212650002502227650001102252650001602263650001102279650001402290650001902304650002402323650002602347650002602373650001502399650001102414700001802425700001802443700001702461773009602478856008102574990002302655852000902678655001202687IND60093448420221121112830.0141103e20121224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009344842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhari, R.D.10aEffect of bud scars on the mechanical properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls  ap. 188-196.  aTo determine the effect of bud scars on the mechanical properties of the walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, freshly cultivated stationary phase cells stained with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated wheat germ agglutinin were sorted according to the number of bud scars using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare. Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour. This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aagglutinins 3acell walls 3achemical engineering 3achitin 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aequations 3aflow cytometry 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3awheat germ 3ayeasts1 aStenson, J.D.1 aOverton, T.W.1 aThomas, C.R.0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Dec. 24, v. 84 p.188-196dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.08.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245018900173520130100362592002801663650002201691650001301713650001001726650001401736650003501750650001101785650001701796650001901813650001901832650002101851650001901872650001801891650002501909653002201934653001601956653002301972653001201995653001602007653002402023700001502047700001402062700001802076700001502094700001702109700002002126700001702146700001602163773009702179856009002276852000902366655001202375IND60777332220221122050352.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xiaowei12aA recombinant protein vaccine encoding Toxoplasma gondii Cyst wall 2 (dense granule protein 47) provides partial protection against acute and chronic T. gondii infection in BALB/c mice  aToxoplasma gondii poses a major threat to economies and public health, and there are still no available vaccines for human against T. gondii infection. T. gondii cyst wall 2 (TgCST2, also known as dense granule protein-47) is a critical molecule in the establishment of chronic infection, making it a potential vaccine candidate. In this research, the recombinant TgCST2 (rTgCST2) was employed to evaluate the protective efficacy of TgCST2 antigen using BALB/c mice model against T. gondii infections via active immunization trials. First, the strong immunogenicity of TgCST2 was indicated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, which mean that TgCST2 might elicit robust immune responses in the organism. Then, after triply subcutaneous immunization with rTgCST2/ISA 201 emulsion, high levels of Toxoplasma-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and cytokines (Interferon γ and interleukin 10) further suggested that TgCST2 was a promising immunogenic antigen. More importantly, this antigen could prolong survival in RH strain infected mice and resulted in the lower brain cysts size and number of PRU strain infected mice. These preliminary results demonstrated the immunoprophylactic effects of TgCST2 antigen and will inform new studies in developing subunit recombinant vaccines against T. gondii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantigens 3abrain 3aemulsions 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-10 3apublic health 3arecombinant proteins 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aCyst wall 2 0aRH and PRU strains 0aVaccine 0aBALB/c mice 0aProtective immunity1 aWang, Meng1 aXie, Tong1 aWan, Guangmin1 aSun, Hanqi1 aMei, Xuefang1 aZhang, Zhenchao1 aLi, Xiangrui1 aWang, Shuai0 tActa tropica.g2022 Aug., v. 232 p.106514-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245013500158300001800293500001900311520160500330592002801935650001501963650001501978650001201993650003002005650001102035650001602046650001302062650001102075650001902086650001302105650002002118650001502138650001402153700001402167700005602181700005302237700005902290700005602349773014002405856007902545852000902624655001202633IND60655819120221122010117.0190807e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b022222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yi10aDefect-Abundant Covalent Triazine Frameworks as Sunlight-Driven Self-Cleaning Adsorbents for Volatile Aromatic Pollutants in Water  ap. 9091-9101.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCovalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with high adsorption potential and photocatalytic ability features are expected to be designed as a new class of adsorbents that can regenerate themselves just by harnessing sunlight. To simultaneously improve both the adsorption and photocatalytic regeneration performance, a defect-abundant CTF-m was designed and tuned effectively by varying the lengths of benzene ring chains incorporated into the CTF backbone. It has been demonstrated that two kinds of defects in terms of broken benzene rings and pyrrole nitrogen were newly generated, other than the normal benzene rings and triazine units in the CTF-m skeleton. Benefiting from these defects, the adsorption sites with high energy for adsorbing volatile aromatic pollutants were significantly increased, which are reflected by higher saturated adsorption capacities of CTF-m (3.026 mmol/g for benzene (BEN), 1.490 mmol/g for naphthalene (NAP), and 0.863 mmol/g for phenol (PHE)) compared with those of CTF-1 and CTF-2. Furthermore, these defects narrowed the band structure and facilitated the separation of photogenerated charge carries, thus promoting photocatalytic regeneration. The percentage of CTF-m regenerated was still higher than 90% in the fourth cycle. These experimental results, together with the density functional theory (DFT) studies, soundly corroborated that the defects could optimize the adsorption and regeneration property of CTF-m. The present work highlights the potential of fabrication of defective CTFs as solar-driven self-cleaning adsorbents to remove pollutants from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3anaphthalene 3anitrogen 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3apyrroles 3asolar radiation 3atechnology 3atriazines1 aZhu, Chao1 aSong, Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8033-68391 aZeng, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1358-53541 aLi, Lingxiangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2611-380X1 aCai, Zongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7013-55470 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 July 02, v. 53, no. 15 p.9091-9101dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b022223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245003600173300001400209520126000223592002801483650002101511650002301532650001201555650001501567650002001582650001101602650002301613650001201636650001901648650001801667650001301685650002101698650001401719650001501733650001101748650001501759650001801774650001101792651001201803700001601815700001501831773008601846856008501932852000902017655001202026IND60084386220221116162628.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadlec, Robert H.14aThe Brighton treatment wetlands  ap. 56-70.  aThe Town of Brighton, Ontario implemented a 6.2ha marsh in 2000, for the purpose of improving water quality before discharge to receiving waters. The wetlands have successfully operated in this moderately cold climate for over ten years. Phosphorus removal of 2.3gP/(m²yr) was achieved, with an annual areal rate coefficient of 9.2m/yr. The removal is strongly seasonal, with the greatest reductions occurring in spring. The total nitrogen loading was dominated by ammonia (208gN/(m²yr)), with smaller amounts of organic and oxidized nitrogen. Ammonia was reduced to 173gN/(m²yr). Implied areal rate constants were high for mineralization of organic nitrogen (29m/yr) and denitrification (101m/yr), but low for nitrification (4m/yr). CBOD₅ was reduced from 5.4 to 3.2mg/L, and TSS was reduced from 13.2 to 7.2mg/L, both with slightly higher values during late winter. The wetland was not effective in reducing pathogens, with Escherichia coli at 167cfu/100ml entering, and 132cfu/100ml leaving. Vegetation was sparse, likely due to muskrats and deep water. Macro-invertebrate diversity was lower than for regional wetlands. Bird use was very high, and birding was a popular human activity. The wetland has been designated as provincially significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aOndatra zibethicus 3aammonia 3acold zones 3adenitrification 3ahumans 3amacroinvertebrates 3amarshes 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3aspring 3avegetation 3awater quality 3awinter 3aOntario1 aPries, John1 aLee, Keith0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.56-70dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245005300209300001400262520100800276592002801284650001901312650001701331650002201348650001101370651001401381651001901395651001801414653002901432653002001461653001401481653001801495653002601513653001901539700001701558700001901575773010901594856008801703852000901791655001201800IND60629198120221121143531.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062919812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5237-857X10aWhy does the UK need a Human Taphonomy Facility?  ap. 74-79.  aHuman Taphonomy Facilities (HTFs) are outdoor laboratories where scientific research is carried out on donated human cadavers in order to understand how human decomposition progresses in a variety of conditions. There are currently eight such facilities in the USA, one in Australia and one on mainland Europe. Forensic scientists in the UK have started to ask the question ‘Does the UK need a Human Taphonomy Facility?’. A review of the literature produced by the existing HTFs, as well as published opinion and commentaries about these facilities and the feasibility of one in the UK has been undertaken. The existing arguments for and against the establishment of a Human Taphonomy Facility in the UK have been examined. Given recent media interest in the possibility of the establishment of a Human Taphonomy Facility in the UK, and the surrounding controversy, it is important to evaluate the potential benefit or harm of the creation of such a facility to Society and the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3adead animals 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3aAustralia 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States 0aHuman Taphonomy Facility 0a‘Body farm’ 0aTaphonomy 0aDecomposition 0aForensic anthropology 0aHuman cadavers1 aRogers, C.J.1 aCassella, J.P.0 tForensic science international.g2019 Mar., v. 296 p.74-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012400173520205400297592002802351650000802379650001602387650002602403650000902429650001002438650002002448650002002468650000902488650002002497650001402517650001802531650001902549650001402568653001202582653001702594653001302611653001602624653002402640700005902664700006602723773009702789856009002886852000902976655001202985IND60777332320221122050507.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanich, Wasin10aHigh-performance triplex PCR detection of three tapeworm species belonging to the genus Raillietina in infected poultry  aChickens and ducks are important sources of essential proteins and nutrition for global consumption, especially their eggs and meat. Tapeworm infections in chickens and ducks are the cause of serious poultry health and economic problems in the processing of livestock and food production systems. Raillietina are cosmopolitan in distribution and are possibly the most common tapeworm parasites. There are three important species regarding avian infection, with different pathogenicity, including Raillietina echinobothrida, R. tetragona, and R. cesticillus. Co-infection diagnosis of these tapeworms using morphological analysis can be performed, but this is time-consuming and complicated. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a triplex PCR for the detection and discrimination of three Raillietina species. The triplex PCR assay specifically amplified target DNAs with no inter-specific interference and produced a specific band for each species. According to the specificity test, there was no cross-amplification with the DNA template of related parasites and their hosts. The lowest detectable DNA concentrations were evaluated and provided sensitivities of 0.5 pg/μL for R. echinobothrida, 5 pg/μL for R. tetragona, 50 fg/μL for R. cesticillus, and 5 pg/μL for the combination of DNA from all three species. Simultaneous detection limits of egg capsules and gravid proglottids was also performed, with and without feces. The interference of feces in the reaction was related to a decrease in sensitivity, but simultaneous detection of three Raillietina species in amounts lower than one gravid proglottid and ten egg capsules was still successful. Thus, this study is the first triplex PCR assay for Raillietina detection and can be utilized as an alternative diagnostic tool for the detection and discrimination of R. echinobothrida, R. tetragona, and R. cesticillus infection in poultry through the verification of fecal specimens. In addition, it could improve the performance of specific treatments and promote veterinary healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaillietina 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeggs 3afeces 3afood production 3ahealth services 3ameat 3amixed infection 3anutrition 3apathogenicity 3apoultry health 3atapeworms 0aPoultry 0aFood control 0aTapeworm 0aTriplex PCR 0aRaillietina species1 aNak-on, Sirapat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8726-59731 aChontananarth, Thapana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4241-69660 tActa tropica.g2022 Aug., v. 232 p.106516-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245007500172520167600247592002801923650002101951650002601972650002101998650001402019650002802033650002002061650003502081650001002116650001502126650001902141650001002160650001002170650002302180650004302203650002902246650001302275653002602288653002802314653001302342653002302355653002102378700001802399700001402417700001902431700001602450700001702466700002002483700001702503700001702520700001802537700001202555700001502567700001502582773009702597856009002694852000902784655001202793IND60777332420221122010138.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Zheng10aCharacterization of aspartyl aminopeptidase from Schistosoma japonicum  aThe tegument of schistosomes is the interface between the worm and the host environment. Some molecules distributed on the tegument participate in host–parasite interactions. Aspartyl aminopeptidase (AAP), identified on the tegument of Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum), facilitate protein turnover by acting in concert with other aminopeptidases. In this study, the gene encoding S. japonicum aspartyl aminopeptidase (SjAAP) was cloned, expressed and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that SjAAP was expressed in all studied developmental stages. The transcript level was higher in 8, 14, 21, and 28 days old worms than the other detected stages. Moreover, the level of expression in 42-day-old male worms was significantly higher than that in females. The recombinant SjAAP (rSjAAP) was expressed as both supernatant and inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The enzymatic activity of rSjAAP was 4.45 U/mg. The Km and Vmax values for H-Asp-pNA hydrolysis were discovered to be 5.93 mM and 0.018 mM·min–¹. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SjAAP is primarily distributed on the tegument and parenchyma of schistosomes. Western blot showed that rSjAAP possessed good immunogenicity. Although specific antibodies were produced in BALB/c mice vaccinated with rSjAAP emulsified with ISA 206 adjuvant, no significant reduction of worm burden and number of eggs in the liver was observed. Therefore, rSjAAP may not be suitable to act as a potential vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis japonica in mice. However, this study provides some foundation for further exploration of the biological function of this molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aWestern blotting 3aadjuvants 3aaspartyl aminopeptidase 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3aimmunogenicity 3aliver 3amales 3aprotein metabolism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aschistosomiasis japonica 3avaccines 0aSchistosoma japonicum 0aAspartyl aminopeptidase 0aTegument 0aEnzymatic activity 0aImmunoprotection1 aGuo, Qinghong1 aZhou, Xue1 aYue, Yongcheng1 aZhou, Kerou1 aTang, Liying1 aZhang, Zhizhong1 aFu, Zhiqiang1 aLiu, Jinming1 aLin, Jiaojiao1 aXu, Bin1 aZhang, Min1 aHong, Yang0 tActa tropica.g2022 Aug., v. 232 p.106519-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1065193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008800167300001600255520128100271592002801552650000801580650003501588650002001623650002701643650002901670650001801699650001801717650001901735650001601754650001301770650002801783650003601811650001401847653000801861653000801869653000801877653000901885653000801894653000801902653000801910653000801918653000801926653000801934653000801942653000801950653000701958653001401965653004401979653001802023653003402041653001102075653002802086700002002114700002002134700001902154700002202173700002002195700002702215700002302242700002202265773012102287856008202408852000902490655001202499IND60532932720221118140716.0160728e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053293272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Yasuyuki10aUric acid induces NADPH oxidase-independent neutrophil extracellular trap formation  ap. 556-561.  aNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of extracellular DNA fibers with antimicrobial peptides that capture and kill microbes. NETs play a critical role in innate host defense and in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the mechanism of NET formation remains unclear, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced via activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) are known to be an important requirement. In this study, we investigated the effect of uric acid (UA) on NET formation. UA, a well-known ROS scavenger, was found to suppress Nox-dependent ROS release in a dose-dependent manner. Low concentrations of UA significantly inhibited Nox-dependent NET formation. However, high concentrations of UA unexpectedly induced, rather than inhibited, NET formation. NETs were directly induced by UA alone in a Nox-independent manner, as revealed by experiments using control neutrophils treated with ROS inhibitors or neutrophils of patients with chronic granulomatous disease who have a congenital defect in ROS production. Furthermore, we found that UA-induced NET formation was partially mediated by NF-κB activation. Our study is the first to demonstrate the novel function of UA in NET formation and may provide insight into the management of patients with hyperuricemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acongenital abnormalities 3adose response 3ahyperuricemia 3amicroorganisms 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3auric acid 0aCGD 0aDHR 0aDPI 0aHBSS 0aMSU 0aMVP 0aNox 0aNET 0aPBN 0aPMA 0aROS 0a1O2 0aUA 0aUric acid 0aNeutrophil extracellular trap formation 0aNADPH oxidase 0aChronic granulomatous disease 0aNF-κB 0aReactive oxygen species1 aNishinaka, Yoko1 aArai, Toshiyuki1 aMorita, Makiko1 aMizugishi, Kiyomi1 aAdachi, Souichi1 aTakaori-Kondo, Akifumi1 aWatanabe, Tomohiro1 aYamashita, Kouhei0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 443 p.556-561dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007400168300001800242520122100260592002801481650001701509650002501526650001101551650001301562650002401575650001501599650002201614653001901636653001401655653001901669700002201688773008001710856008301790852000901873655001201882IND60096980320221122055634.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009698032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaika, Dimitra14aThe environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory. Part B: Critical issues  ap. 1403-1411.  aAccording to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory, the process of economic growth is expected to limit the environmental degradation created in the early stages of development. The first article of this study reviews the empirical studies examining various factors, other than income, that may lead to an EKC-pattern. The current article reviews in the first part the major critiques on the EKC-speculation which relate to the following issues: the normal distribution of world income, the feedback from environmental degradation to economic growth, the characteristics of the pollutant in question, various econometric issues, the evolution of consumption when income rises and the assumption about a common developmental pattern in all countries. The second part discusses additional matters reported indirectly in the literature and/or must be further examined. There are doubts whether the GDP-series captures the transition of production to the three productive sectors in empirical estimations and whether services are less polluting compared to industry activities. Finally, the original Kuznets-theory, which laid the groundwork for the EKC-concept, does not seem to solve income inequality problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3aeconomic development 3aincome 3aindustry 3anormal distribution 3apollutants 3asocial inequality 0aEKC literature 0aCritiques 0aCommon pattern1 aZervas, Efthimios0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.1403-1411dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.07.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009700169300001600266500001500282520170100297592002801998650000902026650002802035650001902063650002002082650001202102650001102114650001302125650003102138650001402169650001902183650001502202650001702217650002202234650002002256650001902276650003402295650004202329650002402371650004302395650002802438653001002466700002302476700001702499700001802516773011902534856008102653852000902734655001202743IND60514881620221119203111.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051488162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-016-0474-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivya, Dhanasekar10aAnalysis of SSH library of rice variety Aganni reveals candidate gall midge resistance genes  ap. 153-169.  a2019-12-06  aThe Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae, is a serious insect pest causing extensive yield loss. Interaction between the gall midge and rice genotypes is known to be on a gene-for-gene basis. Here, we report molecular basis of HR− (hypersensitive reaction—negative) type of resistance in Aganni (an indica rice variety possessing gall midge resistance gene Gm8) through the construction and analysis of a suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA library. In all, 2,800 positive clones were sequenced and analyzed. The high-quality ESTs were assembled into 448 non-redundant gene sequences. Homology search with the NCBI databases, using BlastX and BlastN, revealed that 73% of the clones showed homology to genes with known function and majority of ESTs belonged to the gene ontology category ‘biological process’. Validation of 27 putative candidate gall midge resistance genes through real-time PCR, following gall midge infestation, in contrasting parents and their derived pre-NILs (near isogenic lines) revealed induction of specific genes related to defense and metabolism. Interestingly, four genes, belonging to families of leucine-rich repeat (LRR), heat shock protein (HSP), pathogenesis related protein (PR), and NAC domain-containing protein, implicated in conferring HR+ type of resistance, were found to be up-regulated in Aganni. Two of the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)–scavenging-enzyme-coding genes Cytosolic Ascorbate Peroxidase1, 2 (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2) were found up-regulated in Aganni in incompatible interaction possibly suppressing HR. We suggest that Aganni has a deviant form of inducible, salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance but without HR.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3areactive oxygen species 3asalicylic acid 3apest resistance 3aparents 3aclones 3agenotype 3agene expression regulation 3adatabases 3aisogenic lines 3ametabolism 3ainsect pests 3acomplementary DNA 3aOrseolia oryzae 3acDNA libraries 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3aheat shock proteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aexpressed sequence tags 0agenes1 aSingh, Y.

This study investigated the responses of soil microbial community and enzyme activities to changes in moisture along a gradient of soil fertility formed within a long-term (24 years) field experiment. Soils (0–20 cm) were sampled from the plots under four fertilizer treatments: i) unfertilized control (CK), ii) organic manure (M), iii) nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers (NPK), and iv) NPK plus M (NPK + M). The soils were incubated at three moisture levels: constant submergence, five submerging-draining cycles (S-D cycles), and constant moisture content at 40% water-holding capacity (low moisture). Compared with CK, fertilization increased soil organic carbon (SOC) by 30.1%–36.3%, total N by 27.3%–38.4%, available N by 35.9%–56.4%, available P by 61.4%–440.9%, and total P by 28.6%–102.9%. Soil fertility buffered the negative effects of moisture on enzyme activities and microbial community composition. Enzyme activities decreased in response to submergence and S-D cycles versus low moisture. Compared with low moisture, S-D cycles increased total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and actinomycete, fungal, and bacterial PLFAs. The increased level of PLFAs in the unfertilized soil after five S-D cycles was greater than that in the fertilized soil. Variations in soil microbial properties responding to moisture separated CK from the long-term fertilization treatments. The coefficients of variation of microbial properties were negatively correlated with SOC, total P, and available N. Soils with higher fertility maintained the original microbial properties more stable in response to changes in moisture compared to low-fertility soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3apaddy soils 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphosphorus 3apotassium fertilizers 3asoil enzymes 3asoil fertility 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3asubmergence 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 0amicrobial property 0aphospholipid fatty acids 0asoil fertility 0asubmergence 0asubmerging-draining cycle1 aWU, Meng1 aLiu, Ming,1 aJIANG, Chunyu1 aCHEN, Xiaofen1 aKUZYAKOV, Yakov1 aRinklebe, Jörg,1 aLI, Zhongpei0 tPedosphere.g2018 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.323-331dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60010-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009400206300001600300520157400316592002801890650002001918650001301938650000901951650001301960650001201973650001101985650000801996650005002004650004302054650001902097650001502116650002302131650000902154650002402163650002102187651001002208700001902218773013302237856008302370852000902453655001202462IND60680857620221118021055.0200325e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068085762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-03010-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Satya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1324-159710aLand surface temperature variability across India: a remote sensing satellite perspective  ap. 773-784.  aLand surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in the surface energy budget computation and land surface process studies.

All-India mean LST characteristics show distinctive features as compared to the well-documented mean characteristics of near-surface air temperature. All land cover types except permanent snow and ice, and cold desert areas exhibit bimodal peaks in seasonal variations of daytime LST. The daytime LST over the coldest and high-altitude regions of northern India shows anomalous positive linear relationship with NDVI at a monthly scale. However, monthly domain-mean daytime LST of cropland regions is largely negatively correlated with NDVI as compared to other land cover types. Results reveal that about 17% of the Indian landmass received its hottest LST during 2010 followed by 2016. Linear trend analysis for the 15-year period of mean annual LST shows a decrease in diurnal temperature range over most parts of the country due to rather rapid increase in nighttime LST than daytime LST, similar as changes in near-surface air temperature across the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3acold 3acropland 3adeserts 3aenergy 3aice 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3asurface temperature 3avegetation types 3aIndia1 aNorouzi, Hamid0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Jan., v. 139, no. 1-2 p.773-784dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-03010-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245007800209520151000287592002801797650001101825650001901836650002001855650001001875650002001885650001301905700002501918700005701943700005702000700005702057700006102114773010802175856008102283852000902364655001202373IND60777332620221122024519.0220531e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1147072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAziz, Abu Zahid Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8995-805210aiACP-MultiCNN: Multi-channel CNN based anticancer peptides identification  aCancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world that often leads to misery and death. Current treatments include different kinds of anticancer therapy which exhibit different types of side effects. Because of certain physicochemical properties, anticancer peptides (ACPs) have opened a new path of treatments for this deadly disease. That is why a well-performed methodology for identifying novel anticancer peptides has great importance in the fight against cancer. In addition to the laboratory techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methodologies have developed in recent years for this task. Although these models have shown reasonable predictive ability, there's still room for improvement in terms of performance and exploring new types of algorithms. In this work, we have proposed a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying anticancer peptides from protein sequences. We have collected data from the existing state-of-the-art methodologies and applied binary encoding for data preprocessing. We have also employed k-fold cross-validation to train our models on benchmark datasets and compared our models' performance on the independent datasets. The comparison has indicated our models' superiority on various evaluation metrics. We think our work can be a valuable asset in finding novel anticancer peptides.

Weather affects both these renewable resources and the demand for electricity. The dominant large-scale pattern of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric variability is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), associated with positive correlations in wind, temperature and precipitation over northern Europe. The NAO's effect on wind-power and demand in the UK and Norway is examined, focussing on March when Norwegian hydropower reserves are low and the combined power system might be most susceptible to atmospheric variations. The NCEP/NCAR meteorological reanalysis dataset (1948–2010) is used to drive simple models for demand and wind-power, and ‘demand-net-wind’ (DNW) is estimated for positive, neutral and negative NAO states. Cold, calm conditions in NAO− cause increased demand and decreased wind-power compared to other NAO states. Under a 2020 wind-power capacity scenario, the increase in DNW in NAO− relative to NAO neutral is equivalent to nearly 25% of the present-day average rate of March Norwegian hydropower usage. As the NAO varies on long timescales (months to decades), and there is potentially some skill in monthly predictions, we argue that it is important to understand its impact on European power systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3acold 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3amodels 3aprediction 3atemperature 3awater power 3awind 3awind power 3aNorway 3aUnited Kingdom 0aMeteorology 0aVariability 0aRenewables1 aBrayshaw, David J.1 aMethven, John1 aCox, James1 aPearce, Oliver0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Nov., v. 62 p.1420-1427dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245020100173300001400374520111300388592002801501650002001529650001301549650001201562650001101574650001301585650003701598650000901635650000901644650001101653650001401664650001101678650001801689650002101707650001401728650001101742650001001753650003301763650001201796650001101808650000901819650001001828650001201838651002201850651001001872700001801882700002601900773008601926856008502012852000902097655001202106IND60084386720221119160207.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Alejandro10aMetal concentration and distribution in plant tissues of Nerium oleander (Apocynaceae, Plantae) from extremely acidic and less extremely acidic water courses in the Río Tinto area (Huelva, Spain)  ap. 87-91.  aNerium oleander L. is a micro–nano phanerophyte common in rivers, streams and temporary pools of water in southwestern Iberian Peninsula. In the mining area of Río Tinto, it grows in both extreme acidic and highly metal concentrated waters and in less extremely acidic water courses. In this work we study metal concentration and distribution in plant tissues of N. oleander by means of ICP-MS, SEM and EDX analysis. We observed differences between leaves and roots in the same plant, being Na, As, Fe and Pb concentrations significantly higher in the root. No differences in metal concentration and distribution between individuals of both environments were found. A deposition of Fe, Si, Al and K all over the root surface and the first cell layer of the epidermis with Pb and As in acidic water plants and Mn in less acidic water plants was observed. Ca druses and prismatic crystals were found in stems cortex and around leaves vascular bundle. Given the nutrient accumulation and the metal exclusion capacities of N. oleander, it could be of great interest in metal enriched soils phytostabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNerium oleander 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3acortex 3acrystals 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amining 3aphanerophytes 3aphytoremediation 3apotassium 3arivers 3aroots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asodium 3asoil 3astems 3astreams 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain1 aRufo, Lourdes1 ade la Fuente, Vicenta0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.87-91dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245012300159520113900282592002801421650004401449650002201493650003701515650001701552650001501569650001301584650002001597650002101617650001601638650002801654650001301682650001801695650001301713650001501726650001801741650001801759650001601777653003301793653003501826653002001861700001801881700001601899700001401915700001201929700001601941700001901957773010801976856008102084852000902165655001202174IND60777332720221122010233.0220531e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077733272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1147102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Na10aElectrochemical immunosensor based on AuNPs/Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800@graphene for rapid detection of aflatoxin B1 in peanut oil  aPeanut oil is a basic food raw material in life. However, aflatoxin contamination in peanut oil is considered to be one of the most serious food safety problems in the world. Based on AuNPs/Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800@graphene composite, a simple, efficient and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was developed to detect aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in peanut oil. The bare glassy carbon electrode was modified by graphene, bimetallic organic framework material (Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800), chitosan and gold nanoparticles. The electrochemical immunosensor was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the electrochemical signal changes after antibody and AFB1 binding were investigated in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the linear range of the electrochemical immunosensor was 0.18–100 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 0.18 ng/mL. In addition, the prepared sensor has high selectivity and long-term stability, which lays a foundation for the simple, rapid and sensitive detection of AFB1 in peanut oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaflatoxin B1 3aantibodies 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3afood safety 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3apeanut oil 3arapid methods 3araw materials 3avoltammetry 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aAuNPs/Zn/Ni-ZIF-8-800@graphene 0aRapid detection1 aLiu, Qingqing1 aHu, Xiaofei1 aWang, Fan1 aHu, Mei1 aYu, Qiuying1 aZhang, Gaiping0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 650 p.114710-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1147103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008500164300001600249520089200265592002801157650001801185650001301203650001001216700002101226700002201247773011401269856004801383852000901431655001201440IND4485677620221121060455.0120315e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448567762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-011-0177-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehrmann, Lutz10aTriangulation based inclusion probabilities: a design-unbiased sampling approach  ap. 107-123.  aA probabilistic sampling approach for design-unbiased estimation of area-related quantitative characteristics of spatially dispersed population units is proposed. The developed field protocol includes a fixed number of 3 units per sampling location and is based on partial triangulations over their natural neighbors to derive the individual inclusion probabilities. The performance of the proposed design is tested in comparison to fixed area sample plots in a simulation with two forest stands. Evaluation is based on a general approach for areal sampling in which all characteristics of the resulting population of possible samples is derived analytically by means of a complete tessellation of the areal sampling frame. The example simulation shows promising results.

This study is the first to systematically evaluate the effect of five major air pollution control measures in reducing mercury emissions, the total gaseous mercury (TGM) concentration and mercury deposition flux (FLX) for unit emissions reduction. From 2013 to 2017, China’s mercury emissions decreased from 571 to 444 tons, resulting in a 0.29 ng m–³ decrease in the TGM concentration, on average, and in a 17 μg m–² yr–¹ decrease in FLX. Ultralow emission renovations of coal-fired power plants are identified as the most effective emission abatement measure. As a result of this successful measure, coal-fired power plants are no longer the main mercury emitters. In 2017, the cement clinker sector became the largest emitter due to the use of less effective mercury removal measures. However, in terms of the mitigated TGM concentration and FLX levels per unit emission abatement, newly built wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) systems in coal-fired industrial boilers have become particularly effective in decreasing FLX levels. Therefore, to effectively reduce atmospheric mercury pollution in China, prioritizing mercury emissions control of cement clinkers and coal-fired industrial boilers is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution control 3acement 3acoal 3aflue gas desulfurization 3amercury 3apollution 3aChina1 aWu, Qingru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3381-47671 aWang, Long1 aWang, Shuxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9727-19631 aLiu, Tonghao1 aDing, Dian1 aTang, Yi1 aLi, Guoliang1 aTian, Hezhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3638-84951 aDuan, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9965-46181 aWang, Xun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7407-89651 aFu, Xuewu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5174-71501 aFeng, Xinbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7462-89981 aHao, Jiming0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 June 27, v. 53, no. 15 p.8938-8946dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b024283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015200169300001600321520129500337592002801632650002001660650001401680650001601694650002601710650002101736650001601757650002001773650001301793650001701806650002001823650001601843650001801859650001801877650002901895653002101924653002801945653001901973653002601992653001102018653002302029653002902052653002202081700001502103700001602118700001502134700001702149700001402166700001802180773013302198856008502331852000902416655001202425IND60636543720221118232831.0190410e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063654372DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60012-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongjun,10aProduction of Free Amino Acid and Short Peptide Fertilizer from Rapeseed Meal Fermentation Using Bacillus flexus NJNPD41 for Promoting Plant Growth  ap. 261-268.  aFree amino acids and short peptides (FAPS) that play an important role in plant nutrition can be extracted from rapeseed meal (RSM) by microbial enzymolysis. The enzymolytic activity of one bacterial strain isolated from RSM for the production of FAPS fertilizer (FAPSF) via solid-state fermentation, as well as its detoxification activity for isothiocyanates and oxazolidinethione, was investigated in this study. The strain NJNPD41 isolated from RSM piled-soil possessed effective proteolytic activity and was identified as Bacillus flexus on the basis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rDNA analysis. Compared to the uninoculated control, inoculation with the strain NJNPD41 significantly increased the yield of total free amino acids and short peptides by 115% and decreased the content of isothiocyanates and oxazolidinethione by 53% and 60%, respectively, after solid-state fermentation. The pot and field experiments showed that FAPSF significantly promoted eggplant growth and enhanced the fruit yield and quality of eggplant compared to the control. In conclusion, this study provided a novel method for the high-value utilization of RSM to produce high-quality and low-toxicity FAPSF using the newly isolated strain B. flexus NJNPD41.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus flexus 3aeggplants 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3afree amino acids 3afruit yield 3aisothiocyanates 3apeptides 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aproteolysis 3arapeseed meal 3aribosomal DNA 3asolid state fermentation 0abacterial strain 0adetoxification activity 0aisothiocyanate 0amicrobial enzymolysis 0aN pool 0aorganic fertilizer 0asolid-state fermentation 0aoxazolidinethione1 aZhong, Xi,1 aHuang, Yan,1 aQIAO, Cece1 aShao, Cheng,1 aLi, Rong,1 aShen, Qirong,0 tPedosphere.g2018 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.261-268dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60012-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011100169300001800280500001900298520116700317592002801484650001501512650001601527650001901543650001801562650001301580650001301593650001601606650002701622700002201649700002001671700002201691700002201713700002001735700002101755700002001776700001901796700002101815700002201836700001901858700001801877700001801895773015301913856008102066852000902147655001202156IND60686929520221123035548.0200320e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068692952DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590191101042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBushmanov, A.

In addition, a positive effect on the behavioral reactions of the irradiated animals and striated muscles strength was noted. In addition to these secondary features of the indralin positive effect, a significant reduction of radiation-induced DNA damage in spleenocytes was observed using flow cytometry analysis of phosphorylated histone Н2АХ (γН2АХ) (1 h and eight days after X-ray irradiation) and DNA-comet assay (eight days after X-ray irradiation). The abovementioned methods are recommended for experiments investigating the influence of radioprotective drugs on DNA damage induction and repair in the irradiated organism, as well as for initial searching of potential radioprotectors and assessment of their effectiveness level in clinical practice and experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aX-radiation 3aflow cytometry 3ahematopoiesis 3ahistones 3aimmunity 3airradiation 3aradioprotective agents1 aVorobyeva, N.

Results showed that açai polyphenolic extract (5–20 mg/L) inhibited preferentially the growth of SW-480 cells with no toxicity in CCD-18Co cells, and this was accompanied by reduction of H ₂O ₂-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The mechanisms involved in SW-480 cell growth-inhibition by açai polyphenolic extract included the downregulation of NF-κB proinflammatory transcription factor and the nuclear factor-kappa B targets intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Furthermore, prooncogenic specificity proteins (Sp) were downregulated as well as Sp-targets Bcl-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and survivin. This was accompanied by activation of mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway involving increase of cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-3, and decrease of PARP-1. Results strongly suggest that açai polyphenolic extract has antiinflammatory and cytotoxic activities in colon cancer cells and can be effective as natural colon cancer chemopreventive agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuterpe oleracea 3aadhesion 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell adhesion 3acell growth 3achemoprevention 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3anutrition 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aNoratto, Giuliana1 aMartino, Hercia Stampini Duarte1 aArbizu, Shirley1 aPeluzio, Maria do Carmo Gouveia1 aTalcott, Stephen1 aRamos, Afonso Mota1 aMertens-Talcott, Susanne U.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 66, no. 8 p.1394-1405dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.9562523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013000162300001400292520131900306592002801625650002901653650001501682650001901697650002001716650001401736650002301750650001701773650001501790650002801805650001301833650002001846650001801866650001401884650001801898650001501916650001401931650001401945653001601959653002201975653001401997653003202011653001802043700001502061700001302076700001702089700001702106700001302123700001602136700005702152700001602209700001802225773010002243856008302343852000902426655001202435IND60639250620221119113157.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yi10aPotassium-promoted magnesium ferrite on 3D porous graphene as highly efficient catalyst for CO hydrogenation to lower olefins  ap. 24-35.  aThree-dimensional (3D) honeycomb-like structured graphene (HSG)-supported ternary K-promoted magnesium ferrite catalysts (K-MgFe/HSG) are prepared and evaluated in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to the lower olefins (FTO). The catalysts bear interconnected mesoporous-macroporous framework of graphene nanosheets decorated with homogeneously sized magnesium ferrite nanoparticles (NPs). Under typical FTO reaction conditions, the composition-optimized 1K-MgFe/HSG catalyst affords a reduced CO2 selectivity of 40.4%, an excellent weight specific activity to hydrocarbons of 1825 μmolCO gFe−1 s−1, and an appreciable selectivity to the lower olefins (C2C4 olefins) of 57.8%, thus giving rise to a record high productivity of the lower olefins of 1055 μmolCO gFe−1 s−1. The excellent catalytic efficiency is tentatively attributed to the synergetic effect of Mg and K on adsorption and dissociation of CO. The catalyst also exhibits better durability than previously reported iron-based FTO catalysts, without significant changes in the catalytic performance and the size of the iron carbide NPs after 120 h on stream, highlighting the crucial role of the 3D porous HSG support in restricting the agglomeration of the active phase during the challenging high-temperature and exothermic FTO reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3adurability 3aferrimagnetic materials 3agraphene 3aheat production 3ahydrogenation 3amagnesium 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3apotassium 3asynergism 0a3D graphene 0aMagnesium ferrite 0aPotassium 0aFischer–Tropsch synthesis 0aLower olefins1 aTian, Jing1 aLin, Jun1 aWang, Shunwu1 aXie, Songhai1 aPei, Yan1 aYan, Shirun1 aQiao, Minghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8873-62011 aXu, Hualong1 aZong, Baoning0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.24-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011200169300001800281500002000299500000900319520156100328592002801889650000901917650002001926650001901946650001101965650001201976650002001988650001602008650000802024650001202032650002502044650002002069650002002089650000902109650001102118650002402129650002002153650001602173700002102189700002302210700002102233700001902254773013302273856008402406852000902490655001202499IND60665166320221121035945.0220513e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066516632DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.05.02892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaxter, Lisa L.10aStocker Beef Production on Low‐Water‐Input Systems in Response to Legume Inclusion: II. Water Footprint  ap. 2303-2312.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aInformation on the water footprint of pasture‐based beef production is useful for optimizing the allocation of groundwater to crop and livestock production. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of including legumes on three water footprints of grass‐based, beef stocker grazing systems with respect to observed and total (observed plus predicted from hay production) liveweight gain (LWG). Water inputs for the calculations included total or effective rainfall, total or corrected drip irrigation, and water directly consumed by the steers. When including rainfall in the calculation, water footprints were 16.2 to 40.5 vs. 1.7 to 8.6 m³ kg⁻¹ LWG when including groundwater only. Inclusion of legumes into the system reduced each water footprint with respect to observed LWG in all years (P ≤ 0.01). When total LWG was considered, the water footprint was lower in the grass‐legume system if rainfall (total or effective) was included (P < 0.01) but greater if the evaluation was restricted to irrigation and drinking water as inputs (P < 0.01). Overall, including legumes reduced the water footprint of beef LWG, largely because of greater rates of gain from the greater quality forages. Quantifying water use in the stocker phase adds a missing component in evaluating limited resources in the beef production life cycle. Managing legumes in mixture with warm‐season grasses and as a protein bank can increase the efficiency of beef grazing systems, resulting in an overall lower water footprint for animal weight gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef production 3adrinking water 3aforage 3agrazing 3agrazing systems 3agroundwater 3ahay 3alegumes 3alivestock production 3aliveweight gain 3amicroirrigation 3arain 3asteers 3awarm season grasses 3awater footprint 3aweight gain1 aWest, Charles P.1 aSarturi, Jhones O.1 aBrown, C.

Gastrointestinal and lung cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive nutritional supplement enriched with 2.2 g EPA or standard isocaloric one. Supplements were introduced 72 h before the first chemotherapy and continued for 4 wk. Serum C-reactive protein was measured and its variation was analyzed according to tumor location and treatment group. Compliance was assessed by phone contact and counting of supplement bottles returned after treatment. Sixty-nine patients were assessed, mean aged 65.5 yr old, most of them (59%) men. Gastrointestinal cancer was more prevalent and lung cancer had the highest C-reactive protein values (P = 0.009). Twenty-four patients interrupted treatment (trend for more interruption in EPA group), mainly because of gastrointestinal intolerance. No difference was found in C-reactive protein variation between EPA and control groups after treatment. Lung tumors showed higher inflammation than gastrointestinal ones. A short intervention with EPA was insufficient to reduce inflammation, which may be caused by the frequent abandoning of treatment. The beginning of chemotherapy may not be the optimal time point to initiate EPA supplementation because uncomfortable effects of both treatments may lead to poor adherence.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3aC-reactive protein 3ablood serum 3agastrointestinal system 3alung neoplasms 3acompliance 3amen 3aprotein value 3ainflammation 3anutrition 3abottles 3apatients 0achemotherapy1 aOrlandi, Silvana Paiva1 aGonzalez, M.

Due to their small size, distinct biogenesis, and heterogeneous marker expression, isolation and detection of single EV subpopulations are difficult. Here, we develop a λ-DNA- and aptamer-mediated approach allowing for simultaneous size-selective separation and surface protein analysis of individual EVs. Using a machine learning algorithm to EV signature based on their size and marker expression, we demonstrate that the isolated microvesicles are more efficient than exosomes and apoptotic bodies in discriminating breast cell lines and Stage II breast cancer patients with varied immunohistochemical expression of HER2. Our method provides an important tool to assess the EV heterogeneity at the single EV level with potential value in clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aapoptosis 3aartificial intelligence 3abiogenesis 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acell lines 3adiagnostic techniques 3aexosomes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apatients 3asurface proteins1 aZhao, Junxiang1 aTian, Fei1 aChang, Jianqiao1 aZhang, Wei1 aSun, Jiashu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4255-62020 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Feb. 21, v. 141, no. 9 p.3817-3821dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b000073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245007000197300002000267520139200287592002801679650001301707650001901720650001701739650002101756650001601777650002201793653002501815653001701840653001501857653002101872700001901893700001501912700001701927700001701944700005601961773014202017856007802159852000902237655001202246IND60608713020221121021100.0180808e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060871302DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b073342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1499-605910aSpray-Coated CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Films for Perovskite Photodiodes  ap. 26387-26395.  aLarge-area film deposition and high material utilization ratio are the crucial factors for large-scale application of perovskite optoelectronics. Recently, all-inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr₃ has attracted great attention because of its high phase stability, thermal stability, and photostability. However, most reported perovskite devices were fabricated by spin-coating, suffering from a low material utilization ratio of 1% and a small coverage area. Here, we developed a spray-coating technique to fabricate a CsPbBr₃ quantum dot (QD) film photodiode which had a high material utilization ratio of 32% and a deposition rate of 9 nm/s. The film growth process was studied, and substrate temperature and spray time were two key factors for the deposition of uniform and crack-free QD films. The spray-coated photodiode was demonstrated to be more suitable for working in the photodetector mode because a low dark current density of 4 × 10–⁴ mA cm–² resulting from an extremely low recombination current contributed to a high detectivity of 1 × 10¹⁴ Jones. A high responsivity of 3 A W–¹ was obtained at −0.7 V under 365 nm illumination, resulting from a low charge-transfer resistance and a high charge recombination resistance. We believe that the spray deposition technique will benefit the fabrication of perovskite QD film optoelectronics on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3alighting 3aphotostability 3aquantum dots 3aspray deposition 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0ainorganic perovskite 0aquantum dots 0aphotodiode 0aspray deposition1 aWang, Minqiang1 aLi, Junjie1 aDou, Jinjuan1 aQiu, Hengwei1 aShao, Jinyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2525-45870 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 12, v. 10, no. 31 p.26387-26395dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b073343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011400209300001600323520129700339592002801636650001401664650002301678650001301701650002101714650001101735650001201746650001801758650001101776650001401787650001401801650001701815650001401832653003001846653001701876653001401893653001101907653002201918700002201940700002601962700001701988700001702005700002102022700002502043700006202068773010202130856008302232852000902315655001202324IND60639250820221119113117.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajar, Yasmine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4583-929110aElectrochemical promotion of Bi-metallic Ni9Pd core double-shell nanoparticles for complete methane oxidation  ap. 127-135.  aElectrochemical promotion of Ni9Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with low Pd content (Ni:Pd = 9:1 atomic ratio) supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid-electrolyte was evaluated for the first time for complete methane oxidation. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) showed a Pd core with a Ni first shell surrounded by 3–4 nm layer of Pd outer shell. This core double-shell structure of Ni9Pd NPs enhanced the catalytic activity and stability compared to mono-metallic Pd and Ni NPs under open-circuit. The reversible electrochemical promotion of Ni9Pd was obtained upon positive polarization between 425 and 500 °C. At 425 °C, the reaction rate increase reached 240% corresponding to apparent Faradaic efficiency of 25. On Ni9Pd NPs the reaction exhibited electrophobic behavior, i.e., the rate increased with anodic polarization, under all experimental conditions of this study. The results demonstrate the advantage of using Ni9Pd bi-metallic nanoparticles with core double-shell structure for methane complete oxidation due to the synergetic effect between Pd and Ni and very low amount of expensive Pd phase. EPOC with this type of highly dispersed and low noble metal content catalysts may find a way in the real world catalytic converters for gas exhaust treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aspectroscopy 3asynergism 0aElectrochemical promotion 0aNEMCA effect 0aPalladium 0aNickel 0aMethane oxidation1 aVenkatesh, Balaji1 aHouache, Mohamed S.E.1 aLiu, Hanshuo1 aSafari, Reza1 aPrabhudev, Sagar1 aBotton, Gianluigi A.1 aBaranova, Elena A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5993-27400 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.127-135dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03971naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001600304520211100320592002802431650001202459650001102471650002102482650002002503650002902523650001902552650002102571650000902592650001602601650002102617650001802638650001002656650001202666650002102678650002302699650001502722650001102737650001802748650001802766650001602784650001002800651001102810653000802821653001602829653003602845653001402881653001402895653001902909653001502928653001302943653001202956700002602968700002202994700002203016700001903038700003303057700002103090773010403111856008503215852000903300655001203309IND60546316720221122005534.0160903e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054631672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrygoruk, Mateusz10aAssessing habitat exposure to eutrophication in restored wetlands: Model-supported ex-ante approach to rewetting drained mires  ap. 230-240.  aA multi-model-based study was performed in order to unravel valuable fen meadow habitats' possible exposure to eutrophication, which is expected to occur as a result of the re-saturation of degraded peat soils. The framework was tested in a 3000-ha fen-drain system to be restored in the Middle Biebrza Basin (northeast Poland), where the datasets and related models were used to delineate prospective eutrophication hotspots and nutrient transport. A 1-d hydrodynamic model and a 3-d groundwater flow model were applied to constitute the hydrological response of the fen-drain system to the prospective construction and function of weirs and spillways, which are expected to induce the increase of groundwater levels in degraded fens. A groundwater particle-tracking postprocessor was applied to delineate flow pathways and discharge zones and to determine water residence time in modelled layers. Soil and habitat maps, a high-resolution digital elevation model and historic groundwater level observations were applied to the model performance, calibration and spatial analysis of prospective eutrophication hotspots where increased eutrophication of groundwater can be expected due to the re-saturation of degraded peat soils. The study revealed that the large-scale fen rewetting that occurred as a result of surface water bodies' damming can potentially result in groundwater-driven nutrient dispersion along with an enhanced nutrient transport from a fen to the adjacent water bodies. Spatial analyses showed that, although the rewetting-driven eutrophication of Molinia fen meadows located in the study area is not likely, one can expect increased nutrient discharges to adjacent drains, inducing the contamination of ox-bow lakes located along the rivers. We propose the presented methodology to be applied ex-ante to fen-rewetting projects in strategic environmental assessments of restoration projects in order to manage the potentially negative environmental consequences of fen and river eutrophication with special regard to nutrient hotspots that are likely to occur within the rewetted fens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMolinia 3abasins 3adams (hydrology) 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3aeutrophication 3aex ante analysis 3afens 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3ameadows 3amodel validation 3anutrient transport 3apeat soils 3arivers 3asoil habitats 3asurface water 3awater table 3aweirs 3aPoland 0aFen 0aRestoration 0aEnvironmental impact assessment 0aHydrology 0aModelling 0aEutrophication 0aManagement 0aWetlands 0aBiebrza1 aBańkowska, Agnieszka1 aJabłońska, Ewa,1 aJanauer, Georg A.1 aKubrak, Janusz1 aMirosław-Świątek, Dorota,1 aKotowski, Wiktor0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.230-240dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04741naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002200186245013800208300001200346506007600358520244700434592002802881506003702909650002202946650002302968650001202991650002403003650001103027650001103038650001103049650003703060650004403097650001103141650001403152650002003166650003303186650001303219650002403232650003503256650002403291650001203315650005103327650001803378650001403396650001103410650004303421650001603464650002603480650000903506650006803515650002803583650005803611650003603669650004903705700002503754700001703779700002503796700002003821700002203841773009203863856007903955852000904034655001204043IND60080010520221207135528.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008001052DNAL7 aPMC40775802pmcid7 a249576842pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-2872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenton, Ashley A10aEngineered single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mosquito MEK docking site alter Plasmodium berghei development in Anopheles gambiae  ap. 287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Susceptibility to Plasmodium infection in Anopheles gambiae has been proposed to result from naturally occurring polymorphisms that alter the strength of endogenous innate defenses. Despite the fact that some of these mutations are known to introduce non-synonymous substitutions in coding sequences, these mutations have largely been used to rationalize knockdown of associated target proteins to query the effects on parasite development in the mosquito host. Here, we assay the effects of engineered mutations on an immune signaling protein target that is known to control parasite sporogonic development. By this proof-of-principle work, we have established that naturally occurring mutations can be queried for their effects on mosquito protein function and on parasite development and that this important signaling pathway can be genetically manipulated to enhance mosquito resistance. METHODS: We introduced SNPs into the A. gambiae MAPK kinase MEK to alter key residues in the N-terminal docking site (D-site), thus interfering with its ability to interact with the downstream kinase target ERK. ERK phosphorylation levels in vitro and in vivo were evaluated to confirm the effects of MEK D-site mutations. In addition, overexpression of various MEK D-site alleles was used to assess P. berghei infection in A. gambiae. RESULTS: The MEK D-site contains conserved lysine residues predicted to mediate protein-protein interaction with ERK. As anticipated, each of the D-site mutations (K3M, K6M) suppressed ERK phosphorylation and this inhibition was significant when both mutations were present. Tissue-targeted overexpression of alleles encoding MEK D-site polymorphisms resulted in reduced ERK phosphorylation in the midgut of A. gambiae. Furthermore, as expected, inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling due to D-site mutations resulted in reduction in P. berghei development relative to infection in the presence of overexpressed catalytically active MEK. CONCLUSION: MEK-ERK signaling in A. gambiae, as in model organisms and humans, depends on the integrity of conserved key residues within the MEK D-site. Disruption of signal transmission via engineered SNPs provides a purposeful proof-of-principle model for the study of naturally occurring mutations that may be associated with mosquito resistance to parasite infection as well as an alternative genetic basis for manipulation of this important immune signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aalleles 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3alysine 3amidgut 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3amodels 3aparasites 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Line 2aFemale 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLeviviridae 2aMalariaxparasitology 2aMice 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmodium bergheixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods1 aSouvannaseng, Lattha1 aCheung, Kong1 aAnishchenko, Michael1 aBrault, Aaron C1 aLuckhart, Shirley0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.287-287dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-2873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007400159300001400233520141800247592002801665650003001693650002901723650001201752650001501764650001401779650002801793650001201821650001701833650001201850650002001862650001501882650001601897650001201913650002101925650002201946650001101968651001001979700002101989700002502010773011902035856007202154852000902226655001202235IND60662259120221119045846.0190904e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066225912DNAL7 a10.1039/b605839f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdsul, Mukund G.10aLactic acid production from waste sugarcane bagasse derived cellulose  ap. 58-62.  aProduction of l(+)lactic acid from sugarcane bagasse cellulose, one of the abundant biomass materials available in India, was studied. The bagasse was chemically treated to obtain a purified bagasse cellulose sample, which is much more amenable to cellulase enzyme attack than bagasse itself. This sample, at high concentration (10%), was hydrolyzed by cellulase enzyme preparations (10 FPU g⁻¹ cellulose) derived from mutants generated in our own laboratory. We obtained maximum hydrolysis (72%), yielding glucose and cellobiose as the main end products. Lactic acid was produced from this bagasse cellulose sample by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) in a media containing a cellulase enzyme preparation derived from Penicillium janthinellum mutant EU1 and cellobiose utilizing Lactobacillus delbrueckii mutant Uc-3. A maximum lactic acid concentration of 67 g l⁻¹ was produced from a concentration of 80 g l⁻¹ of bagasse cellulose, the highest productivity and yield being 0.93 g l⁻¹ h⁻¹ and 0.83 g g⁻¹, respectively. The mutant Uc-3 was found to utilize high concentrations of cellobiose (50 g l⁻¹) and convert it into lactic acid in a homo-fermentative way. Considering that bagasse is a waste material available in abundance, we propose to valorize this biomass to produce cellulose and then sugars, which can be fermented to products such as ethanol and lactic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii 3aPenicillium janthinellum 3abiomass 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3amutants 3asaccharification 3asugarcane bagasse 3awastes 3aIndia1 aVarma, Anjani J.1 aGokhale, Digambar V.0 tGreen chemistry.g2007 Jan. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.58-62dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b605839f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245007700221300001600298520124600314592002801560650002201588650001101610650001801621650000901639650001501648650002901663650001501692650002001707650001801727653002901745653002801774653002501802653004101827700002301868700002301891700003301914700001901947773010401966856008502070852000902155655001202164IND60546316820221122024858.0160903e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054631682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.01.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanasi︠u︡k, Oleksandr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3591-368910aContamination of stormwater by wastewater: A review of detection methods  ap. 241-250.  aEven in separate sewer systems, wastewater may find its way into the receiving waters through stormwater sewers. The main reasons for this are cross-connections, illicit connections, overflows and leakages through broken sewers. Such discharges may affect receiving water quality and increase risks to public health and aquatic organisms. Detecting wastewater contamination and locating its points of ingress into storm sewer systems can be a challenging task, which should be addressed using proper methods and indicator parameters. A number of detection methods have already been proposed in this area, yet there is a lack of a general overview of such methods. This literature review summarizes and evaluates the methods used for detecting wastewater in stormwater, including those recently developed. The advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods are discussed. It is concluded that while no single method can as yet produce results in a precise, fast and inexpensive way, the use of human waste specific chemical and microbiological markers, and their innovative sampling, offer the way forward. Guidance for selecting the most effective combinations of detection methods, under specific conditions, is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3ahumans 3apublic health 3arisk 3astormwater 3astormwater sewer systems 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater quality 0aStormwater contamination 0aDetection of wastewater 0aIndicator parameters 0aChemical and microbiological markers1 aHedström, Annelie1 aMaršálek, Jiři,1 aAshley, R.

We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet with low energy density (ED) enriched in rapeseed oil, resulting in high MUFA content and an ALA intake of 3·5 g/d on body weight and cardiovascular risk profile in eighty-one patients with the metabolic syndrome in comparison with an olive oil diet rich in MUFA, but with a low ALA content. After a 6-month dietary intervention, body weight was significantly reduced in the rapeseed oil and olive oil groups (− 7·8 v. − 6·0 kg; P < 0·05). There were significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and insulin levels in both groups (P < 0·05). For all of these changes, no inter-group differences were observed. After the rapeseed oil diet, diastolic blood pressure declined more than after the olive oil diet (P < 0·05 for time × group interaction). Furthermore, concentrations of serum TAG were significantly reduced after the high ALA intake, but not in the low ALA group (P < 0·05 for time × group interaction). In conclusion, our dietary food pattern with a low ED and high intakes of MUFA and ALA may be a practical approach for long-term dietary treatment in patients with the metabolic syndrome, leading to weight reduction and an improvement in the overall cardiovascular risk profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adiastolic blood pressure 3aenergy density 3ainsulin 3alow calorie diet 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutritional intervention 3aolive oil 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apatients 3arapeseed 3arapeseed oil 3arisk profile 3asystolic blood pressure 3aweight loss 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aDietary therapy 0aRapeseed oil 0aα-Linolenic acid 0aWeight reduction1 aStratmann, Bernd1 aLee-Barkey, Young Hee1 aTschoepe, Diethelm1 aWahrburg, Ursel0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Aug. 28, v. 108, no. 4 p.682-691dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145120028753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245008600162300001800248520122200266592002801488650002201516650001301538650001101551650001401562650002001576650001501596650001201611650001401623650002201637650002001659650001301679650001701692650001801709650001401727650001201741700001901753700002401772700001901796700002201815773012401837856007201961852000902033655001202042IND60662259220221119045954.0190904e20061201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066225922DNAL7 a10.1039/b605851e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenwell, H.

Here we describe a synthetic approach for the production of layered double hydroxides containing organic (acetate) anions by a method that requires no excess of base, filtering or washing of the product. A mixture of a slurry of aluminium trihydroxide (or its thermally treated form), magnesium oxide, and magnesium acetate are reacted under atmospheric or autogenous conditions to prepare MgAl-acetate LDHs of general formula Mg₁₋ₓAlₓ(OH)₂(CH₃CO₂)ₓ·yH₂O. Using this synthetic procedure it has been found that MgAl-acetate LDHs with either a full or partial acetate loading may be prepared for a range of Mg/Al stoichiometries. The LDHs formed have been characterised by X-ray diffraction, infra-red spectroscopy, solid state nmr and thermal methods. Depending on the synthesis method, the acetate LDHs had an interlayer spacing of between ca. 8.4 and 14.8 Å indicating the formation of monolayers and bilayers of acetate anions, respectively, in the LDH host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3aanions 3acatalysts 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxides 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3amagnesium acetate 3amagnesium oxide 3aslurries 3aspectroscopy 3astoichiometry 3asynthesis 3awashing1 aJones, William1 aStamires, Dennis N.1 aO'Connor, Paul1 aBrady, Michael F.0 tGreen chemistry.g2006 Dec. 1, v. 8, no. 12 p.1067-1072dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b605851e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018300166300001800349500001900367520198000386592002802366650001502394650001702409650001102426650001102437773015302448856008102601852000902682655001202691IND60686930020221123034036.0200320e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068693002DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590191101652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoterov, A.

The philosophical and scientific concepts necessary for understanding the meaning, essence, and possibility of practical application of the criteria (rules, principles) for establishing the truth of associations revealed in medical and biological disciplines are presented. Five types of definitions of the causes and causality were found, which vary from the simplest explanatory (“by production”) to the complex, for deterministic and stochastic effects (necessary and sufficient causes, component causes, probabilistic causes, and counterfactual causes). Many of these definitions originate from famous philosophers (mostly D. Hume). A selection of statements revealing the scientific, practical and social goals of epidemiology and other causality studies important for human life and activity is presented. These goals are primarily related with evidence of the truth of the revealed dependences of effects on agents and impacts, however methods for their achievement can be based on different rules and ethical foundations established on scientific or social tasks. In the second case, the “precautionary principle” is used, and the norms of research developed for application in the scientific community are simplified, in may respects being replaced by prevention or at least reduction of risks, even if the reality of the latter does not have strict scientific evidence. Examples of false but statistically significant associations from various biomedical and social spheres (including estimates of effects of radiation exposure) caused by confound factors are presented. These examples indicate the need to use standardized criteria for assessing the truth of causality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconception 3aepidemiology 3aethics 3ahumans0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2019 Dec., v. 46, no. 11 p.1458-1488dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237766x1062-35907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623590191101653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245009800200300001600298506007600314520119900390592002801589506003701617650001801654650001501672650001301687650003301700650004001733650001501773650002301788650001401811650001801825650001701843650001001860653002301870653002501893653002601918700002501944700002201969700002201991700002202013773014102035856007302176852000902249655001202258IND60515103520221207093618.0160311e20120410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051510352DNAL7 a10.1139/h2012-0152doi7 aPMC35700432pmcid7 a224863792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, David J.10aExercise-induced vasodilation is associated with menopause stage in healthy middle-aged women  ap. 418-424.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeg exercise hemodynamics during single-leg knee extensions were compared among healthy groups of early perimenopausal (n = 15), late perimenopausal (n = 12), and early postmenopausal (n = 11) women. Femoral blood flow (FBF) and vascular conductance (FVC) at rest and during very light work rates (0 and 5 W) were similar among all three menopause stage groups. Vascular responses at 10 W (FBF) and 20 W (FBF and FVC) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in early perimenopausal compared with late perimenopausal women. At 15 and 25 W, FBF and FVC were similar between late perimenopausal and early postmenopausal groups but higher (P < 0.05) in early perimenopausal women as compared with the other two menopausal groups. In the combined sample of all three menopause stage groups, follicle-stimulating hormone was significantly correlated with vascular conductance during submaximal (15 W) exercise (R = –0.56, P < 0.001), even after adjustment for age, fitness, LDL cholesterol, and abdominal fat (R = –0.46, P = 0.005). Collectively, these findings suggest that in middle-aged women, there is an association between menopause stage and leg vascular responsiveness during exercise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabdominal fat 3ablood flow 3aexercise 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolism 3amiddle-aged adults 3anutrition 3apostmenopause 3avasodilation 3awomen 0aexercise hyperemia 0amenopause transition 0areproductive hormones1 aGonzales, Joaquin U.1 aTucker, Steven H.1 aElavsky, Steriani1 aProctor, David N.0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2012 Apr. 10, v. 37, no. 3 p.418-424dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/h2012-0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001800295520175700313592002802070650001402098650001902112650001502131650001102146650001302157650001502170650001302185650002202198651001002220700002602230773010202256856008102358852000902439655001202448IND60080010720221121205034.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008001072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-013-9743-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvendaño, Miguel10aReproductive cycle of Aulacomya ater [Bivalvia: Mytilidae (Molina 1782)] in Punta Arenas Cove (Antofagasta Region, Chile)  ap. 1229-1244.  aChanges in the condition of broodstock, presence of larvae, and post-larval settlement of A. ater in Punta Arenas Cove (Antofagasta Region, Chile) were used to determine its reproductive cycle. The condition used as a spawning indicator shows that these events occur in three periods throughout the year (May–July, August–November, and December–February). Intense periods recorded in October–November and December–February coincided with periods in which the water temperature descended to less than 13 °C. Simultaneously, plankton samples indicated constant presence of A. ater larvae at this site, with large increases in abundance during August and between October and January, reaching a maximum of 2,192 larvae m⁻³in October. The periods of increase in larval abundance coincide with spawning periods; however, the greatest abundances were recorded before the start of the descent of the spawning indicator of the population under study. Monthly installation and replacement of collectors, after recording the first spawning, showed the permanent settlement of A. ater post-larvae over the course of the study, with a period of greater intensity occurring from the end of August to the end of January, registering peaks in October and November with 5,667 and 4,183 post-larvae × 600 cm² collector⁻¹, months which also coincide with the greatest larval abundance. The presence of larvae and post-larvae of the mytilids Choromytilus chorus and Semimytilus algosus was also recorded alongside A. ater larvae and post-larvae. Ch. chorus presented a cycle very similar to that of A. ater in both stages, with a maximum abundance of 4,531 larvae m⁻³in November and 13,533 post-larvae × 600 cm² collector⁻¹in December.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilidae 3abreeding stock 3acollectors 3alarvae 3aplankton 3apostlarvae 3aspawning 3awater temperature 3aChile1 aCantillánez, Marcela0 tAquaculture international.g2014 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.1229-1244dSpringer-Verlagx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-013-9743-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166300001800302500001900320520178100339592002802120650002502148650001602173650001502189650001802204650002302222650001002245650001302255650001602268650001602284650003002300650002402330650001602354700002002370700002002390700001902410700002302429700002202452773015302474856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60686930120221123025856.0200320e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068693012DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590191100622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmina, N.

Accumulated doses to red bone marrow (RBM) ranged from 0.2 to 2.95 Gy. The time between the end of work with radiation and blood sampling was on average 15.95 ± 1.22 years. Fifty unirradiated residents of Ozyorsk matched by age to the exposed group were enrolled as a control group. Promoter hypermethylation was analyzed using methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The trend towards dependence of promoter hypermethylation of p14/ARF and RASSFA genes on age rather than radiation exposure (logistic regression: p = 0.072) confirms previous results. The frequency of individuals with promoter methylation of at least one of the following six genes: p16/INK4A, GSTP1, р53, АТМ,SOD3,ESR1, in irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (62.5 versus 34%, respectively, p = 0.001, OR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.56–6.69). A significantly elevated frequency of individuals with hypermethylated СpG islands in GSTP1 and SOD3 promoters was revealed among exposed subjects compared to the control group (p = 0.014 and p = 0.021, respectively). A statistically significant association between the cumulative dose and the number of methylated promoters was revealed (r = 0.304, р = 3.2 × 10–⁴). Therefore, the dose-dependent hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene promoters that is revealed in blood leukocytes long term after external exposure to γ-radiation was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abone marrow 3acell cycle 3adose response 3aestrogen receptors 3agenes 3aindustry 3airradiation 3amethylation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3axenobiotics1 aLapteva, N.

Nine diets (30 % CP 20 MJ kg⁻¹) were formulated by substituting fishmeal (FM) for kikuyu leaf meal (KLM) and moringa leaf meal (MLM). A control diet contained 10 % FM and no leaf meal. FM was replaced at 25, 50, 75 and 100 % by KLM in diets: KLM 25, KLM 50, KLM 75 and KLM 100, and then by MLM in diets: MLM 25, MLM 50, MLM 75 and MLM 100, respectively. Maize and gluten meals were adjusted accordingly. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish for 60 days. The best growth (SGR and TGC) was in the control group. There was no significant (P > 0.05) decrease in SGR and TGC when KLM replaced up to 50 % FM. There was a significant (P < 0.05) decrease when MLM replaced >25 % FM. Kikuyu diets had no effect on villi height. A trend towards shorter villi was evident with increasing MLM. Hepatocyte degradation was higher in fish fed moringa-based diets. Anti-nutrients (tannins and polyphenols) in moringa may have contributed to the poor growth, irritation of the enterocytes and hepatotoxic effects. These results show that replacing up to 25 % FM with KLM is effective in reducing the costs without negatively impacting the growth performance or health of T. rendalli. Adding MLM even at the lowest level (25 %) was expensive and resulted in compromised growth and health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aPennisetum clandestinum 3acorn 3aenterocytes 3afish 3afish meal 3agluten 3agrowth performance 3ahepatotoxicity 3aleaves 3apolyphenols 3aprotein sources 3atannins 3avilli1 aMoyo, N.

A reference curve of Ncᵣ decrease (Ref-Ncᵣ) with SB increase proposed for C₃ species (Ref-Ncᵣ=48 SB⁻⁰.³²) was validated for several crops growing without water deficiency in different sites and seasons; however, the validity of Ref-Ncᵣ is uncertain when water is limiting. The objective was to assess whether water stress affects Ncᵣ. Five regrowths of a temperate-type tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] were followed during autumn, spring, and summer in Balcarce, Argentina. Several N rates were applied and SB accumulation and N concentration were measured in each of four to six sequential SB harvests performed at every regrowth. SB, Ncᵣ, available soil water, reference evapotranspiration (ET₀), and real evapotranspiration (RET) were estimated. Ncᵣ agreed well with Ref-Ncᵣ when soil water was nonlimiting, but it was consistently lower than Ref-Ncᵣ whenever crop RET was reduced (RET/ET₀<1). Indeed, crop average Ncᵣ during an entire regrowth scaled linearly with the average level of water stress in the period: (Ncᵣ/Ref-Ncᵣ)ₐᵥg = 0.83 (RET/ET₀)ₐᵥg + 0.22 (R² = 0.90, p < 0.0001). Hence, while Ref-Ncᵣ remains appropriate for assessing crop N status under adequate water availability conditions, the N nutrition management of water stressed crops should be guided by their actualNcᵣ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acrops 3aevapotranspiration 3anitrogen content 3anutrition 3aplant available water 3aregrowth 3aspring 3asummer 3awater stress 3aArgentina1 aAgnusdei, Mónica G.1 aLattanzi, Fernando A.1 aMarino, María A.1 aBerone, Germán D.0 tCrop science.g2014 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.318-330dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.08.05613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245021200167300001600379520159300395592002801988650002802016650002802044650001102072650001702083650002502100650001102125650001802136650001702154650002102171651001302192653002402205653003002229653002002259653002402279653002502303653002702328700001902355700002002374700001802394773010402412856008502516852000902601655001202610IND60546317020221122025020.0160903e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054631702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInam, Azhar10aUsing causal loop diagrams for the initialization of stakeholder engagement in soil salinity management in agricultural watersheds in developing countries: A case study in the Rechna Doab watershed, Pakistan  ap. 251-267.  aOver the course of the last twenty years, participatory modeling has increasingly been advocated as an integral component of integrated, adaptive, and collaborative water resources management. However, issues of high cost, time, and expertise are significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of participatory modeling in many developing countries. In this study, a step-wise method to initialize the involvement of key stakeholders in the development of qualitative system dynamics models (i.e. causal loop diagrams) is presented. The proposed approach is designed to overcome the challenges of low expertise, time and financial resources that have hampered previous participatory modeling efforts in developing countries. The methodological framework was applied in a case study of soil salinity management in the Rechna Doab region of Pakistan, with a focus on the application of qualitative modeling through stakeholder-built causal loop diagrams to address soil salinity problems in the basin. Individual causal loop diagrams were developed by key stakeholder groups, following which an overall group causal loop diagram of the entire system was built based on the individual causal loop diagrams to form a holistic qualitative model of the whole system. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach, based on using causal loop diagrams in initiating stakeholder involvement in the participatory model building process. In addition, the results point to social-economic aspects of soil salinity that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural watersheds 3abasins 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3amodels 3asoil salinity 3astakeholders 3awater management 3aPakistan 0aSalinity management 0aStakeholder participation 0aSystem thinking 0aCausal loop diagram 0aStakeholder analysis 0aParticipatory modeling1 aAdamowski, Jan1 aHalbe, Johannes1 aPrasher, Shiv0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 152 p.251-267dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011200158300002000270520139600290592002801686650001101714650002501725650001101750650001601761650002201777650001201799650001401811653002301825653002801848653002501876653002001901653002901921700005401950700006402004700002802068700005202096773014202148856007802290852000902368655001202377IND60608713420221120034520.0180808e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060871342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b075682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sha10aPrinciples of Design for Substrate-Supported Molecular Switches Based on Physisorbed and Chemisorbed States  ap. 26772-26780.  aThe physisorbed (precursor) and chemisorbed states of a molecule on metal surfaces can be utilized to build a logic switch at the single-molecule level, enabling further microminiaturization of electronic devices beyond the silicon limits. However, a serious drawback of this design is easy lateral diffusion of the molecule in the physisorbed state, which may destroy the normal switch operation. Here, we demonstrate that anchoring engineering can be an effective way to enhance the stability of molecular switches without degrading switching functionality. As exemplified by trans-ADT on Cu(111), we show that the lateral diffusion of such molecular switch can be obstructed by the anchoring of the ending thiophene groups, along with a rotation of the adsorbate during the switching process. More general, our results also suggest that when searching for molecular switches with reversible physisorbed and chemisorbed states with excellent bistability and lateral stability, the focus should be on finding molecules with a moderate HOMO–LUMO energy gap and anchoring atoms with positive charge that can then be deposited on substrates with which they interact moderately. This allows further improvement of the lateral and vertical stability of such a molecular switch by substituting the thiophene groups with selenophene, thus establishing trans-ADS on Cu(111) as a promising switch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3aengineering 3amaterials science 3asilicon 3athiophene 0amolecular switches 0aorganic/metal interface 0avan der Waals forces 0aprecursor state 0aconformational switching1 aLi, Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5578-50341 aFilimonov, Sergey N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3812-33751 aFuentes-Cabrera, Miguel1 aLiu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3016-73810 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 12, v. 10, no. 31 p.26772-26780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b075683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009100163300001600254520149900270592002801769650002201797650001601819650001201835650001501847650001501862650001301877650002201890650001601912651001001928653001601938653002701954653003501981653001802016653003102034773012402065856008002189852000902269655001202278IND60622432720221118082433.0181125e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062243272DNAL7 a10.1177/09730052166659392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Nitin10aDecline of Cultivators and Growth of Agricultural Labourers in India from 2001 to 2011  ap. 179-198.  aAccording to Census data, the proportion of working to the total population in India grew from 39.1 per cent in 2001 to 39.8 per cent in 2011. The working population comprises four categories: cultivators (C.L.),¹ agricultural labourers (A.L.),² household industry workers (H.H.) ³ and other workers (O.W.).⁴ The decade of 2001–11 has seen a decline in the number of cultivators and high increase in the number of agricultural labourers. This is disturbing the development for India. For the first time since independence, agricultural labourers have outnumbered cultivators. There are many reasons for this development such as decreasing average size of operational holdings, farming becoming infeasible, increasing agricultural wages, rampant selling of agricultural land and shift of employment from the agricultural to non-agricultural sector (Figure 3). The decade of 2001–11 also witnessed three drought years. This article explains these reasons in detail. Cultivators are decreasing and such decline in agriculture is replaced by increase in agricultural labourers. There has been a definite marginalization of agrarian interest in the national policy and reforms are certainly needed. This article tries to study the pattern of growth of cultivators and agricultural labourers for the states having population of more than 25 million as per Census 2011. There is a marginal increase in the number of household industry workers but high increase in the number of other workers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acensus data 3adrought 3aemployment 3afarm labor 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alabor force 3aIndia 0aCultivators 0aagricultural labourers 0awork participation rate5 (WPR) 0aother workers 0ahousehold industry workers0 tInternational journal of rural management.g, v. 12, no. 2 p.179-198dSAGE PublicationswJournal:21330x0973-06807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09730052166659393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001800163245005900181300001800240500000900258520157500267592002801842650002201870650001901892650001101911650001501922650002501937650001901962650001101981650001901992650001902011650002202030650001302052650001102065700001802076700001702094700001302111773012302124856009802247852000902345655001202354IND60665167220221120125758.0191122e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066516722DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400060007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGawronska, H.10aPartitioning of Photoassimilates by Four Potato Clones  ap. 1031-1036.  aepub  aThe partitioning of photoassimilates was compared for four field-grown potato clones. Russet Burbank was used as a standard for comparison, and the other three clones were selected because they generally produce higher yields and have higher photosynthetic rates than Russet Burbank. In this study we examined whether the patterns of assimilate partitioning change with the stage of plant development and with the time after labelling and also whether these partitioning patterns vary for different clones. The most recently-expanded leaf on each plant was labelled with ¹⁴CO₂ at three different growth stages: the beginning of tuberization, 3 and 5-weeks later; and representative plants from each treatment were harvested at three time intervals: 2 h after labelling, 7 days after labelling, and the end of the growing season. The total quantity of ¹⁴C-1abel exported from the exposed leaf increased beth with age of the plant and with time after labelling. The exported assimilates were partitioned in varying quantities to all plant organs, including trace amounts to the mother tubers (seed pieces). Some of the assimilates produced after tuber set and originally partitioned to other organs may have been remobilized to the tubers near the end of the season. At later growth stages, some clones delivered assimilates to the tubers more rapidly than others. The potential exists for plant breeders to combine late season maintenance of photosynthesis with rapid and/or greater delivery of assimilates to the tubers as an approach for increasing tuber yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acarbon dioxide 3aclones 3acrop yield 3adevelopmental stages 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant breeders 3aplant development 3apotatoes 3atubers1 aDwelle, R.

However, because the sizes of the compound anions are greatly larger than the lamellar spacing of graphite, common graphite used as cathode may suffer from slow kinetics and large volume expansion. Here, it is demonstrated that graphite with high crystallinity and nanosheet-bricked porous structure can be an excellent cathode for aluminum-ion batteries. This porous graphite is derived from carbon black via a simple electrochemical graphitization in molten CaCl₂, and the high crystallinity and thin layer characters facilitate the high capacity and high rate storage of aluminum tetrachloride ions. Moreover, the bricked porous structure endows the fabricated cathode with a providential porosity to perfectly match the huge volume expansion of graphite (650% against a charging capacity of 100 mA h g–¹), thus this electrochemical graphite exhibits integrated high gravimetric and volumetric capacities as well as high structural stability during cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abatteries 3acalcium chloride 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amaterials science 3aporosity 0agraphite cathodes 0arechargeable aluminum batteries 0aporous graphite 0avolumetric capacity 0aamorphous carbon 0agraphitization1 aHe, Rui1 aZhang, Jichen1 aHu, Yang1 aWang, Zhiyong1 aJin, Xianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3095-89790 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 19, v. 10, no. 31 p.26510-26516dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b075903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003900151245008900190300001600279520170700295592002802002650000902030650001702039650001402056650001202070650001602082650002102098650001802119650001102137650000902148650001702157653002102174653001702195653001102212653001702223700002002240700002202260700001902282700002202301700001602323700001702339700002102356773010302377856008502480852000902565655001202574IND60546317320221122025036.0160903e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054631732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndriamanohiarisoamanana, Fetra J.10aEffects of handling parameters on hydrogen sulfide emission from stored dairy manure  ap. 110-116.  aHydrogen sulfide (H2S) emission from liquid manure in the process preceding field application is an important issue in fertigation systems. Given that H2S poses a significant health risk, it is important to determine the effects of different handling parameters on H2S emissions to prevent health risks to farmers. In this study, the effects of total solids (TS; 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11%) and mixing speed (100, 200, 300, and 400 rpm), duration (5, 15, 30, and 60 min), and frequency (one, two, three, and four times a day) on H2S emissions from two different dairy manures were investigated. The results indicate that the quantity of sulfur-containing substrate intake determines the potential of dairy manure to emit H2S because manure from cows fed with concentrate-based feed generates higher amounts of H2S than manure from cows fed with forage-based feed. The H2S concentration increased with TS concentration and reached a maximum of 1133 ppm at a TS of 9%; thereafter, it decreased with further increases in TS concentration. H2S emission increased with mixing speed with a peak concentration of 3996 ppm at 400 rpm. A similar trend was observed for mixing duration. However, there were no significant differences between the amounts H2S emitted at different frequencies of mixing (P > 0.05). The results indicate that mixing speed, duration, and TS are the major determinants of the quantity of H2S emitted from dairy manure. Therefore, to prevent health risks associated with H2S emission from dairy manure, it is recommended that the mixing speed and duration should be kept as low as possible, while a TS concentration of above 9% should be applied during the fertigation of dairy manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3adairy manure 3aemissions 3afarmers 3afertigation 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aliquid manure 3amixing 3arisk 3atotal solids 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aDairy manure 0aMixing 0aTotal solids1 aSakamoto, Yushi1 aYamashiro, Takaki1 aYasui, Seiichi1 aIwasaki, Masahiro1 aIhara, Ikko1 aTsuji, Osamu1 aUmetsu, Kazutaka0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 May 01, v. 154 p.110-116dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04437naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002000186245017100206300001600377506007600393520186500469592002802334506003702362650002802399650002202427650001202449650002002461650001002481650001602491650001702507650001202524650002302536650002402559650001202583650001102595650001902606650000702625650001402632650002002646650001402666650001302680650001702693650001402710650001202724650005302736650002402789650003002813650003302843650008002876650003802956650001102994650004303005650001603048650001103064650003103075650002803106650002503134650003203159650001303191650002103204650001403225650002403239650002603263650001403289650004503303700002003348700002103368700002103389700001903410773010003429856008103529852000903610655001203619IND4480941720221207070946.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448094172DNAL7 a223432802pmid7 aPMC33192532pmcid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Kwang-Woo10aTwo cation transporters Ena1 and Nha1 cooperatively modulate ion homeostasis, antifungal drug resistance, and virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans via the HOG pathway  ap. 332-345.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaintenance of cation homeostasis is essential for survival of all living organisms in their biological niches. It is also important for the survival of human pathogenic fungi in the host, where cation concentrations and pH will vary depending on different anatomical sites. However, the exact role of diverse cation transporters and ion channels in virulence of fungal pathogens remains elusive. In this study we functionally characterized ENA1 and NHA1, encoding a putative Na⁺/ATPase and Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter, respectively, in Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidiomycete fungal pathogen which causes fatal meningoencephalitis. Expression of NHA1 and ENA1 is induced in response to salt and osmotic shock mainly in a Hog1-dependent manner. Phenotypic analysis of the ena1Δ, nha1Δ, and ena1Δnha1Δ mutants revealed that Ena1 controls cellular levels of toxic cations, such as Na⁺ and Li⁺ whereas both Ena1 and Nha1 are important for controlling less toxic K⁺ ions. Under alkaline conditions, Ena1 was highly induced and required for growth in the presence of low levels of Na⁺ or K⁺ salt and Nha1 played a role in survival under K⁺ stress. In contrast, Nha1, but not Ena1, was essential for survival at acidic conditions (pH 4.5) under high K⁺ stress. In addition, Ena1 and Nha1 were required for maintenance of plasma membrane potential and stability, which appeared to modulate antifungal drug susceptibility. Perturbation of ENA1 and NHA1 enhanced capsule production and melanin synthesis. However, Nha1 was dispensable for virulence of C. neoformans although Ena1 was essential. In conclusion, Ena1 and Nha1 play redundant and discrete roles in cation homeostasis, pH regulation, membrane potential, and virulence in C. neoformans, suggesting that these transporters could be novel antifungal drug targets for treatment of cryptococcosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aantifungal agents 3acations 3adrug resistance 3afungi 3ahomeostasis 3aion channels 3amelanin 3amembrane potential 3ameningoencephalitis 3amutants 3aniches 3aosmotic stress 3apH 3apathogens 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCationsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCryptococcosisxmicrobiology 2aCryptococcus neoformansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aDrug Resistance, Fungalxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIon Transportxgenetics 2aMelaninsxmetabolism 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMutation 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPhylogeny 2aSignal Transduction 2aStress, Physiological 2aVirulence 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aStrain, Anna K.1 aNielsen, Kirsten1 aJung, Kwang-Hwan1 aBahn, Yong-Sun0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2012 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.332-345dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245006400161300001600225520142400241592002801665650001201693650001701705650001401722650002101736650001301757650001801770650001301788650001101801650001101812650001601823650001901839653002601858653002501884653001301909653001101922653001301933653002701946653002001973700002001993700002502013700005802038773010202096856008302198852000902281655001202290IND60639251520221122134307.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xin10aMicrokinetic analysis of acetone hydrogenation over Pt/SiO2  ap. 183-198.  aThe kinetics of vapor-phase acetone hydrogenation were investigated over a Pt/SiO2 catalyst through a range of temperatures (303–435 K) and reactant partial pressures (pACE = 0.3–140 Torr, pH2 = 100–930 Torr). We compile macroscopically observable reaction orders, apparent barriers, kinetic isotope effects, and reaction rates; and we present a microkinetic analysis that considers multiple rate control scenarios in two Horuiti-Polanyi-type mechanisms. Overall, our data are best described by a two-site model wherein atomic hydrogen adsorbs at a distinct set of active sites from organic species. We further propose that two surface reactions each exert partial rate control, and we illustrate that degree of rate control is sensitive to reaction conditions. Shifts in rate control are attributed primarily to changing surface coverage regimes, which highlights the significance of both free energies of activation and chemical-potential driving forces in dictating the kinetic significance of elementary steps. Despite our conclusion that surface reactions involving H-X bond formation are likely rate controlling, we observe that H2/D2 switching minimally perturbs acetone hydrogenation rates. We interpret this by considering that observed kinetic isotope effects reflect a convolution of kinetic and thermodynamic impacts, which can obscure the elementary effects of changes in isotopic mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aisotopes 3amodels 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aAcetone hydrogenation 0aKetone hydrogenation 0aPlatinum 0aSilica 0aKinetics 0aMicrokinetic modelling 0aHoriuti-Polanyi1 aHeyden, Andreas1 aAbdelrahman, Omar A.1 aBond, Jesse Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8883-41510 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.183-198dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01197naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009300158300001600251520026800267592002800535650002300563650001700586650002000603650001800623650001300641700001800654700002100672773012100693856007200814852000900886655001200895IND60662259820221119045642.0190904e20060801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066225982DNAL7 a10.1039/b606258j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiappe, Cinzia10a[Hmim][NO₃]—an efficient solvent and promoter in the oxidative aromatic chlorination  ap. 742-745.  aBrønsted acidic ionic liquid [Hmim][NO₃] has been used as a cosolvent and “promoter” for oxidative halogenation of aromatic compounds with aqueous halohydric acids.

This study was conducted to determine and confirm the effect of B. subtilis C-3102 spore supplementation to feed on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass quality, blood profiles, noxious gas emission, and intestinal and excreta microflora in broilers. A total of 816 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers (46.06 ± 0.67 g) were used in a 5-wk study with Calsporin, B. subtilis final product (1.0 × 10⁹ cfu/g of B. subtilis). Broilers were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments consisting of 16 replicate cages with 17 broilers each: I) CON (control, basal diet), II) BS300 (CON + 300 mg of B. subtilis/kg of feed), and III) BS600 (CON + 600 mg of B. subtilis/kg of feed). Regarding probiotic effect, B. subtilis significantly increased Lactobacillus counts in the cecum, ileal, and excreta, and reduced Escherichia coli counts in the cecum and excreta, compared with CON. In addition, supplementation also tended to reduce Clostridium perfringens counts in the large intestine and excreta, while linearly reducing Salmonella counts in the cecum, ileal, large intestine, and excreta, compared with CON. Regarding growth performance, B. subtilis enhanced ADG in the starter and overall experimental periods, without any effects on feed intake compared with CON. Consequently, feed conversion ratio in the grower-finisher and overall experimental periods decreased significantly. The inclusion of B. subtilis improved the digestibility of DM and gross energy, as well as reducing ammonia emission, compared with CON. No significant difference in breast muscle color, water holding capacity, and drip loss, and relative organ weights, as well as in white blood cells, red blood cells, lymphocyte counts, and IgG amount, were observed. Overall, B. subtilis C-1302 is capable of providing a probiotic effect leading to improved growth performance and feed efficiency, due to the manipulation of intestinal microflora, with minimal side effects in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aSalmonella 3aammonia 3abreast muscle 3acarcass quality 3acecum 3acolor 3adigestibility 3adrip loss 3aenergy 3aexcreta 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amales 3aprobiotics 3aspores 0abroiler 0aexcreta microflora 0aintestinal microflora1 aKim, I.H.0 tPoultry science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 93, no. 12 p.3097-3103dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2014-040863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007500165300001400240520115500254592002801409650004401437650001701481650001901498650002001517650001401537650003001551650001501581650001101596650001801607650000901625650001201634650002301646650002401669650003701693653002801730653002201758653001601780653002601796653001601822700001801838700001801856700005401874700001401928700001301942700002301955773011501978856008302093852000902176655001202185IND60639251720221122202946.0190718e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063925172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Binhang10aTuning CO2 hydrogenation selectivity via metal-oxide interfacial sites  ap. 60-71.  aCO2 hydrogenation over ZrO2-supported NiFe catalysts is investigated to illustrate the role of Fe in controlling the activity and selectivity, and to reveal the structure-function relationship between metal-oxide interfaces and catalytic selectivities. The Ni-ZrO2 interfaces and Ni-FeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for the methanation reaction and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, respectively, using combined in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques. The reaction mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 on the Ni-ZrO2 interfacial sites and to CO on the Ni-FeOx interfacial sites are further revealed by combined in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the binding energy of absorbed CO (*CO) is a key descriptor to predict CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: weak interaction (e.g., Ni-FeOx interfaces) promotes *CO desorption to increase CO selectivity, while moderate interaction (e.g., Ni-ZrO2 interfaces) facilitates further hydrogenation of *CO to produce CH4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aenergy 3ahydrogenation 3airon 3amethane 3amethane production 3areaction mechanisms 3astructure-activity relationships 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aCO2 hydrogenation 0aActive site 0aMetal-oxide interface 0aSelectivity1 aZhao, Baohuai1 aKattel, Shyam1 aWu, Qiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-20031 aYao, Siyu1 aSu, Dong1 aChen, Jingguang G.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 June, v. 374 p.60-71dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245003600169300001400205520120300219592002801422650002101450650001801471650001501489650001201504650001401516650001101530650002201541650001401563650001501577650001601592773010701608856008401715852000901799655001201808IND60122320320221116205238.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012232032DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.9562572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Colin A.14aThe Trophoblast Model of Cancer  ap. 61-67.  aJohn Beard, the British embryologist and histologist, first proposed his trophoblast model of cancer in 1902. The model has subsequently been expanded by Kelley, and in current times, Gonzalez and Isaacs. The trophoblast model of cancer can be stated as a specified, scientifically testable model, including its core predictions that 1) adult stem cells are ectopic trophoblasts that have migrated to other tissues early in embryogenesis; 2) pancreatic enzymes are the key signal that converts the trophoblast into the stable placenta; 3) cancer arises from trophoblasts that have escaped regulatory control; and 4) pancreatic enzymes can be used to treat cancer. The author reviewed the literature on the trophoblast model of cancer and the use of pancreatic enzymes for the treatment of cancer and organized its key tenets into a set of specified scientific hypotheses. The trophoblast model of cancer can be stated as a set of 11 core predictions and 3 adjunctive or nonessential components. The trophoblast model of cancer is a detailed, testable model that should be investigated within an overlapping set of fields including oncology, histology, physiology, molecular biology, and embryology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult stem cells 3aembryogenesis 3aembryology 3aenzymes 3ahistology 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3anutrition 3aprediction 3atrophoblast0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.61-67dRoutledgewJournal:jnl11654x0163-55817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.9562573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009300177300001600270520169000286592002801976650001202004650001202016650000902028650001502037650001102052650001102063650001302074650000902087650001202096650001802108650000902126650000902135650001902144650000902163651001002172700002302182700001802205700002002223700001702243773009202260856008702352852000902439655001202448IND60085057620221120202931.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008505762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2010.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSøvik, Marthe-Lise10aPotentially harmful elements in rice paddy fields in mercury hot spots in Guizhou, China  ap. 167-173.  aLevels of the chalcophile metals Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn and the metalloid As in soils from rice paddy fields were assessed in two regions impacted by different industrial activities in Guizhou province, China. The two study areas (Wanshan and Qingzhen) have previously received attention in the international literature due to heavy Hg pollution, though levels of other potentially harmful elements have not previously been reported. The regions were selected as representing two important, but categorically different metal(loid) contaminated areas in China: Wanshan has been a major region for Hg production while Qingzhen is an important region for a large range of various heavy industries based on coal as an energy source. Within a limited distance of the Hg mine tailings in Wanshan the rice paddy fields are heavily contaminated by Hg (median concentration 25μgg⁻¹, maximum 119μgg⁻¹) and moderately contaminated by Zn and Cd (median concentrations of 86 and 0.9μgg⁻¹, respectively). Zinc and Cd levels correlate well with Hg contamination, which indicates a similar source and mechanism of transport and accumulation. Other studies have concluded that the main sources of Hg contamination in Wanshan are the numerous Hg mine tailings. This is likely as these metals are all geochemically associated with the mineral cinnabar (HgS). The other chalcophile elements (Pb, Cu and As) are nevertheless found at background levels only. In Qingzhen the soils were found to contain elevated levels of As and Hg (median concentrations of 38 and 0.3μgg⁻¹, respectively). These are elements that are known to be more associated with coal and released during coal combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acoal 3acombustion 3acopper 3aenergy 3aindustry 3alead 3amercury 3amine tailings 3arice 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3azinc 3aChina1 aLarssen, Thorjørn1 aVogt, Rolf D.1 aWibetoe, Grethe1 aFeng, Xinbin0 tApplied geochemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.167-173dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2010.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011600164300001800280500001400298520128000312592002801592650002401620650002101644650001401665650001801679650001001697650002001707650001401727650001201741650002301753650002401776650002201800650004301822650001401865650002001879653001601899653002301915653001901938700001501957700001801972700001401990700001802004700001502022700001702037700001302054700001402067700001702081773011202098856007702210852000902287655001202296IND60727009920221117061002.0210209e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072700992DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2014-041452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rong-Ping10aGene expression patterns, and protein metabolic and histological analyses for muscle development in Peking duck  ap. 3104-3111.  aNAL-light  aIn this study, we aimed to use duck breast muscle and leg muscle, the 2 main productive muscle organs, as a model to elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling how the 2 muscles have different deposition capabilities, and to analyze the mechanisms facilitating duck muscle development posthatching. Peking duck breast muscle and leg muscle were collected 3, 7, and 16 wk posthatching. The morphology of the myofibers was observed by paraffin sectioning the muscles. The expression of genes involved in protein metabolism [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RPS6-p70-protein kinase (S6K), forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), and atrogin-1 (MAFbx)] was detected using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot assays, and the results indicated that breast muscle had a stronger capacity for both protein synthesis and protein degradation compared with leg muscle. Satellite cell frequency declined during muscle development in both tissues, and the expression of Pax3/7, satellite cell marker genes, was not significantly different between breast muscle and leg muscle. No notable apoptosis was observed in either tissue. The results of this study suggest that protein metabolism signaling is the main reason promoting duck skeletal muscle mass gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRING finger domains 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abreast muscle 3aducks 3agene expression 3ahistology 3amammals 3amuscle development 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapamycin 3askeletal muscle 0aPeking duck 0aprotein metabolism 0asatellite cell1 aLiu, He-He1 aLi, Qing-Qing1 aWang, Yan1 aLiu, Jun-Ying1 aHu, Ji-Wei1 aYan, Xi-Ping1 aGou, Hua1 aLi, Liang1 aWang, Ji-Wen0 tPoultry science.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 93, no. 12 p.3104-3111dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2014-041453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01572naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008500158300001600243520073000259592002800989650002001017650001801037650002701055700002201082773012101104856007201225852000901297655001201306IND60662260020221120135711.0190904e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066226002DNAL7 a10.1039/b606377b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöfer, Rainer,10aGreen chemistry—a sustainable solution for industrial specialties applications  ap. 203-212.  aThe wellness and sustainability mega-trends will have a decisive influence on the future and, because of this, on the behaviour of consumers.

The bioleaching process was carried out in both one-step and two-step process and the leaching efficiencies in both cases were compared. Formation of inorganic and organic acids during the leaching process caused mobilization of vanadium. In order to reduce toxic effects of the metal species on the above mentioned microorganisms, a prolonged adaptation process was performed. Both bacteria, A. thiooxidans and P. putida were able to remove more than 90% of vanadium at slag concentrations of 1–5 g L−1 after 15 days.

There is limited information about how timing affects the nature of such effects induced by a specific nutritional exposure. We investigated the effect of increased exposure to folic acid before birth or during the juvenile–pubertal period in rats on the epigenetic regulation of glucose homeostasis. Rats were fed either a folic acid-adequate (AF; 1 mg/kg feed) or a folic acid-supplemented (FS; 5 mg/kg feed) diet from conception until delivery and then an AF diet during lactation. Juvenile rats were fed either the AF or the FS diet from weaning for 28 d and then an AF diet. Liver and blood were collected after a 12 h fast between postnatal days 84 and 90. Maternal FS diet increased plasma glucose concentration significantly (P < 0·05) in females, but not in males. Post-weaning FS diet decreased glucose concentration significantly in females, but increased glucose concentration in males. There were no effects of the FS diet on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA expression in males, while the pattern of expression was related to plasma glucose concentration in females. The FS diet induced specific changes in the methylation of individual CpG in females, but not in males, which were related to the time of exposure. Methylation of CpG − 248 increased the binding of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β to the PEPCK promoter. Together, these findings show that both the period during the life course and sex influence the effect of increased exposure to folic acid on the epigenetic regulation of PEPCK and glucose homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3aconception 3adiet 3aepigenetics 3aexposure duration 3afemales 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ajuveniles 3alactation 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3arats 3aweaning 0aEpigenetic regulation 0aPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 0aFolic acid 0aRats1 aLillycrop, Karen A.1 aGrenfell, Leonie R.1 aHanson, Mark A.1 aBurdge, Graham C.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Sept. 14, v. 108, no. 5 p.852-857dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110061553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011200157300002200269520070700291592002800998650002901026650002101055650001201076650001401088650001301102650001801115650001301133650001501146650001601161700001801177700002201195700001601217700002001233700002201253773012701275856007401402852000901476655001201485IND60669313420221119145329.0190920e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066931342DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra16643h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Arijit10aIn silico binding affinity to cyclooxygenase-II and green synthesis of benzylpyrazolyl coumarin derivatives  ap. 100978-100983.  aHere, we have reported for the first time, in silico binding affinity prediction of benzylpyrazolyl coumarin scaffolds to cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) enzyme and a green synthetic route to access these scaffolds using a neutral ionic liquid, [pmIm]Br as the reusable catalyst and reaction media under metal-free conditions.

Non-aromatic compounds bearing active methylene group were monobrominated selectively with the present reagent and olefinic compounds were converted into the corresponding bromohydrins in moderate yields. By obtaining the present reagent from the liquid bromine precursor, the twin advantages of avoiding liquid bromine and producing the reagent in a cost-effective manner are realised.

However, the weight and stability of the modified layer also affect the cycling properties and the energy density of Li–S cells. Here, we initially construct an ultrathin and lightweight MnO₂ layer (380 nm, 0.014 mg cm–²) on a commercial polyethylene (PE) separator (MnO₂@PE) through a chemical self-assembly method. This MnO₂ layer is tightly anchored onto the PE substrate because of the presence of oxygen-containing groups that form a relatively strong chemical force between the MnO₂ nanoparticles and the PE substrate. In addition, the mechanical strength of the separator is not affected by this modification procedure. Moreover, because of the catalytic effect and compactness of the MnO₂ layer, the MnO₂@PE separator can greatly suppress LiPS shuttling. As a result, the application of this MnO₂@PE separator in Li–S batteries leads to high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This strategy provides a novel approach to separator surface modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy density 3amanganese dioxide 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene 3astrength (mechanics) 0aseparator 0amanganese dioxide 0aultrathin coating layer 0acatalysis 0alithium−sulfur batteries1 aChen, Guoping1 aWang, Suqing1 aHuang, Yuping1 aJiang, Zhouyang1 aDing, Liang-Xin1 aWang, Haihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2917-47390 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 20, v. 10, no. 31 p.26274-26282dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b076633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245012100208520107900329592002801408650002101436650001401457650001701471653001301488653001501501653002501516653001701541653002101558653001601579700001401595700005701609700005501666773011101721856008701832852000901919655001201928IND60723439120221120195258.0211213e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072343912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1041812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoranges, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6986-346X10aExplicit and implicit measures of emotions: Data-science might help to account for data complexity and heterogeneity  aMeasuring emotions is a real challenge for fundamental and applied research, especially in ecological contexts. de Wijk and Noldus propose combining two types of measures - explicit to characterize a specific food, and implicit -physiological- to capture the whole experience of a meal in real-life situations. This raises several challenges including development of new and miniaturized sensors and devices but also developing new ways of data analysis. We suggest a path to follow for future studies regarding data analysis: to include Data Science in the game. This field of research may enable developing predictive but also explicative models that link subjective experience of emotions and physiological responses in real-life contexts. We suggest that food scientists should go out of their comfort zone by collaborating with computer scientists and then be trained with the new tools of Data Science, which will undoubtedly enable them 1/ to better manage complex and heterogeneous data sets, 2/ to extract knowledge that will be essential to this field of research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplied research 3acomputers 3afood quality 0aEmotions 0aPhysiology 0aReal-life situations 0aData Science 0aMachine learning 0aData mining1 aRouby, C.1 aPlantevit, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4636-57531 aBensafi, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-30360 tFood quality and preference.g2021 Sept., v. 92 p.104181-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1041813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245007200161300001400233520094200247592002801189650001101217650001501228650002201243650002201265650002101287650001101308650002401319650001601343650001201359651001001371653001601381653001901397653001101416653001001427653001101437700002001448700002001468773012201488856008001610852000901690655001201699IND60622433320221118082437.0181125e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062243332DNAL7 a10.1177/09730052176951632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Daisy10aWho Adopts Biogas in Rural India? Evidence from a Nationwide Survey  ap. 54-70.  aBiogas is a viable alternative for supplying clean and sustainable energy. Despite all manner of policy measures introduced by the Government of India, biogas is not widely used in India. This article tries to identify factors that influence the decision to adopt biogas at household level. We examine a conceptual framework empirically in which a household wants to maximize utility from biogas by using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) I, which is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey. By applying both maximum likelihood and penalized likelihood methods (Firthlogit) of logistic regression on a sample size of almost 10,384 households, it has been found that wealthy people are more likely to adopt biogas compared to the marginalized section of the society. We recommend more inclusive policy measures for the weaker section of the society to create an enabling environment to make it a self-promoting technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3ahouseholds 3ahuman development 3aissues and policy 3anational surveys 3apeople 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3asociety 3aIndia 0aRural India 0aenergy poverty 0abiogas 0awaste 0acattle1 aGoswami, Kishor1 aHazarika, Atanu0 tInternational journal of rural management.g, v. 13, no. 1 p.54-70dSAGE PublicationswJournal:21330x0973-06807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09730052176951633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008800166300001600254520116400270592002801434650002101462650001101483650001701494650001901511650002001530650001201550650001001562650002501572650001201597650001901609650003501628650002401663650001101687650001701698650002001715650001801735650001101753650001301764650001401777650002201791650004301813650002401856650001901880650001701899650003601916650003201952700001201984700002101996700001402017700001402031700001602045700001302061700001302074700001402087700001902101700001202120700001602132773009102148856008402239852000902323655001202332IND60122320720221116205216.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012232072DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2015.9653362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dian10aApple Polysaccharide Reduces Nf-Kb Mediated Colitis-Associated Colon Carcinogenesis  ap. 177-190.  aNuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is an important molecule in mediating inflammatory colitis, which can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of apple polysaccharide extract (AP) in inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammation pathways in CRC. We evaluated AP in vitro in HT-29 and SW620 human CRC cells. We also used the azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate (AOM/DSS) model to induce colon carcinogenesis in vivo. The chemoprotective effects of AP were assessed using Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, real-time PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and flow cytometry. AP reduced AOM/DSS-associated toxicities, prevented carcinogenesis, and decreased the expression of TLR4, MD2, MyD88, TRAM, TRIF-related adapter molecule, interferon-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. The protective effects of AP may be related to the inhibition of TLR4/MD2-mediated signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF, as well as the inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, AP could be used in combination therapy for the prevention of colitis-associated colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapples 3aazoxymethane 3acarcinogenesis 3achemoprevention 3acolitis 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adextran 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agel electrophoresis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amodels 3anecrosis 3anutrition 3aprotective effect 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asodium sulfate 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMi, Man1 aJiang, Fengliang1 aSun, Yang1 aLi, Yuhua1 aYang, Libin1 aFan, Lei1 aLi, Qian1 aMeng, Jin1 aYue, Zhenggang1 aLiu, Li1 aMei, Qibing0 tNutrition and cancer.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.177-190dRoutledgex1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2015.9653363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007600140245009800216300001800314500002000332520128700352592002801639596007101667596006401738596012601802650001601928650002601944650000901970650001501979650001801994650001102012650001502023651001102038700006002049700002902109773015302138856007502291852000902366655001202375IND60786541420221122061533.0220804e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078654142DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.122562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Thais Lomonaco Teodoro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8675-475910aChemical Composition and Nutritional Information of Fats Used in Fillings of Sandwich Cookies  ap. 1173-1179.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the characteristics of fillings used in cookies commercialized in Brazil and in USA according to their chemical composition, labels, nutritional information, ingredients list, and price. Fillings had approximately 25–32% of fat. In general, the composition of these fats consisted of approximately 50% of saturated fatty acids (SFA), mainly palmitic acid, and 50% of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid. Brazilian samples had trans‐fatty acids (TFA) in the range of 1–15% although in many cases their presence was not reported in the labels. USA product labels did not present a fixed portion weight but they showed detailed information about the types of fats used such as source and the process used for their production. In 70% of Brazilian product labels, the information shown in the ingredient list was limited to “vegetable fat,” which does not give enough information to consumers about the type of fat used. In addition, our results showed that low‐trans‐products or zero‐trans‐products, in which TFA were replaced by SFA, presented the highest prices. This research suggests that further legislation should be developed in Brazil to decrease the amount of TFA in foods and improve their nutritional properties.  aPublisher supplied data  a140477/2015‐2cCNPq for National Scholarship and Project Support  cUtah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University  a88881.134926/2016‐01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoa de Nível Superior, CAPES‐Brazil financial code 001 3aingredients 3anutrition information 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aprices 3avegetables 3aBrazil1 aMartini, Silvana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5870-99311 aArellano, Daniel Barrera0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2019 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.1173-1179dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.122563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110024003600146040001800182100001400200245005200214300001600266520053600282592002800818650001200846650001000858650002100868650002000889650002300909650001300932650001300945650002700958650001200985650002100997650002801018650003701046650003701083650001101120650002701131650000901158650001201167650002301179650003301202650003301235650003101268653001101299653002501310653002601335700001701361773011601378852000901494856008301503655001201586IND9103137020221118010509.0190611e19900401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910313702DNAL7 a23665152pmid7 a10.1258/0023677907808901492doi4 a0023-6772(19900401)24:2L.172;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBamba, K.10aFreezing rabbit semen by the use of BF5 diluent  ap. 172-175.  aThree experiments were carried out to find the optimal concentration of DMSO and glycerol in BFS diluent for freezing rabbit spermatozoa.

By oxidizing bare graphite under a mild condition, expanded graphites (EG* where * = functional groups) were obtained with increasing d-spacing from 0.3359 nm to 0.3395 nm as well as with functional groups formed on the plane or at the edges of graphites. The subsequent thermal reduction of EG* led to an insignificant change of d-spacing (0.3390 nm), simultaneously eliminating a portion of the functional groups (EG). The enlargement of d-spacing reduced kinetic hindrance of lithium ion movement within the expanded graphites (EG* and EG) by reserving more space for the ionic transport route. In addition, the activation energy of lithium ion intercalation in EG* was reduced by surface charge polarization of graphites induced by hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms of carbonates in electrolytes and hydrogen atoms of surface functional groups of the expanded graphites, even if the degree of graphitization decreased. Re-graphitization induced by the subsequent thermal reduction increased delithiation capacities (QdLᵢ) of EG as an anode for lithium ion batteries especially at high currents: QdLᵢ at 50 C = 243 mA h g⁻¹ for EG versus 66 mA h g⁻¹ for bare graphite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aanodes 3acarbonates 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amoieties 3aoxygen1 aJeon, Eun Kyung1 aKo, Younghoon1 aJang, Bo Yun1 aKim, Byeong-Su1 aSong, Hyun-Kon0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 2, no. 20 p.7600-7605dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta15360f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008200165300001400247520079900261592002801060650002501088650001601113650001401129650001101143650001801154650001401172650001301186650001901199773009501218856008101313990002301394852000901417655001201426IND60093445620221120091629.0141103e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009344562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskin, Dmitry12aA simple model of particle diffusivity in horizontal hydrotransport pipelines  ap. 84-94.  aAn engineering model of the particle diffusivity in horizontal hydraulic conveying pipelines is developed. The model is based on a known equation of the turbulent diffusivity for isotropic turbulence. The Kolmogoroff turbulence model is employed. It is assumed that turbulence develops in an equivalent fluid, representing a solid–liquid suspension. The particle diffusivity model takes into account a diffusivity increase with both the particle size and the mean solids concentration. The model has two empirical parameters, which are identified from the experimental data available in the literature. A comparison of the computed solids concentration distributions over the pipe cross-section with those measured demonstrates a high model accuracy in a wide range of slurry flow parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apipelines 3aslurries 3aturbulent flow0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 82 p.84-94dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.07.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245010500198300001800303500002000321520133800341592002801679650004401707650001501751650001501766650001301781650001601794650001401810650001601824650002301840650002101863650000901884650001401893700006201907700002301969700006601992773015202058856007502210852000902285655001202294IND60786541520221122061459.0220804e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078654152DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.122772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBall, James C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-294X10aModel Reactions Involving Ester Functional Groups during Thermo‐Oxidative Degradation of Biodiesel  ap. 1153-1161.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiodiesel is a renewable fuel used in diesel engines that is typically blended with diesel fuel. However, biodiesel is susceptible to oxidation, which has the potential to produce higher molecular weight materials that may adversely impact vehicle fuel‐system performance. To investigate the chemical reactions potentially important in biodiesel oxidation, four different types of chemical reactions involving esters were studied: (1) ester formation (reactions of acids with alcohols), (2) alcoholysis (reactions of alcohols with esters), (3) acidolysis (reaction of acids with esters), and (4) ester exchange (reactions between two esters). Experiments with representative model compounds were used to evaluate these reactions at 90 °C with aeration; conditions previously used to simulate thermo‐oxidative degradation during biodiesel aging. Reactions were monitored using gas chromatography, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and total acid number (TAN). Evidence is presented suggesting that alcoholysis and ester formation (Reactions 1 and 2), catalyzed by carboxylic acids, are important reactions of esters that could lead to larger molecules. Acidolysis (Reaction 3) proceeded at a comparatively slow rate and ester exchange reaction products (Reaction 4) were not detected under these aging conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacid value 3aacidolysis 3aaeration 3aalcoholysis 3abiodiesel 3adiesel fuel 3agas chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3aoxidation1 aAnderson, James E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-52711 aSears, Victoria A.1 aWallington, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9810-63260 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2019 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.1153-1161dJohn Wiley & Sons, IncwJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.122773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009400174300001600268520184500284592002802129650002402157650002302181650001102204650001502215650002202230650002502252650001602277650001902293650001502312650001702327650001302344650001402357650001902371650001502390650001302405650001502418650001502433650002502448700002302473700002302496773008802519856008502607852000902692655001202701IND60084383620221116162432.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastas Amofah, Lea10aWillow bed fertigated with domestic wastewater to recover nutrients in subarctic climates  ap. 174-181.  aConventional methods for wastewater treatment emphasise protecting human health, receiving waters and the environment. Consequently, they are generally designed to reduce pollutant levels and are not well-suited for creating resources. This paper describes a new, more sustainable and energy-efficient approach to wastewater treatment that satisfies health and environmental standards while also facilitating resource recovery. A full-scale compact willow bed was intensively fertigated with domestic wastewater in a cold climate to examine biomass production, the recovery of nutrients in willow biomass, and wastewater treatment. The performance of the willow bed was assessed for two years, covering three growing seasons. The studied frost-tolerant willow clones produced good biomass yields per unit area (6–7ton dry matter/ha and year) under intensive fertigation with dense planting and continuous harvesting. The biomass yield of willow species exhibiting vertical growth seemed to be greater than that for lateral growth species in the dense stands studied. In contrast to biomass production, nutrient recovery was facilitated by intensive fertigation, continuous harvesting and less dense planting with a horizontally growing willow clone. The estimated nitrogen accumulation in above-ground biomass was 210kg/ha and that of phosphorus was 30kg/ha. 90% of the accumulated nutrients in the above-ground biomass were removed from the site during the experimental period. However, the quantity of nutrients accumulated in the willow biomass represented only a small fraction of the loaded or removed amount. The willow bed was shown to be an efficient prefilter for reducing the abundance of particulate and organic matter, leaving the bulk of the remaining nutrients in forms that could be recovered in subsequent treatment steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3abiomass production 3aclones 3acold zones 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental health 3afertigation 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3ahuman health 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3apollutants 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aMattsson, Jonathan1 aHedström, Annelie0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.174-181dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009900155300001800254520077200272592002801044650002401072650002101096650001901117650001301136650001701149650001901166650001801185650001301203650001701216650003701233653001701270653002701287653001701314653001501331700001601346700001601362700001501378700001601393700001401409700001701423700001701440773012301457856007501580852000901655655001201664IND60528839620221118181724.0160717e20150311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052883962DNAL7 a10.1021/am508266p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yanjiao10aBifunctional Magnetic-Fluorescent Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, and Cell Imaging  ap. 5226-5232.  aA new type of bifunctional magnetic-fluorescent Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–PDI–PAA/Ca²⁺ nanoparticles has been prepared by coating PDI-cored star polymers (PDI–PAA) onto the surface of Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ core–shell nanostructures.

Complete Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ti and V removal from the water was accomplished through almost the entire operation time while Fe removal ranged between 170 and 620 mg/L. The system operated at a mean inflow rate of 43 m³/day achieving an acid load reduction of 597 g·(m² day)⁻¹, more than 10 times higher than the generally accepted 40 g·(m² day)⁻¹ value commonly used as a passive treatment system designing criteria.

Plastic mulch affects surface albedo and blocks water vapor exchange between soil and atmosphere. Therefore, the large area of cropland covered by plastic film will have serious impacts on regional climate by modifying the surface-atmosphere partitioning of vapor and energy. In this study, a dynamic irrigation scheme was incorporated into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Noah land surface scheme; two experiments (with and without plastic mulch) were designed to simulate the impacts of plastic mulch over cropland in Northwest China on regional climate. In irrigated cropland, the irrigation amount decreased substantially during the early stage of crop growth (ESCG; from 22 April to 1 July) with plastic mulch, especially in May, indicating that plastic mulch conserved agricultural water. In nonirrigated cropland, soil moisture in cropland with plastic mulch was clearly greater than that without plastic mulch. The influences of plastic mulch on land surface processes were mainly reflected in the ESCG, such that upward shortwave radiation increased and latent heat flux decreased. In cropland during the ESCG, after plastic mulch, the latent heat flux decreased significantly by 12–30 W m⁻², the sensible heat flux increased significantly by 8–16 W m⁻², and the surface air temperature increased significantly by 0.2–0.8 °C. The plastic mulch reduced water vapor in the lower atmosphere, which might lead to decrease precipitation in Northwest China.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2005DKA32300cthe National Science and Technology Platform Construction Project of China  a16JJD770019cthe Major Research Projects of the Ministry of Education of China  a2016YFA0600403cthe National Key R&D Program of China 3aEarth atmosphere 3aagricultural development 3aair temperature 3acropland 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3airrigated farming 3airrigation rates 3alatent heat flux 3aplastic film 3aplastic film mulches 3asemiarid zones 3asensible heat flux 3ashortwave radiation 3asoil water 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3awater shortages 3awater vapor 3aweather research and forecasting model 3aChina1 aQin, Fen1 aFeng, Jinming1 aHuang, Jinting0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Jan., v. 139, no. 1-2 p.335-349dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02974-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010400172300001600276520165800292592002801950650002801978650002402006650002602030650002602056650001202082650001502094650002602109650001802135650001302153650001702166650001302183650000902196650002102205773009602226856008102322852000902403655001202412IND60514879120221118035548.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051487912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3396-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuster, Michael J.10aIncreased rainfall variability and N addition accelerate litter decomposition in a restored prairie  ap. 645-655.  aAnthropogenic nitrogen deposition and projected increases in rainfall variability (the frequency of drought and heavy rainfall events) are expected to strongly influence ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition. However, how these two global change factors interact to influence litter decomposition is largely unknown. I examined how increased rainfall variability and nitrogen addition affected mass and nitrogen loss of litter from two tallgrass prairie species, Schizachyrium scoparium and Solidago canadensis, and isolated the effects of each during plant growth and during litter decomposition. I increased rainfall variability by consolidating ambient rainfall into larger events and simulated chronic nitrogen deposition using a slow-release urea fertilizer. S. scoparium litter decay was more strongly regulated by the treatments applied during plant growth than by those applied during decomposition. During plant growth, increased rainfall variability resulted in S. scoparium litter that subsequently decomposed more slowly and immobilized more nitrogen than litter grown under ambient conditions, whereas nitrogen addition during plant growth accelerated subsequent mass loss of S. scoparium litter. In contrast, S. canadensis litter mass and N losses were enhanced under either N addition or increased rainfall variability both during plant growth and during decomposition. These results suggest that ongoing changes in rainfall variability and nitrogen availability are accelerating nutrient cycling in tallgrass prairies through their combined effects on litter quality, environmental conditions, and plant community composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizachyrium scoparium 3aSolidago canadensis 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abotanical composition 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal change 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3aprairies 3arain 3aurea fertilizers0 tOecologia.g2016 Mar., v. 180, no. 3 p.645-655dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3396-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006400163300001200227520166600239592002801905596013401933650002602067650002202093650001402115650001102129650001202140650001202152650001002164650002002174650001702194650001002211650001502221650001902236650003002255650002202285650001202307700001502319700001702334700001802351700001902369700001902388773010902407856008202516852000902598655001202607IND60608835520221122223546.0181025e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060883552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-018-2233-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitoma, Mai12aA new DNA marker for sex identification in purple asparagus  ap. 154.  aGarden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) is an economically-important perennial crop. This plant is dioecious, as there are both male and female individuals; male individuals are preferred over females for agricultural production. To reduce the time required for garden asparagus breeding, various male-specific DNA markers are utilized. Male-specific DNA markers, such as Asp1-T7sp and MSSTS710, are currently available for sex identification in many asparagus cultivars. In the current study, we found that these markers are not suitable for sex identification in the purple asparagus cultivar ‘Pacific Purple’, as male-specific amplification of this marker was detected in some male individuals of this cultivar but not in other males. The Asp1-T7sp marker is suitable for use in sex identification in various Asparagus species related to A. officinalis, indicating that the region around this marker is conserved among these species. Thus, we isolated a DNA fragment around this marker by inverse PCR and produced a new DNA marker, MspHd, based on this sequence. However, like Asp1-T7sp and MSSTS710, MspHd was not suitable for sex identification in the cultivar ‘Pacific Purple’. Since all ‘Pacific Purple’ males have morphologically similar male flowers with functional stamens, we produced a new male-specific marker based on the sex determination gene, MSE1/AspMYB35/AspTDF1, which is responsible for stamen development. This marker, named AspMSD, is suitable for sex identification in ‘Pacific Purple’. In addition, this marker can be utilized for sex identification in various asparagus cultivars and some related Asparagus species.  aPublisher supplied data  a27002BcGrant-in-Aid for Science and Technology Research Promotion Program for Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Food Industry 3aAsparagus officinalis 3aDNA fragmentation 3acultivars 3adioecy 3afemales 3agardens 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amale flowers 3amales 3aperennials 3aplant breeding 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asex determination 3astamens1 aZhang, Lei1 aKonno, Itaru1 aImai, Shunpei1 aMotoki, Satoru1 aKannō, Akira,0 tEuphytica.g2018 Sept., v. 214, no. 9 p.154-154dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-018-2233-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012000160300001800280520135600298592002801654650002301682650002201705650001501727650001101742650002301753650001601776650001701792650001101809650001301820650001501833650001501848650001301863650001101876700001801887700002201905700002301927700002101950773014101971856007402112852000902186655001202195IND60670625920221118081633.0191002e20140527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067062592DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta15379g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermet, Jessica10aOxide ion and proton transport in Gd-doped barium cerate: a combined first-principles and kinetic Monte Carlo study  ap. 9055-9066.  aOxide ion and proton transport properties in the fuel cell electrolyte Gd-doped BaCeO₃ are investigated by first-principles density-functional calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Behind the apparent complexity of the energy landscape (related to the low-symmetry of the system), general tendencies governing the energy barriers can be extracted. In particular, the set of barriers is tested with respect to the Bell–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) principle that relates the activation energy Eₐ of a series of similar chemical reactions to their reaction enthalpies ΔH. This rule is found poorly satisfied in the case of oxide ion migration, but much better satisfied for proton hopping mechanisms. Protonic reorientations, by contrast, do not obey the BEP rule. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations give insight into the macroscopic transport properties. We observe that dopants act as traps for oxygen vacancies and slow down their motion, whereas their effect on the protonic diffusion coefficient is more complex. This is related to the fact that a two-state picture roughly applies to the oxygen vacancy energy landscape, while it does not apply to the protonic one. Oxide ion migration exhibits strong anisotropy, the motion of the oxygen vacancies being favored in the equatorial planes, while protonic diffusion is found more isotropic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aactivation energy 3aanisotropy 3abarium 3achemical reactions 3adiffusivity 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3afuel cells 3agadolinium 3aisotropy 3aoxygen1 aTorrent, Marc1 aBottin, François1 aDezanneau, Guilhem1 aGeneste, Gregory0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 27, v. 2, no. 24 p.9055-9066dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta15379g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016100175300001600336520191500352592002802267650002702295650001102322650000902333650001202342650001302354650003102367650001302398650001302411650001002424650002002434650001802454700002102472700002502493700002302518700002702541700002102568700002002589700002102609700002202630700001702652700002402669773009602693856008102789852000902870655001202879IND60514879220221118035455.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051487922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3407-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKernaléguen, Laëtitia10aFrom video recordings to whisker stable isotopes: a critical evaluation of timescale in assessing individual foraging specialisation in Australian fur seals  ap. 657-670.  aEstimating the degree of individual specialisation is likely to be sensitive to the methods used, as they record individuals’ resource use over different time-periods. We combined animal-borne video cameras, GPS/TDR loggers and stable isotope values of plasma, red cells and sub-sampled whiskers to investigate individual foraging specialisation in female Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) over various timescales. Combining these methods enabled us to (1) provide quantitative information on individuals’ diet, allowing the identification of prey, (2) infer the temporal consistency of individual specialisation, and (3) assess how different methods and timescales affect our estimation of the degree of specialisation. Short-term inter-individual variation in diet was observed in the video data (mean pairwise overlap = 0.60), with the sampled population being composed of both generalist and specialist individuals (nested network). However, the brevity of the temporal window is likely to artificially increase the level of specialisation by not recording the entire diet of seals. Indeed, the correlation in isotopic values was tighter between the red cells and whiskers (mid- to long-term foraging ecology) than between plasma and red cells (short- to mid-term) (R ² = 0.93–0.73 vs. 0.55–0.41). δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values of whiskers confirmed the temporal consistency of individual specialisation. Variation in isotopic niche was consistent across seasons and years, indicating long-term habitat (WIC/TNW = 0.28) and dietary (WIC/TNW = 0.39) specialisation. The results also highlight time-averaging issues (under-estimation of the degree of specialisation) when calculating individual specialisation indices over long time-periods, so that no single timescale may provide a complete and accurate picture, emphasising the benefits of using complementary methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus pusillus 3acarbon 3adiet 3afemales 3aforaging 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitats 3anitrogen 3aseals 3astable isotopes 3avideo cameras1 aDorville, Nicole1 aIerodiaconou, Daniel1 aHoskins, Andrew J.1 aBaylis, Alastair M.

The treatments (0.15 M NaCl, negative control; methotrexate 1.5 mg/kg, positive control; SE 100 mg/kg; SteLL 1 and 5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injections started on the 8th day after tumor inoculation and lasted 7 days. It was analyzed: tumor weight; number and gauge of tumor vessels; hematological and biochemical parameters; histopathological changes; and occurrence of micronuclei in bone marrow cells.SE and SteLL showed IC50 values (concentrations that reduced cell viability to 50%) of 301.65 and 8.30 μg/mL, respectively. The lectin was able to induce apoptosis. Treatments with the extract and lectin caused a 57.6–73.6% reduction in tumor weight, which was not significantly different from the reduction in the methotrexate group. Tumors of animals treated with SteLL at 5 mg/kg showed reduced number of secondary vessels while the gauge was lower in all treated groups. In the groups treated with SteLL, tumors showed reduced and slightly vascularized parenchyma, with necrosis in the center and at the periphery. No alterations in the blood levels of urea, creatine, and glucose were detected while serum AST level was moderately increased in the SE group. Histopathological analysis revealed vacuolization and steatosis in the liver of animals treated with the extract and lectin. In addition, the treatments with SE and SteLL resulted in the reduction of filtration space and alterations in tubular architecture in kidneys. In respect to hematological parameters, it was only detected increase in the number of monocytes in SE group. The extract and lectin did not induce the formation of micronuclei in the bone marrow cells.SE and SteLL had antitumor effect against sarcoma 180 without inducing hematological changes and genotoxic effects in mice; however, some degree of hepatic and renal toxicity was observed, suggesting the evaluation of drug delivery strategies in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchinus terebinthifolia 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3acell viability 3acreatine 3afemales 3afiltration 3agenotoxicity 3aglucose 3ahematologic tests 3ahistopathology 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alectins 3aliver 3amethotrexate 3amice 3amonocytes 3anecrosis 3anephrotoxicity 3asarcoma 3asodium chloride 3atraditional medicine 3aurea 0aAST 0aFBS 0aHA 0aIC50 0aMCH 0aMCV 0aMTS 0aMTX 0aPBS 0aPHA 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSE 0aSteLL 0aBrazilian pepper tree 0aAnticancer 0aLectin 0aAntiangiogenic activity 0aGenotoxicity evaluation1 ade Moura Fontes Araújo, Maria Taís1 ade Lima Araújo, Tarcísio Cícero1 ados Santos Neto, Osmar Galvão1 ae Silva, Mariana Gama1 aSilva, Yasmym Araújo1 aLira Torres, Diego José1 ade Siqueira Patriota, Leydianne Leite1 ade Melo, Cristiane Moutinho Lagos1 ade Lorena, Vírginia Maria Barros1 aGuedes Paiva, Patrícia Maria1 aMendes, Rosemairy Luciane1 aNapoleão, Thiago Henrique0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Apr. 06, v. 233 p.148-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245020000166300001600366520157000382592002801952650002501980650001302005650001302018650001902031650003002050650001302080650001302093650001302106650001102119650001102130650001302141650002802154650001902182650001402201650001502215650002202230700001902252700002002271700002002291773009602311856008102407852000902488655001202497IND60514879320221118035636.0160303e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051487932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3479-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOguchi, Riichi10aWhich plant trait explains the variations in relative growth rate and its response to elevated carbon dioxide concentration among Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes derived from a variety of habitats?  ap. 865-876.  aElevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration ([CO₂]) enhances plant growth, but this enhancement varies considerably. It is still uncertain which plant traits are quantitatively related to the variation in plant growth. To identify the traits responsible, we developed a growth analysis model that included primary parameters associated with morphology, nitrogen (N) use, and leaf and root activities. We analysed the vegetative growth of 44 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown at ambient and elevated [CO₂] (800 μmol mol⁻¹). The 44 ecotypes were selected such that they were derived from various altitudes and latitudes. Relative growth rate (RGR; growth rate per unit plant mass) and its response to [CO₂] varied by 1.5- and 1.7-fold among ecotypes, respectively. The variation in RGR at both [CO₂]s was mainly explained by the variation in leaf N productivity (LNP; growth rate per leaf N),which was strongly related to photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE). The variation in the response of RGR to [CO₂] was also explained by the variation in the response of LNP to [CO₂]. Genomic analyses indicated that there was no phylogenetic constraint on inter-ecotype variation in the CO₂ response of RGR or LNP. We conclude that the significant variation in plant growth and its response to [CO₂] among ecotypes reflects the variation in N use for photosynthesis among ecotypes, and that the response of PNUE to CO₂ is an important target for predicting and/or breeding plants that have high growth rates at elevated [CO₂].  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aaltitude 3abreeding 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aecotypes 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3avegetative growth1 aOzaki, Hiroshi1 aHanada, Kousuke1 aHikosaka, Kouki0 tOecologia.g2016 Mar., v. 180, no. 3 p.865-876dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3479-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245003800159300001600197500001900213520114600232592002801378650002501406650002201431650000901453650001401462650001001476650001101486650001801497650001601515650001301531650002601544650001401570650001801584650001101602650001801613650001001631650001601641650001701657650001701674651001101691653002501702653001901727653002501746653002001771653001201791653002301803700001701826700001601843700002101859700001601880700001901896700001701915773013701932856007902069852000902148655001202157IND60717745820221118024228.0201116e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071774582DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2020-01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraf, R.J.10aAAC Network hard red winter wheat  ap. 737-746.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAAC Network is a semi-dwarf hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar that is well adapted across western Canada and eligible for grades of Canada Western Red Winter (CWRW) wheat. It was developed using wheat × maize pollen doubled haploid methodology. AAC Network was evaluated in the Western Canadian Winter Wheat Cooperative registration trials relative to CDC Buteo, Emerson, Moats, and AAC Elevate for 4 yr (2016–2019). Based on 44 replicated trials, AAC Network produced grain yield similar to AAC Elevate, the highest yielding check, with a protein concentration 0.9 units higher. AAC Network had fair to good winter survival, relatively late maturity, short straw with excellent lodging resistance, and high test weight. AAC Network expressed resistance to stem and stripe rust, moderate resistance to leaf rust and common bunt, and intermediate resistance to Fusarium head blight. In addition to increased grain protein concentration, AAC Network showed improvements in gluten strength and flour water absorption, and it maintained the excellent milling yield and low flour ash attributes of the CWRW wheat class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium head blight 3aTriticum aestivum 3acorn 3acultivars 3aflour 3agluten 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3ahaploidy 3ahard red winter wheat 3aleaf rust 3aoverwintering 3apollen 3asmut diseases 3astraw 3astripe rust 3awater uptake 3awinter wheat 3aCanada 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0awheat (winter) 0acultivar description 0adoubled haploid 0aprotein 0adisease resistance1 aLarsen, R.J.1 aBeres, B.L.1 aAboukhaddour, R.1 aLaroche, A.1 aRandhawa, H.S.1 aForoud, N.A.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2020 May 27, v. 100, no. 6 p.737-746dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1933x1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2020-01023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014100208300001600349520139900365592002801764650003101792650004101823650001901864650000901883650001501892650001101907650001601918650002501934650001501959651000901974700002001983773013302003856008302136852000902219655001202228IND60680854720221118021641.0200325e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068085472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02979-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharafati, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0448-287112aA strategy to assess the uncertainty of a climate change impact on extreme hydrological events in the semi-arid Dehbar catchment in Iran  ap. 389-402.  aThis study presents a robust approach to assess climate change impact variability on future extreme events (e.g., rainfall depth and river discharge) over Dehbar catchment in Iran. Climate change impact is assessed using five general circulation models (GCMs) including EC-EARTH, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-MR with several emission scenarios (e.g., RCP26, RCP45, and RCP85). Daily discharge data is simulated based on the distributed rainfall-runoff model called Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), while calibration and validation phases are performed using SWAT-CUP. Future annual extreme events (i.e., rainfall depth and river discharge) are computed by means of frequency analysis. Results show that future annual maximum values are increased significantly, where the most increase occurs in the future annual river discharge and rainfall depth according to the EC-EARTH-RCP85 as 142% and 81% with MPI-ESM-MR-RCP85 model. The highest future extreme river discharge and rainfall depth values through different return periods (50–1000 year) are obtained from EC-EARTH-RCP85 as 6.8~8.08 cms and 57.41~105.76 mm based on EC-EARTH-RCP45 model. Uncertainty analysis results indicate that climate models/scenarios have significant effect on the future extreme events variability, while the same for extreme river discharge is the least sensitive to different return periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aclimate change 3arain 3ariver flow 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aPezeshki, Elnaz0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Jan., v. 139, no. 1-2 p.389-402dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02979-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011800177300001600295520155500311592002801866650001001894650002001904650002101924650002501945650003001970650002702000650002202027650002502049650001502074650001602089650002502105650002102130650001402151650001502165650001302180650001602193650001702209650002502226650001802251651001002269700002302279773008802302856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60084384120221116162411.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008438412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-Elela, Sohair I.10aMunicipal wastewater treatment using vertical flow constructed wetlands planted with Canna, Phragmites and Cyprus  ap. 209-213.  aA pilot scale vertical flow constructed wetland unit (VFCW) with a surface area of 457.56m² was built within the vicinity of a wastewater treatment plant, North Cairo, Egypt. The wetland unit was planted with three kinds of plants namely; Canna, Phragmites australis and Cyprus papyrus. The wetland unit was fed with primary treated municipal wastewater at influent flow rate of 20m³/day and surface loading rate ranged between 26.2kgBODha⁻¹day⁻¹ and 76.5kgBODha⁻¹day⁻¹ and a detention time of 7.7 days. The efficiency of VFCW after two years operation was evaluated in terms of both mass removal and water quality improvement, both physico-chemically and biologically. The biological analysis was carried out for total coliform, fecal coliform, and Escherichia coli. The accumulation of the elements in the plants organs and their uptake with the harvested macrophyte were also measured. The results obtained showed that the average removal efficiency of COD, BOD and TSS in the final effluent were 88%, 90%, 92%, respectively with corresponding residual values of 30.60mg/l, 13.20mg/l and 8.50mg/l. The amount of nutrients accumulated in the plants which represented by total phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen were 32.55g/m² and 68.10g/m². Also, significant reduction of total coliform, fecal coliform were achieved. To conclude, the quality of treated effluent proved that the use of VFCW as a post treatment step is an effective technology for wastewater treatment and use for irrigation in rural areas and small communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanna 3aCyperus papyrus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPhragmites australis 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3aconstructed wetlands 3airrigation 3amacrophytes 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3arural areas 3asurface area 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3aEgypt1 aHellal, Mohamed S.0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.209-213dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245019000199300001800389500001900407520158200426592002802008650002602036650001602062650001302078650001302091650001302104650001602117650001402133650000702147650001502154650002202169650001302191651001002204700001902214700005802233700001602291700005702307773014002364856007902504852000902583655001202592IND60655817220221120223258.0190807e20190626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b016232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGen, Masao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6160-902910aHeterogeneous Oxidation of SO₂ in Sulfate Production during Nitrate Photolysis at 300 nm: Effect of pH, Relative Humidity, Irradiation Intensity, and the Presence of Organic Compounds  ap. 8757-8766.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeterogeneous oxidation of SO₂ is one of the promising mechanisms to account for high loading of sulfate during severe haze periods in China. Our earlier work reported on the SO₂ oxidation by OH and NO₂ produced during 250 nm nitrate photolysis (Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2019, 6, 86–91). Here, we extend that work to examine sulfate production during nitrate photolysis at 300 nm irradiation, which can additionally generate NO₂– or HNO₂, N(III). Flow cell/in situ Raman experiments showed that the reactive uptake coefficient of SO₂, γSO₂, can be expressed as γSO₂ = 1.64 × pNO₃–, where pNO₃₋ is the nitrate photolysis rate in the range of (1.0–8.0) × 10–⁵ M s–¹. Our kinetic model with the pNO₃₋ predicts that N(III) is the main contributor to the SO₂ oxidation, followed by NO₂ contribution. Furthermore, the addition of OH scavengers (e.g., glyoxal or oxalic acid) does not suppress the sulfate production because of the reduced N(III)-consuming reactions and the high particle pH sustained by their presence. Our calculations illustrate that under characteristic haze conditions, the nitrate photolysis mechanism can produce sulfate at ∼1 μg m–³ h–¹ at pH 4–6 and pNO₃– = 10–⁵ M s–¹. The present study highlights the importance of in-particle nitrate photolysis in heterogeneous oxidation of SO₂ by reactive nitrogen (NO₂–/HNO₂ and NO₂) under atmospherically relevant actinic irradiation. However, the nitrate photolysis rate constant needs to be better constrained for ambient aerosols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3airradiation 3akinetics 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotolysis 3arelative humidity 3asulfates 3aChina1 aZhang, Ruifeng1 aHuang, Dan Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2878-74691 aLi, Yongjie1 aChan, Chak K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-87710 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 June 26, v. 53, no. 15 p.8757-8766dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b016233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006900140245015900209300001800368500002000386520120400406592002801610596003701638650004401675650002501719650001501744650000901759650001001768650002701778650001601805650001201821650002201833650000901855650001401864650002401878650001901902650002101921651001301942700002801955700003201983773015302015856007502168852000902243655001202252IND60786542020221122105113.0220804e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078654202DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.122702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Luis‐Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9514-388810aEffects of Dehulling Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) Seeds on the Physicochemical and Sensory Properties of Oils Extracted by Means of Cold Pressing  ap. 1187-1195.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) is a plant native to the Peruvian Amazon, with great expansion because of the high industrialization potential of its seeds (SIS). The Sacha Inchi oil (SIO) is commonly obtained by pressing the SIS, and it is of high commercial value because of its excellent nutritional properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of the dehulling of SIS on the physicochemical and sensory properties of the SIO extracted by means of cold pressing. The fatty acid composition, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, density, refractive index (RI), acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), p‐anisidine index (p‐An), oxidative stability index (OSI), color, and sensory profiles of the SIO samples were evaluated. The oils obtained from whole SIS showed similar fatty acid profiles, physicochemical properties, and sensory profiles to those extracted from dehulled SIS. After 60 days of storage, the total oxidation values of both SIO samples significantly increased, but there were no significant differences between oils from whole and dehulled SIS. Thus, the dehulling process could be avoided without affecting significantly the quality of the obtained oils.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversidad Nacional de Colombia 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPlukenetia volubilis 3aacid value 3acold 3acolor 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3ahulling 3aindustrialization 3aoils 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aperoxide value 3arefractive index 3aAmazonia1 aSanchez‐Reinoso, Zain1 aQuiñones‐Segura, Yolanda0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2019 Nov., v. 96, no. 11 p.1187-1195dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.122703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245015000189300001800339520098600357592002801343650001001371650001601381650001401397650002101411650001101432650001501443650002301458650001701481650003101498650002901529650002201558650002001580650004101600651001101641651001901652700002001671773009901691856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60086653920221118221021.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008665392DNAL7 a218999362pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabadie, Pierre10aBiogeochemical dynamics of perfluorinated alkyl acids and sulfonates in the River Seine (Paris, France) under contrasting hydrological conditions  ap. 3634-3639.  aThe biogeochemical dynamics of 15 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were investigated in a heavily urbanised river (River Seine, Paris, France). The target compounds included C4-C10 sulfonates and C5-C14 acids; eleven PFCs were detected and ∑PFCs ranged between 31 and 91 ng L⁻¹ (median: 47 ng L⁻¹). The molecular pattern was dominated by the perfluoroalkyl sulfonates PFHxS and PFOS (>54% of ∑PFCs), which were the only PFCs quantified in both the dissolved and particulate phases. For these PFCs, the sorbed fraction positively correlated with suspended sediment levels. Total PFC levels negatively correlated with river flow rate, which varied between 150 and 640 m³ s⁻¹. This suggests the predominance of point sources (likely WWTP effluent discharge), but a contribution of non-point sources such as combined sewer overflow could not be excluded. The annual PFC mass flow was estimated at 500 kg, which is less than observed for other large European rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3acorrelation 3amass flow 3aperfluorocarbons 3arivers 3asulfonates 3asuspended sediment 3aurbanization 2aAlkanesulfonatesxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aFrance 0aParis (France)1 aChevreuil, Marc0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Dec., v. 159, no. 12 p.3634-3639dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012500162300002000287520122900307592002801536650002301564650001401587650001301601650001301614650001501627650002301642650001901665650001601684650001701700700002101717773014301738856007401881852000901955655001201964IND60670626220221118081340.0191002e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067062622DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta15387h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmeyama, Tomokazu10aDesign and control of organic semiconductors and their nanostructures for polymer–fullerene-based photovoltaic devices  ap. 11545-11560.  aThe polymer solar cell (PSC) technology has continued to be developed, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has now exceeded 10%. The rapid improvement of PCEs in the last decade has mainly resulted from versatile synthetic efforts for conjugated polymers as electron-donors and fullerene derivatives as electron-acceptors. This Feature Article highlights recent exploration of unique, attractive building blocks, i.e., quinoidal units, phospholes, porphyrins, and fluorinated aromatic rings, which can be incorporated into low bandgap conjugated polymers. As candidates for the next-generation acceptor materials that replace the benchmark acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM), fullerene bisadduct regioisomers are also overviewed. Furthermore, we summarized recent attempts for the construction of one-dimensionally confined, organic donor–acceptor heterojunction nanorods and their applications to photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. The topics in this article are not intended to cover an exhaustive list of PSC research studies, but involve the fundamental aspect to stimulate further studies for getting new insights into the structure–property relationship in PSC devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3afullerene 3ananorods 3apolymers 3aporphyrins 3apositional isomers 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aImahori, Hiroshi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 8, v. 2, no. 30 p.11545-11560dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta15387h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245011600157300001800273500001900291520123800310592002801548650001101576650001501587650002101602650003101623650001501654650001501669650002501684651001501709700001401724700002301738700002001761700002001781700005201801773014001853856007901993852000902072655001202081IND60655817320221120212853.0190807e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b017132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun10aInference of Organophosphate Ester Emission History from Marine Sediment Cores Impacted by Wastewater Effluents  ap. 8767-8775.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganophosphate esters (OPEs) have been in use as flame retardants for many decades, with their actual usage varying over time. Knowledge of the emission history of OPEs is valuable for improving our prediction of their environmental loadings and associated risks. In this study, concentrations and compositions of 10 OPEs were measured in three dated sediment cores from the Palos Verdes Shelf (PVS) off the coast of Los Angeles, which has been impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents for over a century. The total OPE concentrations varied from 0.68 to 1064 ng/g along the sediment profile, with two apparent peaks. The first peak occurred in the 1970s, coinciding with peak emissions from WWTPs. The second peak appeared in the 2000s and was possibly attributed to increased consumption of OPEs as replacement flame retardants. Since downward movement of OPEs in the PVS sediment bed was retarded by their slow desorption, the reconstructed history likely provided an accurate picture of OPE emissions in Southern California and North America. These findings suggest that the near-shore marine sediments affected by WWTP effluents could serve as an environmental proxy documenting history in OPE use and emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adesorption 3amarine sediments 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aprediction 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aCalifornia1 aWang, Jie1 aTaylor, Allison R.1 aCryder, Zachary1 aSchlenk, Daniel1 aGan, Jay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7137-49880 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 July 15, v. 53, no. 15 p.8767-8775dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b017133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008400170300001600254520129100270592002801561650004001589650003101629650001401660650001201674650001901686650001301705650002601718653001801744653002101762653001801783653001601801700002101817700002501838700002301863773012101886856008202007852000902089655001202098IND60532930720221118140922.0160728e20140103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053293072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Yoshikatsu10aShikonin shortens the circadian period: Possible involvement of Top2 inhibition  ap. 339-343.  aThe naphthoquinone pigment, shikonin, is a natural product derived from Lithospermum erythrorhizon and an active component of a Chinese traditional herbal therapeutic. We identified shikonin as a candidate for shortening the circadian period using real-time reporter gene assays based on NIH3T3-derived stable reporter cells. Period length that became shortened in cells incubated with shikonin or etoposide reverted to that of control cells after continued incubation without these compounds. These findings indicated that shikonin and etoposide shorten the circadian period reversibly and through similar mechanisms. Topoisomerase II (Top2)-specific decatenation assays confirmed that shikonin, liker etoposide, is a Top2 inhibitor. Shikonin was incorporated into the nucleus and Top2 was located in the Bmal1 promoter, suggesting the relationship between Bmal1 transcription and Top2 inhibition. Top2a siRNA also shortened period length, suggesting that Top2 is involved in this process. Promoter assays showed that Top2a siRNA, etoposide and shikonin reduce Bmal1 promoter activity. These findings indicated that Top2 is involved in Bmal1 transcription and influences the circadian period, and that shikonin is a novel contributor to the control of period length in mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aLithospermum erythrorhizon 3aetoposide 3amammals 3areporter genes 3ashikonin 3asmall interfering RNA 0aTranscription 0aCircadian rhythm 0aTopoisomerase 0aClock genes1 aKawano, Yasuhiro1 aYamazaki, Yoshimitsu1 aŌnishi, Yoshiaki,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Jan. 03, v. 443 p.339-343dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04699naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166300001400265520265900279592002802938650001602966650001202982650002502994650001603019650001003035650001803045650002203063650002003085650001103105650001603116650001103132650001503143650001603158650001503174650002203189650001603211650001803227650001503245650003403260650001103294650001603305650002903321650001703350650001103367650003303378650001603411650001503427650001303442650001803455650002303473653002503496653001103521653001503532653001803547653001403565700005603579700001603635700001703651700001603668700001203684700001603696700002003712700001703732773012203749856008503871852000903956655001203965IND60636541220221118232233.0220914e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063654122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Huali10aPhysiological and metabolome changes during anther development in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 18-32.  aThis study used cytology, cytochemistry, and non-targeted metabolomics to investigate the distribution characteristic of polysaccharides, lipids, and all the metabolites present during five wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) anther developmental stages to provide insights into wheat anther development. Anthers were collected from the tetrad through trinucleate stages, and 1.5% (w/v) acetocarmine and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining were used to confirm the developmental stage and visualize the nuclei, respectively. Polysaccharides and lipids were detected by staining with periodic acid-Schiff and Sudan Black B, respectively. The integrated optical density of the tapetum and microspores were calculated using IPP6.0 software. Furthermore, the metabolites were identified by gas chromatograph system coupled with a Pegasus HT time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS). The results indicated that the interior and exterior surface cells of anthers are orderly. Pollen was rich in numerous nutrient substances (e.g., lipids, insoluble carbohydrates, and others), and formed a normal sperm cell that contained three nuclei, i.e., one vegetative nuclei and two reproductive nuclei in the mature pollen. Semi-thin sectioning indicated that the tapetum cells degraded progressively from the tetrad to late uninucleate stage and disappeared from the bi-to trinucleate stages. Moreover, nutrient substances (lipids and insoluble carbohydrates) accumulated, were synthesized in the pollen, and gradually increased from the tetrad to trinucleate stages. Finally, the metabolomics results identified that 146 metabolites were present throughout the wheat anther developmental stages. Principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and metabolite-metabolite correlation revealed distinct dynamic changes in metabolites. The metabolism of organic acids, amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, amines, polyols, and nucleotides were interrelated and involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis. Furthermore, their interactions were revealed using an integrated metabolic map, which indicated that the TCA cycle and glycolysis were very active during anther development to provide the required energy for anther and pollen development. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of substance metabolism in wheat anthers and can be used for possible application by metabolic engineers for the improvement of cell characteristics or creating new compounds and molecular breeders in improving pollen fertility or creating the ideal male sterile line, to improve wheat yield per unit area to address global food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3apolyols 3adevelopmental stages 3anucleotides 3awheat 3afood security 3acomputer software 3apolysaccharides 3apollen 3ametabolites 3asugars 3aabsorbance 3aamino acids 3ametabolome 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3acytochemistry 3aglycolysis 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aamines 3aspermatozoa 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3ametabolomics 3aenergy 3aprincipal component analysis 3amicrospores 3aSudan dyes 3astaining 3aspectrometers 3agas chromatography 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0aAnther 0aMetabolome 0aCytochemistry 0aFertility1 aSong, Yulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2472-59221 aGuo, Jialin1 aWang, Junwei1 aZhang, Lili1 aNiu, Na1 aMa, Shoucai1 aZhang, Gaisheng1 aZhao, Huiyan0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Nov., v. 132 p.18-32dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015200164300001800316500001900334520139200353592002801745650001601773650002401789650002001813650000901833650002601842650001001868650002101878650001501899650001601914651001101930700001901941700002401960700001601984700002102000700002602021700006202047773014002109856008002249852000902329655001202338IND60655817420210726000000.0200213e20190711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065581742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b017492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarrer, Cecile10aLinking Probabilistic Exposure and Pharmacokinetic Modeling To Assess the Cumulative Risk from the Bisphenols BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPAF for Europeans  ap. 9181-9191.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe bisphenols S, F, and AF (BPS, BPF, and BPAF) are used to replace the endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) while exerting estrogenic effects of comparable potency. We assessed the cumulative risk for the aforementioned BPs in Europe and compared the risk before and after the year 2011, which was when the first BPA restrictions became effective. For this, we probabilistically modeled external exposures from food, personal care products (PCPs), thermal paper, and dust (using the tools MCRA and PACEM for exposures from food and PCPs, respectively). We calculated internal concentrations of unconjugated BPs with substance-specific PBPK models and cumulated these concentrations normalized by estrogenic potency. The resulting mean internal cumulative exposures to unconjugated BPs were 3.8 and 2.1 ng/kg bw/day before and after restrictions, respectively. This decline was mainly caused by the replacement of BPA by BPS in thermal paper and the lower dermal uptake of BPS compared to BPA. However, the decline was not significant: the selected uncertainty intervals overlapped (P2.5–P97.5 uncertainty intervals of 2.7–4.9 and 1.3–6.3 ng/kg bw/day before and after restrictions, respectively). The upper uncertainty bounds for cumulative exposure were higher after restrictions, which reflects the larger uncertainty around exposures to substitutes compared to BPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acumulative exposure 3acumulative risk 3adust 3aenvironmental science 3apaper 3apharmacokinetics 3atechnology 3auncertainty 3aEurope1 ade Boer, Waldo1 aDelmaar, Christiaan1 aCai, Yaping1 aCrépet, Amélie1 aHungerbühler, Konrad1 avon Goetz, Natalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5257-45730 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 July 11, v. 53, no. 15 p.9181-9191dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b017493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245007500169300002000244520105800264592002801322650001101350650002301361650001601384700001901400773012901419856008201548852000901630655001201639IND60566932020221120033017.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b053092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMozgawa, Krzysztof10aElectronic Structure of Small Surfactants: A Continuum Solvation Study  ap. 17501-17513.  aThe effect of surfaces and interfaces on the structure and properties of molecules is of great interest in a number of biological and technological applications. Nevertheless, such an investigation is extremely challenging from an experimental point of view, due to the bidimensionality of the environment. In recent years, we have developed a framework to study molecules at surfaces and interfaces, by means of a continuum approach. In the present study, we extend our model by showing the effect of interfacial solvation on molecular properties and by refining the description of the transfer process, making use of a proper Boltzmann averaging of the orientational degrees of freedom. Our findings are in substantial agreement with previous simulations for the energetics of the transfer process, but yield a somehow different description of the molecular electronic structure. Both the agreement on the energetics and the disagreement on the properties are motivated in light of the role played by nonelectrostatic effects in the solvation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3asurfactants1 aFrediani, Luca0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17501-17513dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b053093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001800275520216500293536024602458592002802704596010402732650001902836650002102855650002902876650001102905650003502916650001302951650002802964650000802992650001003000650001203010650005003022650001403072650000903086650001203095650001903107650000903126650002403135650001803159650002203177651001003199700001703209700001603226700001303242700001603255773013803271856008503409852000903494655001203503IND60637251620221119103136.0190416e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063725162DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.15775782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jianrong10aHazard assessment of glacial lake outburst floods in Southeast Tibet based on RS and GIS technologies  ap. 4955-4979.  aGlacial lakes are widely distributed across glaciated mountainous regions such as Southeast Tibet (ST). As a result of climate change, glacial lakes have expanded continually in ST over recent five decades, and ST is seriously suffering from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Hence, glacial lake investigations and hazard assessments of GLOFs are very necessary to perform and are of great practical significance for this area. The region running from Ranwu to Tongmai (RTR) in ST was selected as a study area. To assess hazard degrees of GLOFs, nine factors (F1–F9) were selected from glacial characteristics: the scale of glacial lakes, meteorological conditions, moraine dam parameters and downstream gullies. Average monthly (May to September) land surface temperatures (LSTs), temperature change rates, and average annual precipitation levels were first calculated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data. Then, glacial lake areas, downstream gully slopes, distances to glacial lakes, upper glacier areas, average gradients of upper glaciers, and terminal moraine dam widths were obtained based on Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Finally, the fuzzy comprehensive assessment (FCA) method was used to assess hazard degrees of GLOFs in the study area. According to the results, 135 glacial lakes existed during the study periods, five new glacial lakes formed due to lake collapse and snow and ice melt, and one disappeared due to GLOFs. The number of glacial lakes in the area increased from 130 in 1986 to 134 in 2015, and the total area of glacial lakes increased from 832.77 ha in 1986 to 850.51 ha in 2015 due to lake expansion and GLOFs. Of the 134 glacial lakes present in 2015, 10 are identified as high hazardous lakes, eight are identified as medium hazardous lakes, two are considered low hazardous lakes, and 114 are considered extremely low hazardous lakes. The results illustrate hazard levels of GLOFs in ST, which can help guide future hazard prevention in the area.  aThis work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant No. XDA20030301] and the Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Science [Grant No. KFJ-EW-STS-094].  aPublisher supplied data  aKFJ-EW-STS-094cScience and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Science 3aclimate change 3adams (hydrology) 3adigital elevation models 3afloods 3ageographic information systems 3aglaciers 3ahazard characterization 3aice 3alakes 3amelting 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amountains 3arain 3aravines 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asurface temperature 3athematic maps 3atopographic slope 3aChina1 aAn, Chunchun1 aZhang, Xiyu1 aLi, Xuan1 aTan, Jiejun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 July 3, v. 40, no. 13 p.4955-4979dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.15775783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012500168300001600293520120000309592002801509650002501537650002901562650001201591650002301603650001801626650001201644650002401656650001201680653003701692653001901729653002601748653002601774700001201800700001401812700001801826773011301844856008601957852000902043655001202052IND60531654720221120030115.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Taiwen10aEnvironmental management systems and financial performance: the joint effect of switching cost and competitive intensity  ap. 781-791.  aDespite the importance of environmental management systems, previous findings on its relationship with financial performance are inconsistent. This study aims to investigate how the relationship between environmental management systems and financial performance is moderated by switching cost, competitive intensity and their interaction drawing on contingency theory and an interactional perspective. We conducted two waves of survey to collect data from 214 Chinese manufacturing firms and employed hierarchical moderated regression analysis to test the research hypotheses. The results reveal that there is a positive relationship between environmental management systems and financial performance. This relationship is negatively moderated by switching cost and is positively moderated by competitive intensity. In addition, switching cost and competitive intensity have a negative joint moderating effect on the relationship between environmental management systems and financial performance. This study advances environmental management systems research by identifying the market conditions that augment or constrain the impact of environmental management systems on financial performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental management 3afinance 3amanagement systems 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 0aEnvironmental management systems 0aSwitching cost 0aCompetitive intensity 0aFinancial performance1 aCai, Di1 aWang, Dan1 aZhang, Xiaodi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 113 p.781-791dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014600169520135300315592002801668650002201696650002301718650001101741650002401752650001601776650001701792650001901809650001501828650001901843650001601862653004701878653002001925653001801945653002601963653002801989700005402017700001502071700001602086700001302102700001602115700006502131773012702196856008602323852000902409655001202418IND60740533420221120103531.0210715e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huifeng10aEffectiveness evaluation of environmentally friendly stabilizers on remediation of Cd and Pb in agricultural soils by multi-scale experiments  aUtilizing heavy-metal-contaminated agricultural land safely is an urgent problem. Comprehensive evaluation of remediation efforts and economic benefits of stabilizers on contaminated soil are the most important means to address this problem. Environmentally friendly stabilizers attapulgite (APT), attapulgite/carbon (APT/C), and phosphate mineralization bacteria products (PMBP) were analysed for their ability to stabilize Cd and Pb in soil under incubation conditions and to decrease the uptake of heavy metals by vegetables under greenhouse and ﬁeld conditions. In incubation, pot, and field experiments, APT/C best stabilized Cd in soil, while PMBP had the best stabilization effect on Pb in soil. Based on effectiveness, cost, and improved yields, the optimal amounts of stabilizers were 5‰ APT/C and 0.21‰ PMBP. In practical applications, PMBP should be appropriately supplemented annually to ensure its efficiency. APT/C and PMBP can be used to treat heavy-metal-contaminated agricultural soils not only in this study area, but also in other similar heavy-metal-contaminated agricultural lands. This study provides a new perspective for evaluating the performance of eco-friendly heavy metal stabilizers in soils by analysing their efficiency, economic benefit, and application time through multiple rounds of multi-scale experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aapplication timing 3acarbon 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3amineralization 3aphosphates 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 0aHeavy-metal-contaminated agricultural land 0aBioavailability 0aFood security 0aIn situ stabilization 0aEconomic eﬀectiveness1 aHu, Wenyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-28881 aWu, Qiumei1 aHuang, Biao1 aZong, Li1 aWang, Aiqin1 aSiebecker, Matthew G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1348-65430 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127673-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245012300213520211700336592002802453650001502481650000802496650001502504650001102519650002002530650001802550650001302568650001302581650001802594650002102612650001602633653002302649653001602672653001602688700001902704700001702723700005802740700001802798773011302816856008602929852000903015655001203024IND60740533520221120113351.0210715e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdahaie, S.

Hydrogen storage performance and consumption of these systems are strongly dependent on heat and mass transfer characteristics. Incorporating Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and spiral tube heat exchangers into metal hydride reactors improves storage performance significantly. The present paper includes a numerical investigation on the storage performance of a novel Porous Metal Hydride Tank (PMHT) integrated with PCM as a passive heat transfer system. Moreover, a heat exchanger with newly-offered Flat Spiral Tube Planes (FSTPs) is mounted into a reactor for heat transfer enhancement. The air as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) flows into the metal reactor through a spiral tube to enhance the heat and mass transfer. The effects of various spiral configurations, different shapes, and thicknesses of PCM jackets on the absorption/desorption process of hydrogen are investigated in detail. Also, various inlet temperatures are applied to the system to examine its impact on the absorption/desorption process. According to the results, increasing the number of FSTPs along the PMHT reduces the absorption duration by 8%. Moreover, compared with PMHT without PCM, the absorption and desorption performance of PCM-based PMHT is improved by 44% and 20%, respectively. Furthermore, increasing and decreasing the air inlet temperature leads to a 43% and 47% reduction in total desorption and absorption duration, respectively. Finally, conical-shaped PCM-jackets are found to be capable of demonstrating better absorption and desorption performances. They offer the advantage of less PCM usage to provide even a higher performance than annulus PCM-jackets. In this regard, the conical-shaped PCM provides the means for the PMHT to reach its maximum hydrogen absorption by only 85% usage of its PCM volume. In comparison, annulus-shaped PCM uses 98% of its PCM volume to help the PMHT reach its maximum hydrogen absorption capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3amass transfer 3aphase transition 3atemperature 0aMetal hydride tank 0aSpiral tube 0aLatent heat1 aHosseini, M.J.1 aEisapour, M.1 aEisapour, A.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8748-150X1 aRanjbar, A.A.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127674-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166246006000256300001600316520110200332592002801434650001601462650004201478650002201520650001301542650001301555650000801568650001901576650001601595650002101611650001101632650000901643650001801652700001601670700001601686773011701702856004801819852000901867655001201876IND50063467320221120225812.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006346732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-013-0667-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzmutku, M.

The influence of the freezing rate and the time of exposure to negative temperatures were evaluated by applying three different freezing conditions which may occur in winter when green timber is stored in an open yard. It was found that a high freezing rate (−10 °C/h) does not affect wood strengths at all, while slow freezing (by −1 °C/h) significantly reduces all mechanical wood properties, especially MOR, MOE and the compressive strength (by 20…30 %), the Janka hardness (by 18 %), and also the tensile strength (by 10 %). A longer time of exposure, involving repeated freezing and thawing due to natural temperature variations led to further reduction of MOR, MOE and the compressive strength (up to 37 %), but without further affecting the tensile strength, shear strength and hardness. The obtained results may be useful to industrials with respect to a more careful planning of green timber purchase and storage in wintertime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aenvironmentally preferable purchasing 3aexposure duration 3afreezing 3ahardness 3amor 3ashear strength 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3awinter 3awood 3awood strength1 aCampean, M.1 aPorojan, M.0 tEuropean Journal of Wood and Wood Products.g2013 Mar., v. 71, no. 2 p.205-210dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-013-0667-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245016200167300002000329520154800349592002801897650001101925650001401936650001101950650001301961650001801974650002301992650002202015650002302037650001702060650001602077700002402093700001702117700001802134700002002152700001802172700003002190773012902220856008202349852000902431655001202440IND60566932320221120033020.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b053492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Thomas
D.10aCharacterization of Emissive States for Structurally Precise Au25(SC8H9)180 Monolayer-Protected Gold Nanoclusters Using Magnetophotoluminescence Spectroscopy  ap. 17784-17790.  aElectronic relaxation dynamics and near-infrared emission of structurally precise Au₂₅(SC₈H₉)₁₈⁰ MPCs were studied using energy-resolved and time-resolved magneto-photoluminescence (MPL) spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out at sample temperatures spanning the range of 4.5 to 20 K following 3.1 eV laser excitation. These measurements revealed two main PL peaks detected at 1.78 and 1.98 eV. The emissive states giving rise to these peaks were characterized using magnetic circular polarized photoluminescence (MCPL) spectra, which were obtained from energy-resolved PL collected at positive and negative field polarities. Analysis of MCPL magnetization data yielded a Lande g-factor of g = 1.05 ± 0.04 for the 1.98 eV peak and g = 1.7 ± 0.1 for the 1.78 eV peak. The g-factor of the 1.78 eV peak suggested emission from a quartet state, which represents a high-spin configuration for this system. The time-resolved MPL data were fit to a biexpenoential decay function that included a stretch parameter. Arrhenius analysis of the 4.5 K field-dependent rate data identified an energy barrier of 0.66 ± 0.04 meV, which was interpreted as the energy gap separating dark and bright fine structure components of the manifold of nanocluster emissive states. The temperature dependence of this energy barrier was attributed to thermal population of the upper state, reducing the effect of field-induced mixing. These data provide new insight into the optical properties of structurally precise, condensed-phase metal clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amagnetism 3amixing 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aHerbert, Patrick J.1 aYi, Chongyue1 aZeng, Chenjie1 aMcGill, Stephen1 aJin, Rongchao1 aKnappenberger, Kenneth L.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17784-17790dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b053493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010700162520155400269592002801823650001201851650001301863650002001876650001901896650001501915650001901930650002501949650001001974651001801984700002502002700002102027700002302048700002202071700002402093700002402117700001902141700002402160700002002184773012902204856007502333852000902408655001202417IND60791092220221119073526.0220826e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079109222DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141640052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraesser, Jordan 10aTemporally-Consistent Annual Land Cover from Landsat Time Series in the Southern Cone of South America  aThe impact of land cover change across the planet continues to necessitate accurate methods to detect and monitor evolving processes from satellite imagery. In this context, regional and global land cover mapping over time has largely treated time as independent and addressed temporal map consistency as a post-classification endeavor. However, we argue that time can be better modeled as codependent during the model classification stage to produce more consistent land cover estimates over long time periods and gradual change events. To produce temporally-dependent land cover estimates—meaning land cover is predicted over time in connected sequences as opposed to predictions made for a given time period without consideration of past land cover—we use structured learning with conditional random fields (CRFs), coupled with a land cover augmentation method to produce time series training data and bi-weekly Landsat imagery over 20 years (1999–2018) across the Southern Cone region of South America. A CRF accounts for the natural dependencies of land change processes. As a result, it is able to produce land cover estimates over time that better reflect real change and stability by reducing pixel-level annual noise. Using CRF, we produced a twenty-year dataset of land cover over the region, depicting key change processes such as cropland expansion and tree cover loss at the Landsat scale. The augmentation and CRF approach introduced here provides a more temporally consistent land cover product over traditional mapping methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acropland 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3aSouth America1 aStanimirova, Radost 1 aTarrio, Katelyn 1 aCopati, Esteban J.1 aVolante, José N.1 aVerón, Santiago R.1 aBanchero, Santiago 1 aElena, Hernan 1 aAbelleyra, Diego de1 aFriedl, Mark A.0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141640053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245009000209520104800299592002801347650001201375650001901387650002001406650001501426650001301441700006601454773010401520856008201624852000901706655001201715IND60736783620221118013839.0220207e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esg.2021.1001072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayaram, Dhanasree1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0483-794310aAiding or undermining? The military as an emergent actor in global climate governance  aThe military is emerging as an important actor in climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly when it comes to responding to climate extremes. While not generally considered a “governance actor” in scholarship on climate governance, militaries increasingly participate in climate-related knowledge production, resource provision, and decision-making. However, the nature and degree of involvement of militaries in these issues vary from context to context, based on political, socio-cultural, institutional, and economic conditions. This Perspective examines this expanding role through the five Earth System Governance research lenses. We argue that it is necessary to more fully account for the emergence of this powerful actor within accepted democratic frameworks of climate governance. Key research questions relate to the implications of military involvement, the appropriateness of military involvement in different contexts, and the consequences of the involvement of an authoritarian actor for climate governance norms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3agovernance 3apolitics1 aBrisbois, Marie Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6600-72970 tEarth system governance.g2021 Sept., v. 9 p.100107-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27266x2589-81167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esg.2021.1001073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010300165300001800268520170600286592002801992650002002020650001202040650001502052650002802067650001102095650001602106650003302122650001902155653001702174653002702191653002802218653002102246653003102267653003302298700002402331773011302355856008002468961000902548852000902557655001202566IND60616456820221120134642.0181016e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061645682DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175176976412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yongliang14aThe relationship between instrumental leaf grade and Shirley Analyzer trash content in cotton lint  ap. 1091-1098.  aWith the increasing acceptance of high volume instrument (HVI™) instrumental leaf grade index in both domestic and international trading, there is a continued interest in the relationship between instrumental leaf grade and equivalent trash gravimetric content (% percent by mass) from cotton customers and regulators. Due to the complexity of not only trash type, size, and its weight distribution but also the nature of HVI and gravimetric methods, it is an on-going challenge to examine such a relationship. In this study, the Shirley Analyzer (SA) was used to determine the gravimetric cotton trash in percent by mass (%). This system is the traditional cotton trash reference method that is still utilized as a routine tool in the cotton industry, despite being a destructive process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study first investigated the correlations between three SA trash readings (SAᵥᵢₛᵢbₗₑ, SAᵢₙᵥᵢₛᵢbₗₑ, and SAₜₒₜₐₗ) and respective leaf grade categories, and it revealed a general trend of increasing SAᵥᵢₛᵢbₗₑ and SAₜₒₜₐₗ trash content with elevating leaf grade. Then, comparison of SAᵥᵢₛᵢbₗₑ trash content in the current study to that in separate studies indicated a good agreement for low leaf grade cottons (<4). Next, the principal component analysis of near infrared spectra from SAᵥᵢₛᵢbₗₑ trash portions revealed a different pattern in PC1 score between low leaf grade (1–4) and high leaf grade (5 and 6) SA visible trash remains, implying a general change of more leaf-related trash in low leaf grade cottons to more non-leaf-related trash in high leaf grade cottons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton industry 3afabrics 3agravimetry 3ahigh volume instruments 3aleaves 3alint cotton 3aprincipal component analysis 3atextile fibers 0acotton trash 0ahigh volume instrument 0ainstrumental leaf grade 0aShirley Analyzer 0anear infrared spectroscopy 0aprincipal component analysis1 aDelhom, Christopher0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 88, no. 10 p.1091-1098dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175176976413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008700158300001600245520102200261592002801283650002301311650001501334650002801349650001401377650001101391650001801402650001901420650001701439650001601456650001201472653002101484653002301505653001801528653001301546653001701559653001901576700001901595700002701614700002601641700002401667773009601691856003801787852000901825655001201834IND50059476320221121011230.0121102s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005947632DNAL7 a10.1071/FP120492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoorter, Hendrik10aPot size matters: a meta-analysis of the effects of rooting volume on plant growth  ap. 839-850.  aThe majority of experiments in plant biology use plants grown in some kind of container or pot. We conducted a meta-analysis on 65 studies that analysed the effect of pot size on growth and underlying variables. On average, a doubling of the pot size increased biomass production by 43%. Further analysis of pot size effects on the underlying components of growth suggests that reduced growth in smaller pots is caused mainly by a reduction in photosynthesis per unit leaf area, rather than by changes in leaf morphology or biomass allocation. The appropriate pot size will logically depend on the size of the plants growing in them. Based on various lines of evidence we suggest that an appropriate pot size is one in which the plant biomass does not exceed 1gL-1. In current research practice ~65% of the experiments exceed that threshold. We suggest that researchers need to carefully consider the pot size in their experiments, as small pots may change experimental results and defy the purpose of the experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acontainers 3adry matter partitioning 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3ameta-analysis 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aresearchers 3arooting 0acontainer volume 0aexperimental setup 0ameta-analysis 0apot size 0aplant growth 0arooting volume1 aBühler, Jonas1 avan Dusschoten, Dagmar1 aCliment Barber, José1 aPostma, Johannes A.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2012, v. 39, no. 11 p.839-850dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP12049  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245013700220520176600357592002802123650002202151650001002173650001902183650002302202650002002225650001902245650001402264650001702278650002202295650001302317650003302330650001902363650001502382653002202397653002602419653002502445653003002470653002902500653002202529700006502551700001802616700002402634700005902658773011302717856008602830852000902916655001202925IND60740533720221120103426.0210715e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbuabdou, Salahaldin M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6183-544510aDevelopment of a novel polyvinylidene fluoride membrane integrated with palm oil fuel ash for stabilized landfill leachate treatment  aStabilized landfill leachate is a complex wastewater containing high concentration of non-biodegradable organic compounds and Ammoniacal nitrogen. Thus, an advanced treatment such as membrane technology is required to treat leachate effectively. In this study, membrane filtration process was employed to treat stabilized leachate. A new type of membrane was fabricated by incorporating palm oil fuel ash (POFA) into hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer to produce flat sheet membrane via phase inversion technique. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the membrane fabrication. The filtration process was carried out using cross-flow ring (CFR) test. The best removal efficiencies of COD, colour and NH₃–N was found using a membrane with the following composition: 13.9 wt% PVDF and 1.2 wt% POFA. To improve the permeability and anti-fouling ability, the best performing membrane was further modified using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The performance and characterization of unmodified and modified membranes were systematically analyzed. The results showed that filtration properties of modified membrane were efficiently developed by 0.5 wt% of PVA. Pure water flux value was enhanced from 40.16 to 81.08L/m².h and transmembrane pressure was reduced from 0.60 to 0.55 bar as a result of the surface and pore size improvements. Moreover, the modified membranes significantly enhanced the removal of COD (57.06%), colour (58.27%) and NH₃–N (55.44%) due to the newly developed microstructure. This study offers the best way to develop PVDF- POFA membrane improved by PVA for stabilized landfill leachate treatment. The produced PVDF membrane was also economical compared to the commercially available PVDF membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acolor 3ahydrophobicity 3alandfill leachates 3amicrofiltration 3amicrostructure 3apalm oils 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aporosity 3aresponse surface methodology 3athermoplastics 3awastewater 0aLandfill leachate 0aFiltration technology 0aMembrane fabrication 0aPhase inversion technique 0aPalm oil fuel ash (POFA) 0aEconomic analysis1 aBashir, Mohammed J.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3086-05681 aAun, Ng Choon1 aSethupathi, Sumathi1 aYong, Wong Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5913-886X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127677-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245021600170300002000386520140000406592002801806650001701834650002301851650002201874650001101896700002101907700001801928700002001946700002301966700001601989700001902005773012902024856008202153852000902235655001202244IND60566932420221120032851.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b053762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Yukihiro10aFabrication of Conducting Thin Films on the Surfaces of 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane Single-Component and Charge-Transfer Complex Single Crystals: Nucleation, Crystal Growth, Morphology, and Charge Transport  ap. 17537-17545.  aElectrically conducting TTF–TCNQ thin films are fabricated on various molecular crystals containing 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) by exposing a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) vapor under ambient conditions. To systematically investigate the properties of the films, mixed-stack TCNQ charge-transfer (CT) complex crystals with nine kinds of donors have been prepared as the substrates, and the morphology change of the films on the surfaces at the initial stage of the TTF vapor contact has been observed. When the substrate is a TCNQ single-component crystal, randomly oriented TTF–TCNQ nanometer-size needle crystals are grown by the reaction with a TTF vapor. However, when the substrate is a TCNQ CT complex crystal, TTF–TCNQ crystals are grown with alignment of their needle axis along the mixed-stack direction of the substrate. The surface roughness, the size of the needle crystals, and the degree of the dense packing of the needles have been found to systematically depend on the strength of the CT interactions in the substrate, and the sheet resistance also exhibits a systematic change. The resistance drop is rapid and remarkable when the donor of the substrate CT complex is weak. The difference in the morphology and the properties is considered to arise from the difference in the ease of nucleus formation and the rate of crystal growth of the TTF–TCNQ nanocrystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananocrystals 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface roughness 3avapors1 aMikasa, Tomohiro1 aHayakawa, Kei1 aYokokura, Seiya1 aHasegawa, Hiroyuki1 aHarada, Jun1 aInabe, Tamotsu0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17537-17545dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b053763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013900208520151100347592002801858650002501886650001601911650001101927650000901938650002301947650001401970653003101984653001702015653002202032653002602054653003202080653003702112700002002149700002102169773009002190856008502280852000902365655001202374IND60727628220221119160016.0211003e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072762822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakui, Tetsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7033-487X10aStructural design of distributed energy networks by a hierarchical combination of variable- and constraint-based decomposition methods  aA near-optimal solution method of a large-scale design problem of a distributed energy network, consisting of multiple energy-supply systems under power and heat interchanges, is developed by hierarchically combining variable- and constraint-based decompositions. The design problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming, and its scale increases with the number of connected energy-supply systems and daily patterns of energy demand. By focusing on the hierarchical relationship between design and operation variables, the original problem is decomposed into an upper-level design problem and lower-level coordinated operation problems based on the Benders decomposition. By focusing on power- and heat-interchange constraints, the coordinated operation problem is further decomposed into a master problem concerning power and heat interchanges and subproblems for energy supply in each energy-supply system based on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. A near-optimal solution is calculated through a two-level iterative calculation, consisting of delayed constraint generation between the design problem and the coordinated operation problems and delayed column generation between the master problem and the subproblems in each coordinated operation problem. The near-optimal solution method is applied to the structural design problem of distributed energy networks incorporating 5–100 cogeneration systems, in which suboptimal solutions cannot be found in the conventional solution method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acogeneration systems 3adegradation 3aenergy 3aheat 3alinear programming 3asolutions 0aDistributed energy network 0aOptimization 0aStructural design 0aBenders decomposition 0aDantzig-wolfe decomposition 0aMixed-integer linear programming1 aHashiguchi, Moe1 aYokoyama, Ryohei0 tEnergy.g2021 June 01, v. 224 p.120099-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010800160300002000268520122700288592002801515650002301543650001301566650001401579650001601593650002701609650001401636650001801650650002801668650001901696700002901715700001701744700001801761700002801779773012401807856007401931852000902005655001202014IND60640884320221119183413.0190505e20160826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088432DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11724d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jia Ming10aDroplet generation in cross-flow for cost-effective 3D-printed “plug-and-play” microfluidic devices  ap. 81120-81129.  aDroplet-based microfluidics is a rapidly growing field of research and involves various applications from chemistry to biology. Droplet generation techniques become the pre-requisite focus. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) technology has recently been exploited in microfluidics due to its simplicity and low cost. However, only relatively large droplets can be produced in current 3D-printed droplet generators, due to the channel dimension limitations on how fine a channel can be 3D-printed. Here we report a novel design of a 3D-printed “plug-and-play” device for the generation of monodisperse microdroplets with sizes down to ∼50 μm. This device combines a 3D-printed generator, a commercial tubing and a fingertight fitting, which can be easily assembled and disassembled. Different emulsions, water-in-oil and oil-in-water, can be generated in the same device. Scaling laws for droplet sizes generated in our device have been successfully proposed and verified. Furthermore, the feasibility of 3D printing technology used in droplet-based engineering applications has been demonstrated by two novel 3D-printed devices, as well as by using the device for producing magnetically responsive microparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aengineering 3agenerators (equipment) 3amagnetism 3amanufacturing 3amicrofluidic technology 3amicroparticles1 aAguirre-Pablo, Andres A.1 aLi, Er Qiang1 aBüttner, U.,1 aThoroddsen, Sigurdur T.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 26, v. 6, no. 84 p.81120-81129dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11724d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245010500171300001600276520145100292592002801743650001001771650001101781650004301792650002101835650001001856650002101866650002201887650001201909650001201921650001901933650001601952651001001968700001801978700001601996700001602012700001602028773010802044856005502152852000902207655001202216IND50071436520221119111602.0131221e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007143652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.01721.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Yanjing10aZonation of plant cover and environmental factors in wetlands of the Sanjiang Plain, northeast China  ap. 748-756.  aThe zonation of depressional and riparian wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of northeastern China was studied to describe their vegetation composition and environmental variables. We sampled 108 plots in 6 depression and riparian wetlands. Samples were classified into 4 groups using two‐way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Emergent marsh vegetation was characterized by Carex lasiocarpa and C. pseudocuraica, meadow marsh vegetation by tussock species such as Carex appendiculata and C. meyeriana, wet meadow vegetation by Calamangrostis angustifolia and Carex appendiculata, and shrub meadow vegetation by the shrubs Betula fruticosa, Alnus sibirica and Salix rosmarinifolia and the graminids Carex schmidtii and Calamagrostis angustifolia. CCA ordination showed that water table, organic matter and available N were the major factors explaining the vegetation zonation pattern. Compared with other Northern Hemisphere regions, bog and fen vegetation are completely absent due to climatic conditions unfavorable for peat formation. Out of four vegetation types, only the Carex lasiocarpa community and the C. pseudo‐curaica community have been found in other regions. However, at the species level many species are widespread and some species are vicariant or pseudovicariant to other regions in the world. Our study suggests that topography and hydrology may be the most important determinants of the vegetation pattern in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus 3aBetula 3aCalamagrostis purpurea subsp. purpurea 3aCarex lasiocarpa 3aSalix 3aclimatic factors 3aindicator species 3amarshes 3ameadows 3aorganic matter 3awater table 3aChina1 aWang, Guoping1 aLu, Xianguo1 aJiang, Ming1 aZhao, Kuiyi0 tNordic journal of botany.g2013 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.748-756dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.01721.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013800164300002000302520191000322592002802232650003002260650002802290650001702318650001202335650002602347650002302373650001102396650002102407650001902428700001902447700002302466700002302489700001702512700002002529700002202549700002102571773012902592856008202721852000902803655001202812IND60566932620180615000000.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b054022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParis, Chiara10aIncreasing the Templating Effect on a Bulk Insulator Surface: From a Kinetically Trapped to a Thermodynamically More Stable Structure  ap. 17546-17554.  aMolecular self-assembly, governed by the subtle balance between intermolecular and molecule–surface interactions, is generally associated with the thermodynamic ground state, while the competition between kinetics and thermodynamics during its formation is often neglected. Here, we present a simple model system of a benzoic acid derivative on a bulk insulator surface. Combining high-resolution noncontact atomic force microscopy experiments and density functional theory, we characterize the structure and the thermodynamic stability of a set of temperature-dependent molecular phases formed by 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid molecules, self-assembled on the insulating calcite (10.4) surface. We demonstrate that a striped phase forms before the thermodynamically favored dense phase, indicating a kinetically trapped state. Our theoretical analysis elucidates that this striped-to-dense phase transition is associated with a distinct change in the chemical interactions involved in the two phases. The striped phase is characterized by a balance between molecule–molecule and molecule–substrate interactions, reminiscent of the molecular bulk. In contrast, the dense phase is formed by upright standing molecules that strongly anchor to the surface with a comparatively little influence of the intermolecular interactions, i.e., in the latter case the substrate acts as a template for the molecular structure. The kinetic trapping stems from a relatively strong intermolecular interaction between molecules in the striped phase that need to be broken before the substrate-templated dense phase can be formed. Thus, our results provide molecular level insights into two qualitatively different bonding motifs of a simple organic molecule on a bulk insulator surface. This understanding is mandatory for obtaining predictive power in the rational design of molecular structures on insulating surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 3aatomic force microscopy 3abenzoic acid 3acalcite 3achemical interactions 3achemical structure 3amodels 3aphase transition 3athermodynamics1 aFloris, Andrea1 aAeschlimann, Simon1 aKittelmann, Markus1 aKling, Felix1 aBechstein, Ralf1 aKühnle, Angelika1 aKantorovich, Lev0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17546-17554dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b054023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012200214520184500336592002802181650001602209650001502225650001602240650002602256650001102282650001802293650001202311650001002323650001602333650001802349650001102367650000702378650001502385650002002400650001202420650001702432650001402449650001202463650001702475650001102492653001502503653001502518653002802533653001802561700006402579700002402643773012102667856008302788852000902871655001202880IND60736784120221118014008.0210825e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1001552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmatuzzaman Rana, Md1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6242-183410aTraceability of sweeteners in soy yogurt using linear discriminant analysis of physicochemical and sensory parameters  aThe present study was aimed to design and develop the consumer-accepted soy yogurt using different sweeteners and investigate the possibility of tracing these sweeteners by implementing a classification algorithm. The effects of three types of sweeteners on the physicochemical properties, sensory properties, and prediction of sweeteners in soymilk-based yogurt were investigated using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Yogurts were prepared by inoculating lactic acid cultures into soymilk containing 0.3% gelatin, one of the selected sweeteners [sucrose, honey, and sucralose (an artificial sugar)], and strawberry flavor. Freshly prepared soy yogurts were then analyzed for their physicochemical and sensory characteristics. The results revealed that the honey samples had a higher protein content (4.69%–4.71%) compared to that in plain yogurt (3.83%). Soy yogurts containing the sweeteners had a relatively reduced fat content, with the lowest fat content exhibited by the honey samples (1.88%–1.91%). Furthermore, the addition of sweeteners resulted in final products with varying ash content and total soluble solids (TSS). In contrast, the least effect was found on lactic acid and pH. The overall sensory results revealed that the strawberry flavored soy yogurt with honey as sweetener could attain acceptable quality upon processing. LDA with two components based on the partial chemical composition of soy yogurts could identify the sweetener source in unknown soy yogurt samples. The discriminatory ability of the LDA model was further validated using unknown soy yogurt samples to predict the sweeteners, and an accuracy level ranging from 80% to 100% was attained in 1000 test runs. Moreover, the model could distinguish the presence of artificial sweeteners from the other sweeteners in the samples with 100% accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3aash content 3adiscriminant analysis 3aflavor 3afood research 3agelatin 3ahoney 3alactic acid 3alipid content 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3aprotein content 3asoymilk 3astrawberries 3asucralose 3asucrose 3atraceability 3ayogurt 0aSoy yogurt 0aSweeteners 0aDiscrimination analysis 0aAcceptability1 aBabor, Majharulislam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5440-75731 aSabuz, Ashfak Ahmed0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2021 Sept., v. 5 p.100155-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1001553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014800165300001400313520174900327592002802076650001502104650001702119650002102136650002002157650002602177650001502203650002202218650001802240650002102258650001402279650001302293700001402306700001602320700001502336700001202351700001602363700001702379773010102396856008202497852000902579655001202588IND60091558820221119024908.0141103e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Xianxue10a4-(Dimethylamino)butyric acid@PtNPs as enhancer for solid-state electrochemiluminescence aptasensor based on target-induced strand displacement  ap. 25-29.  aA solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor based on target-induced aptamer displacement for highly sensitive detection of thrombin was developed successfully using 4-(dimethylamino)butyric acid (DMBA)@PtNPs labeling as enhancer. Such a special aptasensor included three main parts: ECL substrate, ECL intensity amplification and target-induced aptamer displacement. The ECL substrate was made by modifying the complex of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) and tris(2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)₃ ²⁺) (Ru–PtNPs) onto nafion@multi-walled carbon nanotubes (nafion@MWCNTs) modified electrode surface. A complementary thrombin aptamer labeled by DMBA@PtNPs (Aptamer II) acted as the ECL intensity amplification. The thrombin aptamer (TBA) was applied to hybridize with the labeled complementary thrombin aptamer, yielding a duplex complex of TBA–Aptamer II on the electrode surface. The introduction of thrombin triggered the displacement of Aptamer II from the self-assembled duplex into the solution and the association of inert protein thrombin on the electrode surface, decreasing the amount of DMBA@PtNPs and increasing the electron transfer resistance of the aptasensor and thus resulting large decrease in ECL signal. With the synergistic amplification of DMBA and PtNPs to Ru(bpy)₃ ²⁺ ECL, the aptasensor showed an enlarged ECL intensity change before and after the detection of thrombin. As a result, the change of ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the logarithm of thrombin concentration in the range of 0.001–30nM. The detection limit of the proposed aptasensor is 0.4pM. Thus, the approach is expected to open new opportunities for protein diagnostics in clinical as well as bioanalysis in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3abutyric acid 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aruthenium 3athrombin1 aYuan, Ruo1 aChai, Yaqin1 aYuan, Yali1 aMao, Li1 aCao, Yaling1 aLiao, Yuhong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 34, no. 1 p.25-29dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001800247500001100265520136200276592002801638596005901666596010801725596009101833596007901924650002602003650001302029650002002042650002202062650002502084650002102109650001302130650001502143650001102158650001202169650001702181650001302198650002002211650001402231700001802245700001802263700001702281700005902298773013102357856008302488852000902571655001202580IND60749130320221120192045.0220708e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074913032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-021-07289-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuexin10aCryptosporidium and cryptosporidiosis in wild birds: A One Health perspective  ap. 3035-3044.  aReview  aCryptosporidium is one of the most important parasitic protozoa that can be transmitted through food and water contamination. With the increasing report of Cryptosporidium infections in wild birds, especially in herbivorous waterfowl, concerns have been raised for oocyst contamination of water and food supplies, which in turn can cause human and domestic animal infections in areas neighboring wild birds’ habitats. This review discusses the epidemiology, species, and genotypes distribution of Cryptosporidium in wild birds around the world. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium in wild birds was calculated as 3.96% (1945/49129), with 6 Cryptosporidium species (C. andersoni, C. parvum, C. meleagridis, C. avium, C. baileyi, and C. galli) and 5 genotypes (Goose genotype I, Goose genotype II, Avian genotype I, Avian genotype III, and Avian genotype VI) reported. As wild birds mainly live in the wild, control method for the Cryptosporidium infection in wild birds is still lacking, which increases the probability of disease transmission from wild birds to humans. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the Cryptosporidium infection in wild birds and its transmission, associated risk factors, and their prevention, illustrating the necessity of multidisciplinary approaches toward screening and control of Cryptosporidium infections.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1904203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019SJGLX006YcHigher Education Teaching Reform Research and Practice Project of Henan Province in 2019  a2017YFD0501305, 2019YFC1605700cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a19CZ0122cLeading talents of the Thousand Talents Program of Central China 3aOne Health initiative 3aProtozoa 3acontrol methods 3acryptosporidiosis 3adisease transmission 3adomestic animals 3agenotype 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3aoocysts 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3awater pollution 3awaterfowl1 aZhang, Kaihui1 aChen, Yuancai1 aLi, Xiaoying1 aZhang, Longxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9310-19750 tParasitology research.g2021 Sept., v. 120, no. 9 p.3035-3044dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07289-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012000171300001600291520184500307592002802152650001402180650001702194650000902211650001202220650001602232650002202248650002502270650001902295650000902314650002002323650002602343650001702369650002902386650002102415650002302436650001102459651001102470653002702481653002002508653002602528653001402554700006202568700002202630773011302652856008602765852000902851655001202860IND60531655520221121222954.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoux, Charlotte10aAccounting for temporal variation of electricity production and consumption in the LCA of an energy-efficient house  ap. 532-540.  aThe development of on-site renewable energy production and demand management in buildings calls for a deeper understanding of the interaction between building operation and the electricity grid. Electricity consumption in buildings varies in terms of seasons (heating and cooling), day of the week (professional activities) and hour of the day, which is also the case of on-site electricity production (e.g. photovoltaic systems). Centralised electricity production varies as well according to the demand (e.g. during peak hours). This research aims at improving the evaluation of potential environmental impacts of an energy efficient house attributable to electricity consumption and production by taking into account the temporal variation of the electricity production. Electricity end-uses and on-site electricity production were evaluated on an hourly basis in the case of an energy-efficient house. Another objective was to investigate the sources of errors in the assessment. Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate potential environmental impacts based on electricity production data for the year 2013 in France. Results were compared using an annual average electricity supply mix versus hourly data. This case study demonstrates that the use of an annual average mix instead of hourly mix data can lead to underestimation of potential impacts up to 39% for Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP) and 36% for Global warming potential (GWP) when combining all end-uses. Increase of GWP and ADP when using hourly mix data is mainly explained by higher share of coal and gas power plant in the electricity mix in winter. This coincides with a higher electricity consumption of the studied house in this season due to space heating, electric back-up of the solar water heating system and a lower onsite production (photovoltaic system).  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acoal 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aheating systems 3alife cycle assessment 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aFrance 0aElectricity production 0aElectricity mix 0aLife cycle assessment 0aBuildings1 aSchalbart, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3021-90761 aPeuportier, Bruno0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 113 p.532-540dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245006800161300002000229520094300249592002801192650001101220650001301231650001301244650001201257650001401269650001101283650002201294700001501316700001601331700001701347700001201364773012901376856008201505852000901587655001201596IND60566932820221120032904.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b054502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Can10aOriented Organic Nanowires Self-Assembled on a Graphene Surface  ap. 17564-17569.  aMolecular self-assembly of organic molecules on two-dimensional atomic crystals involves molecule–molecule interactions, molecule–surface interactions, or their combination. Most previous studies are focused on self-assembled organic monolayers. Here, for the first time, we report oriented organic nanowires self-assembled on a graphene surface in the atmosphere. Oriented lauroyl peroxide nanowires were formed when cooling down the melting lauroyl peroxide layer on a graphene surface but were not formed on SiO₂ and copper surfaces. Structural analysis and theoretical simulation revealed that the combination of strong molecule–molecule packing interactions, weak molecule–molecule linking interactions, and weak molecule–surface interactions contributed to the formation of nanowires, while the orientation of nanowires depended on the six-fold rotational symmetry of graphene and strong molecule–surface interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acrystals 3agraphene 3amelting 3ananowires 3asilica 3asimulation models1 aHe, Mengci1 aLiu, Dandan1 aSun, Xiudong1 aGao, Bo0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17564-17569dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b054503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007300168520229900241592002802540650000802568650002002576650001002596650001402606650001102620650000902631650001502640650001802655650002502673650001502698650002202713650002102735650001002756653002002766653003202786653002202818653001902840653002002859700002202879700001902901700002002920700002402940773011302964856008603077852000903163655001203172IND60740534320221120094224.0210904e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČulić, Ana10aSmart monitoring technologies for personal thermal comfort: A review  aImproving the efficiency of building energy systems is crucial to reach a goal related to the high – performance building, particularly in the space heating and air - cooling domain, which are considered as leading energy consumption systems in buildings. Current trends in the smart building paradigm allowed efficient implementation of user-centric approach in personal thermal comfort modelling. The potential technological solutions in that sense can bring various benefits leading towards improvement of the building energy performance. Existing papers published in the Scopus and Web of Science database have been reviewed in order to investigate a state of the art related to experimental practices in the development and application of monitoring technologies for personal thermal comfort. Consequently, the work brings insights in some of the main research findings in the area focusing on (I) inputs that affect personal thermal comfort, (II) smart technologies and methods used for sensing and the detection of defined inputs and (III) insights into the approaches of collected data processing. Parameters considered in reviewed literature rely on environmental and personal variables. Based on the conducted review, it can be indicated that room air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and mean radiant temperature (MRT) are frequently used environmental parameters in thermal comfort modelling. Among user – related indicators in the considered literature, skin temperature (hands, face) and metabolic rate (MET) are found to be the most common, followed by clothing insulation (CLO) and heart rate data. Some additional parameters are also found to be influenced by thermal comfort of individual (skin conductance, brain activity, heat flux, sweat rate, aural temperature, body core temperature). Subjective response from users is still unavoidable and recorded through questionnaires. The results of review indicated that technological solutions for detection of thermal comfort parameters in data-driven models are mainly based on network of connected sensors, and can be divided into camera-based technologies, wearable devices and connected sensor systems. Finally, open questions and gaps that inquire further research were also detected and discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3abrain 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aface 3aheart rate 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3ametabolism 3arelative humidity 3askin temperature 3asweat 0aThermal comfort 0aPersonalized comfort models 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnergy savings 0aSmart buildings1 aNižetić, Sandro1 aŠolić, Petar1 aPerković, Toni1 aČongradac, Velimir0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127685-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015000158520159900308592002801907650001801935650001601953650001701969650001101986650004301997650002302040650001802063650002302081650001102104650001102115651001002126700001602136700001502152700001602167700001902183700001802202700001502220700002102235773012902256856007502385852000902460655001202469IND60791092920221119072014.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079109292DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141640122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yanrong 10aQuantifying Spatiotemporal Heterogeneities in PM2.5-Related Health and Associated Determinants Using Geospatial Big Data: A Case Study in Beijing  aAir pollution has brought about serious challenges to public health. With the limitations of available data, previous studies overlooked spatiotemporal heterogeneities in PM₂.₅-related health (PM₂.₅-RH) and multiple associated factors at the subdistrict scale. In this research, social media Weibo data was employed to extract PM₂.₅-RH based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, in Beijing, China. Then, the relationship between PM₂.₅-RH and eight associated factors was qualified based on multi-source geospatial big data using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results indicate that the PM₂.₅-RH in the study area showed a spatial pattern of agglomeration to the city center and seasonal variation in the spatially non-stationary effects. The impacts of varied factors on PM₂.₅-RH were also spatiotemporally heterogeneous. Specifically, nighttime light (NTL), population density (PD) and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) had outstanding effects on PM₂.₅-RH in the four seasons, but with spatial disparities. The impact of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on PM₂.₅-RH was significant in summer, especially in the central urban areas, while in winter, the contribution of the air quality index (AQI) was increased. This research further demonstrates the feasibility of using social media data to indicate the effect of air pollution on public health and provides new insights into the seasonal impacts of associated driving factors on the health effects of air pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acase studies 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation density 3apublic health 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina1 aWang, Juan 1 aMeng, Bin 1 aJi, Huimin 1 aWang, Shaohua 1 aZhi, Guoqing 1 aLiu, Jian 1 aShi, Changsheng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 18, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141640123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001600263520106100279592002801340650002001368650002101388650002101409650001301430650003801443650001701481650001401498650001401512650002501526650001901551650001401570653004401584653002701628653002301655653002201678653003201700653002101732700001401753700002301767773010401790856008401894852000901978655001201987IND60122433920221123041659.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243392DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.8423802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagane, Mitsuo10aPsychosomatic disorder may be related to circadian rhythms in physically healthy students  ap. 121-130.  aStudents suffering from subjective psychosomatic disorder often have basic lifestyle problems. We examined 30 healthy students aged 21–22 years old. Salivary samples were collected from the subjects at home five times per day (20:00, 24:00, 04:00, 08:00 and 12:00 h). We assessed melatonin secretion patterns by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay and cortisol secretion by ELISA. We assigned the subjects to regular, semi-regular and irregular circadian rhythm groups based on whether melatonin secretion was high until midnight. A self-assessment questionnaire addressing psychosomatic disorder was completed by the same students. The subjects rated their psychosomatic symptoms twice per day (08:00 and 20:00 h). The irregular group showed lower cortisol awakening response, but high cortisol concentrations at 12:00 h; this group also reported more subjective health complaints related to psychosomatic stress compared with the regular group. Our findings suggest that psychosomatic disorder is associated with circadian rhythms in Japanese students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese people 3acircadian rhythm 3acollege students 3acortisol 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3alifestyle 3amelatonin 3apsychological stress 3aquestionnaires 3asecretion 0amorningness–eveningness (chronotypes) 0apsychosomatic disorder 0asalivary melatonin 0asalivary cortisol 0acortisol awakening response 0ahealthy students1 aSuge, Rie1 aWatanabe, Shu-Ichi0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 45, no. 1 p.121-130dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.8423803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013700166500001400303520144800317592002801765650001401793650001401807650002701821650001301848650001201861650001901873650001401892650001801906650000901924650001501933650001901948650001001967650002201977650001501999650001502014650000702029650001502036650001402051650001302065650001602078650001502094650001602109650001202125650002102137653002502158653004702183653002502230700001902255700001602274700001702290700001702307773009502324856008402419852000902503655001202512IND60709537320221119024425.0210105e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Dongmin10aRapid eco-toxicity analysis of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) using morphological change detection in Dunaliella tertiolecta  aNAL-light  aEco-toxicity testing assesses the potential harmfulness of unknown toxic substances as well as other effects of those substances, such as synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects using various organisms including water flea, fish, benthic amphipod, and microalgae. Microalgae are important components in the food chains of marine ecosystems. Conventionally, the growth rate of an individual microalgae population is analyzed for 72 h to identify the effects of external stresses, e.g., chemicals, pH, temperature, CO₂, etc. However, this method requires counting the number of microalgae every 24 h using a microscope, which is not only labor intensive but also requires substantial expertise. Dunaliella tertiolecta which rapidly changes its morphology when exposed to toxic substances, has been a species of interest among biomass and eco-toxicology researchers. However, such small changes are difficult to visualize and interpret with conventional microscopy or physicochemical techniques. Therefore, we propose a new method which utilizes microalgal morphological changes via lens-free shadow imaging technology (LSIT). To this end, a field-portable cell analyzer, NaviCell, which integrates LSIT was developed. Within this platform, the morphological changes of hundreds of microalgae can be automatically analyzed in parallel within just 3–4 min with over 96% precision and accuracy enabling rapid eco-toxicity evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aCladocera 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3aaccuracy 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3adetection 3aecotoxicology 3afish 3afood chain 3aimage analysis 3alabor 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroalgae 3amicroscopy 3apH 3apopulation 3aprecision 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3atechnology 3atemperature 3atesting 3atoxic substances 0aEco-toxicity testing 0aLens-free shadow imaging technology (LSIT) 0aMorphological change1 aShin, Sanghoon1 aOh, Sangwoo1 aLee, Moonjin1 aSeo, Sungkyu0 tAlgal research.g2020 Oct., v. 51 p.102063-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009800161300001600259500000900275520153200284592002801816650002101844650002301865650001301888650002501901650000901926650002201935650001101957650001801968650001501986650002202001650001002023650002002033650001202053650002002065650001802085651001902103700001902122700001802141700001602159773013202175856007802307852000902385655001202394IND60663395320221118063926.0191122e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339532DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj13.04862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, D.

Therefore, the objectives of this research were to define interactions of SDI and tillage with respect to yield and economic return of corn (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) planted in rotation. Research was conducted in two 4-yr periods (2007–2010 and 2008–2011) in North Carolina using continuous strip tillage vs. continuous conventional tillage without irrigation or with SDI using a crop sequence of 1 yr of cotton, 2 yr of corn, followed by 1 yr of peanut. Corn, cotton, and peanut yields increased with SDI compared with no irrigation regardless of tillage system. Cotton and peanut yields were not affected by tillage system or the interaction of tillage and irrigation; corn yield was affected by this interaction. In the second year of corn, yield and economic return were higher in conventional tillage with SDI than strip tillage with SDI. Economic return for the sum of crops in the rotation was affected by the interaction of irrigation and tillage. Economic return was higher in both periods during each year corn was grown under SDI compared with non-irrigated corn while higher economic returns for cotton and peanut under SDI were noted in one of two periods. When pooled over periods, crops, and tillage, economic return for SDI was US$1,552 ha–¹ higher than non-irrigated production over 4 yr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aZea mays 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acosts and returns 3acotton 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3acropping sequence 3acrops 3amicroirrigation 3apeanuts 3areduced tillage 3astrip tillage 3aNorth Carolina1 aJohnson, P.

In this paper we mapped the temporal hydrological dynamics of floodplain wetlands in the Ganga-Padma moribund deltaic zone. To evaluate the trend in wetland changes over time we used a time-series of Landsat images from 1987 to 2016 and adopted Water Presence Frequency (WPF), Standard Deviation, and Trend Analysis for stability and trend of water presence and change over time. Normalized Difference Water Index is used for wetland mapping for both pre- and post-monsoon seasons using the 30 years Landsat images. The result shows sequential changes in trend of wetland area and nature of deviation in water availability in wetland over time. More than 85% wetland area is prone to shallowing of depth and out of which 25% area is highly infected to this problem as found from wetland trend analysis. Standard deviation approach and trend analysis approach are used for detecting pixel-wise dynamics of wetland and trend of wetland change over the selected period of time based on the same images. The entire time spectrum is subdivided into three phases for detecting phasal change of water presence frequency (WPF) or stability of wetland. Among the total wetland area, 21.22% appeared as highly stable (high WPF) and 43.71% emerged as instable (low WPF). Only 14.56% wetland area recorded low departure in water availability, and these are usually found in the stable wetland part.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aenvironment 3afloodplains 3ahydrology 3astandard deviation 3atime series analysis 3aIndia1 aPaul, Satyajit0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.12925-12953dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01193-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012200167300001600289520131500305592002801620650000901648650002801657650001401685650001501699650001401714650001101728650001301739653007701752700001701829700002001846700001901866700002401885700001801909700002601927773011201953856008502065852000902150655001202159IND60515413620221119104327.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541362DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2015.11211452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZito, Sarah10aCross-Sectional Study of Characteristics of Owners and Nonowners Surrendering Cats to Four Australian Animal Shelters  ap. 126-143.  aUnwanted cats surrendered to nonhuman animal shelters are generally categorized as either “owned” or “stray.” This classification is misleading because “stray” cats may include many “semiowned” cats, for which people provide care but who are not perceived as being owned. This differentiation is important because effective strategies designed to reduce cat admissions to, and euthanasia rates in, shelters rely on accurate information about cat populations contributing to shelter intake; cat semiowners will likely respond to different strategies than people with no relationship with the cats they surrender. People surrendering cats to four Australian animal shelters were surveyed to identify factors associated with perception of ownership. Many self-classified nonowners had fed the cats they surrendered, often for a considerable period of time. The factor most strongly associated with ownership perception was an increasing association time with the cat. These findings confirm that enduring relationships between surrenderers and cats, consistent with cat semiownership, are common for cats surrendered to Australian animal shelters. This finding should be taken into account when planning education messages and cat population management strategies aimed at reducing cat admissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3aeuthanasia 3aownership 3apeople 3aplanning 0aAnimal shelter; cat; cat semiownership; shelter medicine; animal welfare1 aMorton, John1 aPaterson, Mandy1 aVankan, Dianne1 aBennett, Pauleen C.1 aRand, Jacquie1 aPhillips, Clive J.

Eighteen oxysterols previously have been identified as oxidation products of 7-DHC (most of them distinct from cholesterol (Chol)-derived oxysterols) in solution, in cells, and in brains obtained from Dhcr7-KO mice and AY9944-treated rats, formed either via free radical oxidation (peroxidation) or P450-catalyzed enzymatic oxidation. We report here the identification of five 7-DHC-derived oxysterols, including 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), 4α- and 4β-hydroxy-7-DHC, 24-hydroxy-7-DHC and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kChol, an oxysterol that is normally derived from Chol), in the retinas of AY9944-treated rats by comparing the retention times and mass spectrometric characteristics with corresponding synthetic standards in HPLC-MS analysis. Levels of 4α- and 4β-hydroxy-7-DHC, DHCEO, and 7-kChol were quantified using d₇-DHCEO as an internal standard. Among the five oxysterols identified, only 7-kChol was observed in retinas of control rats, but the levels of 7-kChol in retinas of AY9944-rats were 30-fold higher. Intravitreal injection of 7-kChol (0.25μmol) into a normal rat eye induced panretinal degeneration within one week; by comparison, contralateral (control) eyes injected with vehicle alone exhibited normal histology. These findings are discussed in the context of the potential involvement of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols in the retinal degeneration associated with the SLOS rat model and in SLOS patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a7-dehydrocholesterol 3aanimal models 3acholesterol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistology 3aintravitreal injection 3amacular degeneration 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3aoxidation 3apatients 3aperoxidation 3arats 3aretina 3atissues1 aSheflin, Lowell G.1 aPorter, Ned A.1 aFliesler, Steven J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 June, v. 1821, no. 6 p.877-883dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001600278520135400294592002801648653001501676653002601691653001701717653001701734653001601751653002001767700002201787700002201809773016601831856008101997852000902078655001202087IND60651145520221119173303.0190711e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065114552DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154170013572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarabanova, Larisa10aCytogenetic study on the invasive species Gmelinoides fasciatus in the ecosystem of the Gulf of Finland  ap. 611-618.  aThe amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus from Lake Baikal is an example of a species being introduced into a number of water bodies in Russia, including the water system of North-west Russia, to expand food reserves of commercial fish. The interest in this crustacean has been attributed to its successful adaptation and expanding habitat area in the region. In order to assess the role of genetic mechanisms in adaptation to new conditions the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (ChA) at anaphase and telophase stages of mitosis in G. fasciatus embryos from six local populations of Lake Baikal and two invasive populations of the Gulf of Finland, originating from natural habitats were studied in two sequential years. The average level of ChA varied slightly between 0.95% in the samples collected in Lake Baikal and 2.9% in those from the Gulf of Finland. A significant increase in the frequency of ChA was found at two sites in Lake Baikal in 2015 and at two locations in the Gulf of Finland in 2016. First information on G. fasciatus chromosome number and constitution acquired by means of molecular cytogenetic techniques is presented and discussed. The results enable us to suggest this amphipod as a sensitive model to study possible mechanisms of biological adaptation and at the same time as a natural bioindicator of the environmental state.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadaptation 0aGmelinoides fasciatus 0abioindicator 0acytogenetics 0aLake Baikal 0aGulf of Finland1 aGalkina, Svetlana1 aMikhailova, Elena0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2019 May, v. 99, no. 3 p.611-618dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170013573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014700172300001400319520200300333592002802336650002102364650002602385650002602411650003302437650002602470700002002496700002102516700001902537700001702556773009302573856008402666852000902750655001202759IND60112966220221116193649.0141111e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOp de Beeck, Jeff10aImpact of the limitations of state-of-the-art micro-fabrication processes on the performance of pillar array columns for liquid chromatography  ap. 35-48.  aWe report on the practical limitations of the current state-of-the-art in micro-fabrication technology to produce the small pillar sizes that are needed to obtain high efficiency pillar array columns. For this purpose, nine channels with a different pillar diameter, ranging from 5 to 0.5μm were fabricated using state-of the-art deep-UV lithography and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) etching technology. The obtained results strongly deviated from the theoretically expected trend, wherein the minimal plate height (Hₘᵢₙ) would reduce linearly with the pillar diameter. The minimal plate height decreases from 1.7 to 1.2μm when going from 4.80 to 3.81μm diameter pillars, but as the dimensions are further reduced, the minimal plate heights rise again to values around 2μm. The smallest pillar diameter even produced the worst minimal plate height (4μm). An in-depth scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection of the different channels clearly reveals that these findings can be attributed to the micro-fabrication limitations that are inevitably encountered when exploring the limits of deep-UV lithography and DRIE etching processes. When the target dimensions of the design approach the etching resolution limits, the band broadening increases in a strongly non-linear way with the decreased pillar dimensions. This highly non-linear relationship can be understood from first principles: when the machining error is of the order of 100–200nm and when the target design size for the inter-pillar distance is of the order of 250nm, this inevitably leads to pores that will range in size between 50 and 450nm that we want to highlight with our paper highly non-linear relationship.

Here we investigate the fabrication of SnOₓ nanostructures through sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) in block copolymer (BCP) film templates. While the growth of metal and metal oxides within polymers and BCP films via SIS has been demonstrated until now using small precursors such as trimethyl aluminum and diethyl zinc, we hypothesize that SIS can be performed using larger precursors and demonstrate SnOₓ SIS with tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn) and hydrogen peroxide. Tuning the SIS reaction and BCP chemistry resulted in highly ordered, polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP)-templated porous SnOₓ - AlOₓ and SnOₓ nanostructures. Detailed investigation using in-situ microbalance, high resolution electron microscopy, elemental analysis and infra-red spectroscopy shows that SnOₓ can directly grow within P2VP homopolymer and BCP films. Simultaneously with the growth, SnOₓ SIS process also contributes to the polymer etch. Performing SnOₓ SIS with pretreatment of a single AlOₓ SIS cycle increases the SnOₓ growth and protects the BCP template from etching. This is the first report of SnOₓ SIS opening a pathway for additional tetrakis-based organometallic precursors to be utilized in growth processes within polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3aelectron microscopy 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananomaterials 3apyridines 3atin 3atin dioxide 3azinc 0aSequential infiltration synthesis 0aAtomic layer deposition 0aTin oxide 0aBlock copolymer1 aSimon, Assaf1 aWeisbord, Inbal1 aShomrat, Neta1 aSegal-Peretz, Tamar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3222-64290 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 557 p.537-545dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245011900213300001600332506007600348520185800424592002802282506003702310650001602347650002602363650001602389650001002405650002302415650001602438650001202454650001002466650000902476650001302485650001602498700002502514700002502539700002602564700002402590700002502614700002402639700002602663700002202689773010402711856008402815852000902899655001202908IND60090001620221207091853.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0112doi7 aPMC33662562pmcid7 a224411642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovacs, Werner J.10aPeroxisome deficiency-induced ER stress and SREBP-2 pathway activation in the liver of newborn PEX2 knock-out mice  ap. 895-907.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDisruption of the Pex2 gene leads to peroxisome deficiency and widespread metabolic dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that peroxisomes are critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, using peroxisome-deficient Pex2⁻/⁻ mice on a hybrid Swiss Webster×129S6/SvEv (SW/129) genetic background. Peroxisome deficiency activates hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, leading to dysregulation of the endogenous sterol response mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a more profound dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in newborn Pex2⁻/⁻ mice congenic on a 129S6/SvEv (129) genetic background, and substantial differences between newborn versus postnatal Pex2⁻/⁻ mice in factors that activate ER stress. These differences extend to relationships between activation of genes regulated by SREBP-2 versus PPARα. The SREBP-2 pathway is induced in neonatal Pex2⁻/⁻ livers from 129 and SW/129 strains, despite normal hepatic cholesterol levels. ER stress markers are increased in newborn 129 Pex2⁻/⁻ livers, which occurs in the absence of hepatic steatosis or accumulation of peroxins in the ER. Moreover, the induction of SREBP-2 and ER stress pathways is independent of PPARα activation in livers of newborn 129 and SW/129 Pex2⁻/⁻ mice. Two-week-old wild-type mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 show strong induction of PPARα-regulated genes and decreased expression of SREBP-2 and its target genes, further demonstrating that SREBP-2 pathway induction is not dependent on PPARα activation. Lastly, there is no activation of either SREBP-2 or ER stress pathways in kidney and lung of newborn Pex2⁻/⁻ mice, suggesting a parallel induction of these pathways in peroxisome-deficient mice. These findings establish novel associations between SREBP-2, ER stress and PPARα pathway inductions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesterol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afatty liver 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ahomeostasis 3akidneys 3aliver 3amice 3aneonates 3aperoxisomes1 aCharles, Khanichi N.1 aWalter, Katharina M.1 aShackelford, Janis E.1 aWikander, Thomas M.1 aRichards, Michael J.1 aFliesler, Steven J.1 aKrisans, Skaidrite K.1 aFaust, Phyllis L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 June, v. 1821, no. 6 p.895-907dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012200172300001600294520133300310592002801643650002001671650001601691650001901707650000901726650001101735650001401746650001101760650000901771650001901780650000901799651001201808653001301820653002101833653001601854653001001870700001801880700001401898700002501912773011201937856008502049852000902134655001202143IND60515413820221119104408.0160315e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541382DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2015.11252952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, Rachel10aEffect of Adopters' Lifestyles and Animal-Care Knowledge on Their Expectations Prior to Companion-Animal Guardianship  ap. 157-170.  aHuman expectations can greatly affect the human–companion animal relationship, sometimes putting nonhuman animals at risk for relinquishment. At 20 animal shelters in Southern Ontario, Canada, potential adopters (N = 234) completed a questionnaire regarding their lifestyle, companion animal-care knowledge, and preadoption expectations of their adopted companion animals. Linear mixed models were used to assess the associations of adopters' lifestyles and companion animal-care knowledge with their expectations for animal behavior, the human–companion animal relationship, and the effort required in companion-animal guardianship. Dog adopters had higher expectations than cat adopters for their companion animal's behavior (p < .001), the human–companion animal relationship (p < .001), and the effort required in companion-animal guardianship (p < .001). Adopters' human relationship statuses were also associated with expectations for the human–companion animal relationship (p = .002). As adopters' companion animal-care knowledge increased, so did their expectations for the effort required in companion-animal guardianship (p < .001). An understanding of adopters' expectations prior to adoption will help animal shelters better match, educate, and prepare adopters for their lives with companion animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal care 3aanimal welfare 3adogs 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amodels 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3aOntario 0aAdoption 0acompanion animal 0aexpectation 0aowner1 aCoe, Jason B.1 aNiel, Lee1 aJones-Bitton, Andria0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 19, no. 2 p.157-170dRoutledgex1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2015.11252953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245015200207300001400359520210300373592002802476650002502504650002002529650001802549650001102567650005002578650002202628650001302650653003102663653002902694653002602723653002102749653002102770700006302791700002502854773009002879856008102969852000903050655001203059IND60544767120221118064447.0160901e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalivas, John H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7056-976X10aSum of ranking differences (SRD) to ensemble multivariate calibration model merits for tuning parameter selection and comparing calibration methods  ap. 21-33.  aMost multivariate calibration methods require selection of tuning parameters, such as partial least squares (PLS) or the Tikhonov regularization variant ridge regression (RR).

Selection of the final tuning parameter is often accomplished through some form of cross-validation and the resultant root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) values are evaluated. However, selection of a “good” tuning parameter with this one model evaluation merit is almost impossible. Including additional model merits assists tuning parameter selection to provide better balanced models as well as allowing for a reasonable comparison between calibration methods. Using multiple merits requires decisions to be made on how to combine and weight the merits into an information criterion. An abundance of options are possible. Presented in this paper is the sum of ranking differences (SRD) to ensemble a collection of model evaluation merits varying across tuning parameters. It is shown that the SRD consensus ranking of model tuning parameters allows automatic selection of the final model, or a collection of models if so desired. Essentially, the user’s preference for the degree of balance between bias and variance ultimately decides the merits used in SRD and hence, the tuning parameter values ranked lowest by SRD for automatic selection. The SRD process is also shown to allow simultaneous comparison of different calibration methods for a particular data set in conjunction with tuning parameter selection. Because SRD evaluates consistency across multiple merits, decisions on how to combine and weight merits are avoided. To demonstrate the utility of SRD, a near infrared spectral data set and a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) data set are evaluated using PLS and RR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adata collection 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 0aSum of ranking differences 0aMultivariate calibration 0aPartial least squares 0aRidge regression 0aModel comparison1 aHéberger, Károly,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0965-939X1 aAndries, E.q(Erik),0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 869 p.21-33dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.12.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011900167300001600286520183900302592002802141650002702169650002502196650001702221650001602238650001202254650002302266650001002289650001202299650002002311650001302331650002302344650001502367650002002382650001602402700001802418700001602436700001502452773010402467856008402571852000902655655001202664IND60090002020221120172845.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDou, Jiangli10aCholesterol and the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids are required for sperm activation in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 934-942.  aEjaculated mammalian sperm must acquire fertilization capacity after residing into the female reproductive tract, a process collectively known as capacitation. Cholesterol efflux was required for sperm maturation. Different from flagellated sperm, C. elegans sperm are crawling cells. C. elegans sperm are highly enriched with cholesterol though this animal species lacks biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol and its survival requires an exogenous cholesterol supply. The low abundance of cholesterol in C. elegans lipid extract is thought insufficient to form lipid microdomains ubiquitously in this organism. We present evidence that cholesterol is enriched in the plasma membrane of C. elegans spermatids and that cholesterol- and glycosphingolipids (GSLs)-enriched membrane microdomains (lipid microdomains) mediate sperm activation. Disruption of sperm lipid microdomains by acute manipulation of cholesterol in vitro blocks the sperm activation. Restriction of cholesterol uptake also results in the abnormal sperm activation in both males and hermaphrodites. Manipulation of the integrity of lipid microdomains by targeting the biosynthesis of GSLs inhibits sperm activation and the inhibition can be rescued by the addition of exogenous GSLs. The cleavage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are exclusively found in lipid microdomains, also affects sperm activation. We conclude that localized signaling mediated by lipid microdomains is critical for worm sperm activation. Lipid microdomains composed of cholesterol and GSLs have been observed in flagellated sperm of several animal species, thus cholesterol, before its efflux from the plasma membrane, might be needed to assemble into a platform for some more important upstream signal sorting during spermatogenesis than was previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3afemales 3aglycosphingolipids 3amales 3amammals 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3asperm capacitation 3aspermatids 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa1 aChen, Lianwan1 aHu, Youqiao1 aMiao, Long0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 June, v. 1821, no. 6 p.934-942dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245016300166520122100329592002801550650001501578650002401593650001201617650000901629650002201638650001901660650000701679650001101686650001301697650002001710653002801730653002201758653001401780653001501794653001201809700001901821700001701840700001501857700001901872700001601891700001601907773010601923856008702029852000902116655001202125IND60698606420221122045600.0200824e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069860642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1251412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xin10aRational design an amorphous multifunctional δ-MnO2@Fe/Mg-MIL-88B nanocomposites with tailored components for efficient and rapid removal of arsenic in water  aCompounding a single component with a specific function into a composite material that can fully exert synergy effects according to demand is the key to achieving the expected function and expanding emerging applications. Herein, anchoring δ-MnO₂ with strong oxidizing ability on the surface of Fe/Mg-MIL-88B with superior uptake ability for As(V) to form an amorphous nanocomposite with multiple functions for removing more toxic As(III). Due to special construction and rational design, the fabricated nanocomposite demonstrated an excellent As(III) removal performance over a very broad pH range of 3 to 10. Impressively, the adsorption efficiency of the obtained δ-MnO₂@Fe/Mg-MIL-88B on As(III) is greatly improved, and the maximum adsorption capacity under laboratory conditions is as high as 221.04 mg/g in room temperature. Notably, the residual concentration of arsenic will drop below 10 μg/L, as long as the initial As(III) concentration is not higher than10 mg/L, which is very critical for further promotion. In general, the δ-MnO₂@Fe/Mg-MIL-88B exhibits excellent promise in removing As(III) from sewage, and its applicability in practical complex water treatment deserves further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aarsenic 3airon 3amanganese dioxide 3ananocomposites 3apH 3asewage 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aMetal organic framework 0aFunctionalization 0aOxidation 0aAdsorption 0aAs(III)1 aLiang, Qianwei1 aYang, Boqian1 aChen, Yuyu1 aFang, Yuanyuan1 aLuo, Hanjin1 aLiu, Yushan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 602 p.125141-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1251413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013300175500001900308520123600327592002801563650002001591650001801611650002101629650001201650650001501662650000801677650001101685650001601696650001701712650002101729650000901750650001501759650002201774650001001796650001901806650001201825650001401837650001801851650001001869650002601879650001001905650002101915653001601936653001101952653001301963653001601976653002401992653001902016700001202035773010902047856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60709538120221119024507.0210124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wri.2020.1001352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido Sanchis, Adrian10aEvaluation of the new energy-efficient hot bubble pilot plant (HBPP) for water sterilization from the livestock farming industry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffluent and water management, in particular inactivating pathogens, have become more critical for the livestock farming industry, from both public health and business efficiency perspectives. The new hot bubble pilot plant (HBPP) uses hot air and hot combustion gases to produce hot bubbles that successfully inactivated Escherichia coli C-3000 (ATCC15597) in the lab, in different synthetic effluents and later at the farm using naturally occurring bacteria such as Salmonella, E.coli, Thermotolerant coliforms, and Cyanophyta and protozoa spores (oocysts and cysts) from Giardia and Cryptosporidium from piggery effluent.Many industries, such as pig farms, landfills, biogas power plants, and coal power plants, emit large amounts of hot combustion gases. The potential use of these hot combustion gases (waste) to produce hot bubbles in a bubble column reactor offers a new energy-efficient water sterilization process that fits within the circular economy principals by using waste gases as an input for the system. This new technology would then be able to compete with other water-disinfection technologies, such as UV irradiation, ozonation, and even chlorination, due to its low operating costs and high energy efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aCyanobacteria 3aEscherichia coli 3aGiardia 3aSalmonella 3aair 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3achlorination 3acircular economy 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy efficiency 3afarms 3aheat tolerance 3aoocysts 3aozonation 3apublic health 3aswine 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater 3awater management 0aPilot plant 0aE.coli 0aProtozoa 0aWater reuse 0aWater sterilization 0aCombustion gas1 aJin, Lu0 tWater resources and industry.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.100135-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23294x2212-37177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wri.2020.1001353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011100165300001600276520091500292592002801207650001501235650002501250650002301275650001301298650001301311650001601324650001101340653002101351653001301372653001801385653002101403700002001424773010401444856008401548852000901632655001201641IND60122434720221122005221.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243472DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.7971612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalaksha, 10aEffect of different light regimes on eclosion rhythm of Drosophila agumbensis and Drosophila nagarholensis  ap. 219-227.  aAn endogenous control of timing of many events like oviposition, eclosion, and hatching occurs at a particular time of the day, which enhances the survival of an organism. The present study is an attempt to understand the effect of different light regimes on eclosion rhythm of Drosophila agumbensis and Drosophila nagarholensis . The eclosion rhythm of the two species were analyzed under constant conditions such as continuous light (LL), continuous dark (DD), and 12-h light and 12-h dark condition. Eclosion occurred only during morning period. The peak of eclosion was observed during 10 h in the morning in all the three light regimes of both the species in 10th and 20th generation. Analysis of variance revealed that there is a significant difference in the eclosion between light/dark, DD, and LL condition and Student t test revealed that there is no significant difference between the two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aanalysis of variance 3abiological rhythms 3aeclosion 3ahatching 3aoviposition 3at-test 0acircadian rhythm 0aeclosion 0aD. agumbensis 0aD. nagarholensis1 aShakunthala, V.0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 45, no. 2 p.219-227dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.7971613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01093naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245005800162300001600220520028500236592002800521650001300549650001600562650001900578650001700597700002400614773009700638856007100735852000900806655001200815IND60518557920221118230310.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855792DNAL7 a10.2307/19343192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTranquillini, Walter10aIntegrated Calibrations of Plant Gas Exchange Systems  ap. 974-976.  aCalibration procedures are described to test the accuracy of plant gas exchange systems.

We noticed a cultivar ‘Elodie’ show weak double-flowered phenotype, by which whole 3 can be classified into three different types including stamen, partially petaloid stamen (PPetSta) and totally petaloid stamen (TPetSta). To understand the molecular basis of this homeotically conversion variation, quantitative RNA-Seq analysis was conducted to screen the important unigenes underlying this phenomenon. Meanwhile, endogenous hormone contents including auxin, cytokinin, GA and ABA were detected at the same time. In total, we assembled and annotated 53,182 unigenes. 8453, 21,281 and 7646 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were identified from PPetSta vs Stamen, TPetSta vs Stamen, and TPetSta vs PPetSta comparisons, in which 2241 unigenes were shared DEGs. 20 transcription factors in MADS-box and MYB families, 43 unigenes in signaling and synthesis pathways of auxin, cytokinin, GA, ABA and ethylene were differentially expressed. Meanwhile, endogenous hormone contents including auxin, cytokinin, GA and ABA were declined in partially petaloidy flower and totally petaloidy flower when compared with the normal stamen. The expression of GA20ox3 and CYP735A2 encode the biosynthesis genes of GA and cytokinin, respectively were downregulated, which was consistent with the hormone determination results. The expression of SAUR50, SLR5, PYL9, ERF4/27 involved in the signaling pathways of IAA, GA, ABA, ethylene and transcription factors MYB44/108, AG2, AGL104, MGS1 had the same expression profiles corresponding with the endogenous hormone content, indicating that they may play a positive role during the process of stamen petalization. This work will help us to unravel several specific genes and provide a theoretical basis for double flower breeding of Lilium species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000401cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aGrant NO.202002080012F01463cShanghai Agriculture Applied Technology Delelopment Program 3aLilium 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3acytokinins 3aethylene 3aflowers 3agene expression regulation 3aornamental value 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3aunigenes1 aNie, Gongping1 aYang, Liuyan1 aZhang, Yongchun1 aCai, Youming0 tPlant growth regulation.g2021 Sept., v. 95, no. 1 p.49-64dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-021-00724-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001300276520090800289592002801197650001601225650002501241650002301266650004301289650002201332650002101354700002001375700002801395773009201423856008401515852000901599655001201608IND60112966820221116194148.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumgaertel, Anja10aRecent developments in the detailed characterization of polymers by multidimensional chromatography  ap. 1-20.  aSynthetic polymers as well as biopolymers reveal complex structures, such as variations in functionality, chain length and architecture.

One possible approach is the combination of high performance liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) and size-exclusion chromatography, also named as two-dimensional chromatography, which allows the separation of the polymers according to different properties, like molar mass, chemical composition or functionality. In addition, LCCC hyphenated with different mass spectrometry techniques, e.g. MALDI-TOF or ESI-TOF, leads to additional information about molecular details of the polymeric structure. We summarize in this article the recent developments in two-dimensional chromatography of synthetic polymers and biopolymers since 2005.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achemical composition 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight1 aAltuntaş, Esra1 aSchubert, U.q(Ulrich),0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 June 1, v. 1240 p.1-20dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007500170300001600245520132100261592002801582650002301610650001001633650001301643650000801656650001501664650002201679650001701701653001801718653002401736653001401760653001501774700001901789700001601808700002201824700002301846700001801869700002001887700001901907700001901926773010401945856008402049852000902133655001202142IND60122435020221122050134.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243502DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.8059092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChtourou, Hamdi14aThe effect of time of day on hormonal responses to resistance exercise  ap. 247-256.  aThe aim of this study was to examine the acute hormonal responses to resistance training performed in the morning or in the evening. Eighteen active men underwent two lower body resistance exercise (RE) sessions (3 × 10 repetitions, maximum of four exercises) on two occasions (07:00 and 17:00 h). Blood samples were collected in the morning and evening before (BT), after (AT), and 60 min after (60-AT) the RE training session for the determination of testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations. The Δ-changes of T and C concentrations were calculated as the difference between AT and BT, the difference between 60-AT and BT, as well as the difference between 60-AT and AT. The results showed that T increased from BT to AT and decreased from AT to 60-AT at the two times of testing. However, T was higher in the evening and lower in morning at 60-AT compared with BT. C increased from BT to AT and 60-AT in the evening, and decreased from AT to 60-AT at the two times of testing. Likewise, Δ-changes of T and C concentrations between AT and BT and between 60-AT and BT were higher in the evening than in the morning. In conclusion, training-induced hormonal responses are observed to be greater in the evening than in the morning, which potentially provides a more favorable profile for anabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3ablood 3acortisol 3amen 3ametabolism 3astrength training 3atestosterone 0achronobiology 0aresistance training 0aanabolism 0acatabolism1 aHammouda, Omar1 aAloui, Asma1 aChaabouni, Khansa1 aMakni-Ayedi, Fatma1 aWahl, Michael1 aChaouachi, Anis1 aChamari, Karim1 aSouissi, Nizar0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 45, no. 2 p.247-256dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.8059093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010000165300001800265520154600283592002801829650002501857650001701882650002501899650002601924650002601950650001801976650002401994650002402018650002402042650001402066650003002080650002402110700001902134700002502153700001902178773010602197856008402303852000902387655001202396IND60090002520221120172711.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMsika, Ora10aNGF blocks polyunsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis in n−3 fatty acid-supplemented PC12 cells  ap. 1022-1030.  aRegulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis in proliferating and NGF-differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells deficient in n−3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6n−3) was studied. A dose- and time-dependent increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n−3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n−3) and DHA in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) glycerophospholipids (GPL) via the elongation/desaturation pathway following alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n−3) supplements was observed. That was accompanied by a marked reduction of eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid 20:3n−9), an index of PUFA deficiency. EPA supplements were equally effective converted to 22:5n−3 and 22:6n−3. On the other hand, supplements of linoleic acid (LNA, 18:2n−6) were not effectively converted into higher n−6 PUFA intermediates nor did they impair elongation/desaturation of ALA. Co-supplements of DHA along with ALA did not interfere with 20:5n−3 biosynthesis but reduced further elongation to 22-hydrocarbon PUFA intermediates. A marked decrease in the newly synthesized 22:5n−3 and 22:6n−3 following ALA or EPA supplements was observed after nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation. NGF also inhibited the last step in 22:5n−6 formation from LNA. These results emphasize the importance of overcoming n−3 PUFA deficiency and raise the possibility that growth factor regulation of the last step in PUFA biosynthesis may constitute an important feature of neuronal phenotype acquisition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiosynthesis 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adocosapentaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3alinoleic acid 3anerve growth factor 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphatidylserines1 aBrand, Annette1 aCrawford, Michael A.1 aYavin, Ephraim0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 July, v. 1821, no. 7 p.1022-1030dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245019100166300001400357520232100371592002802692650002302720650001902743650001302762650001502775650002002790650001702810650001202827650002302839650001802862650003202880700002602912700002002938700002302958773009302981856008403074852000903158655001203167IND60112966920221116193946.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Tien D.10aSelective extraction of genotoxic impurities and structurally alerting compounds using polymeric ionic liquid sorbent coatings in solid-phase microextraction: Alkyl halides and aromatics  ap. 29-44.  aA series of polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) possessing varied chemical makeup and composition were applied as selective solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sorbent coatings for the analysis of genotoxic impurities (GTIs) and related structurally alerting compounds, namely, alkyl halides and aromatics. In addition to exploiting two previously synthesized PILs as selective coatings, two new PILs, namely, N,N-didecyl-N-methyl-d-glucaminium poly(2-methyl-acrylic acid 2-[1-(3-{2-[2-(3-trifluoromethanesulfonylamino-propoxy)-ethoxy]-ethoxy}-propylamino)-vinylamino]-ethyl ester) (poly([DDMGlu][MTFSI])), and poly(1-vinyl-3-propylphenylimidazolium) chloride (poly([VPPIM][Cl])), were designed, synthesized, and their selectivity examined in the extraction of the selected analytes. The glucaminium-based coating was developed to exploit the hydrogen bond-acidic hydroxyl groups within the carbohydrate moiety of the PIL in addition to dispersive capabilities resulting from the cation and anion. The poly([VPPIM][Cl]) coating was tailored to possess π–π interaction capabilities through the phenyl functionality while also containing the hydrogen bond-basic chloride anion. Calibration studies were performed via headspace extraction to determine the sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) for all analytes with respect to each PIL-based sorbent coating and compared to the polyacrylate (PA) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sorbent coatings. PILs containing the chloride anion exhibited high selectivity for aniline-based compounds. The glucaminium-based PIL exhibited good sensitivity for larger aliphatic alkyl halides. The poly(1-4-vinylbenzyl-3-hexadecylimidazolium) bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl] imide (poly([VBHDIM][NTf₂])) PIL coating demonstrated superior selectivity for larger aliphatic/aromatic analytes. The LODs of both commercial and PIL-based coatings for the two classes of GTIs ranged from low part-per-billion (ppb) to mid part-per-trillion (ppt) levels. Recovery studies were performed at two concentration levels within the linear range in order to validate the accuracy of the technique. Scanning electron micrographs were obtained for three PIL-based coatings following approximately 70 extraction/desorption steps, wherein the fiber coatings were observed to be largely smooth and intact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3achromatography 3acoatings 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agenotoxicity 3ahalides 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic liquids 3asolid phase microextraction1 aJoshi, Manishkumar D.1 aSilver, Mark A.1 aAnderson, Jared L.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 June 1, v. 1240 p.29-44dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013000163300001600293520182400309592002802133650002502161650002502186650001302211650002002224650001402244650001902258650001002277650002002287650001602307650002502323650001702348650001302365651001202378653002002390653001402410700001702424700002102441773011302462856008202575852000902657655001202666IND60549242920221120121750.0160907e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054924292DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-11-01622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalas, Firas10aWithin-Field Variation of Fusarium graminearum Isolates for Aggressiveness and Deoxynivalenol Production in Wheat Head Blight  ap. 128-134.  aFusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto (s.s.), causes tremendous annual yield losses in wheat worldwide. Variation of aggressiveness of isolates from individual field populations in terms of FHB infection and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration in the host are important population parameters reflecting parasitic ability. Our main objective was to estimate the variation of both traits within three populations of F. graminearum s.s., each consisting of 30 single-spore isolates collected from small wheat fields in Germany, and to compare it with 11 isolates of a collection (F. graminearum collection) from four countries. The same isolates were characterized using 19 single-sequence repeat markers. All isolates were spray inoculated on a moderately resistant spring wheat cultivar at two field locations over 2 years (i.e., in four environments). The genotypic proportion of phenotypic variance (σ²G) within populations was significant (P < 0.01) for both traits, and the σ²G × environment interaction was even more important for mean FHB severity. Ranges in mean FHB severity and DON concentration in the host were only slightly smaller for the field populations than for the F. graminearum collection. Both traits were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated within and across populations. A further partitioning of σ²G revealed 72% of σ²G within and 28% of σ²G across populations for both traits. Molecular variance of the three populations was similarly distributed (73.6% within versus 26.4% between populations). In view of this high within-field variation for traits of parasitic ability and selection, neutral molecular markers, multiple resistance genes of different origin should be employed in wheat breeding programs to obtain a long-term stable FHB resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abreeding 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adeoxynivalenol 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahead blight 3aphenotypic variation 3aspring wheat 3avariance 3aGermany 0aGibberella zeae 0amycotoxin1 aKalih, Rasha1 aMiedaner, Thomas0 tPhytopathology.g2012 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.128-134dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-06-11-01623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001600262520179400278592002802072650002702100650001602127650002402143650003002167650000902197650001402206650001102220650001402231650001202245650001002257650001402267650001002281650001402291653002302305653001202328653001802340653001302358653001702371700002302388700002102411700002602432700002202458773011402480856005102594852000902645655001202654IND50088376720221122035014.0140414e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008837672DNAL7 a10.1080/07438141.2012.7046222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepak, Jesse M.13aAn experimental approach to determine esocid prey preference in replicated pond systems  ap. 224-231.  aLepak JM, Fetherman ER, Pate WM, Craft CD, Gardunio EI. 2012. An experimental approach to determine esocid prey preference in replicated pond systems. Lake Reserv Manage. 28: 224–231.Competitive interactions between salmonids and white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) often result in poor salmonid growth, condition, and ultimately angler catch-per-unit-effort. Fisheries managers frequently introduce hybrid northern pike (Esox lucius) and muskellunge (E. masquinongy), known as tiger muskellunge, as biological control agents to reduce the abundance of undesirable species including white suckers, while simultaneously attempting to create viable recreational fisheries with stocked salmonids. In this study, northern pike were used to evaluate esocid prey preference between naïve, hatchery-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and wild white suckers. Enclosures containing northern pike were stocked with rainbow trout and white suckers at 2 densities (50:50 and 20:80, respectively) to represent different ratios of forage. Weekly sampling by beach seine was used to determine rainbow trout and white sucker mortality. When the experiment was complete, enclosures were drained to determine overall survival of the forage species. Rainbow trout numbers declined precipitously to zero, while 60–75% of white suckers remained across all treatments. This study demonstrated a clear difference in survival of rainbow trout and white suckers (rainbow trout having lower survival) in the presence of northern pike under these conditions. We suggest fisheries managers consider these findings when stocking or managing for piscivores to control undesirable fish species, or to create recreational fisheries, while simultaneously stocking naïve sport fish vulnerable to predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatostomus commersonii 3aEsox lucius 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abiological control agents 3afish 3afisheries 3aforage 3agame fish 3ahybrids 3alakes 3amortality 3aponds 3apredation 0abiological control 0aesocids 0arainbow trout 0astocking 0awhite sucker1 aFetherman, Eric R.1 aPate, William M.1 aCraft, Christopher D.1 aGardunio, Eric I.0 tLake and reservoir management.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 28, no. 3 p.224-231dTaylor & Francis Groupx2151-55307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.704622  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017100172300001800343520138300361592002801744650002101772650002401793650002301817650002401840650001601864650002501880650001701905650001201922650002901934650001201963650001901975650001301994650002302007650001602030650001702046650000702063650001102070650002402081650001402105650001502119650002402134650001102158650001802169650000902187700002302196700001902219700002602238700002902264773013602293856008102429852000902510655001202519IND60638271720221118232708.0190427e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063827172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-018-0675-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheapparat, Yongyuth10aPhysicochemical properties and in vitro antioxidant activities of pyroligneous acid prepared from brushwood biomass waste of Mangosteen, Durian, Rambutan, and Langsat  ap. 1139-1148.  aPhysicochemical characteristics and in vitro antioxidant activities of four pyroligneous acids carbonized from the wastes of wood species including Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana Linn.), Durian (Durio zibethinus L.), Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L.), and Langsat (Lansium domesticum Serr.) were assessed. Appearing as transparent liquors with pH 3.9–4.2, the pyroligneous acid samples under test possessed acetic acid (23.22–25.46%) as the dominant component. The total soluble tar, total acid, and water content were 0.15 − 0.28 wt%, 99–192 mg KOH/g and 84.5–93.5 wt%, respectively. Phenolic compounds namely: 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (6.88–9.69%), phenol (2.97–5.88%), 4-methylsyringol (3.10–3.56%), guaiacol (2.36–3.55%), and 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (1.08–1.28%) were found. All had in vitro antioxidant activities especially mangosteen pyroligneous acid, which showed activity roughly similar to BHT (P > 0.05) against anti-lipid peroxidation. Nitric oxide scavenging capacities of all pyroligneous acids were significantly higher than BHT (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that pyroligneous acids from the four types of branch waste could be used as sources of beneficial natural antioxidants, possibly as food or feed additives to protect against lipid peroxidation, and potentially also in veterinary medicine in anti-inflammatory products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDurio zibethinus 3aGarcinia mangostana 3aLansium domesticum 3aNephelium lappaceum 3aacetic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3adurians 3afeed additives 3aguaiacol 3alipid peroxidation 3amangosteens 3anitric oxide 3apH 3aphenol 3apotassium hydroxide 3arambutans 3ashrublands 3aveterinary medicine 3awastes 3awater content 3awood1 aKhongthong, Sunisa1 aRodjan, Prawit1 aLertwittayanon, Kowit1 aFaroongsarng, Damrongsak0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.1139-1148dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0675-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012400171520104800295592002801343650001501371650001301386650001601399650001301415650001801428650002101446650001801467650000701485650002101492650002101513650003701534650001401571650001901585653002201604653001501626653001001641653001301651653002501664700002001689700002601709700002201735700002101757773010601778856008701884852000901971655001201980IND60698606920221120121430.0200824e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069860692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1251672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSallem, Fadoua10aSurface modification of titania nanoparticles by catechol derivative molecules: Preparation of concentrated suspensions  aThis work focused on the preparation of high solid content suspension from nanosized TiO₂ P25 (about 30 nm). Two derivative catechol molecules (Tiron and Dopamine), were used as dispersants to enhance the colloidal stability of the prepared suspensions. Dopamine is a positively charged molecule which was used for the first time as dispersing agent and compared to Tiron, a negatively charged molecule. The effect of the pH and the dispersant percentage on the hydrodynamic size as well as on the surface chemistry of titania was studied in diluted suspension, using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements (acoustophoresis). Tiron and Dopamine adsorptions on titania surface were investigated using UV–vis spectrometry and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). It was illustrated, from the rheological behavior, that Tiron and Dopamine decrease dramatically the viscosity of highly concentrated titania suspensions and allow to reach up to 15 vol% and 20 vol% for dopamine and tiron-modified titania suspensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatechol 3adispersants 3adopamine 3ahydrodynamics 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3apH 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aviscosity 3azeta potential 0aNanosized titania 0aSuspension 0aTiron 0aDopamine 0aSurface modification1 aVillatte, Lucas1 aGeffroy, Pierre-Marie1 aGoglio, Graziella1 aPagnoux, Cécile0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 602 p.125167-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1251673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245014800181300001600329500000900345520147300354592002801827650001801855650001101873650001901884650001701903650001301920650001901933650002001952650002101972650001501993650002202008650001802030700001902048700002202067773012302089856009602212852000902308655001202317IND60663396520221119161230.0191122e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339652DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1972.00021962006400050025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, O.

Field studies were conducted near Morgantown, W.Va, during the 1966 to 1969 growing seasons to determine the effect of slope orientation on the yield of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) treated with O, 112, 224, 448, and 672 kg/ha rates of N applied singly and in up to four split applications. Slopes were approximately 35%. Soil on both slopes was Gilpin silt loam. The rate of growth, total yield, seasonal distribution of yield, and N recovery in plants were influenced greatly by slope orientation. Production on the north facing slope was more than twice that on the south-facing slope. Splitting the N applications tended to produce a higher yield and more uniform seasonal distribution. More than 11,000 kg/ha of bluegrass forage were produced on the north-facing slope in 1967 as compared to 4,000 kg/ha on the south-facing slope. A combination of high soil temperatures and low soil moisture levels appeared to limit growth on the south-facing slope. Maximum soil temperature on the north-facing slopes were from 8 to 10 C less than on the south-facing slope. Temperatures were measured 2.5 cm (1 in) below the soil surface under the bluegrass sod. Yield differences due to slope orientation completely overshadowed any yield responses from specific fertility treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3aforage 3agrowing season 3amicroclimate 3anitrogen 3aplant response 3asilt loam soils 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asplit application 3awater content1 aMathias, E.

In natural and industrial environments, the nucleation process might occur in the solution’s bulk or at the solid-liquid and liquid-gas interfaces, which evolve into distinct morphologies. A complete molecular level understanding and material characterization of preferred nucleation sites and morphologies is required to inhibit or promote crystallization, as required.Computational simulations are utilized in this work in combination with analytical theory to calculate the supersaturation and interfacial tension as the driving force and suppressor, respectively, in the hydrate crystal formation process. We employ accurate molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to obtain critical thermodynamic and mechanical properties, and subsequently, analyze the formation using the classical nucleation theory (CNT).We report the interfacial tension at all possible interfaces in water-methane gas solutions. We apply both our direct numerical simulation method and Antonow’s rule to find the tension at the methane hydrate and gas interface, and importantly conclude that Antonow’s rule overestimates the values. We calculate the work of formation and nucleation rate of the methane hydrate with and without additives. The nucleation probabilistically forms in the ranked order of film-shaped, cap-shaped, lens-shaped, and homogeneous. We postulate that the premelting of hydrate crystals at the hydrate-gas interface creates an intermediate quasi-liquid layer, which works in favor of the lens-shaped formation compared to homogeneous cases. However, the subtle difference in surface energy indicates high concentration of water and gas molecules at the interface is the main reason behind lens-shaped clustering. We lastly show that ice properties cannot be used to approximate the hydrate formation work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aenergy 3aice 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 0aMethane hydrate 0aSurface physics 0aInterfacial tension 0aClassical nucleation theory 0aComputational thermodynamics 0aMolecular dynamics simulation1 aServio, Phillip1 aRey, Alejandro D.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 557 p.556-567dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010000173300001600273520129600289592002801585650001601613650002301629650000901652650002301661650001001684650001201694650001401706650001301720650001701733651002101750653003001771653001501801653001601816653000801832653001101840653001101851700002301862700002101885700002001906700002701926773010401953856008402057852000902141655001202150IND60122435320221122125250.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012243532DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2013.8059152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRandler, Christoph10aAge and gender differences in morningness–eveningness in Turkish adolescents and young adults  ap. 277-284.  aThe aim of this study was to analyze gender and age differences in chronotype preference in a Turkish sample using the Composite Scale of Morningness. Four thousand four hundred and twenty three participants were randomly sampled from students in Turkey. Ages ranged from 11 to 23 and the average age was 16.39 years. There was a significant influence of age and gender. After controlling for age, girls were more morning oriented with one exception: At the age of 16 years, girls had a higher evening orientation than boys, while at the age of 13, 17, and 19 boys showed higher eveningness. Turkish girls become morning oriented from the early age of 15 years onwards, while boys reported their peak of eveningness at the age of 19. This is fascinating, since it is the earliest age reported for a turn to morningness in girls compared to previous studies. Interestingly, girls perform a second turn towards eveningness between the ages of 17 and 19. Cultural background may imprint the early shift back to morningness in girls, since Turkish parenting styles are different for boys and girls with a more authoritarian parenting style for girls, e.g. girls help their mothers. Later on, enrolment in university might foster more independence and promote the drift back to eveningness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abiological rhythms 3aboys 3agender differences 3agirls 3amothers 3aparenting 3astudents 3ayoung adults 3aTurkey (country) 0amorningness–eveningness 0achronotype 0aadolescents 0aage 0agender 0aTurkey1 aVollmer, Christian1 aBeşoluk, Şenol1 aÖnder, İsmail1 aHorzum, Mehmet Barış0 tBiological rhythm research.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 45, no. 2 p.277-284dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2013.8059153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007900170300001600249520100300265592002801268650002701296650001301323650001501336650001301351650002401364650001301388650002101401650002101422650003101443650000901474650001501483650002701498650001301525653001201538653002101550653000901571653000901580653001501589653001101604653001501615700001901630700001701649700002001666700002201686773012801708856008501836852000901921655001201930IND60515414720221119104328.0160315e20160221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541472DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2015.11227962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, C.

Fertilizer P was added with or without chelate to the center of pots, simulating a starter band of P. Without the presence of chelates, biomass above and below ground increased linearly as P fertilizer rates increased at 0, 9.6, 19.3, 28.9, and 38.5 kg P ha ⁻¹. Applications of EDTA and HEEDTA did not significantly increase water-soluble P (WSP), Mehlich 1 P, and Mehlich 3 P compared to soils without chelates. Applications of EDTA increased P uptake in the belowground biomass.

In this paper, stable isotope ratios of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), complementarily with analyses of stomach contents, were used to investigate the trophic ecology of an Atlantic kelp forest fish assemblage targeted by spear fishers in Galicia (NW Spain). Trophic habits of the fishes were consistent across the species ranges and six trophic niches were identified. Chelon labrosus was the only pelagic omnivore, while Conger conger and Dicentrarchus labrax were the principal predators, preying on benthic osteichthyes. The intermediate carnivorous Diplodus sargus mainly preyed on benthic molluscs, while Labrus bergylta exploited a wider range of prey. Although associated with different trophic niches, the two morphotypes of L. bergylta showed some degree of diet overlap, providing little support to the hypothesis of their separate management. Moreover, L. bergylta can be a keystone species whose adequate management has relevant implications for the sustainable use of the European kelp forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTemperate rocky reefs 0afish assemblages 0akelp forests 0arecreational fisheries 0astomach contents 0astable isotope ratios1 aFreire, Juan0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2019 Feb., v. 99, no. 1 p.19-29dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170018623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012600172300001600298520112300314592002801437650001901465650002601484650001401510650003001524650001701554650001101571650001201582650002301594650000901617700002201626700001501648700001601663700001601679700001901695700001801714700002001732700001701752700002101769700002101790700003001811700002001841700001601861773010401877856008401981852000902065655001202074IND60090003120221123003531.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinohara, Nahoko10aJacaric acid, a linolenic acid isomer with a conjugated triene system, has a strong antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo  ap. 980-988.  aIn this study, we compared the cytotoxic effects of natural conjugated linolenic acids (CLnAs) on human adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) in vitro, with the goal of finding CLnA isomers with strong cytotoxic effects.

The results showed that all CLnA isomers have strong cytotoxic effects on DLD-1 cells, with jacaric acid (JA) having the strongest effect. Examination of the mechanism of cell death showed that CLnAs induce apoptosis in DLD-1 cells via lipid peroxidation. The intracellular levels of incorporated CLnAs were measured to examine the reason for differences in cytotoxic effects. These results showed that JA was taken into cells efficiently. Collectively, these results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of CLnAs is dependent on intracellular incorporation and induction of apoptosis via lipid peroxidation. JA also had a strong preventive antitumor effect in vivo in nude mice into which DLD-1 cells were transplanted. These results suggest that JA can be used as a dietary constituent for prevention of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aisomers 3alipid peroxidation 3amice1 aTsuduki, Tsuyoshi1 aIto, Junya1 aHonma, Taro1 aKijima, Ryo1 aSugawara, Soko1 aArai, Tatsuya1 aYamasaki, Masao1 aIkezaki, Aya1 aYokoyama, Marino1 aNishiyama, Kazuo1 aNakagawa, K.q(Kiyotaka),1 aMiyazawa, Teruo1 aIkeda, Ikuo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 July, v. 1821, no. 7 p.980-988dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245005600163300001600219520104500235592002801280650002001308650001101328650002001339650002401359700002101383773009701404856007101501852000901572655001201581IND60518558520221122113338.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855852DNAL7 a10.2307/19343132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockelman, Warren Y.10aOn Modeling Density‐Independent Population Change  ap. 944-948.  aSeveral recent papers have shown that when statistical and graphical tests for regulation are applied to artificially generated "density—independent" populations containing random variables, enigmatic evidence for regulation (density dependence) is obtained. In one instance, density independence is confused with randomness of population size. In the other instances, Morris's method of regressing log Nₜ ₊ ₁ on log Nₜ yields evidence of regulation in density—independent populations. It is shown here that regression analysis is inappropriate in Morris's test, and that the principal error axis rather than the regression line yields the slope tending toward unity in the absence of regulation. However, the sensitivity of the slope of the principal axis to density dependence depends on the amount of initial displacement from equilibrium and on the number of serial samples. Hence, this statistic is of little usefulness. The effect of serial correlation on tests for the presence of density dependence is discussed briefly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aregression analysis1 aFagen, Robert M.0 tEcology.g1972 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.944-948dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19343133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009200169300001600261500002000277500000900297520186800306592002802174650001602202650002102218650001302239650001402252650001802266650000902284650001602293650001502309650002202324650001802346650001302364650001202377651001302389700001802402700002302420700002402443700002302467700002302490773013202513856008302645852000902728655001202737IND60663396820221119161400.0220803e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339682DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2016.06.03652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, Lance S.10aTopsoil Thickness Effects on Corn, Soybean, and Switchgrass Production on Claypan Soils  ap. 782-794.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Grain relative yield increased with depth to claypan, while switchgrass relative yield was unaffected. Grain yield was twice as temporally variable as switchgrass yield. Grain crops generally were more profitable than switchgrass across depth to claypan. Switchgrass has the capacity to reduce yield variability caused by depth to claypan. Diminished topsoil thickness, or depth to claypan (DTC), is a major cause of yield and profit depression in corn (Zea mays L.) and to a lesser extent in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production on claypan soils in the U.S. Midwest. Perennial grasses, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), may be more resilient to reduced DTC than grain crops. Therefore, a study was conducted on a Missouri claypan soil to compare production and profitability of switchgrass grown for bioenergy to corn and soybean grain over varying DTC. Corn, soybean, and switchgrass yield were measured from 2009 to 2015 on plots constructed with DTC representative of those found on claypan landscapes. Yield, annual by‐crop relative yield (RY), yield coefficient of variation (CV), and return to land and management (net return) were evaluated by year, within wet and dry year categories, and across all years. Results indicate that corn and soybean RY across years increased to a maximum of 82 and 79% at DTC of 32 and 21 cm, respectively. Switchgrass RY was unresponsive and averaged 72% across DTC. Corn, soybean, and switchgrass yield CV averaged 46, 35, and 17%, respectively. Corn and switchgrass net return increased with DTC to a maximum of US$386 and $134 ha⁻¹ at DTC of 31 and 32 cm, respectively, while soybean net return averaged $634 ha⁻¹ across DTC. In general, switchgrass yield was less variable than grain production across DTC, and switchgrass could compete economically with corn on shallow DTC (<3 cm).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aPanicum virgatum 3aZea mays 3abioenergy 3aclaypan soils 3acorn 3agrain crops 3alandscapes 3aperennial grasses 3aprofitability 3asoybeans 3atopsoil 3aMissouri1 aYost, Matt A.1 aKitchen, Newell R.1 aSudduth, Kenneth A.1 aThompson, Allen L.1 aMassey, Raymond E.0 tAgronomy journal.g2017 May, v. 109, no. 3 p.782-794dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.06.03653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011800170300001600288520188100304592002802185650001002213650001302223650001402236650002602250650001302276650002202289650001502311650001102326650002302337650002202360650001002382650001402392650001602406651001002422653000802432653001302440653001402453653001202467653001302479653001602492700002302508700001902531700002202550773012402572856008302696852000902779655001202788IND60525470220221120214056.0190318e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052547022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssandri, Giacomo10aDiversity in the monotony? Habitat traits and management practices shape avian communities in intensive vineyards  ap. 250-260.  aSpreading of viticulture may pose serious threats to biodiversity and adequate policies targeted at decreasing its impact are urgently required. Current knowledge of viticulture effects on biodiversity is scarce and studies on bird communities in vineyards are even scarcer.We surveyed avian assemblages in Trentino vineyards (North-East Italy) in both breeding and wintering seasons to evaluate the effect of: i) landscape, ii) management and iii) topographic-climatic characteristics on birds and to derive implications for conservation. We calculated four community indexes (species richness, abundance, evenness and conservation index) and modelled their relative variation according to 18 environmental variables belonging to the three above-mentioned groups.Landscape models performed better than the others, except for winter evenness, for which management models were the most supported ones. Generally, models considering the three groups together explained more variation than models from an individual group.Landscape (and agricultural) heterogeneity, extent of marginal habitats, density of traditional elements (hedgerows, tree rows, isolated trees and rural buildings) all had positive effects, whereas vineyard cover had negative impact on the value of the four community indexes.Organic management had no apparent effect on avian communities. We detected a seasonal difference in the effects of environmental characteristics on bird communities, which suggested that local conservation efforts could be tuned according to the seasonal importance of vineyards in different regions.Key measures to promote biodiversity in vineyards include maintaining patches of residual habitats in the vineyard matrix and enhancing heterogeneity. Marginal features appeared particularly important in the homogeneous landscape of intensive vineyards to favour bird communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3abuildings 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aItaly 0aCAP 0aGreening 0aLandscape 0aOrganic 0aTrentino 0aViticulture1 aBogliani, Giuseppe1 aPedrini, Paolo1 aBrambilla, Mattia0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 01, v. 223 p.250-260dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011100169300001600280520122500296592002801521650002701549650002601576650001601602650003601618650002501654650002901679650002001708650001501728650001801743650001901761650001901780650001201799650001701811651001001828653003601838653002901874653001901903653002901922653002701951700002201978773011302000856008602113852000902199655001202208IND60531652120221123031510.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Weiyan10aKey activity areas of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the construction industry: a study of China  ap. 850-860.  aChina's ambitious urbanization continues to provide a strong impetus for the construction industry to proliferate in the foreseeable future. While construction firms are supposed to contribute extra efforts to improve social welfare, they are also attempting to minimize their negative impacts on the environment. This has compounded the difficulty of fulfilling corporate social responsibility (CSR), and it is vitally important that CSR activities can be formulated accordingly. In this study, generic CSR activities were identified first through extensive literature review. Content analysis on CSR reports of construction firms and interviews with professionals were then conducted to make the generic CSR activities suit the Chinese construction industry. A questionnaire survey was finally adopted to collect professionals' opinions on the importance of CSR activities. It is found that the key factors or activity areas of CSR are environmental protection, construction quality and safety, community, employees, clients, and CSR management. The research findings suggest that contractors' CSR fulfillment should be embedded in the construction process as well as the uniqueness of construction practices in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconstruction industry 3acontractors 3acorporate social responsibility 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3asocial welfare 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aSustainable construction 0aActivity areas 0aEnvironmental protection 0aStakeholder management1 aWong, Johnny K.W.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 113 p.850-860dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012100161520164500282592002801927650001801955650001801973650002901991650002002020650001502040650003302055650001602088650002702104650002802131650001002159700002002169700002002189700001602209773012902225856007502354852000902429655001202438IND60791089620221119071625.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079108962DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141639722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shaoxiong 10aReshaping Hyperspectral Data into a Two-Dimensional Image for a CNN Model to Classify Plant Species from Reflectance  aLeaf-level hyperspectral-based species identification has a long research history. However, unlike hyperspectral image-based species classification models, convolutional neural network (CNN) models are rarely used for the one-dimensional (1D) structured leaf-level spectrum. Our research focuses on hyperspectral data from five laboratories worldwide to test the general use of effective identification of the CNN model by reshaping 1D structure hyperspectral data into two-dimensional greyscale images without principal component analysis (PCA) or downscaling. We compared the performance of two-dimensional CNNs with the deep cross neural network (DCN), support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree in individual tree species classification from leaf-level hyperspectral data. We tested the general performance of the models by simulating an application phase using data from different labs or years as the unseen data for prediction. The best-performing CNN model had validation accuracy of 98.6%, prediction accuracy of 91.6%, and precision of 74.9%, compared to the support vector machine, with 98.6%, 88.8%, and 66.4%, respectively, and DCN, with 94.0%, 85.7%, and 57.1%, respectively. Compared with the reference models, CNNs more efficiently recognized Fagus crenata, and had high accuracy in Quercus rubra identification. Our results provide a template for a species classification method based on hyperspectral data and point to a new way of reshaping 1D data into a two-dimensional image, as the key to better species prediction. This method may also be helpful for foliar trait estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus crenata 3aQuercus rubra 3adecision support systems 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3aspecies identification 3asupport vector machines 3atrees1 aSong, Guangman 1 aNg, Kwan Cheng,1 aWang, Quan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010900166520137300275592002801648650001601676650001701692650000901709650002401718650001001742653001901752653002001771653002501791653002301816653002401839700001701863700001501880700001701895700005701912700001501969700001601984773011302000856008602113852000902199655001202208IND60740530320221120123732.0210715e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Wen12aA new dust removal technology used in hot rolling mills: Atomized spray with higher dedusting efficiency  aIn order to effectively remove the oxide scale dusts in the hot rolling strip steel, this study focuses on the principle of atomized spray and use it to develop a new dust removal technology used in the hot rolling mills. Through establishing a mathematic model of particle collision, 4 critical factors most affecting the dedusting efficiency are analysed: the diameter of nozzles, the diameter of water droplets, the diameter of dust particles, and the spray pressure. For further discovering the principles of the movements and concentration changes of the dust particles, a numerical model is established based on the gap space between the hot rolling mills. 2 scenarios of running the atomized dedusting or not are simulated to compute the dedusting efficiency so that the dedusting effect of the atomized spray can be confirmed for the hot rolling. The case study on the 1580 mm hot rolling line in WISCO plant demonstrates a successful dedusting efficiency of 93.50% on the R2 rough rolling mill. The spray pressure of 0.5 MPa and the nozzle diameter of 1.4 mm are appropriate to generating the proper water droplets with the diameter of 71.1 μm in order to capture the dust particles with the mean diameter of 27 μm. The study on the principles and simulations of the atomized spray facilitates more efficient dust removal for cleaner hot rolling mills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3acase studies 3adust 3amathematical models 3asteel 0aAtomized spray 0aCollision model 0aDedusting efficiency 0aDust concentration 0aCleaner hot rolling1 aFu, Liandong1 aZhao, Gang1 aChen, Yancai1 aZhao, Xuesong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0393-35621 aHu, Maolin1 aYao, Hongwu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127574-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001600163245007300179300001400252500000900266520106200275592002801337650002101365650001101386650001901397650001301416650001901429700001801448700001901466700001501485773011801500856009801618852000901716655001201725IND60665254720221122073227.0191122e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525472DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1969.0011183X000900010008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, D. D.10aMeasuring Photosynthesis of Attached Leaves with Air Sealed Chambers  ap. 24-27.  aepub  aNet carbon exchange (NCE) of leaves is generally measured by sealing a chamber around an intact leaf. Most chambers use a flexible gasket around the leaf or petiole to insure an air-tight seal. This paper describes a chamber based on the principle that air provides a simple, effective seal. The chamber consists of three compartments: air-seal, leaf, and reference. The leaf is inserted through an opening in the air-seal compartment and into the leaf compartment. Air is pumped through an air supply tube into the air-seal compartments. It is then drawn through the leaf compartment and simultaneously through a reference compartment. NCE is determined from the difference in CO₂ concentration in these two compartments. Enough excess air must be supplied to exhaust through the leaf port and provide an air seal about the leaf. This design allows repeated leaf insertion without injury even when measurements are taken for prolonged periods of time.

Multispectral sensors with different wavelengths can provide complementary information. In this work, we propose a multispectral line segment matching algorithm based on phase congruency and multiple local homographies (PC-MLH) for image pairs captured by the cross-spectrum sensors (visible spectrum and infrared spectrum) in man-made scenarios. The feature points are first extracted and matched according to phase congruency. Next, multi-layer local homographies are derived from clustered feature points via random sample consensus (RANSAC) to guide line segment matching. Moreover, three geometric constraints (line position encoding, overlap ratio, and point-to-line distance) are introduced in cascade to reduce the computational complexity. The two main contributions of our work are as follows: First, compared with the conventional line matching methods designed for single-spectrum images, PC-MLH is robust against nonlinear radiation distortion (NRD) and can handle the unknown multiple local mapping, two common challenges associated with multispectral feature matching. Second, fusion of line extraction results and line position encoding for neighbouring matching increase the number of matched line segments and speed up the matching process, respectively. The method is validated using two public datasets, CVC-multimodal and VIS-IR. The results show that the percentage of correct matches (PCM) using PC-MLH can reach 94%, which significantly outperforms other single-spectral and multispectral line segment matching methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3ageometry 3aguidelines1 aLi, Boyang 1 aYang, Wenyu 1 aWen, Chih-Yung 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141638573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013200161520138700293592002801680650002201708650002001730650002501750650001801775650002101793650002601814650002701840650001801867650002001885650000901905650003101914650002001945650001901965650001501984650000901999650001902008650001902027700005502046700001902101700001602120700001702136773010702153856007602260852000902336655001202345IND60637245120221119232735.0190416e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063724512DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/35805622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbumere, V.

The study investigated the influence of varying rates of chicken manure and NPK fertilizers as it affected growth, nutrient uptake, seed yield, and oil yield of sunflower on nutrient-limiting soil. Field experiments were carried out during 2014 and 2015 planting seasons for both main and residual studies. There were eight treatments comprising four rates of chicken manure (5, 10, 15, and 20 t·ha⁻¹), three rates of NPK (30, 60, and 90 kg·N·ha⁻¹), and control. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Growth, yield, dry matter and proximate, nutrient uptake concentration, and oil content were determined following standard procedures. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, and means were compared with the Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) at p≤0.05. Performance of sunflower was superior on the field fertilized with 10 t·ha⁻¹ chicken manure which was comparable to 90 kg·N·ha⁻¹ NPK fertilizer. Sunflower seed yield and oil quality were superior in plots supplied with 10 t·ha⁻¹ chicken manure which was comparable to 60 kg·N·ha⁻¹ NPK. Growth, yield, dry matter, and proximate content were least in the unfertilized plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aNPK fertilizers 3aanalysis of variance 3adata analysis 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agrowth and development 3alipid content 3anutrient uptake 3aoils 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplanting season 3apoultry manure 3aseed yield 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asunflower seed1 aDada, O.

Ag-NPs were biologically synthesised using Pearl Millet (Pennisetum glaucum) husk. The Ag-NPs were investigated for their antimicrobial property against algae, and further Ag-NPs doped charcoal was explored for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide selectively to benzaldehyde. The antimicrobial property of the Ag-NPs was tested by incubating freshwater algae in an Ag-NP solution, and the chlorophyll concentration measured periodically. The UV–Vis Spectroscopy analysis of Ag-NPs revealed a Surface Plasmon Resonance peak at 429 nm. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy showed spherical shaped and poly-dispersed nanoparticles with an average size of 17 nm. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy affirmed the role of Pearl Millet extract as a reducing and capping agent of silver ions. Incubation of algae with Ag-NPs resulted in a 41.31% reduction in chlorophyll concentration. HPLC confirmed the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, with 90% conversion. The study concluded that biologically synthesised Ag-NPs are toxic to algae and can be used for algae control in wastewater treatment, and as Ag NPs doped on the charcoal catalyst for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde. With cleaner production concept, this protocol addresses treating the algae contaminated water with Ag-NPs. An eco-friendly, economical process is developed for Namibia/Africa, which is stressed by water shortage. Further, the efficacy of Ag-NP doped charcoal as a catalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus americanus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantimicrobial properties 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzyl alcohol 3acatalysts 3acharcoal 3achlorophyll 3afreshwater 3ahulls 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater treatment 3awater shortages 3aNamibia 0aPennisetum glaucum 0aPearl millet extract (PME) 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aNPs (nanoparticle)1 aRahman, Ateeq1 aUahengo, Veikko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-72861 aNaimhwaka, Johannes1 aDaniel, Likius1 aBhaskurani, Sandeep V.H.S.1 aJonnalagadda, S.B.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127581-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162300001800268520190200286592002802188650003102216650001002247650002002257650001202277650001202289650001102301650001602312650002202328650001302350650001902363650002102382650000902403650002202412650001602434651001102450651002002461700002302481700001502504700002802519773009602547856008102643852000902724655001202733IND60091555620221119024911.0150111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2094-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuwei10aAtmospheric teleconnection mechanisms of extratropical North Atlantic SST influence on Sahel rainfall  ap. 2797-2811.  aExtratropical North Atlantic cooling has been tied to droughts over the Sahel in both paleoclimate observations and modeling studies. This study, which uses an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a slab ocean model that simulates this connection, explores the hypothesis that the extratropical North Atlantic cooling causes the Sahel droughts via an atmospheric teleconnection mediated by tropospheric cooling. The drying is also produced in a regional climate model simulation of the Sahel when reductions in air temperature (and associated geopotential height and humidity changes) from the GCM simulation are imposed as the lateral boundary conditions. This latter simulation explicitly demonstrates the central role of tropospheric cooling in mediating the atmospheric teleconnection from extratropical North Atlantic cooling. Diagnostic analyses are applied to the GCM simulation to infer teleconnection mechanisms. An analysis of top of atmosphere radiative flux changes diagnosed with a radiative kernel technique shows that extratropical North Atlantic cooling is augmented by a positive low cloud feedback and advected downstream, cooling Europe and North Africa. The cooling over North Africa is further amplified by a reduced greenhouse effect from decreased atmospheric specific humidity. A moisture budget analysis shows that the direct moisture effect and monsoon weakening, both tied to the ambient cooling and resulting circulation changes, and feedbacks by vertical circulation and evaporation augment the rainfall reduction. Cooling over the Tropical North Atlantic in response to the prescribed extratropical cooling also augments the Sahel drying. Taken together, they suggest a thermodynamic pathway for the teleconnection. The teleconnection may also be applicable to understanding the North Atlantic influence on Sahel rainfall over the twentieth century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aSahel 3aair temperature 3acooling 3adrought 3adrying 3aevaporation 3agreenhouse effect 3ahumidity 3amonsoon season 3apaleoclimatology 3arain 3asimulation models 3atroposphere 3aEurope 3aNorthern Africa1 aChiang, John C.

Observations from a single operational coastal Doppler are quality-controlled and assimilated. Compared with the baseline experiment initialized by GFS analysis, the reflectivity data assimilation experiment (Z-DA) resulted in an obvious improvement in both structural analysis and typhoon forecast skills in terms of intensity, precipitation, and track. Sensitivity experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of EnKF to update certain state variables considering that the degree of freedom of analytical variables increased with a DM MP scheme. When either the total number concentration or other large-scale state variables that are not directly linked to reflectivity observations via the observation operator are not updated, the tendency of RMSIs and PS to be imbalanced is significantly increased during DA cycles compared to those of Z-DA with updating a full set of state variables, resulting in increased intensity and track forecast errors. These results indicate that the reliable ensemble covariance could handle the underconstraint issue associated with the DM scheme, and helps in obtaining more physically balanced analytical fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3aradar 3atyphoons 3aweather research and forecasting model1 aLi, Hong 1 aSiuvai, Ming,1 aZhu, Yijie 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014000167500001900307520145200326592002801778650000801806650001501814650001101829650000901840650001601849650002701865653002001892653002401912653002001936653002001956653002201976700001501998700001402013700001702027700001502044773008902059856008502148852000902233655001202242IND60727625520221119155856.0210415e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072762552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Haiqiao10aEffects of high ignition energy on lean combustion characteristics of natural gas using an optical engine with a high compression ratio  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNatural gas engines often suffer from slow-burning rate and large cyclic variations, which significantly affects engine performance and thermal efficiency. In this study, using an optical spark-ignition engine with a high compression ratio, the role of high ignition energy in lean combustion characteristics of natural gas was investigated. Synchronization measurement of in-cylinder pressure and visualization images were performed to analyze the correlations of engine performance and combustion characteristics. The results show that elevating ignition energy can improve combustion instability and thermal efficiency, manifesting more concentrated heat release and greater influences on the combustion duration from 10% to 50% in burned mass fraction than that of 50%–90% range. The combustion visualizations show that ignition energy mainly affects initial flame kernel formation and early flame development, and improved flame speed and combustion instability can be observed even when excess air coefficient reaches 1.4 at sufficiently high ignition energy. Furthermore, an empirical criterion based on burned mass fraction and combustion visualizations was adopted to quantify early flame development. The shortage of ignition delay time and the acceleration of initial flame propagation are observed with the increases of ignition energy, which leads to lower cyclic variations and a faster burning rate at the early combustion stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aheat 3anatural gas 3aspark ignition engines 0aIgnition energy 0aNatural gas engines 0aLean combustion 0aOptical engines 0aCyclic variations1 aZhang, Ren1 aChen, Lin1 aPan, Jiaying1 aWang, Xuan0 tEnergy.g2021 May 15, v. 223 p.120053-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007900168300001800247520110800265592002801373650001201401650001901413650000801432650001501440650002401455651002101479651001801500700003101518700002301549700001801572700001901590773009601609856008101705852000901786655001201795IND60091555720221119024820.0150111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2095-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuemas, Virginie10aEnsemble of sea ice initial conditions for interannual climate predictions  ap. 2813-2829.  aPolar climate studies are severely hampered by the sparseness of the sea ice observations. We aim at filling this critical gap by producing two 5-member sea ice historical simulations strongly constrained by ocean and atmosphere observational data and covering the 1958–2006 and 1979–2012 periods. This is the first multi-member sea ice reconstruction covering more than 50 years. The obtained sea ice conditions are in reasonable agreement with the few available observations. These best estimates of sea ice conditions serve subsequently as initial sea ice conditions for a set of 28 3-year-long retrospective climate predictions. We compare it to a set in which the sea ice initial conditions are taken from a single-member sea ice historical simulation constrained by atmosphere observations only. We find an improved skill in predicting the Arctic sea ice area and Arctic near surface temperature but a slightly degraded skill in predicting the Antarctic sea ice area. We also obtain a larger spread between the members for the sea ice variables, thus more representative of the forecast error.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aice 3aprediction 3asurface temperature 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region1 aDoblas-Reyes, Francisco J.1 aMogensen, Kristian1 aKeeley, Sarah1 aTang, Yongming0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Nov., v. 43, no. 9-10 p.2813-2829dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2095-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245015000158300001600308520194600324592002802270653002102298653001402319653001102333653004302344700001702387700001702404700001802421700001502439700001802454700001802472700001902490773012502509856007602634852000902710655001202719IND60681624620221119191126.0200226e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068162462DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2017.00732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasaro, M.C.10aProphylactic Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATTCC 15703 supplementation reduces partially allergic airway disease in Balb/c but not in C57BL/6 mice  ap. 465-476.  aAllergic asthma is a chronic disease mainly characterised by eosinophil inflammation and airway remodelling. Many studies have shown that the gut microbiota of allergic individuals differs from that of non-allergic individuals. Although high levels of bifidobacteria have been associated with healthy persons, Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703, a gut bacteria, has been associated with allergic individuals in some clinical studies. The relationship between B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 and asthma or allergies has not been well elucidated, and its effect may be dependent on the host’s genetic profile or disease state. To elucidate this question, we evaluated the role of preventive B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 treatment on experimental allergic airway inflammation in two genetically different mouse strains, Balb/c and C57BL/6 (B6). Balb/c mice display a greater predisposition to develop allergic responses than B6 mice. Oral preventive treatment with B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 modulated experimental allergic airway inflammation, specifically in Balb/c mice, which showed decreased levels of eosinophils in the airway. B6 mice did not exhibit any significant alterations in eosinophils but showed an increased influx of total leukocytes and neutrophils into the airway. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of these bacteria in experimental allergic mice may involve products of bacteria metabolism, as dead bacteria did not mimic the ability of live B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 to attenuate the influx of eosinophils into the airway. To conclude, preventive oral B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 treatment can attenuate the major characteristic of allergic asthma, eosinophil airway influx, in Balb/c but not B6 mice. These results suggest that oral treatment with this specific live bacterial strain may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic airway disease, although its effect is mouse-strain-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 0aeosinophil cells 0aprobiotic 0aasthma 0abifidobacteria and airway inflammation1 aCrisma, A.R.1 aVieira, A.T.1 aSilva, G.H.M.1 aMendes, E.1 aRibeiro, W.R.1 aMartins, F.S.1 aFerreira, C.M.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2018 Apr. 25, v. 9, no. 3 p.465-476dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2017.00733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008000163500001900243520143100262592002801693650002201721650001101743650001101754653001601765653003301781653003201814700001801846700001301864700001301877700001601890700001601906700005201922773008901974856008502063852000902148655001202157IND60727625620221119155721.0210415e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072762562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Wei10aEconomic dispatch of interconnected networks considering hidden flexibility  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a—Owing to privacy concerns, data sharing between interconnected power networks is not always possible. Data sharing hinders cooperation among internal and external networks. Existing equivalence-based models can protect privacy and represent external characteristics. However, these models can be used only for a single-period economic dispatch, ignoring the hidden flexibility of the external network, especially the ramping flexibility. This paper proposes a multiperiod economic dispatch model considering the hidden flexibility. The hidden flexibility subjected to the operational constraints of the external network is represented by the proposed equivalent flexibility model. In this model, the operational constraints, including power balance equations, transmission capacity limits, and generation capacity limits, are equivalent to the feasible regions of tie lines based on multiparametric programming. To further capture the hidden ramping flexibility, equivalent ramping constraints are proposed, which are formulated as piecewise functions with respect to the tie line power. Based on the equivalent flexibility model, the multiperiod economic dispatch model of the interconnected power networks is constructed, which is a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) problem. A heuristic method is proposed to reduce the computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by test systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic dispatch 3aenergy 3amodels 0aFlexibility 0aInterconnected power network 0aMultiparametric programming1 aYang, Zhifang1 aYu, Juan1 aCui, Wei1 aLi, Wenyuan1 aLi, Jinghua1 aLiu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2676-91710 tEnergy.g2021 May 15, v. 223 p.120054-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1200543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006700165300001800232520176200250592002802012650001202040650001502052650001102067650001102078650001502089650003002104651001402134700002602148700002602174700002402200700002502224700002202249700002402271773009602295856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60091555820221119025404.0150111e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2096-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJullien, Swen10aOcean feedback to tropical cyclones: climatology and processes  ap. 2831-2854.  aThis study presents the first multidecadal and coupled regional simulation of cyclonic activity in the South Pacific. The long-term integration of state-of the art models provides reliable statistics, missing in usual event studies, of air–sea coupling processes controlling tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. The coupling effect is analyzed through comparison of the coupled model with a companion forced experiment. Cyclogenesis patterns in the coupled model are closer to observations with reduced cyclogenesis in the Coral Sea. This provides novel evidence of air–sea coupling impacting not only intensity but also spatial cyclogenesis distribution. Storm-induced cooling and consequent negative feedback is stronger for regions of shallow mixed layers and thin or absent barrier layers as in the Coral Sea. The statistical effect of oceanic mesoscale eddies on TC intensity (crossing over them 20 % of the time) is also evidenced. Anticyclonic eddies provide an insulating effect against storm-induced upwelling and mixing and appear to reduce sea surface temperature (SST) cooling. Cyclonic eddies on the contrary tend to promote strong cooling, particularly through storm-induced upwelling. Air–sea coupling is shown to have a significant role on the intensification process but the sensitivity of TCs to SST cooling is nonlinear and generally lower than predicted by thermodynamic theories: about 15 rather than over 30 hPa °C⁻¹and only for strong cooling. The reason is that the cooling effect is not instantaneous but accumulated over time within the TC inner-core. These results thus contradict the classical evaporation-wind feedback process as being essential to intensification and rather emphasize the role of macro-scale dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3ahurricanes 3amixing 3amodels 3astatistics 3asurface water temperature 3aCoral Sea1 aMarchesiello, Patrick1 aMenkes, Christophe E.1 aLefèvre, Jérôme,1 aJourdain, Nicolas C.1 aSamson, Guillaume1 aLengaigne, Matthieu0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Nov., v. 43, no. 9-10 p.2831-2854dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2096-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011600210500001900326520112300345592002801468650001401496650002001510650001101530650002501541650001301566653002801579653002401607653001601631653002901647653002201676653001301698653004201711700005601753700001401809773009201823856008601915852000902001655001202010IND60736781220221118013952.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorjonen, Kimmo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9930-057X10aDiminishing returns as a function of the association between within-individual average performance and variance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt has been demonstrated that the worst performance rule (WPR) effect can occur as a result of statistical dependencies in the data. Here, we examine whether this might also be the case for Spearman's law of diminishing returns (SLODR). Two proposed SLODR criteria are the skewness of the estimated latent ability factor and the correlation between this latent ability and within-individual residual variance. Using four publicly available datasets, covering quite different dimensions of behavior, we show that both these criteria are affected by the correlation between within-individual average performance and variance on the test scores. However, the influence of this correlation on the two criteria goes in opposite directions, which suggests that it generally might be difficult to get results that unambiguously support SLODR. These results might have far-reaching implications for the literature, to the extent that various research findings attributed to human cognitive functioning might in fact be due to trivial statistical dependencies in data. This is an important issue to address for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3adata collection 3ahumans 3astatistical analysis 3avariance 0aAbility differentiation 0aAverage performance 0aCorrelation 0aStatistical dependencies 0aResidual variance 0aSkewness 0aSpearman's law of diminishing returns1 aMadison, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5366-11691 aMelin, Bo0 tHeliyon.g2021 May, v. 7, no. 5 p.e06989-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165300001800258500000900276520166200285592002801947650001801975650002401993650001202017650001002029650001402039650001302053650001302066650001302079650001502092650001002107700001702117773012402134856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60665255020221122063318.0191228e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525502DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.3951416x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, P.F.10aKentucky Bluegrass Seed and Vegetative Responses to Residue Management and Fall Nitrogen  ap. 1416-1423.  aepub  aOpen-field burning to remove post-harvest residue from Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) seed fields was essentially eliminated in Washington in 1998, and may be banned in Idaho and Oregon because of health concerns. Regulations banning burning necessitated exploring non-thermal residue management. Seed and vegetative responses of six Kentucky bluegrass cultivars to three post-harvest residue removal methods, and three timings of fall applied N in second- and third-year seed crops were evaluated. Residue removal methods were burn, vacuum, and rake. Split fall timings of N applications were 70% September, 30% October; 30% September, 70% October; and 100% October. Post-harvest residue management did not significantly influence second-year seed crop yields; however, with mechanical residue removal, third-year seed crop yields of `Glade', `Huntsville', and `South Dakota' were 42 to 62% of seed yields with open-field burning. Seed yield of `Baron', `Limousine', and `Georgetown' was not affected by residue management in the third-year seed crop. As larger portions of N were October applied, second-year seed yields of Georgetown and Huntsville were higher. Third-year seed crop yields were not influenced by timing of N application. Overall, seed production was correlated with panicle number (r = 0.77**), but not with above ground biomass, rhizome biomass, or weight per 100 seeds. These data suggest that seed yield of relatively short-statured, small-seeded cultivars producing modest amounts of above ground biomass may be sustained by mechanical residue removal through three seed crop years when 70 or 100% the N is applied in October.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3aaboveground biomass 3aburning 3acrops 3acultivars 3anitrogen 3apanicles 3arhizomes 3aseed yield 3aseeds1 aMurray, G.A.0 tCrop science.g1999 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.1416-1423dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1999.3951416x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001300265500001900278520138500297592002801682650002201710650001401732650001401746650002001760650001101780650001001791650003301801650001401834650001801848650001401866650001401880650001101894651001001905651001101915653001901926653001901945700002301964700002301987700002202010773009302032856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60698705620221118053858.0210303e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870562DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.66.483892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAiello, Dalia10aOchraceocephala foeniculi gen. et sp. nov., a new pathogen causing crown rot of fennel in Italy  ap. 1-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new disease of fennel is described from Sicily (southern Italy). Surveys of the disease and sampling were conducted during spring 2017 and 2018 in Adrano and Bronte municipalities (Catania province) where this crop is widely cultivated. Isolations from the margin of symptomatic tissues resulted in fungal colonies with the same morphology. Pathogenicity tests with one isolate of the fungus on 6-month-old plants of fennel reproduced similar symptoms to those observed in nature. Inoculation experiments to assess the susceptibility of six different fennel cultivars to infection by the pathogen showed that the cultivars ‘Narciso’, ‘Apollo’, and ‘Pompeo’ were more susceptible than ‘Aurelio’, ‘Archimede’, and ‘Pegaso’. Phylogenetic analyses based on a matrix of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large subunit (LSU), and the small subunit (SSU) rDNA regions revealed that the isolates represent a new genus and species within the Leptosphaeriaceae, which is here described as Ochraceocephala foeniculi gen. et sp. nov. This study improves the understanding of this new fennel disease, but further studies are needed for planning effective disease management strategies. According to the results of the phylogenetic analyses, Subplenodomus iridicola is transferred to the genus Alloleptosphaeria and Acicuseptoria rumicis to Paraleptosphaeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptosphaeriaceae 3acrown rot 3acultivars 3adisease control 3afennel 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew genus 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aspring 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aFungal disease 0asusceptibility1 aVitale, Alessandro1 aPolizzi, Giancarlo1 aVoglmayr, Hermann0 tMycoKeys.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 66 p.1-22dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.66.483893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011600160300002000276520132200296592002801618650000801646650002501654650001501679650001601694650002401710650001401734650001701748650001301765650001201778650002101790650001901811650001401830700001501844700001801859700001901877700001301896700001701909773012501926856007402051852000902125655001202134IND60640881920221119184807.0190505e20160908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088192DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11646a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xinchuan10aInsight into the inhibition mechanism of kukoamine B against CpG DNA via binding and molecular docking analysis  ap. 85756-85762.  aKukoamine B (KB) was found to inhibit the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by immunostimulatory CpG DNA, thus being considered as a valuable candidate for the development of anti-sepsis drugs. With the goal of elucidating the mechanism of inhibition of CpG DNA by KB, dual polarization interferometry and isothermal titration calorimetry were used to measure the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of KB–CpG DNA interaction, and molecular docking was employed to predict the binding mode. The significant binding of KB to CpG DNA led to a conformational change of the CpG DNA layer on the biosensor chip surface and produced a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of 4.82 × 10⁻⁷ M. The thermodynamic profile elucidated two-site binding, a strong binding of the first site and weaker binding of the second one, which was driven by enthalpy and entropy. Further, docking results suggested that KB formed a close contact with the core sequence of CpG DNA. Taken together with these results, we gained insight into the inhibition mechanism of KB against CpG DNA through direct binding measurement and in silico simulation. KB could bind the primary structure of CpG DNA, thereby interfering with the interaction of CpG DNA with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and the immunestimulatory effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToll-like receptor 9 3abiosensors 3acalorimetry 3acomputer simulation 3acytokines 3adissociation 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterferometry 3atitration1 aWang, Ning1 aYang, Yongjun1 aChen, Yingchun1 aLiu, Xin1 aZheng, Jiang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 08, v. 6, no. 89 p.85756-85762dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11646a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011500168300001600283520132200299592002801621650001801649650002401667650002201691650001901713650001901732650001101751650003301762650001101795650001301806650002501819653003201844653003301876653000801909653003301917700001501950700001601965700001601981700001801997773011302015856008602128852000902214655001202223IND60531652920221122041123.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiao, Wenhua10aLife cycle assessment and economic efficiency analysis of integrated management of wastewater treatment plants  ap. 325-337.  aThis paper evaluates several Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes, an integrated sludge management system, and waste sludge disposal methods in a large city based on life cycle analysis (LCA) and economic efficiency analysis (EEA) together. Among the three WWTP processes considered, the A2O process (S-WWTP) showed the lowest eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP), but the highest acidification potential (AP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). Simple integration of sludge treatment by combining two sludge treatment lines resulted in enhanced anaerobic digestion and production of less sludge. For final sludge disposal, incineration with integrated sludge management showed the highest reduction of life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) in all four categories. The simple integration of sludge management could reduce the sludge handling cost by 6.1%. As a final sludge disposal method, incineration with integration of sludge management was the most economic: reducing operation and management (O&M) cost by 33%. These results demonstrated that application of LCA and EEA would be a useful tool for optimizing an integrated sludge-management system. The proposed integrated sludge-management alternatives could provide a valuable example for managing several WWTPs in a large city.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aanaerobic digestion 3aeconomic analysis 3aeutrophication 3aglobal warming 3ahumans 3alife cycle impact assessment 3asludge 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 0aWastewater treatment plants 0aIntegrated sludge management 0aLCA 0aEconomic efficiency analysis1 aKim, Yejin1 aKim, Hyosoo1 aKim, Minsoo1 aKim, Changwon0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 113 p.325-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245013400209500001900343520142700362592002801789650001201817650002001829650001401849650001501863650001001878650002401888650002301912651001401935653002501949653001101974653002001985653002002005700006002025700005602085700005902141700005802200773009202258856008602350852000902436655001202445IND60736781420221118014034.0210825e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073678142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiswaty, Risma1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1180-420X10aInvestigating the effect of authentic leadership and employees' psychological capital on work engagement: evidence from Indonesia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims at investigating the positive effect of Authentic Leadership on Work Engagement and the mediating role of Psychological Capital (PsyCap). This study employed the Jobs Demands Resource (JD-R) model theory to explain the contribution of Authentic Leadership and PsyCap on Work Engagement. Also, the direct effect of Authentic Leadership on employees' PsyCap was examined. This study randomly selected participants from 1,120 employees in one of the largest public service offices in Indonesia. 192 employees (male = 120 or 62.5%) fully participated in a three-wave data collection. By using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique, this study confirmed that the proposed theoretical model (χ²/df = 2, p < .05, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .07, CFI = .95) showed a better fit than the alternative model (χ²/df = 3, p < .05, RMSEA = .09, SRMR = .09, CFI = .85). The results also confirmed that Authentic Leadership and PsyCap directly predicted Work Engagement. Furthermore, the indirect effect of Authentic Leadership on Work Engagement was positively mediated by employees' PsyCap. Authentic Leadership in Indonesian public organizations may provide a tremendous impact on employees' PsyCap and Work Engagement. This study has provided new insight into the application of the JD-R model in Indonesian public organizations. Discussion, implications, limitations, and future research directions are included.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adata collection 3aequations 3aleadership 3amales 3amathematical theory 3atheoretical models 3aIndonesia 0aAuthentic leadership 0aPsyCap 0aWork engagement 0aHuman resources1 aWirawan, Hillman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0160-31081 aAkib, Haedar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3821-05831 aSaggaf, M.

However, their use on calcareous grasslands has rarely been tested. On the one hand, conservationists fear an unequal use of the pasture with partial abandonment, encroachment or reduced ground light conditions, as well as partial over-grazing with negative effects as soil erosion, latrines, grazing lawns, disturbance to the ground or shrub nesting bird species due to enhanced trampling, or impairing of typical plant species. On the other hand, it is well known that large herbivore grazing is an economical alternative where traditional sheep grazing is no longer profitable. From 2010–2014, we studied horse activity (Koniks), habitat parameters (percent dung, shrub, short vegetation, and bare ground cover), and frequency of orchids and birds using a raster approach within a 90ha year-round pasture. Vegetation composition and structure was sampled on 25m2 plots from 2009 to 2014.All habitat parameters indicated a relatively equal horse utilization of the whole pasture and neither latrines nor partial abandonment were observed. After five years, shrub encroachment on the whole pasture was restricted from 13.7 (±17.0) to 12.0% (±15.3). Vegetation litter was reduced by 60% and the mean number of species typical for dry calcareous grasslands increased by one third on the 25m2 plots. The studied orchid species as well as the target bird species were not impaired by the grazers and plots not occupied by these species showed an equal or even lower grazing frequency. The positive grazing effects such as enhanced site conditions seem to outweigh the potentially negative effects through trampling or grazing. We conclude that in large-scale calcareous grasslands low-intensity year-round grazing with large herbivores is suitable for maintaining and even improving species diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3aadverse effects 3abirds 3abotanical composition 3afeces 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahorse breeds 3ahorses 3alawns and turf 3anesting 3aovergrazing 3apastures 3asheep 3ashrubs 3asoil erosion 3atrampling damage 0aLarge herbivory 0aBreeding bird 0aPlant diversity 0aVegetation structure 0aGrassland management 0aShrub encroachment 0aDung1 aHiller, Georg1 aTischew, Sabine0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Oct. 16, v. 234 p.48-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011800167300001600285500002000301500000900321520160600330592002801936596005401964650002002018650001202038650002302050650001802073650001602091650001202107650001402119650000902133651001902142700003302161700002302194700001902217700001802236700002202254700002502276700001802301700002802319773013102347856008402478852000902562655001202571IND60665255220221122054607.0220805e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525522DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2016.09.07652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKante, Moctar10aCan Tall Guinea‐Race Sorghum Hybrids Deliver Yield Advantage to Smallholder Farmers in West and Central Africa?  ap. 833-842.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aMany farmers in West and Central Africa (WCA) prefer tall (>3 m) grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] for various reasons. This study seeks to determine (i) what yield superiority newly bred, tall, photoperiod‐sensitive guinea‐race sorghum hybrids can provide relative to an adapted landrace variety across a wide range of productivity conditions, and (ii) the risk of these hybrids failing to provide yield superiority for individual farmers. Seven hybrids, one local check, and eight pure‐line progenies were evaluated in 37 farmer‐managed, on‐farm yield trials across three Malian zones and 3 yr. Environments were classified into four productivity groups (low [0.78–1.10 Mg ha⁻¹], mid‐low [1.10–1.50 Mg ha⁻¹], mid‐high [1.50–2.00 Mg ha⁻¹] and high [2.00–2.65 Mg ha⁻¹]) based on their trial mean grain yield. Mean yields of the seven tall hybrids were 3 to 17% (ranging from 0.06 to 0.28 Mg ha⁻¹) higher than that of the local check across all environments and were highest (14–47%) averaged across the seven trials with the lowest mean yields. The individual overall highest‐yielding hybrid showed superiorities over the local check in the low, mid‐low, mid‐high, and high productivity levels of 0.43 (47%), 0.14 (10%), 0.47 (27%), and 0.34 (14%) Mg ha⁻¹, respectively. The tall hybrids rarely had yields significantly inferior to the local check. Farmers’ preference for, and the possible benefits of, taller plant types may lead farmers to grow tall hybrids, particularly under the typical low‐productivity production conditions of WCA.  aPublisher supplied data  aSCB11013cCalifornia Dep. of Food and Agriculture 3aSorghum bicolor 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3alandraces 3arisk 3aCentral Africa1 aRattunde, Henry Frederick W.1 aLeiser, Willmar L.1 aNebié, Baloua1 aDiallo, Bocar1 aDiallo, Abdoulaye1 aTouré, Abocar Oumar1 aWeltzien, Eva1 aHaussmann, Bettina I.G.0 tCrop science.g2017 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.833-842dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.09.07653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001300187245007100200300002000271506007600291520156800367592002801935506003701963650001502000650001102015650002202026650003402048700001802082700002102100700001802121700001902139700002302158773012902181856008202310852000902392655001202401IND60566930720221207084623.0170415e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056693072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b049112doi7 aPMC57474892pmcid7 a292961352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Hai10aComplex Chiral Induction Processes at the Solution/Solid Interface  ap. 17444-17453.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo-dimensional supramolecular chirality is often achieved by confining molecules against a solid surface. The sergeants–soldiers principle is a popular strategy to fabricate chiral surfaces using predominantly achiral molecules. In this method, achiral molecules (the soldiers) are forced to assemble in a chiral fashion by mixing them with a small percentage of structurally similar chiral molecules (the sergeants). The full complexity of the amplification processes in chiral induction studies is rarely revealed due to the specific experimental conditions used. Here we report the evolution of chirality in mixed supramolecular networks of chiral and achiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (DBA) derivatives using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the solution/solid interface. The experiments were carried out in the high sergeants–soldiers mole ratio regime in relatively concentrated solutions. Variation in the sergeants/soldiers composition at a constant solution concentration revealed different mole ratio regimes where either amplification of supramolecular handedness as defined by the sergeant chirality or its reversal was observed. The chiral induction/reversal processes were found to be a convolution of different phenomena occurring at the solution-solid interface namely, structural polymorphism, competitive adsorption and adaptive host–guest recognition. Grasping the full complexity of chiral amplification processes as described here is a stepping-stone toward developing a predictive understanding of chiral amplification processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3amixing 3aoptical isomerism 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aDestoop, Iris1 aTahara, Kazukuni1 aTobe, Yoshito1 aMali, Kunal S.1 aFeyter, Steven De,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 120, no. 31 p.17444-17453dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b049113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245012000207300001200327506007600339520196300415592002802378596006302406506003702469650002102506650002502527650003502552650002002587650001602607650002302623650001302646650001802659650000902677650001302686650002402699650005202723650001402775650002402789650001302813650001302826700001602839700001802855700001902873700002102892700001902913700001602932700001802948773013102966856008203097852000903179655001203188IND60580134620221207143038.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013462DNAL7 a288882262pmid7 aPMC55915082pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1963-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Hwa Chul10aModulation of hippocampal neuronal activity by So-ochim-tang-gamibang in mice subjected to chronic restraint stress  ap. 456.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: So-ochim-tang-gamibang (SOCG) is a decoction formula which has been used to improve mental activity in traditional Korean medicine. The present study was performed to evaluate whether the treatment of SOCG was involved in activating hippocampal neurons in mice which were subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS). METHODS: Mice were subjected to CRS for 2 weeks to induce depressive-like behaviors. SOCG was orally administered for the same period. mRNA expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by RT-PCR. Levels of serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR in the hippocampus were determined by western blotting and by immunofluorescence staining in coronal brain sections. Cultured neurons were prepared from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mice to examine the effects of CRS and SOCG treatment on neurite outgrowth. Depressive-like behaviors of experimental animals were measured by open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST). RESULTS: mRNA levels of serotonin 1A and 1B receptors (5-HT1AR and 5-HT1BR) were decreased in the hippocampus of CRS animals and increased by SOCG treatment. Signals of 5-HT1AR protein in CA3 pyramidal cells were decreased by CRS but elevated back to levels in control animals after SOCG treatment. Phospho-Erk1/2 protein in CA3 cells showed similar pattern of changes as in 5-HT1AR, suggesting coordinated regulation after SOCG treatment in CRS animals. Axonal growth-associated protein GAP-43 levels were also decreased by CRS and then increased by SOCG treatment. In vivo administration of SOCG improved neurite outgrowth of primary DRG neurons from CRS animals and also increased 5-HT1AR protein signals. Behavioral tests of open field and forced swimming showed that immobility time periods were significantly decreased by SOCG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SOCG treatment may increase synaptic responsiveness to serotonergic neuronal inputs by upregulating 5-HT1AR in the hippocampal neurons.  aPublisher supplied data  aHI13C0493cMinistry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3ahippocampus 3alaboratory animals 3amedicine 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneurites 3aoral administration 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotonin 3aserotonin receptors 3astaining 3aswimming1 aLee, Jae Ho1 aKim, Ki-jung,1 aShin, Hyun Jin1 aChoi, Jeong June1 aLee, Chan Yong1 aNamgung, Uk1 aJung, In Chul0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.456-456dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1963-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245013300158300001600291520181900307592002802126650002402154650001402178650001702192650002002209650001902229650001802248650001602266650001602282650000902298650001302307650001402320650000902334650001502343650001802358650001402376650001402390653002502404653001802429653003602447653001902483653001502502700001502517700001702532700001802549773012602567856007602693852000902769655001202778IND60749127920221121211440.0210831e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912792DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2020.02282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuntillo, M.10aNarrowing down the number of potential plant-based probiotic candidates by successive in vitro, technological and in vivo assays  ap. 351-364.  aThe interest on plant-based fermented food is in raise in Western countries. The aim of this study was to select interleukin (IL)-10 inducing strains for the development of potential probiotic plant-based fermented foods. Departing from a collection of 52 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains derived from plant material, in vitro co-culture with murine macrophages allowed us to narrow down the number of candidates to 21 strains able to induce IL-10 secretion. 14 of these strains were able to promote the production of tumour necrosis factor-α too. The capacity to induce IL-6 was used to further reduce the number of strains to 4, from which Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum LpAv was selected to ferment oat and carrots. L. plantarum LpAv was able to ferment oat and carrots until reaching counts of ca. 10⁸ and 10⁹ cfu/ml. Fermented oat and carrots were orally administered to mice for 10 consecutive days and challenged with a single infective dose of Salmonella enterica serovar. Typhimurium. Counts of L. plantarum LpAv in fermented carrots were 9.23±0.05 cfu/ml and 9.27±0.01 cfu/ml, at day 1 and 10 of the feeding period. Fermented carrots were able to confer enhanced protection (80% of survival) against infection, when compared to control mice (less than 25% of survival). However, L. plantarum LpAv administered as pure culture was not able to confer protection against Salmonella infection. L. plantarum LpAv was selected among 52 plant-derived LAB and it was able to ferment oat and carrots, being only fermented carrots able to confer enhanced protection against Salmonella infection. A succession of in vitro to in vivo tests is proposed as a tool to narrow down the number of candidates when searching for potential novel probiotics from a collection of autochthonous strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3acoculture 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3alactic acid 3amacrophages 3amice 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aoats 3aprobiotics 3asalmonellosis 3asecretion 3aserotypes 0alactic acid bacteria 0aLactobacillus 0aLactiplantibacillus plant-based 0afermented food 0aSalmonella1 aSpotti, J.1 aSalminen, S.1 aVinderola, G.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 12, no. 4 p.351-364dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2020.02283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174520137200295592002801667650002101695650001401716650001701730653002101747653001601768653001901784653000901803653002901812653002501841700002101866700005701887773011301944856008602057852000902143655001202152IND60740531220221120123909.0210904e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalzolari, Tommaso14aThe adoption of circular economy practices in supply chains – An assessment of European Multi-National Enterprises  aThe European Commission Circular Economy Action Plan aims at fostering a society based on sustainable production and consumption. Within this context, industrial organisations are called to implement a wide set of practices to drive this transition: manufacturing easy-to-repair and sustainable products, adopting solutions aimed at extending product lifetime, and promoting remanufacturing and materials’ recycling. A major contribution is expected from Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs), as these organisations dominate the European economy and coordinate resource-intensive global supply networks.As such, this study assesses the Circular Economy-inspired initiatives promoted by the largest European MNEs. The content of sustainability reports is scrutinised, through a template analysis technique, in order to create a database of Circular Economy practices. Key findings include the degree of implementation, the level of involvement of supply chain partners, and the drivers behind the implementation of such practices. Furthermore, a conceptual framework is proposed, in order to describe the adoption of Circular Economy practices as a supply chain process. A theoretical discussion explores the role of institutional pressures and supply chain integration to shape the transition towards the adoption of Circular Economy practices in global supply chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3adatabases 3asupply chain 0aCircular economy 0aFortune 500 0aSustainability 0aMNEs 0aSupply chain integration 0aInstitutional theory1 aGenovese, Andrea1 aBrint, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8863-407X0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127616-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245019100169300002000360520214100380592002802521650003402549650001502583650004402598650002102642650002202663650001402685650002102699650002702720650002602747650001002773650001702783650002802800650002102828650002402849650001402873650001302887650001802900650001902918650000702937650001302944650002702957650003302984650002103017650003703038650001903075700002403094700003103118700002903149773012403178856007403302852000903376655001203385IND60640882220221119184802.0190505e20160707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11658b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavithaa, Krishnamoorthy10aInduction of intrinsic apoptotic pathway and cell cycle arrest via baicalein loaded iron oxide nanoparticles as a competent nano-mediated system for triple negative breast cancer therapy  ap. 64531-64543.  aMagnetic nanoparticles have shown an increasing number of applications in the field of molecular medicine. In the present study we investigated the controlled synthesis of biocompatible polymer coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe₂O₃) loaded with baicalein and evaluated these for their drug loading and release behaviour. Moreover, the loaded particles were evaluated for their anti-proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis activation properties in triple negative breast cancer cells. The structure, morphology and magnetic properties of the prepared materials were studied by using scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic light scattering analysis and zeta potential analysis. DLS and TEM analysis confirms that the size of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles are about 90–100 nm and that they are extremely crystalline and spherical in nature. FTIR analysis confirms that the baicalein molecules were conjugated with PEG-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the magnetic nanoparticles were highly pure with a spinel structure. Baicalein loaded nanoparticles show a controlled release profile in response to various pH levels. We found significant cell cycle arrest at various phases in the treated group and subsequent apoptotic cell death to be evidenced by AO/EtBr, DAPI and PI of fluorescence microscopy analysis. The TUNEL assay evidences that DNA damage occurs in the treated cells. Further baicalein loaded iron oxide nanoparticles exhibit significant down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins evidenced by Western blotting. Our findings clearly demonstrate that baicalein loaded iron oxide nanoparticles could efficiently deliver the drug of interest, and initiate and execute the apoptotic process in triple negative breast cancer cells. This could open a new window in polymer surface chemistry to develop metal oxide based drug delivery systems for all kinds of cancer therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aDNA damage 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aWestern blotting 3aX-ray diffraction 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle checkpoints 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aferric oxide 3afluorescence microscopy 3alight scattering 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3apolymers 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aPaulpandi, Manickam1 aPadma, Palghat Raghunathan1 aSumathi, Sundaravadivelu0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 07, v. 6, no. 69 p.64531-64543dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11658b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011400156520164400270592002801914650001101942650001001953650001801963650002001981650001102001650002202012650001302034650002002047650001302067650001902080650002702099650002002126650000902146650001402155650001502169700001802184700001502202700001802217700002002235700001902255700002002274700001902294773012902313856007502442852000902517655001202526IND60791090420221119072042.0220826e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079109042DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141639892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie 10aRemote Sensing Monitoring of Rice Grain Protein Content Based on a Multidimensional Euclidean Distance Method  aGrain protein content (GPC) is an important indicator of nutritional quality of rice. In this study, nitrogen fertilization experiments were conducted to monitor GPC for high-quality Indica rice varieties Meixiangzhan 2 (V1) and Wufengyou 615 (V2) in 2019 and 2020. Three types of parameters, including photosynthetic sensitive vegetation indices (VIs), canopy leaf area index (LAI), and crop plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), obtained from UAV hyperspectral images were used to estimate rice GPC. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional GPC indices were constructed by combining any two of the three types of parameters and all three, respectively, based on the Euclidean distance method. The R² and RMSE of the two-dimensional GPC index model for variety V1 at the tillering stage were 0.81 and 0.40% for modeling and 0.95 and 0.38% for validation, and 0.91 and 0.27% for modeling and 0.83 and 0.36% for validation for variety V2. The three-dimensional GPC index model for variety V1 had R² and RMSE of 0.86 and 0.34% for modeling and 0.78 and 0.45% for validation, and 0.97 and 0.17% for modeling and 0.96 and 0.17% for validation for variety V2 at the panicle initiation stage. At the heading stage, the R² and RMSE of the three-dimensional model for variety V1 were 0.92 and 0.26% for modeling and 0.91 and 0.37% for validation, and 0.96 and 0.20% for modeling and 0.99 and 0.15% for validation for variety V2. These results demonstrate that the GPC monitoring models incorporating multiple crop growth parameters based on Euclidean distance can improve GPC estimation accuracy and have the potential for field-scale GPC monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acrops 3agrain protein 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amultiple cropping 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3apanicles 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant nitrogen content 3aprotein content 3arice 3atillering 3avegetation1 aSong, Xiaoyu 1 aJing, Xia 1 aYang, Guijun 1 aYang, Chenghai 1 aFeng, Haikuan 1 aWang, Jiaojiao 1 aMing, Shikang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245010800218520103700326592002801363650002201391650001101413650002401424653002101448653002601469653002201495653002101517653001701538653002401555700002801579700002401607773011301631856008601744852000901830655001201839IND60740531420221120123827.0210715e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFescioglu-Unver, Nilgun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5332-867010aFeedback controlled resource management model for express service in electric vehicle charging stations  aThe number of electric vehicles on the roads is increasing globally. However, the charging duration of electric vehicles is long, and the number and capacity of fast charging public stations are limited. This may lead to congested electric vehicle charging stations and long waiting times in queues. Priority based express service can reduce the waiting times of the high priority class. This study develops a feedback controlled express station management model (FC-EXP) for priority service in electric vehicle charging stations. FC-EXP manages the charging station's resources dynamically in real time such that the ratio of high and normal priority vehicles' delay times follow a relative delay target. Stations can announce different relative delay targets depending on their pricing policies. FC-EXP provides a self-controlling resource management capability to express charging stations. Results show that FC-EXP successfully tracks the relative delay target under different conditions, both in steady state and in real time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric vehicles 3amodels 3aresource management 0aElectric vehicle 0aFast charging station 0aPriority charging 0aFeedback control 0aSelf-control 0aResource management1 aYıldız Aktaş, Melike1 aKasnakoğlu, Coşku0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127629-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245009400212300001600306520169700322592002802019650004102047650002802088650003002116650002002146650003102166650001602197650001502213650001602228650001102244650001302255650002302268653002502291653002402316653003602340653001302376700006402389700007202453773011302525856008602638852000902724655001202733IND60531653220221121223351.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGázquez, Jose A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2605-769210aIntelligent low cost telecontrol system for agricultural vehicles in harmful environments  ap. 204-215.  aThe use of vehicles to control pests and crop diseases is needed to maintain agricultural production. This paper describes how to design and implement a low cost intelligent telecontrol system applied for agricultural machinery that are designed for use in places where human presence is not adequate, such as pesticide spraying tasks in farming environments as greenhouses. The intelligent system designed basically consists of these parts: States Encoding, Console Automaton, Vehicle Automaton, Communication System and Security of Communications. This system has been developed with a special-purpose UHF narrow band modem that interchanges digital operative commands/states from the console to the vehicle. The intelligent telecontrol system acts as a security system to protect against outsiders, and loss of communications due to fading or others interference. The originality of this system is based on the fact that it is 10 times cheaper than autonomous systems; those systems need electronic systems, GPS, a complex sensorial system, and a beforehand mapping performed on the new work environment. Related to classic remote control, our system protects from potential oversights of the operator. In addition, in the proposed system, the vehicle state is shown in the console, due the bidirectional communications. The system was successfully applied in prototype vehicle used for spraying tasks, and the result shows that the system operated stably and has confirmed the effectiveness of this intelligent telecontrol system.

Dubey10aEndocrine regulation of testosterone production by Leydig cells in the catfish, Clarias batrachus: Probable mediators of growth hormone  ap. 158-165.  aGrowth hormone (GH), in the recent past, has been recognized as a potent steroid stimulating hormone independent of gonadotropin (GtH). However, the mode and mechanism of its steroidogenic action in the testis is not yet elucidated, particularly in fish. The present study was designed to understand the mode and mechanism of steroidogenic action of growth hormone in testis of the catfish, Clarias batrachus through in vivo and in vitro Leydig cell culture studies using the signaling molecule inhibitors. Exogenous administration of GtH, GH and insulin to the male catfish increased testicular and circulating testosterone level. In vitro treatment of Leydig cells with these hormones also increased testosterone production. The steroidogenic action of GH appeared to be indirect and mediated through Leydig cell produced insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), as the treatments with actinomycin D, cycloheximide and anti-IGF-I abolished the GH-induced testosterone production by Leydig cells. The GH-induced stimulation in IGF-I production by the isolated Leydig cells further substantiates this notion. GH appears to employ cAMP/PKA and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways to induce IGF-I production, as the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (SQ 22,536), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocker (H-89) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (lavendustin A) abolished the GH-induced IGF-I production and in turn testosterone by the Leydig cells. This study suggests that GH exerts independent androgenic effect in the catfish testis indirectly through augmenting the Leydig cell production of IGF-I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias batrachus 3aLeydig cells 3aactinomycin D 3aadenylate cyclase 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acatfish 3acell culture 3acyclic AMP 3acycloheximide 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amales 3asignal transduction 3asomatotropin 3atestosterone 3atyrosine 0aGH 0aIGF-I 0aGtH 0aLeydig cells 0aTestosterone production1 aKumar, Pankaj1 aLal, Bechan0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Mar., v. 154 p.158-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013500168300001600303520189000319592002802209650002002237650002402257650001602281650001602297650000902313650002502322650001302347650000702360650001102367650002402378650001602402650002302418650001602441650001902457653002902476653001802505653001602523653001602539653001302555653001902568700001502587700002702602700001902629700001802648700001802666773011302684856008602797852000902883655001202892IND60531653320221121223447.0180831e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053165332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Lai Yee10aEffective removal of Acid Blue 113 dye using overripe Cucumis sativus peel as an eco-friendly biosorbent from agricultural residue  ap. 194-203.  aThe release of hazardous synthetic dyes into industrial effluents has emerged as an environmental problem requiring remediation. This research focused on the development of a new and environmentally-friendly process for the remediation of aqueous media containing dye. A natural biosorbent prepared from overripe Cucumis sativus peel which is a readily available local agricultural waste, was utilised for the first time to remove Acid Blue 113 dye. The biosorption performance of the biosorbent was evaluated by varying operating parameters such as initial dye concentration, pH, dosage, contact time and temperature. Fourier transformed infrared analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl, phenol, alcohol, carboxyl and alkyl halide groups in the biosorbent which interacted with the dye. It was determined that an improvement in biosorption capacity was observed when initial dye concentration and temperature were increased. The fit of experimental data to biosorption isotherm and kinetic models was evaluated by non-linear regression of coefficients using hybrid fractional function, root mean square error and coefficient of determination. The Langmuir model best described the equilibrium isotherm data, exhibiting maximum biosorption capacity of 59.81 mg/g. Kinetic study indicated the initial dye removal was rapid with equilibrium established within 20 min. The kinetic data were better fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model than to the pseudo-first-order and Elovich kinetic models. It was also found that intraparticle diffusion played a prominent role in the rate-controlling step. The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the biosorption was endothermic, spontaneous and feasible. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the waste biosorbent could be employed as an effective and eco-friendly alternative for the cleanup of dye-polluted aqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aagricultural wastes 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3adyes 3aindustrial effluents 3akinetics 3apH 3aphenol 3aregression analysis 3aremediation 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aOverripe Cucumis sativus 0aAcid Blue 113 0aBiosorption 0aEquilibrium 0aKinetics 0aThermodynamics1 aGan, Suyin1 aYin Tan, Michelle Siaw1 aLim, Siew Shee1 aLee, Xin Jiat1 aLam, Yun Fung0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 113 p.194-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245011100213520188900324592002802213650001202241650001802253650002202271650002002293650002302313650001902336650001702355650001202372653002002384653002202404653003602426653002002462653002502482653002902507700002102536700002102557773011302578856008602691852000902777655001202786IND60740531720221120123921.0210904e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074053172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostantino, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4298-432X10aIdentification of energy-efficient solutions for broiler house envelopes through a primary energy approach  aOne of the main concerns regarding intensive broiler production is the high use of energy for climate control. An improved design of broiler house envelopes could decrease this energy consumption. Current evaluation methods only consider the delivered energy, which is misleading because it does not consider the entire energy supply chain. By contrast, primary energy encompasses all forms of direct energy, e.g. thermal and electrical, that are supplied to the broiler house, including the energy losses along the energy supply chain. In this work, delivered energy and primary energy approaches are adopted to identify the most energy-efficient solution for envelopes in typical European broiler houses. This work evaluates 18 scenarios characterized by three different envelope types and six different outdoor weather conditions. Financial aspects are evaluated through global cost analysis. The results of this study show that a high-insulated envelope is suitable in the considered outdoor weather conditions, but it is not sustainable from a financial point of view. By contrast, a medium insulated envelope shows a favourable energy performance and its global cost is similar to that of a non-insulated envelope. A comparison of the results reveals that the delivered energy approach considerably underestimates the broiler house energy consumption compared to the primary energy approach. These results strongly suggest that a primary energy approach is well-suited for the assessment of the energy performance of broiler houses and livestock houses. This is because it accounts for the total direct energy supplied to the broiler house considering the specificity of the energy mix of the analysed country and the considered energy carrier. The proposed approach lays the groundwork for future research regarding the assessment of the energy performance of livestock houses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acost analysis 3aenergy efficiency 3apoultry housing 3apoultry production 3aprimary energy 3asupply chain 3aweather 0aEnergy analysis 0aEnergy benchmarks 0aDynamic energy simulation model 0aPoultry farming 0aGlobal cost analysis 0aLivestock sustainability1 aCalvet, Salvador1 aFabrizio, Enrico0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 312 p.127639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1276393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245006100161300001300222500001400235520079200249536019201041592002801233650001401261650001301275650001501288650001501303650001001318650001301328650001601341650003301357650001401390650002001404650001601424651001001440653001801450653001201468653001801480653001601498653001301514700001601527700002101543773009201564856008201656852000901738655001201747IND60698706320221118053746.0210303e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870632DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.67.494832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qin10aThree new Diaporthe species from Shaanxi Province, China  ap. 1-18.  aNAL-light  aDiaporthe species (Sordariomycetes, Diaporthales) are often reported as important plant pathogens, saprobes and endophytes on a wide range of plant hosts.

Planting depth is another aspect to be considered when establishing rhizomes in soils with low moisture retention. Shallow planting can increase sprouting and emergence; but if rhizomes are placed too shallow they may dry out without irrigation. The overall objective was to evaluate the effect of rhizome planting rate and depth on establishment success. Treatments were the factorial combinations of three planting rates (Low–2.6 m³ ha–¹, Medium–5.2 m³ ha–¹, and High–10.4 m³ ha–¹) and two planting depths (6 and 12 cm). High planting rate increased Tifton 85 frequency, ground cover, and herbage dry matter (DM), independent of planting depth. In both years, the High rate resulted in 100% grass frequency and ground cover before 120 d after planting. Also, this treatment produced more than 2300 kg DM ha–¹ in the establishment year, and this was greater than the Medium and Low rates (1230 and 900 kg ha–¹, respectively) when planted at 6 cm, or than the Low rate planted at 12 cm (1430 kg ha–¹). When using Low or Medium rates, planting at a 12-cm depth, improved overall performance compared with 6 cm. Medium rhizome planting rate of ∼5 m³ ha–¹ at a 12-cm depth provided satisfactory ground cover and herbage DM at lower cost than High and thus is recommended for the sandy soils in the Suwanee River basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3acultivars 3aforage 3agrasses 3airrigation 3aplanting depth 3arhizomes 3asandy soils 3asprouting 3astolons 3awatersheds1 aNewman, Yoana1 aSollenberger, Lynn E.1 aFraisse, Clyde1 aObreza, Thomas0 tCrop science.g2015 May, v. 55, no. 3 p.1338-1345dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.09.06053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008800164300001800252520101400270592002801284650002501312650002601337650002001363650002001383650002101403650001801424650002101442650002401463700001701487700002001504700001701524700001801541773010801559856008401667852000901751655001201760IND60580137520221118180707.0170911e20170911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.7b004432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzer, Imran10aEffect of Molecular Architecture on Cell Interactions and Stealth Properties of PEG  ap. 2699-2710.  aPEGylation, covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic biomolecules, in which suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles limiting their therapeutic utility are of concern, is a widely applied technology. However, this technology has been challenged by reduced bioactivity of biomolecules upon PEGylation and immunogenicity of PEG triggering immune response and abrogating clinical efficacy, which collectively necessitate development of stealth polymer alternatives. Here we demonstrate that comb-shape poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA), a stealth polymer alternative, has a more compact structure than PEG and self-organize into nanoparticles in a molecular weight dependent manner. Most notably, we show that comb-shape POEGMA promotes significantly higher cellular uptake and exhibits less steric hindrance imposed on the conjugated biomolecule than PEG. Collectively, comb-shape POEGMA offers a versatile alternative to PEG for stealth polymer–biomolecule conjugation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiochemical compounds 3aethylene glycol 3aimmune response 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol1 aTomak, Aysel1 aZareie, Hadi M.1 aBaran, Yusuf1 aBulmus, Volga0 tBiomacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 11, v. 18, no. 9 p.2699-2710dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biomac.7b004433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008200163300002000245520079400265592002801059650001601087650001301103650001201116650001101128650001101139650001101150650001301161650003001174650001101204650000901215700001901224700002401243700002301267773012401290856007401414852000901488655001201497IND60640882620221119184444.0190505e20160810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064088262DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11672h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatina, Madhu Babu10aAdvances in C-alkynylation of sugars and its application in organic synthesis  ap. 75960-75972.  aC-Glycosidation plays a significant role in the synthesis of optically active scaffolds. Among C-glycosylations, C-alkynylation has emerged as a synthetic tool in organic or natural product synthesis since it make use of carbohydrates as chiral pool and source of carbon as well. In this present review several modes of C-alkynyl-glycosylations have been summarized based on different glycosyl donors such as glycals, anomeric acetates, anomeric halosugars, 1,2-anhydrosugars, 1,6-anhydrosugars, lactones, lactols and activated/unactivated terminal alkynes as a glycan partner under various Lewis acids like TiCl₄, I₂, BF₃·OEt₂, Cu(OTf)₂, TMSOTf and/or metals like In, Zn.

The paper studies the improvement that different nanogold probes prepared at different antibody:gold nanoparticle (IgG:AuNP) ratios and AuNP sizes produce on the maximum signal and detectability of a simple SPR immunosensor developed to analyze fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotic residues (SPReeta system). The investigation compares the features of sensor enhanced formats using both, secondary and primary nanogold probes (anti-IgG and IgG coupled to AuNP, on double and single-antibody immunochemical assay steps, respectively), in respect to the unenhanced format. For this purpose, a reproducible bioconjugation procedure for preparing gold biohybrid nanoparticles has been established, involving the formation of a mixed self-assembled monolayer (m-SAM) with PEGylated cross-linkers around the AuNP followed by the covalent attachment of the antibodies. The procedure allows controlling the IgG:AuNP ratio of the nanogold probes on a reproducible manner and the functionalized NPs have been found to be stable during assay and storage. Both formats, using secondary and primary nanogold probes, are excellent strategies to improve immunosensor detectability. Thus, using anti-IgG-AuNP, the detectability could be improved by a factor of 14 (LOD 0.07±0.01μgL⁻¹vs. 0.98±0.38μgL⁻¹) reducing at the same time the amount of primary antibody used (30,000 vs. 1000 dilution factor). Likewise, the format using IgG-AuNP also allows improving detectability (LOD 0.11±0.01μgL⁻¹), but reducing the number of needed steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibodies 3afluoroquinolones 3agold 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aSánchez-Baeza, Francisco1 aMarco, M.-Pilar0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 34, no. 1 p.151-158dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001400273500001400287520097200301592002801273650001601301650001001317650001601327650002501343650001001368650003101378650001401409651001001423653001201433653001501445653001301460653001301473700001701486700001601503773009301519856008201612852000901694655001201703IND60698706520221118053749.0210303e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870652DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.67.510202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haiying,10aNew species of Retiboletus (Boletales, Boletaceae) from China based on morphological and molecular data  ap. 33-44.  aNAL-light  aSpecies of the genus Retiboletus in China were investigated based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nrLSU) and the translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1-α).

The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) urban agglomeration has experienced rapid urbanization during the past decades with profound impacts on vegetation, so there is an urgent need to evaluate vegetation dynamics across land use/cover change (LUCC). Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during 2001–2020, we used coefficient of variation, Theil–Sen median trend analysis, and Hurst exponent to analyze the spatiotemporal change and future consistency of vegetation growth among the main LUCC in the GBA. Results demonstrated that low NDVI values with high fluctuations were mainly distributed in the central urban areas, whereas high NDVI values with low fluctuations were primarily located in the peripheral hilly mountains. The area-averaged NDVI showed an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0.0030 year⁻¹, and areas with vegetation improvement (82.99%) were more than four times those with vegetation degradation (17.01%). The persistent forest and grassland and the regions converted from built-up to vegetation displayed the most obvious greening; NDVI in over 90% of these areas showed an increasing trend. In contrast, vegetation browning occurred in more than 60% of the regions converted from vegetation to built-up. Future vegetation change in most areas (91.37%) will continue the existing trends, and 80.06% of the GBA was predicted to develop in a benign direction, compared to 19.94% in a malignant direction. Our results contribute to in-depth understanding of vegetation dynamics during rapid urbanization in the GBA, which is crucial for vegetation conservation and land-use optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3aland use 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aurbanization1 aZhang, Huamin 1 aXie, Fei 1 aLi, Lanhui 1 aYang, Long 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 16, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
